to the senate of the united states
 i transmit to the senate in answer to a resolution of that body pass on the 17th instant the accompanying report of head of departments which contain all the official information in the possession of the executive ask for by the resolution
 on come into office i find the military commandant of the department of california exercise the function of civil governor in that territory and leave as i be to act under the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo without the aid of any legislative provision establish a government in that territory i think it well not to disturb that arrangement make under my predecessor until congress should take some action on that subject i therefore do not interfere with the power of the military commandant who continue to exercise the function of civil governor as before but i make no such appointment confer no such authority and have allow no increase compensation to the commandant for his service
 with a view to the faithful execution of the treaty so far as lie in the power of the executive and to enable congress to act at the present session with as full knowledge and as little difficulty as possible on all matter of interest in these territories i send the hon thomas butler king as bearer of dispatch to california and certain officer to california and new mexico whose duty be particularly define in the accompany letter of instruction address to they severally by the proper department
 i do not hesitate to express to the people of those territories my desire that each territory should if prepare to comply with the requisition of the constitution of the united states form a plan of a state constitution and submit the same to congress with a prayer for admission into the union as a state but i do not anticipate suggest or authorize the establishment of any such government without the assent of congress nor do i authorize any government agent or officer to interfere with or exercise any influence or control over the election of delegate or over any convention in make or modify their domestic institution or any of the provision of their propose constitution on the contrary the instruction give by my order be that all measure of domestic policy adopt by the people of california must originate solely with themselves that while the executive of the united states be desirous to protect they in the formation of any government republican in its character to be at the proper time submit to congress yet it be to be distinctly understand that the plan of such a government must at the same time be the result of their own deliberate choice and originate with themselves without the interference of the executive
 i be unable to give any information as to law pass by any suppose government in california or of any census take in either of the territories mention in the resolution as i have no information on those subject
 as already state i have not disturb the arrangement which i find have exist under my predecessor
 in advise an early application by the people of these territories for admission as states i be actuate principally by an earnest desire to afford to the wisdom and patriotism of congress the opportunity of avoid occasion of bitter and angry dissension among the people of the united states
 under the constitution every state have the right of establish and from time to time alter its municipal law and domestic institution independently of every other state and of the general government subject only to the prohibition and guaranty expressly set forth in the constitution of the united states the subject thus leave exclusively to the respective states be not design or expect to become topic of national agitation still as under the constitution congress have power to make all needful rule and regulation respect the territories of the united states every new acquisition of territory have lead to discussion on the question whether the system of involuntary servitude which prevail in many of the states should or should not be prohibit in that territory the period of excitement from this cause which have heretofore occur have be safely pass but during the interval of whatever length which may elapse before the admission of the territories cede by mexico as states it appear probable that similar excitement will prevail to an undue extent
 under these circumstance i think and still think that it be my duty to endeavor to put it in the power of congress by the admission of california and new mexico as states to remove all occasion for the unnecessary agitation of the public mind
 it be understand that the people of the western part of california have form a plan of a state constitution and will soon submit the same to the judgment of congress and apply for admission as a state this course on their part though in accordance with be not adopt exclusively in consequence of any expression of my wish inasmuch as measure tend to this end have be promote by the officer send there by my predecessor and be already in active progress of execution before any communication from i reach california if the propose constitution shall when submit to congress be find to be in compliance with the requisition of the constitution of the united states i earnestly recommend that it may receive the sanction of congress
 the part of california not include in the propose state of that name be believe to be uninhabited except in a settlement of our countryman in the vicinity of salt lake
 a claim have be advance by the state of texas to a very large portion of the most populous district of the territory commonly designate by the name of new mexico if the people of new mexico have form a plan of a state government for that territory as cede by the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo and have be admit by congress as a state our constitution would have afford the mean of obtain an adjustment of the question of boundary with texas by a judicial decision at present however no judicial tribunal have the power of decide that question and it remain for congress to devise some mode for its adjustment meanwhile i submit to congress the question whether it would be expedient before such adjustment to establish a territorial government which by include the district so claim would practically decide the question adversely to the state of texas or by exclude it would decide it in her favor in my opinion such a course would not be expedient especially as the people of this territory still enjoy the benefit and protection of their municipal law originally derive from mexico and have a military force station there to protect they against the indians it be undoubtedly true that the property life liberty and religion of the people of new mexico be well protect than they ever be before the treaty of cession
 should congress when california shall present herself for incorporation into the union annex a condition to her admission as a state affect her domestic institution contrary to the wish of her people and even compel she temporarily to comply with it yet the state could change her constitution at any time after admission when to she it should seem expedient any attempt to deny to the people of the state the right of self government in a matter which peculiarly affect themselves will infallibly be regard by they as an invasion of their right and upon the principle lay down in our own declaration of independence they will certainly be sustain by the great mass of the american people to assert that they be a conquered people and must as a state submit to the will of their conqueror in this regard will meet with no cordial response among american freeman great number of they be native citizen of the united states not inferior to the rest of our countryman in intelligence and patriotism and no language of menace to restrain they in the exercise of an undoubted right substantially guarantee to they by the treaty of cession itself shall ever be utter by i or encourage and sustain by person act under my authority it be to be expect that in the residue of the territory cede to we by mexico the people reside there will at the time of their incorporation into the union as a state settle all question of domestic policy to suit themselves
 no material inconvenience will result from the want for a short period of a government establish by congress over that part of the territory which lie eastward of the new state of california and the reason for my opinion that new mexico will at no very distant period ask for admission into the union be round on unofficial information which i suppose be common to all who have care to make inquiry on that subject
 seeing then that the question which now excite such painful sensation in the country will in the end certainly be settle by the silent effect of cause independent of the action of congress i again submit to your wisdom the policy recommend in my annual message of await the salutary operation of those cause believe that we shall thus avoid the creation of geographical party and secure the harmony of feel so necessary to the beneficial action of our political system connect as the union be with the remembrance of past happiness the sense of present blessing and the hope of future peace and prosperity every dictate of wisdom every feeling of duty and every emotion of patriotism tend to inspire fidelity and devotion to it and admonish we cautiously to avoid any unnecessary controversy which can either endanger it or impair its strength the chief element of which be to be find in the regard and affection of the people for each other

to the senate of the united states
 i herewith transmit to the senate for their advice with regard to its ratification a convention between the united states and great britain conclude at washington on the 19th instant by john m. clayton secretary of state on the part of the united states and by the right hon sir henry lytton bulwer on the part of great britain
 this treaty have be negotiate in accordance with the general view express in my message to congress in december last its object be to establish a commercial alliance with all great maritime state for the protection of a contemplated ship canal through the territory of nicaragua to connect the atlantic and pacific ocean and at the same time to insure the same protection to the contemplated railway or canal by the tehuantepec and panama route as well as to every other interoceanic communication which may be adopt to shorten the transit to or from our territory on the pacific
 it will be see that this treaty do not propose to take money from the public treasury to effect any object contemplate by it it yield protection to the capitalist who may undertake to construct any canal or railway across the isthmus commence in the southern part of mexico and terminate in the territory of new granada it give no preference to any one route over another but propose the same measure of protection for all which ingenuity and enterprise can construct should this treaty be ratify it will secure in future the liberation of all central america from any kind of foreign aggression
 at the time negotiation be open with nicaragua for the construction of a canal through her territory i find great britain in possession of nearly half of central america as the ally and protector of the mosquito king it have be my object in negotiate this treaty not only to secure the passage across the isthmus to the government and citizen of the united states by the construction of a great highway dedicate to the use of all nation on equal term but to maintain the independence and sovereignty of all the central american republics the senate will judge how far these object have be effect
 if there be any who would desire to seize and annex any portion of the territory of these weak sister republic to the american union or to extend our dominion over they i do not concur in their policy and i wish it to be understand in reference to that subject that i adopt the view entertain so far as i know by all my predecessor
 the principle by which i have be regulate in the negotiation of this treaty be in accordance with the sentiment well express by my immediate predecessor on the 10th of february 1847 when he communicate to the senate the treaty with new granada for the protection of the railroad at panama it be in accordance with the whole spirit of the resolution of the senate of the 3d of march 1835 refer to by president polk and with the policy adopt by president jackson immediately after the passage of that resolution who dispatch an agent to central america and new granada to open negotiation with those government for the purpose of effectually protect by suitable treaty stipulation with they such individual or company as might undertake to open a communication between the atlantic and pacific ocean by the construction of a ship canal across the isthmus which connect north and south america and of securing forever by such stipulation the free and equal right of navigate such canal to all such nation on the payment of such reasonable toll as might be establish to compensate the capitalist who should engage in such undertaking and complete the work
 i also communicate herewith a copy of the correspondence between the american secretary of state and the british plenipotentiary at the time of conclude the treaty whatever honor may be due to the party first propose such a treaty justly belong to the united states my predecessor in his message of the 10th of february 1847 refer to the treaty with new granada for the protection of the panama railroad observe that--
 should the proposition thus tender be reject we may deprive the united states of the just influence which its acceptance might secure to they and confer the glory and benefit of be the first among the nation in conclude such an arrangement upon the government either of great britain or france that either of these government would embrace the offer can not be doubt because there do not appear to be any other effectual mean of securing to all nation the advantage of this important passage but the guaranty of great commercial power that the isthmus shall be neutral territory the interest of the world at stake be so important that the security of this passage between the two ocean can not be suffer to depend upon the war and revolution which may arise among different nation
 should the senate in its wisdom see fit to confirm this treaty and the treaty heretofore submit by i for their advice in regard to its ratification negotiate with the state of nicaragua on the 3d day of september last it will be necessary to amend one or both of they so that both treaty may stand in conformity with each other in their spirit and intention the senate will discover by examine they both that this be a task of no great difficulty
 i have good reason to believe that france and russia stand ready to accede to this treaty and that no other great maritime state will refuse its accession to an arrangement so well calculate to diffuse the blessing of peace commerce and civilization and so honorable to all nation which may enter into the engagement

to the senate and house of representatives
 i herewith transmit to the two houses of congress a letter from his excellency the governor of texas date on the 14th day of june last address to the late president of the united states which not having be answer by he come to my hand on his death and i also transmit a copy of the answer which i have feel it to be my duty to cause to be make to that communication
 congress will perceive that the governor of texas officially state that by authority of the legislature of that state he dispatch a special commissioner with full power and instruction to extend the civil jurisdiction of the state over the unorganized county of el paso worth presidio and santa fe situate on its northwestern limit
 he proceed to say that the commissioner have report to he in an official form that the military officer employ in the service of the united states station at santa fe interpose adversely with the inhabitant to the fulfillment of his object in favor of the establishment of a separate state government east of the rio grande and within the rightful limit of the state of texas these four county which texas thus propose to establish and organize as be within her own jurisdiction extend over the whole of the territory east of the rio grande which have heretofore be regard as an essential and integral part of the department of new mexico and actually govern and possess by her people until conquer and sever from the republic of mexico by the american arm
 the legislature of texas have be call together by her governor for the purpose as be understand of maintain her claim to the territory east of the rio grande and of establish over it her own jurisdiction and her own law by force
 these proceeding of texas may well arrest the attention of all branch of the government of the united states and i rejoice that they occur while the congress be yet in session it be i fear far from be impossible that in consequence of these proceeding of texas a crisis may be bring on which shall summon the two houses of congress and still more emphatically the executive government to an immediate readiness for the performance of their respective duty
 by the constitution of the united states the president be constitute commander in chief of the army and navy and of the militia of the several states when call into the actual service of the united states the constitution declare also that he shall take care that the law be faithfully execute and that he shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union
 congress have power by the constitution to provide for call forth the militia to execute the law of the union and suitable and appropriate act of congress have be pass as well for provide for call forth the militia as for place other suitable and efficient mean in the hand of the president to enable he to discharge the constitutional function of his office
 the second section of the act of the 28th of february 1795 declare that whenever the law of the united states shall be oppose or their execution obstruct in any state by combination too powerful to be suppress by the ordinary course of judicial proceeding or the power vest in the marshal the president may call forth the militia as far as may be necessary to suppress such combination and to cause the law to be duly execute
 by the act of march 3 1807 it be provide that in all case of obstruction to the law either of the united states or any individual state or territory where it be lawful for the president to call forth the militia for the purpose of cause the law to be duly execute it shall be lawful for he to employ for the same purpose such part of the land or naval force of the united states as shall be judge necessary
 these several enactment be now in full force so that if the law of the united states be oppose or obstruct in any state or territory by combination too powerful to be suppress by the judicial or civil authority it become a case in which it be the duty of the president either to call out the militia or to employ the military and naval force of the united states or to do both if in his judgment the exigency of the occasion shall so require for the purpose of suppress such combination the constitutional duty of the president be plain and peremptory and the authority vest in he by law for its performance clear and ample
 texas be a state authorize to maintain her own law so far as they be not repugnant to the constitution law and treaty of the united states to suppress insurrection against her authority and to punish those who may commit treason against the state accord to the form provide by her own constitution and her own law
 but all this power be local and confine entirely within the limit of texas herself she can possibly confer no authority which can be lawfully exercise beyond her own boundary
 all this be plain and hardly need argument or elucidation if texas militia therefore march into any one of the other states or into any territory of the united states there to execute or enforce any law of texas they become at that moment trespasser they be no long under the protection of any lawful authority and be to be regard merely as intruder and if within such state or territory they obstruct any law of the united states either by power of arm or mere power of number constitute such a combination as be too powerful to be suppress by the civil authority the president of the united states have no option leave to he but be bind to obey the solemn injunction of the constitution and exercise the high power vest in he by that instrument and by the act of congress
 or if any civil posse armed or unarmed enter into any territory of the united states under the protection of the law thereof with intent to seize individual to be carry elsewhere for trial for alleged offense and this posse be too powerful to be resist by the local civil authority such seizure or attempt to seize be to be prevent or resist by the authority of the united states
 the grave and important question now arise whether there be in the territory of new mexico any exist law of the united states opposition to which or the obstruction of which would constitute a case call for the interposition of the authority vest in the president
 the constitution of the united states declare that--
 this constitution and the law of the united states which shall be make in pursuance thereof and all treaty make or which shall be make under the authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land
 if therefore new mexico be a territory of the united states and if any treaty stipulation be in force therein such treaty stipulation be the supreme law of the land and be to be maintain and uphold accordingly
 in the letter to the governor of texas my reason be give for believe that new mexico be now a territory of the united states with the same extent and the same boundary which belong to it while in the actual possession of the republic of mexico and before the late war in the early part of that war both california and new mexico be conquer by the arm of the united states and be in the military possession of the united states at the date of the treaty of peace
 by that treaty the title by conquest be confirm and these territory province or department separate from mexico forever and by the same treaty certain important right and security be solemnly guarantee to the inhabitant reside therein
 by the fifth article of the treaty it be declare that--
 the boundary line between the two republic shall commence in the gulf of mexico 3 league from land opposite the mouth of the rio grande otherwise call rio bravo del norte or opposite the mouth of its deep branch if it should have more than one branch empty directly into the sea from thence up the middle of that river follow the deep channel where it have more than one to the point where it strike the southern boundary of new mexico thence westwardly along the whole southern boundary of new mexico which run north of the town call paso to its western termination thence northward along the western line of new mexico until it intersect the first branch of the river gila or if it should not intersect any branch of that river then to the point on the say line near to such branch and thence in a direct line to the same thence down the middle of the say branch and of the said river until it empty into the rio colorado thence across the rio colorado follow the division line between upper and lower california to the pacific ocean
 the eighth article of the treaty be in the following term
 mexicans now establish in territory previously belong to mexico and which remain for the future within the limit of the united states as define by the present treaty shall be free to continue where they now reside or to remove at any time to the mexican republic retain the property which they possess in the said territory or dispose thereof and remove the proceed wherever they please without their be subject on this account to any contribution tax or charge whatever
 those who shall prefer to remain in the say territory may either retain the title and right of mexican citizen or acquire those of citizen of the united states but they shall be under the obligation to make their election within one year from the date of the exchange of ratification of this treaty and those who shall remain in the say territory after the expiration of that year without having declare their intention to retain the character of mexicans shall be consider to have elect to become citizen of the united states
 in the say territory property of every kind now belong to mexicans not establish there shall be inviolably respect the present owner the heir of these and all mexicans who may hereafter acquire say property by contract shall enjoy with respect to it guaranty equally ample as if the same belong to citizen of the united states
 the ninth article of the treaty be in these word
 the mexicans who in the territory aforesaid shall not preserve the character of citizen of the mexican republic conformably with what be stipulate in the precede article shall be incorporate into the union of the united states and be admit at the proper time to be judge of by the congress of the united states to the enjoyment of all the right of citizen of the united states accord to the principle of the constitution and in the meantime shall be maintain and protect in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and secure in the free exercise of their religion without restriction
 it be plain therefore on the face of these treaty stipulation that all mexicans establish in territory north or east of the line of demarcation already mention come within the protection of the ninth article and that the treaty be a part of the supreme law of the land do extend over all such mexicans and assure to they perfect security in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property as well as in the free exercise of their religion and this supreme law of the land be thus in actual force over this territory be to be maintain until it shall be displace or supersede by other legal provision and if it be obstruct or resist by combination too powerful to be suppress by the civil authority the case be one which come within the provision of law and which oblige the president to enforce those provision neither the constitution nor the law nor my duty nor my oath of office leave i any alternative or any choice in my mode of action
 the executive government of the united states have no power or authority to determine what be the true line of boundary between mexico and the united states before the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo nor have it any such power now since the question have become a question between the state of texas and the united states so far as this boundary be doubtful that doubt can only be remove by some act of congress to which the assent of the state of texas may be necessary or by some appropriate mode of legal adjudication but in the meantime if disturbance or collision arise or should be threaten it be absolutely incumbent on the executive government however painful the duty to take care that the law be faithfully maintain and he can regard only the actual state of thing as it exist at the date of the treaty and be bind to protect all inhabitant who be then establish and who now remain north and east of the line of demarcation in the full enjoyment of their liberty and property accord to the provision of the ninth article of the treaty in other word all must be now regard as new mexico which be possess and occupy as new mexico by citizen of mexico at the date of the treaty until a definite line of boundary shall be establish by competent authority
 this assertion of duty to protect the people of new mexico from threatened violence or from seizure to be carry into texas for trial for alleged offense against texan law do not at all include any claim of power on the part of the executive to establish any civil or military government within that territory that power belong exclusively to the legislative department and congress be the sole judge of the time and manner of create or authorize any such government
 the duty of the executive extend only to the execution of law and the maintenance of treaty already in force and the protection of all the people of the united states in the enjoyment of the right which those treaty and law guarantee
 it be exceedingly desirable that no occasion should arise for the exercise of the power thus vest in the president by the constitution and the law with whatever mildness those power might be execute or however clear the case of necessity yet consequence might nevertheless follow of which no human sagacity can foresee either the evil or the end
 having thus lay before congress the communication of his excellency the governor of texas and the answer thereto and having make such observation as i have think the occasion call for respect constitutional obligation which may arise in the further progress of thing and may devolve on i to be perform i hope i shall not be regard as step aside from the line of my duty notwithstanding that i be aware that the subject be now before both houses if i express my deep and earnest conviction of the importance of an immediate decision or arrangement or settlement of the question of boundary between texas and the territory of new mexico all consideration of justice general expediency and domestic tranquillity call for this it seem to be in its character and by position the first or one of the first of the question grow out of the acquisition of california and new mexico and now require decision
 no government can be establish for new mexico either state or territorial until it shall be first ascertain what new mexico be and what be her limit and boundary these can not be fix or know till the line of division between she and texas shall be ascertain and establish and numerous and weighty reason conspire in my judgment to show that this divisional line should be establish by congress with the assent of the government of texas in the first place this seem by far the most prompt mode of proceed by which the end can be accomplish if judicial proceeding be resort to such proceeding would necessarily be slow and year would pass by in all probability before the controversy could be end so great a delay in this case be to be avoid if possible such delay would be every way inconvenient and might be the occasion of disturbance and collision for the same reason i would with the utmost deference to the wisdom of congress express a doubt of the expediency of the appointment of commissioner and of an examination estimate and an award of indemnity to be make by they this would be but a species of arbitration which might last as long as a suit at law
 so far as i be able to comprehend the case the general fact be now all know and congress be as capable of decide on it justly and properly now as it probably would be after the report of the commissioner if the claim of title on the part of texas appear to congress to be well rounded in whole or in part it be in the competency of congress to offer she an indemnity for the surrender of that claim in a case like this surround as it be by many cogent consideration all call for amicable adjustment and immediate settlement the government of the united states would be justify in my opinion in allow an indemnity to texas not unreasonable or extravagant but fair liberal and award in a just spirit of accommodation
 i think no event would be hail with more gratification by the people of the united states than the amicable adjustment of question of difficulty which have now for a long time agitate the country and occupy to the exclusion of other subject the time and attention of congress
 having thus freely communicate the result of my own reflection on the most advisable mode of adjust the boundary question i shall nevertheless cheerfully acquiesce in any other mode which the wisdom of congress may devise and in conclusion i repeat my conviction that every consideration of the public interest manifest the necessity of a provision by congress for the settlement of this boundary question before the present session be bring to a close the settlement of other question connect with the same subject within the same period be greatly to be desire but the adjustment of this appear to i to be in the high degree important in the train of such an adjustment we may well hope that there will follow a return of harmony and good will an increase attachment to the union and the general satisfaction of the country

fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives be suddenly call in the midst of the last session of congress bya painful dispensation of divine providence to the responsible stationwhich i now hold i content myself with such communication to the legislatureas the exigency of the moment seem to require the country be shroudedin mourn for the loss of its venerable chief magistrate and all heartswere penetrate with grief neither the time nor the occasion appearedto require or to justify on my part any general expression of politicalopinion or any announcement of the principle which would govern i inthe discharge of the duty to the performance of which i have be so unexpectedlycalled i trust therefore that it may not be deem inappropriate ifi avail myself of this opportunity of the reassembling of congress to makeknown my sentiment in a general manner in regard to the policy which oughtto be pursue by the government both in its intercourse with foreign nationsand its management and administration of internal affair nation like individual in a state of nature be equal and independent possess certain right and owe certain duty to each other arisingfrom their necessary and unavoidable relation which right and dutiesthere be no common human authority to protect and enforce still theyare right and duty bind in moral in conscience and in honor although there be no tribunal to which an injured party can appeal butthe disinterested judgment of mankind and ultimately the arbitrament ofthe sword among the acknowledge right of nation be that which each possessesof establish that form of government which it may deem most conduciveto the happiness and prosperity of its own citizen of change that formas circumstance may require and of manage its internal affair accordingto its own will the people of the united states claim this right for themselves and they readily concede it to other hence it become an imperative dutynot to interfere in the government or internal policy of other nations;and although we may sympathize with the unfortunate or the oppress everywherein their struggle for freedom our principle forbid we from take anypart in such foreign contest we make no war to promote or to preventsuccession to throne to maintain any theory of a balance of power orto suppress the actual government which any country choose to establishfor itself we instigate no revolution nor suffer any hostile militaryexpedition to be fit out in the united states to invade the territoryor province of a friendly nation the great law of morality ought to havea national as well as a personal and individual application we shouldact toward other nation as we wish they to act toward we and justiceand conscience should form the rule of conduct between government insteadof mere power self interest or the desire of aggrandizement to maintaina strict neutrality in foreign war to cultivate friendly relation toreciprocate every noble and generous act and to perform punctually andscrupulously every treaty obligation these be the duty which we oweto other state and by the performance of which we well entitle ourselvesto like treatment from they or if that in any case be refuse we canenforce our own right with justice and a clear conscience in our domestic policy the constitution will be my guide and in questionsof doubt i shall look for its interpretation to the judicial decisionsof that tribunal which be establish to expound it and to the usage ofthe government sanction by the acquiescence of the country i regardall its provision as equally binding in all its part it be the willof the people express in the most solemn form and the constitute authoritiesare but agent to carry that will into effect every power which it hasgrante be to be exercise for the public good but no pretense of utility no honest conviction even of what might be expedient can justify theassumption of any power not grant the power confer upon the governmentand their distribution to the several department be as clearly expressedin that sacred instrument as the imperfection of human language will allow and i deem it my first duty not to question its wisdom add to its provision evade its requirement or nullify its command upon you fellow citizen as the representative of the states andthe people be wisely devolve the legislative power i shall comply withmy duty in lay before you from time to time any information calculatedto enable you to discharge your high and responsible trust for the benefitof our common constituent my opinion will be frankly express upon the lead subject of legislation;and if which i do not anticipate any act should pass the two houses ofcongress which should appear to i unconstitutional or an encroachmenton the just power of other department or with provision hastily adoptedand likely to produce consequence injurious and unforeseen i should notshrink from the duty of return it to you with my reason for yourfurther consideration beyond the due performance of these constitutionalobligation both my respect for the legislature and my sense of proprietywill restrain i from any attempt to

right of the states over the object and subject intrust to congress its legislative authorityis supreme but here that authority cease and every citizen who trulylove the constitution and desire the continuance of its existence andit blessing will resolutely and firmly resist any interference in thosedomestic affair which the constitution have dearly and unequivocally leftto the exclusive authority of the states and every such citizen will alsodeprecate useless irritation among the several member of the union andall reproach and crimination tend to alienate one portion of the countryfrom another the beauty of our system of government consist and itssafety and durability must consist in avoid mutual collision and encroachmentsand in the regular separate action of all while each be revolve in itsown distinct orbit the constitution have make it the duty of the president to take carethat the law be faithfully execute in a government like ours in whichall law be pass by a majority of the representative of the people and these representative be choose for such short period that any injuriousor obnoxious law can very soon be repeal it would appear unlikely thatany great number should be find ready to resist the execution of thelaw but it must be bear in mind that the country be extensive thatthere may be local interest or prejudice render a law odious in onepart which be not so in another and that the thoughtless and inconsiderate mislead by their passion or their imagination may be induce madly toresist such law as they disapprove such person should recollect thatwithout law there can be no real practical liberty that when law be trampledund foot tyranny rule whether it appear in the form of a militarydespotism or of popular violence the law be

the unexampled growth of the country the present amount of its population and its ample mean of self protection assure for it the respect of allnation while it be trust that its character for justice and a regardto the right of other states will cause that respect to be readily andcheerfully pay a convention be negotiate between the united states and great britainin april last for facilitate and protect the construction of a shipcanal between the atlantic and pacific ocean and for other purpose theinstrument have since be ratify by the contracting party the exchangeof ratification have be

betweenthe two ocean through the territory of that state have make progress intheir preliminary arrangement the treaty between the united states andgreat britain of the 19th of april last above refer to be now inoperation it be to be hope that the guaranty which it offer will besufficient to secure the completion of the work with all practicable expedition it be obvious that this result would be indefinitely postpone if any otherthan peaceful measure for the purpose of harmonize conflict claimsto territory in that quarter should be adopt it will consequently bemy endeavor to cause any further negotiation on the part of this governmentwhich may be requisite for this purpose to be so conduct as to bringthem to a speedy and successful close some unavoidable delay have occur arise from distance and the difficultyof intercourse between this government and that of nicaragua but as intelligenceha just be receive of the appointment of an envoy extraordinary andminister plenipotentiary of that government to reside at washington whosearrival may soon be expect it be hope that no further impediment willbe experience in the prompt transaction of business between the two government citizen of the united states have undertake the connection of thetwo ocean by mean of a railroad across the isthmus of tehuantepec undergrant of the mexican government to a citizen of that republic it be understoodthat a thorough survey of the course of the communication be in preparation and there be every reason to expect that it will be prosecute with characteristicenergy especially when that government shall have consent to such stipulationswith the government of the united states as may be necessary to imparta feeling of security to those who may embark their property in the enterprise negotiation be pende for the accomplishment of that object and a hopeis confidently entertain that when the government of mexico shall becomeduly sensible of the advantage which that country can not fail to derivefrom the work and learn that the government of the united states desiresthat the right of sovereignty of mexico in the isthmus shall remain unimpaired the stipulation refer to will be agree to with alacrity by the last advice from mexico it would appear however that thatgovernment entertain strong objection to some of the stipulation whichthe party concern in the project of the railroad deem necessary fortheir protection and security further consideration it be to be hope or some modification of term may yet reconcile the difference existingbetween the two government in this respect fresh instruction have recently be give to the minister of the unitedstates in mexico who be prosecute the subject with promptitude and ability although the negotiation with portugal for the payment of claim ofcitizen of the united states against that government have not yet resultedin a formal treaty yet a proposition make by the government of portugalfor the final adjustment and payment of those claim have recently beenaccepte on the part of the united states it give i pleasure to saythat mr. clay to whom the negotiation on the part of the united stateshad be intrust discharge the duty of his appointment with abilityand discretion act always within the instruction of his government it be expect that a regular convention will be immediately negotiatedfor carry the agreement between the two government into effect thecommissioner appoint under the act of congress for carry into effectthe convention with brazil of the 27th of january 1849 have enter uponthe performance of the duty impose upon he by that act it be hopedthat those duty may be complete within the time which it prescribe the document however which the imperial government by the third articleof the convention stipulate to furnish to the government of the unitedstates have not yet be receive as it be presume that those documentswill be essential for the correct disposition of the claim it may becomenecessary for congress to extend the period limit for the duration ofthe commission the sum stipulate by the fourth article of the conventionto be pay to this government have be receive the collection in the port of the united states of discriminate dutiesupon the vessel of chili and their cargo have be suspend pursuantto the provision of the act of congress of the 24th of may 1828 it isto be hope that this measure will impart a fresh impulse to the commercebetween the two country which of late and especially since our acquisitionof california have to the mutual advantage of the party be much augmented peruvian guano have become so desirable an article to the agriculturalinterest of the united states that it be the duty of the government toemploy all the mean properly in its power for the purpose of cause thatarticle to be import into the country at a reasonable price nothingwill be omit on my part toward accomplish this desirable end i ampersuade that in remove any restraint on this traffic the peruviangovernment will promote its own good interest while it will afford aproof of a friendly disposition toward this country which will be dulyappreciate the treaty between the united states and his majesty the king of thehawaiian islands which have recently be make public will it be believe have a beneficial effect upon the relation between the two country the relation between those part of the island of st. domingo whichwere formerly colony of spain and france respectively be still inan unsettled condition the proximity of that island to the united statesand the delicate question involve in the exist controversy there renderit desirable that it should be permanently and speedily adjust the interestsof humanity and of general commerce also demand this and as intimationsof the same sentiment have be receive from other government it ishope that some plan may soon be devise to effect the object in a mannerlikely to give general satisfaction the government of the united stateswill not fail by the exercise of all proper friendly office to do allin its power to put an end to the destructive war which have rage betweenthe different part of the island and to secure to they both the benefitsof peace and commerce i refer you to the report of the secretary of the treasury for a detailedstatement of the finance the total receipt into the treasury for the year end 30th of junelast be $ 47,421,748.90 the total expenditure during the same periodwere $ 43,002,168.90 the public debt have be reduce since the last annualreport from the treasury department $ 495,276.79 by the nineteenth section of the act of 28th january 1847 the proceedsof the sale of the public land be pledge for the interest and principalof the public debt the great amount of those land subsequently grantedby congress for military bounty will it be believe very nearly supplythe public demand for several year to come and but little reliance can therefore be place on that hitherto fruitful source of revenue asidefrom the permanent annual expenditure which have necessarily largelyincrease a portion of the public debt amount to $ 8,075,986.59 mustbe provide for within the next two fiscal year it be most desirablethat these accrue demand should be meet without resort to new loan all experience have demonstrate the wisdom and policy of raise a largeportion of revenue for the support of government from duty on good import the power to lay these duty be unquestionable and its chief object of course be to replenish the treasury but if in do this an incidentaladvantage may be gain by encourage the industry of our own citizen it be our duty to avail ourselves of that advantage a duty lay upon an article which can not be produce in this country such as tea or coffee add to the cost of the article and be chieflyor wholly pay by the consumer but a duty lay upon an article which maybe produce here stimulate the skill and industry of our own country toproduce the same article which be bring into the market in competitionwith the foreign article and the importer be thus compel to reducehis price to that at which the domestic article can be sell thereby throwinga part of the duty upon the producer of the foreign article the continuanceof this process create the skill and invite the capital which finallyenable we to produce the article much cheap than it could have be procuredfrom abroad thereby benefit both the producer and the consumer at home the consequence of this be that the artisan and the agriculturist be broughttogether each afford a ready market for the produce of the other thewhole country become prosperous and the ability to produce every necessaryof life render we independent in war as well as in peace a high tariff can never be permanent it will cause dissatisfaction and will be change it exclude competition and thereby invite the investmentof capital in manufacture to such excess that when change it bring distress bankruptcy and ruin upon all who have be mislead by its faithless protection what the manufacturer want be uniformity and permanency that he may feela confidence that he be not to be ruin by sudden exchange but to makea tariff uniform and permanent it be not only necessary that the law shouldnot be alter but that the duty should not fluctuate to effect thisall duty should be specific wherever the nature of the article be suchas to admit of it ad valorem duty fluctuate with the price and offerstrong temptation to fraud and perjury specific duty on the contrary be equal and uniform in all port and at all time and offer a stronginducement to the importer to bring the good article as he pay no moreduty upon that than upon one of inferior quality i therefore stronglyrecommend a modification of the present tariff which have prostrate someof our most important and necessary manufacture and that specific dutiesbe impose sufficient to raise the requisite revenue make such discriminationsin favor of the industrial pursuit of our own country as to encouragehome production without exclude foreign competition it be also importantthat an unfortunate provision in the present tariff which impose a muchhigher duty upon the raw material that enter into our manufacture thanupon the manufacture article should be remedie the paper accompany the report of the secretary of the treasurywill disclose fraud attempt upon the revenue in variety and amountso great as to justify the conclusion that it be impossible under any systemof ad valorem duty levy upon the foreign cost or value of the articleto secure an honest observance and an effectual administration of the law the fraudulent device to evade the law which have be detect by thevigilance of the appraiser leave no room to doubt that similar impositionsnot discover to a large amount have be successfully practice sincethe enactment of the law now in force this state of thing have alreadyhad a prejudicial influence upon those engage in foreign commerce itha a tendency to drive the honest trader from the business of importingand to throw that important branch of employment into the hand of unscrupulousand dishonest man who be alike regardless of law and the obligationsof an oath by these mean the plain intention of congress as expressedin the law be daily defeat every motive of policy and duty therefore impel i to ask the earnest attention of congress to this subject ifcongress should deem it unwise to attempt any important change in thesystem of levy duty at this session it will become indispensableto the protection of the revenue that such remedy as in the judgmentof congress may mitigate the evil complain of should be at once apply as before state specific duty would in my opinion afford the mostperfect remedy for this evil but if you should not concur in this view then as a partial remedy i beg leave respectfully to recommend that insteadof take the invoice of the article abroad as a means of determine itsvalue here the correctness of which invoice it be in many case impossibleto verify the law be so change as to require a home valuation or appraisal to be regulate in such manner as to give as far as practicable uniformityin the several port there be no mint in california i be inform that the laborer inthe mine be compel to dispose of their gold dust at a large discount this appear to i to be a heavy and unjust tax upon the labor of thoseemployed in extract this precious metal and i doubt not you will bedisposed at the early period possible to relieve they from it by theestablishment of a mint in the meantime as an assayer 's office be establishedthere i would respectfully submit for your consideration the proprietyof authorize gold bullion which have be assay and stamp to be receivedin payment of government due i can not conceive that the treasury wouldsuffer any loss by such a provision which will at once raise bullion toit par value and thereby save if i be rightly inform many millionsof dollar to the laborer which be now pay in brokerage to convert thisprecious metal into available fund this discount upon their hard earningsis a heavy tax and every effort should be make by the government to relievethem from so great a burden more than three fourth of our population be engage in the cultivationof the soil the commercial manufacturing and navigate interest areall to a great extent dependent on the agricultural it be therefore themost important interest of the nation and have a just claim to the fosteringcare and protection of the government so far as they can be extend consistentlywith the provision of the constitution as this can not be do by theordinary mode of legislation i respectfully recommend the establishmentof an agricultural bureau to be charge with the duty of give to thisleade branch of american industry the encouragement which it so welldeserve in view of the immense mineral resource of our country provisionshould also be make for the employment of a competent mineralogist andchemist who should be require under the direction of the head of thebureau to collect specimen of the various mineral of our country andto ascertain by careful analysis their respective element and propertiesand their adaptation to useful purpose he should also be require toexamine and report upon the quality of different soil and the manuresb calculate to improve their productiveness by publish the resultsof such experiment with suitable explanation and by the collectionand distribution of rare seed and plant with instruction as to theb system of cultivation much may be do to promote this great nationalinter in compliance with the act of congress pass on the 23d of may 1850,providing among other thing for take the seventh census a superintendentwas appoint and all other measure adopt which be deem necessaryto insure the prompt and faithful performance of that duty the appropriationalready make will it be believe be sufficient to defray the whole expenseof the work but further legislation may be necessary in regard to thecompensation of some of the marshal of the territories it will also beproper to make provision by law at an early day for the publication ofsuch abstract of the return as the public interest may require the unprecedented growth of our territory on the pacific in wealthand population and the consequent increase of their social and commercialrelation with the atlantic states seem to render it the duty of the governmentto use all its constitutional power to improve the mean of intercoursewith they the importance of open a line of communication the bestand most expeditious of which the nature of the country will admit betweenthe valley of the mississippi and the pacific be bring to your noticeby my predecessor in his annual message and as the reason which he presentedin favor of the measure still exist in full force i beg leave to callyour attention to they and to repeat the recommendation then make by he the uncertainty which exist in regard to the validity of land titlesin california be a subject which demand your early consideration largebodie of land in that state be claim under grant say to have beenmade by authority of the spanish and mexican government many of thesehave not be perfect other have be revoke and some be believedto be fraudulent but until they shall have be judicially investigatedthey will continue to retard the settlement and improvement of the country i therefore respectfully recommend that provision be make by law for theappointment of commissioner to examine all such claim with a view totheir final adjustment i also beg leave to call your attention to the propriety of extendingat an early day our system of land law with such modification as maybe necessary over the state of california and the territories of utahand new mexico the mineral land of california will of course form anexception to any general system which may be adopt various method ofdispose of they have be suggest i be at first incline to favorthe system of leasing as it seem to promise the large revenue to thegovernment and to afford the good security against monopoly but furtherreflection and our experience in lease the lead mine and sell landsupon credit have bring my mind to the conclusion that there would begreat difficulty in collect the rent and that the relation of debtorand creditor between the citizen and the government would be attendedwith many mischievous consequence i therefore recommend that insteadof retain the mineral land under the permanent control of the governmentthey be divide into small parcel and sell under such restriction asto quantity and time as will insure the good price and guard most effectuallyagainst combination of capitalist to obtain monopoly the annexation of texas and the acquisition of california and new mexicohave give increase importance to our indian relation the various tribesbrought under our jurisdiction by these enlargement of our boundariesare estimate to embrace a population of 124,000 texas and new mexicoare surround by powerful tribe of indians who be a source of constantterror and annoyance to the inhabitant separate into small predatoryband and always mount they overrun the country devastating farm destroy crop drive off whole herd of cattle and occasionally murderingthe inhabitant or carry they into captivity the great road leadinginto the country be infest with they whereby travel be renderedextremely dangerous and immigration be almost entirely arrest the mexicanfrontier which by the eleventh article of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgowe be bind to protect against the indians within our border be exposedto these incursion equally with our own the military force stationedin that country although form a large proportion of the army be representeda entirely inadequate to our own protection and the fulfillment of ourtreaty stipulation with mexico the principal deficiency be in cavalry and i recommend that congress should at as early a period as practicable provide for the raising of one or more regiment of mount man for further suggestion on this subject and other connect with ourdomestic interest and the defense of our frontier i refer you to thereport of the secretary of the interior and of the secretary of war i commend also to your favorable consideration the suggestion containedin the last mention report and in the letter of the general in chiefrelative to the establishment of an asylum for the relief of disabled anddestitute soldier this subject appeal so strongly to your sympathiesthat it would be superfluous in i to say anything more than barely toexpress my cordial approbation of the propose object the navy continue to give protection to our commerce and other nationalinterest in the different quarter of the globe and with the exceptionof a single steamer on the northern lake the vessel in commission aredistribute in six different squadron the report of the head of that department will exhibit the servicesof these squadron and of the several vessel employ in each during thepast year it be a source of gratification that while they have be constantlyprepare for any hostile emergency they have everywhere meet with the respectand courtesy due as well to the dignity as to the peaceful dispositionsand just purpose of the nation the two brigantine accept by the government from a generous citizenof new york and place under the command of an officer of the navy to proceedto the arctic seas in quest of the british commander sir john franklinand his companion in compliance with the act of congress approve inmay last have when last hear from penetrate into a high northern latitude;but the success of this noble and humane enterprise be yet uncertain i invite your attention to the view of our present naval establishmentand resource present in the report of the secretary of the navy andthe suggestion therein make for its improvement together with the navalpolicy recommend for the security of our pacific coast and the protectionand extension of our commerce with eastern asia our facility for a largerparticipation in the trade of the east by mean of our recent settlementson the shore of the pacific be too obvious to be overlook or disregarded the question in relation to rank in the army and navy and relativerank between officer of the two branch of the service present tothe executive by certain resolution of the house of representatives atthe last session of congress have be submit to a board of officersin each branch of the service and their report may be expect at an earlyday i also earnestly recommend the enactment of a law authorize officersof the army and navy to be retire from the service when incompetent forit vigorous and active duty take care to make suitable provisionfor those who have faithfully serve their country and award distinctionsby retain in appropriate command those who have be particularly conspicuousfor gallantry and good conduct while the obligation of the country tomaintain and honor those who to the exclusion of other pursuit havedevote themselves to its arduous service be acknowledge this obligationshould not be permit to interfere with the efficiency of the serviceitself i be gratify in be able to state that the estimate of expenditurefor the navy in the ensue year be less by more than $ 1,000,000 thanthose of the present except the appropriation which may become necessaryfor the construction of a dock on the coast of the pacific propositionsfor which be now be consider and on which a special report may beexpecte early in your present session there be an evident justness in the suggestion of the same report thatappropriation for the naval service proper should be separate from thosefor fixed and permanent object such as build dock and navy yardsand the fixture attach and from the extraordinary object under thecare of the department which however important be not essentially naval a revision of the code for the government of the navy seem to requirethe immediate consideration of congress its system of crime and punishmentshad undergone no change for half a century until the last session thoughit defect have be often and ably point out and the abolition ofa particular specie of corporal punishment which then take place withoutprovide any substitute have leave the service in a state of defectivenesswhich call for prompt correction i therefore recommend that the wholesubject be revise without delay and such a system establish for theenforcement of discipline as shall be at once humane and effectual the accompanying report of the postmaster general present a satisfactoryview of the operation and condition of that department at the close ofthe last fiscal year the length of the inland mail route in the unitedstates not embrace the service in oregon and california be 178,672miles the annual transportation thereon 46,541,423 mile and the annualcost of such transportation $ 2,724,426 the increase of the annual transportationover that of the precede year be 3,997,354 mile and the increase incost be $ 342,440 the number of post office in the united states on the1st day of july last be 18,417 be an increase of 1,670 during thepreceding year the gross revenue of the department for the fiscal year end june30 1850 amount to $ 5,552,971.48 include the annual appropriationof $ 200,000 for the franked matter of the departments and exclude theforeign postage collect for and payable to the british government the expenditure for the same period be $ 5,212,953.43 leave a balanceof revenue over expenditure of $ 340,018.05 i be happy to find that the fiscal condition of the department be suchas to justify the postmaster general in recommend the reduction of ourinland letter postage to 3 cent the single letter when prepay and 5 centswhen not prepay he also recommend that the prepaid rate shall be reducedto 2 cent whenever the revenue of the department after the reduction shall exceed its expenditure by more than 5 per cent for two consecutiveyear that the postage upon california and other letter send by our oceansteamer shall be much reduce and that the rate of postage on newspaper pamphlet periodical and other print matter shall be modify andsome reduction thereon make it can not be doubt that the propose reduction will for the presentdiminish the revenue of the department it be believe that the deficiency after the surplus already accumulate shall be exhaust may be almostwholly meet either by abolish the exist privilege of send freematter through the mail or by pay out of the treasury to the post officedepartment a sum equivalent to the postage of which it be deprive by suchprivilege the last be suppose to be the preferable mode and will ifnot entirely so nearly supply that deficiency as to make any further appropriationthat may be find necessary so inconsiderable as to form no obstacle tothe propose reduction i entertain no doubt of the authority of congress to make appropriationsfor leading object in that class of public work comprise what be usuallycalled work of internal improvement this authority i suppose to be derivedchiefly from the power of regulate commerce with foreign nation andamong the states and the power of lay and collect impost wherecommerce be to be carry on and impost collect there must be portsand harbor as well as wharf and custom house if ship laden with valuablecargoe approach the shore or sail along the coast light house be necessaryat suitable point for the protection of life and property other facilitiesand security for commerce and navigation be hardly less important andthose clause of the constitution therefore to which i have referredhave receive from the origin of the government a liberal and beneficialconstruction not only have light house buoy and beacon been establishedand float light maintain but harbor have be clear and improve pier construct and even breakwater for the safety of ship andsea wall to protect harbor from be fill up and render uselessby the action of the ocean have be erect at very great expense andthis construction of the constitution appear the more reasonable fromthe consideration that if these work of such evident importance and utility be not to be accomplish by congress they can not be accomplish atall by the adoption of the constitution the several states voluntarilyparte with the power of collect duty of impost in their own port and it be not to be expect that they should raise money by internal taxation direct or indirect for the benefit of that commerce the revenue derivedfrom which do not either in whole or in part go into their own treasury nor do i perceive any difference between the power of congress to makeappropriation for object of this kind on the ocean and the power to makeappropriation for similar object on lake and river wherever they arelarge enough to bear on their water an extensive traffic the magnificentmississippi and its tributary and the vast lake of the north and northwestappear to i to fall within the exercise of the power as justly and asclearly as the ocean and the gulf of mexico it be a mistake to regardexpenditures judiciously make for these object as expenditure for localpurpose the position or sight of the work be necessarily local but itsutility be general a ship canal around the falls of st. mary of less thana mile in length though local in its construction would yet be nationalin its purpose and its benefit as it would remove the only obstructionto a navigation of more than 1,000 mile affect several state aswell as our commercial relation with canada so too the breakwater atthe mouth of the delaware be erect not for the exclusive benefit ofthe states border on the bay and river of that name but for that ofthe whole coastwise navigation of the united states and to a considerableextent also of foreign commerce if a ship be lose on the bar at the entranceof a southern port for want of sufficient depth of water it be very likelyto be a northern ship and if a steamboat be sink in any part of the mississippion account of its channel not having be properly clear of obstruction it may be a boat belong to either of eight or ten states i may add as somewhat remarkable that among all the thirty one states there be nonethat be not to a great or less extent bound on the ocean or the gulfof mexico or one of the great lakes or some navigable river in fulfil our constitutional duty fellow citizen on this subject as in carry into effect all other power confer by the constitution we should consider ourselves as deliberate and act for one and thesame country and bear constantly in mind that our regard and our dutyare due not to a particular part only but to the whole i therefore recommend that appropriation be make for complete suchwork as have be already begin and for commence such other as mayseem to the wisdom of congress to be of public and general importance the difficulty and delay incident to the settlement of private claimsby congress amount in many case to a denial of justice there be reasonto apprehend that many unfortunate creditor of the government have therebybeen unavoidably ruin congress have so much business of a public characterthat it be impossible it should give much attention to mere private claim and their accumulation be now so great that many claimant must despairof ever be able to obtain a hearing it may well be doubt whethercongress from the nature of its organization be properly constitutedto decide upon such case it be impossible that each member should examinethe merit of every claim on which he be compel to vote and it be preposterousto ask a judge to decide a case which he have never hear such decisionsmay and frequently must do injustice either to the claimant or the government and i perceive no well remedy for this grow evil than the establishmentof some tribunal to adjudicate upon such claim i beg leave therefore most respectfully to recommend that provision be make by law for the appointmentof a commission to settle all private claim against the united states;and as an ex parte hearing must in all contest case be very unsatisfactory i also recommend the appointment of a solicitor whose duty it shall beto represent the government before such commission and protect it againstall illegal fraudulent or unjust claim which may be present for theiradjudication this district which have neither voice nor vote in your deliberation look to you for protection and aid and i commend all its want to yourfavorable consideration with a full confidence that you will meet themnot only with justice but with liberality it should be bear in mindthat in this city lay out by washington and consecrate by his name be locate the capitol of our nation the emblem of our union and the symbolof our greatness here also be situate all the public building necessaryfor the use of the government and all these be exempt from taxation it should be the pride of americans to render this place attractive tothe people of the whole republic and convenient and safe for the transactionof the public business and the preservation of the public record thegovernment should therefore bear a liberal proportion of the burden ofall necessary and useful improvement and as nothing could contributemore to the health comfort and safety of the city and the security ofthe public building and record than an abundant supply of pure water i respectfully recommend that you make such provision for obtain thesame as in your wisdom you may deem proper the act pass at your last session make certain proposition totexas for settle the dispute boundary between that state and the territoryof new mexico be immediately on its passage transmit by express tothe governor of texas to be lay by he before the general assembly forit agreement thereto its receipt be duly acknowledge but no officialinformation have yet be receive of the action of the general assemblythereon it may however be very soon expect as by the term of theproposition submit they be to have be act upon on or before thefirst day of the present month it be hardly to have be expect that the series of measure passedat your last session with the view of heal the sectional differenceswhich have spring from the slavery and territorial question should at oncehave realize their beneficent purpose all mutual concession in the natureof a compromise must necessarily be unwelcome to man of extreme opinion and though without such concession our constitution could not have beenforme and can not be permanently sustain yet we have see they madethe subject of bitter controversy in both section of the republic itrequire many month of discussion and deliberation to secure the concurrenceof a majority of congress in their favor it would be strange if they hadbeen receive with immediate approbation by people and states prejudicedand heat by the exciting controversy of their representative i believethose measure to have be require by the circumstance and conditionof the country i believe they be necessary to allay asperity and animositiesthat be rapidly alienate one section of the country from another anddestroye those fraternal sentiment which be the strong supportsof the constitution they be adopt in the spirit of conciliation andfor the purpose of conciliation i believe that a great majority of ourfellow citizen sympathize in that spirit and that purpose and in themain approve and be prepare in all respect to sustain these enactment i can not doubt that the american people bind together by kindre bloodand common tradition still cherish a paramount regard for the union oftheir father and that they be ready to rebuke any attempt to violateit integrity to disturb the compromise on which it be base or to resistthe law which have be enact under its authority the series of measure to which i have allude be regard by i asa settlement in principle and substance a final settlement of the dangerousand exciting subject which they embrace most of these subject indeed be beyond your reach as the legislation which dispose of they be init character final and irrevocable it may be presume from the oppositionwhich they all encounter that none of those measure be free from imperfection but in their mutual dependence and connection they form a system of compromisethe most conciliatory and well for the entire country that could be obtainedfrom conflict sectional interest and opinion for this reason i recommend your adherence to the adjustment establishedby those measure until time and experience shall demonstrate the necessityof further legislation to guard against evasion or abuse by that adjustment we have be rescue from the wide and boundlessagitation that surround we and have a firm distinct and legal groundto rest upon and the occasion i trust will justify i in exhort mycountryman to rally upon and maintain that ground as the good if not theonly mean of restore peace and quiet to the country and maintaininginviolate the integrity of the union and now fellow citizen i can not bring this communication to a closewithout invoke you to join i in humble and devout thank to the greatruler of nations for the multiplied blessing which he have graciously bestowedupon we his hand so often visible in our preservation have stay thepestilence save we from foreign war and domestic disturbance and scatteredplenty throughout the land our liberty religion and civil have be maintain the fountainsof knowledge have all be keep open and mean of happiness widely spreadand generally enjoy great than have fall to the lot of any othernation and while deeply penetrate with gratitude for the past let ushope that his all wise providence will so guide our counsel as that theyshall result in give satisfaction to our constituent secure the peaceof the country and add new strength to the united government underwhich we live

 from the common source of public information it would appear that a very remarkable degree of unanimity prevail not only in the legislature but among the people of texas in respect to the agreement of the state to that which have be propose by congress
 i can not refrain from congratulate congress and the country on the success of this great and leading measure of conciliation and peace the difficulty feel and the danger apprehend from the vast acquisition of territory under the late treaty with mexico seem now happily overcome by the wisdom of congress within that territory there already exist one state respectable for the amount of her population distinguish for singular activity and enterprise and remarkable in many respect from her condition and history this new state have come into the union with manifestation not to be mistaken of her attachment to that constitution and that government which now embrace she and her interest within their protect and beneficent control

to the senate of the united states
 i have receive the resolution of the senate of the 18th instant request i to lay before that body if not incompatible with the public interest any information i may possess in regard to an alleged recent case of a forcible resistance to the execution of the law of the united states in the city of boston and to communicate to the senate under the above condition what mean i have adopt to meet the occurrence and whether in my opinion any additional legislation be necessary to meet the exigency of the case and to more vigorously execute exist law
 the public newspaper contain an affidavit of patrick riley a deputy marshal for the district of massachusetts set forth the circumstance of the case a copy of which affidavit be herewith communicate private and unofficial communication concur in establish the main fact of this account but no satisfactory official information have as yet be receive and in some important respect the accuracy of the account have be deny by person whom it implicate nothing could be more unexpected than that such a gross violation of law such a high handed contempt of the authority of the united states should be perpetrate by a band of lawless confederate at noonday in the city of boston and in the very temple of justice i regard this flagitious proceeding as be a surprise not unattended by some degree of negligence nor do i doubt that if any such act of violence have be apprehend thousand of the good citizen of boston would have present themselves voluntarily and promptly to prevent it but the danger do not seem to have be timely make known or duly appreciate by those who be concern in the execution of the process in a community distinguish for its love of order and respect for the law among a people whose sentiment be liberty and law and not liberty without law nor above the law such an outrage could only be the result of sudden violence unhappily too much unprepared for to be successfully resist it would be melancholy indeed if we be oblige to regard this outbreak against the constitutional and legal authority of the government as proceed from the general feeling of the people in a spot which be proverbially call the cradle of american liberty such undoubtedly be not the fact it violate without question the general sentiment of the people of boston and of a vast majority of the whole people of massachusetts as much as it violate the law defy the authority of the government and disgrace those concerned in it their alder and abettor
 it be nevertheless my duty to lay before the senate in answer to its resolution some important fact and consideration connect with the subject
 a resolution of congress of september 23 1789 declare
 that it be recommend to the legislature of the several states to pass law make it expressly the duty of the keeper of their jail to receive and safe keep therein all prisoner commit under the authority of the united states until they shall be discharge by the course of the law thereof under the like penalty as in the case of prisoner commit under the authority of such states respectively the united states to pay for the use and keeping of such jail at the rate of 50 cent per month for each prisoner that shall under their authority be commit thereto during the time such prisoner shall be therein confine and also to support such of say prisoner as shall be commit for offense
 a further resolution of congress of the 3d of march 1791 provide that--
 whereas congress do by a resolution of the 23d day of september 1789 recommend to the several states to pass law make it expressly the duty of the keeper of their jail to receive and safe keep therein all prisoner commit under the authority of the united states in order therefore to insure the administration of justice--
 resolve by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assemble that in case any state shall not have comply with the say recommendation the marshal in such state under the direction of the judge of the district be authorize to hire a convenient place to serve as a temporary jail and to make the necessary provision for the safe keeping of prisoner commit under the authority of the united states until permanent provision shall be make by law for that purpose and the say marshal shall be allow his reasonable expense incur for the above purpose to be pay out of the treasury of the united states
 and a resolution of congress of march 3 1821 provide that--
 where any state or states having comply with the recommendation of congress in the resolution of the 23d day of september 1789 shall have withdraw or shall hereafter withdraw either in whole or in part the use of their jail for prisoner commit under the authority of the united states the marshal in such state or states under the direction of the judge of the district shall be and hereby be authorize and require to hire a convenient place to serve as a temporary jail and to make the necessary provision for the safe keeping of prisoner commit under the authority of the united states until permanent provision shall be make by law for that purpose and the say marshal shall be allow his reasonable expense incur for the above purpose to be pay out of the treasury of the united states
 these various provision of the law remain unrepealed
 by the law of massachusetts as that law stand before the act of the legislature of that state of the 24th of march 1843 the common jail in the respective county be to be use for the detention of any person detain or commit by the authority of the court of the united states as well as by the court and magistrate of the state but these provision be abrogate and repeal by the act of the legislature of massachusetts of the 24th of march 1843
 that act declare that--
 no judge of any court of record of this commonwealth and no justice of the peace shall hereafter take cognizance or grant a certificate in case that may arise under the third section of an act of congress pass february 12 1793 and entitle an act respect fugitive from justice and person escape from the service of their master to any person who claim any other person as a fugitive slave within the jurisdiction of the commonwealth
 and it far declare that--
 no sheriff deputy sheriff coroner constable jailer or other officer of this commonwealth shall hereafter arrest or detain or aid in the arrest or detention or imprisonment in any jail or other building belong to this commonwealth or to any county city or town thereof of any person for the reason that he be claim as a fugitive slave
 and it far declare that--
 any justice of the peace sheriff deputy sheriff coroner constable or jailer who shall offend against the provision of this law by in any way act directly or indirectly under the power confer by the third section of the act of congress aforementione shall forfeit a sum not exceed $ 1,000 for every such offense to the use of the county where say offense be commit or shall be subject to imprisonment not exceed one year in the county jail
 this law it be obvious have two object the first be to make it a penal offense in all officer and magistrate of the commonwealth to exercise the power confer on they by the act of congress of the 12th of february 1793 entitle an act respect fugitive from justice and person escape from the service of their master and which power they be fully competent to perform up to the time of this inhibition and penal enactment second to refuse the use of the jail of the state for the detention of any person claim as a fugitive slave
 it be deeply to be lament that the purpose of these enactment be quite apparent it be to prevent as far as the legislature of the state could prevent the law of congress pass for the purpose of carry into effect that article of the constitution of the united states which declare that no person hold to service or labor in one state under the law thereof escape into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharge from such service or labor but shall be deliver up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due from be carry into effect but these act of state legislation although they may cause embarrassment and create expense can not derogate either from the duty or the authority of congress to carry out fully and fairly the plain and imperative constitutional provision for the delivery of person bind to labor in one state and escape into another to the party to whom such labor may be due it be quite clear that by the resolution of congress of march 3 1821 the marshal of the united states in any state in which the use of the jail of the state have be withdraw in whole or in part from the purpose of the detention of person commit under the authority of the united states be not only empower but expressly require under the direction of the judge of the district to hire a convenient place for the safe keeping of prisoner commit under authority of the united states it will be see from paper accompany this communication that the attention of the marshal of massachusetts be distinctly call to this provision of the law by a letter from the secretary of the navy of the date of october 28 last there be no official information that the marshal have provide any such place for the confinement of his prisoner if he have not it be to be regret that this power be not exercise by the marshal under the direction of the district judge immediately on the passage of the act of the legislature of massachusetts of the 24th of march 1843 and especially that it be not exercise on the passage of the fugitive slave law of the last session or when the attention of the marshal be afterwards particularly draw to it
 it be true that the escape from the deputy marshal in this case be not owe to the want of a prison or place of confinement but still it be not easy to see how the prisoner could have be safely and conveniently detain during an adjournment of the hearing for some day without such place of confinement if it shall appear that no such place have be obtain direction to the marshal will be give to lose no time in the discharge of this duty
 i transmit to the senate the copy of a proclamation issue by i on the 18th instant in relation to these unexpected and deplorable occurrence in boston together with copy of instruction from the departments of war and navy relative to the general subject and i communicate also copy of telegraphic dispatch transmit from the department of state to the district attorney and marshal of the united states for the district of massachusetts and their answer thereto
 in regard to the last branch of the inquiry make by the resolution of the senate i have to observe that the constitution declare that the president shall take care that the law be faithfully execute and that he shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states and of the militia of the several states when call into the actual service of the united states and that congress shall have power to provide for call forth the militia to execute the law of the union suppress insurrection and repel invasion from which it appear that the army and navy be by the constitution place under the control of the executive and probably no legislation of congress could add to or diminish the power thus give but by increase or diminishing or abolish altogether the army and navy but not so with the militia the president can not call the militia into service even to execute the law or repel invasion but by the authority of act of congress pass for that purpose but when the militia be call into service in the manner prescribe by law then the constitution itself give the command to the president act on this principle congress by the act of february 28 1795 authorize the president to call forth the militia to repel invasion and suppress insurrection against a state government and to suppress combination against the law of the united states and cause the law to be faithfully execute but the act proceed to declare that whenever it may be necessary in the judgment of the president to use the military force thereby direct to be call forth the president shall forthwith by proclamation command such insurgent to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abode within a limited time these word be broad enough to require a proclamation in all case where militia be call out under that act whether to repel invasion or suppress an insurrection or to aid in execute the law this section have consequently create some doubt whether the militia could be call forth to aid in execute the law without a previous proclamation but yet the proclamation seem to be in word direct only against insurgent and to require they to disperse thereby imply not only an insurrection but an organize or at least an embody force such a proclamation in aid of the civil authority would often defeat the whole object by give such notice to person intend to be arrest that they would be enable to fly or secrete themselves the force may be want sometimes to make the arrest and also sometimes to protect the officer after it be make and to prevent a rescue i would therefore suggest that this section be modify by declare that nothing therein contain shall be construe to require any previous proclamation when the militia be call forth either to repel invasion to execute the law or suppress combination against they and that the president may make such call and place such militia under the control of any civil officer of the united states to aid he in execute the law or suppress such combination and while so employ they shall be pay by and subsist at the expense of the united states
 congress not probably advert to the difference between the militia and the regular army by the act of march 3 1807 authorize the president to use the land and naval force of the united states for the same purpose for which he might call forth the militia and subject to the same proclamation but the power of the president under the constitution as commander of the army and navy be general and his duty to see the law faithfully execute be general and positive and the act of 1807 ought not to be construe as evince any disposition in congress to limit or restrain this constitutional authority for great certainty however it may be well that congress should modify or explain this act in regard to its provision for the employment of the army and navy of the united states as well as that in regard to call forth the militia it be suppose not to be doubtful that all citizen whether enrol in the militia or not may be summon as member of the posse comitatus either by the marshal or a commissioner accord to law and that it be their duty to obey such summon but perhaps it may be doubt whether the marshal or a commissioner can summon as the posse comitatus an organize militia force act under its own appropriate officer without the consent of such officer this point may deserve the consideration of congress
 i use this occasion to repeat the assurance that so far as depend on i the law shall be faithfully execute and all forcible opposition to they suppress and to this end i be prepared to exercise whenever it may become necessary the power constitutionally vest in i to the full extent i be fully persuade that the great majority of the people of this country be warmly and strongly attach to the constitution the preservation of the union the just support of the government and the maintenance of the authority of law i be persuade that their earnest wish and the line of my constitutional duty entirely concur and i doubt not firmness moderation and prudence strengthen and animate by the general opinion of the people will prevent the repetition of occurrence disturb the public peace and reprobate by all good man
 april 25 1851- warn against participating in unlawful invasions of cuba
 whereas there be reason to believe that a military expedition be about to be fit out in the united states with intention to invade the island of cuba a colony of spain with which this country be at peace and
 whereas it be believe that this expedition be instigate and set on foot chiefly by foreigner who dare to make our shore the scene of their guilty and hostile preparation against a friendly power and seek by falsehood and misrepresentation to seduce our own citizen especially the young and inconsiderate into their wicked scheme an ungrateful return for the benefit confer upon they by this people in permit they to make our country an asylum from oppression and in flagrant abuse of the hospitality thus extend to they and
 whereas such expedition can only be regard as adventure for plunder and robbery and must meet the condemnation of the civilized world whilst they be derogatory to the character of our country in violation of the law of nation and expressly prohibit by our own our statute declare that if any person shall within the territory or jurisdiction of the united states begin or set on foot or provide or prepare the mean for any military expedition or enterprise to be carry on from thence against the territory or dominion of any foreign prince or state or of any colony district or people with whom the united states be at peace every person so offending shall be deem guilty of a high misdemeanor and shall be fine not exceed $ 3,000 and imprison not more than three year
 now therefore i have issue this my proclamation warn all person who shall connect themselves with any such enterprise or expedition in violation of our law and national obligation that they will thereby subject themselves to the heavy penalty denounce against such offense and will forfeit their claim to the protection of this government or any interference on their behalf no matter to what extremity they may be reduce in consequence of their illegal conduct and therefore i exhort all good citizen as they regard our national reputation as they respect their own law and the law of nation as they value the blessing of peace and the welfare of their country to discountenance and by all lawful mean prevent any such enterprise and i call upon every officer of this government civil or military to use all effort in his power to arrest for trial and punishment every such offender against the law of the country
 give under my hand the 25th day of april a. d. 1851 and the seventy fifth of the independence of the united states

fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives
 i congratulate you and our common constituency upon the favorable auspex under which you meet for your first session our country be at peace with all the world the agitation which for a time threaten to disturb the fraternal relation which make we one people be fast subsiding and a year of general prosperity and health have crown the nation with unusual blessing none can look back to the danger which be pass or forward to the bright prospect before we without feel a thrill of gratification at the same time that he must be impress with a grateful sense of our profound obligation to a beneficent providence whose paternal care be so manifest in the happiness of this highly favor land
 since the close of the last congress certain cubans and other foreigner resident in the united states who be more or less concerned in the previous invasion of cuba instead of be discourage by its failure have again abuse the hospitality of this country by make it the scene of the equipment of another military expedition against that possession of her catholic majesty in which they be countenance aid and join by citizen of the united states on receive intelligence that such design be entertain i lose no time in issue such instruction to the proper officer of the united states as seem to be call for by the occasion by the proclamation a copy of which be herewith submit i also warn those who might be in danger of be inveigle into this scheme of its unlawful character and of the penalty which they would incur for some time there be reason to hope that these measure have suffice to prevent any such attempt this hope however prove to be delusive very early in the morning of the 3d of august a steamer call the pampero depart from new orleans for cuba have on board upward of 400 armed man with evident intention to make war upon the authority of the island this expedition be set on foot in palpable violation of the law of the united states its leader be a spaniard and several of the chief officer and some other engage in it be foreigner the person compose it however be mostly citizen of the united states
 before the expedition set out and probably before it be organize a slight insurrectionary movement which appear to have be soon suppress have take place in the eastern quarter of cuba the importance of this movement be unfortunately so much exaggerated in the account of it publish in this country that these adventurer seem to have be lead to believe that the creole population of the island not only desire to throw off the authority of the mother country but have resolve upon that step and have begin a well concert enterprise for effect it the person engage in the expedition be generally young and ill informed the steamer in which they embark leave new orleans stealthily and without a clearance after touch at key west she proceed to the coast of cuba and on the night between the 11th and 12th of august land the person on board at playtas within about 20 league of havana
 the main body of they proceed to and take possession of an inland village 6 league distant leave other to follow in charge of the baggage as soon as the mean of transportation could be obtain the latter having take up their line of march to connect themselves with the main body and having proceed about 4 league into the country be attack on the morning of the 13th by a body of spanish troop and a bloody conflict ensue after which they retreat to the place of disembarkation where about 50 of they obtain boat and reembarke therein they be however intercept among the key near the shore by a spanish steamer cruising on the coast capture and carry to havana and after be examine before a military court be sentence to be publicly execute and the sentence be carry into effect on the 16th of august
 on receive information of what have occur commodore foxhall a. parker be instruct to proceed in the steam frigate saranac to havana and inquire into the charge against the person execute the circumstance under which they be take and whatsoever refer to their trial and sentence copy of the instruction from the department of state to he and of his letter to that department be herewith submit
 accord to the record of the examination the prisoner all admit the offense charge against they of be hostile invader of the island at the time of their trial and execution the main body of the invader be still in the field make war upon the spanish authority and spanish subject after the lapse of some day be overcome by the spanish troop they disperse on the 24th of august lopez their leader be capture some day after and execute on the 1st of september many of his remain follower be kill or die of hunger and fatigue and the rest be make prisoner of these none appear to have be try or execute several of they be pardon upon application of their friend and other and the rest about 160 in number be send to spain of the final disposition make of these we have no official information
 such be the melancholy result of this illegal and ill fate expedition thus thoughtless young man have be induce by false and fraudulent representation to violate the law of their country through rash and unfounded expectation of assist to accomplish political revolution in other state and have lose their life in the undertaking too severe a judgment can hardly be pass by the indignant sense of the community upon those who be well inform themselves have yet lead away the ardor of youth and an ill direct love of political liberty the correspondence between this government and that of spain relate to this transaction be herewith communicate
 although these offender against the law have forfeit the protection of their country yet the government may so far as consistent with its obligation to other country and its fix purpose to maintain and enforce the law entertain sympathy for their unoffending family and friend as well as a feeling of compassion for themselves accordingly no proper effort have be spare and none will be spare to procure the release of such citizen of the united states engage in this unlawful enterprise as be now in confinement in spain but it be to be hope that such interposition with the government of that country may not be consider as afford any ground of expectation that the government of the united states will hereafter feel itself under any obligation of duty to intercede for the liberation or pardon of such person as be flagrant offender against the law of nation and the law of the united states these law must be execute if we desire to maintain our respectability among the nation of the earth it behoove we to enforce steadily and sternly the neutrality act pass by congress and to follow as far as may be the violation of those act with condign punishment
 but what give a peculiar criminality to this invasion of cuba be that under the lead of spanish subject and with the aid of citizen of the united states it have its origin with many in motive of cupidity money be advance by individual probably in considerable amount to purchase cuban bond as they have be call issue by lopez sell doubtless at a very large discount and for the payment of which the public land and public property of cuba of whatever kind and the fiscal resource of the people and government of that island from whatever source to be derive be pledge as well as the good faith of the government expect to be establish all these mean of payment it be evident be only to be obtain by a process of bloodshed war and revolution none will deny that those who set on foot military expedition against foreign state by mean like these be far more culpable than the ignorant and the necessitous whom they induce to go forth as the ostensible party in the proceeding these originator of the invasion of cuba seem to have determine with coolness and system upon an undertaking which should disgrace their country violate its law and put to hazard the life of ill inform and deluded man you will consider whether further legislation be necessary to prevent the perpetration of such offense in future
 no individual have a right to hazard the peace of the country or to violate its law upon vague notion of alter or reform government in other state this principle be not only reasonable in itself and in accordance with public law but be ingraft into the code of other nation as well as our own but while such be the sentiment of this government it may be add that every independent nation must be presume to be able to defend its possession against unauthorized individual band together to attack they the government of the united states at all time since its establishment have abstain and have seek to restrain the citizen of the country from enter into controversy between other power and to observe all the duty of neutrality at an early period of the government in the administration of washington several law be pass for this purpose the main provision of these law be reenact by the act of april 1818 by which amongst other thing it be declare that--
 if any person shall within the territory or jurisdiction of the united states begin or set on foot or provide or prepare the mean for any military expedition or enterprise to be carry on from thence against the territory or dominion of any foreign prince or state or of any colony district or people with whom the united states be at peace every person so offending shall be deem guilty of a high misdemeanor and shall be fine not exceed $ 3,000 and imprison not more than three year
 and this law have be execute and enforce to the full extent of the power of the government from that day to this
 in proclaim and adhere to the doctrine of neutrality and nonintervention the united states have not follow the lead of other civilized nation they have take the lead themselves and have be follow by other this be admit by one of the most eminent of modern british statesman who say in parliament while a minister of the crown that if he wish for a guide in a system of neutrality he should take that lay down by america in the day of washington and the secretaryship of jefferson and we see in fact that the act of congress of 1818 be follow the succeed year by an act of the parliament of england substantially the same in its general provision up to that time there have be no similar law in england except certain highly penal statute pass in the reign of george ii prohibit english subject from enlist in foreign service the avow object of which statute be that foreign army raise for the purpose of restore the house of stuart to the throne should not be strengthen by recruit from england herself
 all must see that difficulty may arise in carry the law refer to into execution in a country now have 3,000 or 4,000 mile of seacoast with an infinite number of port and harbor and small inlet from some of which unlawful expeditious may suddenly set forth without the knowledge of government against the possession of foreign state
 friendly relation with all but entangle alliance with none have long be a maxim with we our true mission be not to propagate our opinion or impose upon other country our form of government by artifice or force but to teach by example and show by our success moderation and justice the blessing of self government and the advantage of free institution let every people choose for itself and make and alter its political institution to suit its own condition and convenience but while we avow and maintain this neutral policy ourselves we be anxious to see the same forbearance on the part of other nation whose form of government be different from our own the deep interest which we feel in the spread of liberal principle and the establishment of free government and the sympathy with which we witness every struggle against oppression forbid that we should be indifferent to a case in which the strong arm of a foreign power be invoke to stifle public sentiment and repress the spirit of freedom in any country
 the government of great britain and france have issue order to their naval commander on the west india station to prevent by force if necessary the landing of adventurer from any nation on the island of cuba with hostile intent the copy of a memorandum of a conversation on this subject between the charge&#39 d&#39;affaire of her britannic majesty and the acting secretary of state and of a subsequent note of the former to the department of state be herewith submit together with a copy of a note of the acting secretary of state to the minister of the french republic and of the reply of the latter on the same subject these paper will acquaint you with the ground of this interposition of two lead commercial power of europe and with the apprehension which this government could not fail to entertain that such interposition if carry into effect might lead to abuse in derogation of the maritime right of the united states the maritime right of the united states be found on a firm secure and well define basis they stand upon the ground of national independence and public law and will be maintain in all their full and just extent the principle which this government have heretofore solemnly announce it still adhere to and will maintain under all circumstance and at all hazard that principle be that in every regularly document merchant vessel the crew who navigate it and those on board of it will find their protection in the flag which be over they no american ship can be allow to be visit or search for the purpose of ascertain the character of individual on board nor can there be allow any watch by the vessel of any foreign nation over american vessel on the coast of the united states or the sea adjacent thereto it will be see by the last communication from the british charge&#39 d&#39;affaire to the department of state that he be authorize to assure the secretary of state that every care will be take that in execute the preventive measure against the expedition which the united states government itself have denounce as not be entitle to the protection of any government no interference shall take place with the lawful commerce of any nation

 it be earnestly to be hope that the difference which have for some time past be pende between the government of the french republic and that of the sandwich islands may be peaceably and durably adjust so as to secure the independence of those island long before the event which have of late impart so much importance to the possession of the united states on the pacific we acknowledge the independence of the hawaiian government this government be first in take that step and several of the lead power of europe immediately follow we be influence in this measure by the exist and prospective importance of the island as a place of refuge and refreshment for our vessel engage in the whale fishery and by the consideration that they lie in the course of the great trade which must at no distant day be carry on between the western coast of north america and eastern asia
 we be also influence by a desire that those island should not pass under the control of any other great maritime state but should remain in an independent condition and so be accessible and useful to the commerce of all nation i need not say that the importance of these consideration have be greatly enhance by the sudden and vast development which the interest of the united states have attain in california and oregon and the policy heretofore adopt in regard to those island will be steadily pursue
 it be gratify not only to those who consider the commercial interest of nation but also to all who favor the progress of knowledge and the diffusion of religion to see a community emerge from a savage state and attain such a degree of civilization in those distant sea it be much to be deplore that the internal tranquillity of the mexican republic should again be seriously disturb for since the peace between that republic and the united states it have enjoy such comparative repose that the most favorable anticipation for the future might with a degree of confidence have be indulge these however have be thwart by the recent outbreak in the state of tamaulipas on the right bank of the rio bravo having receive information that person from the united states have take part in the insurrection and apprehend that their example might be follow by other i cause order to be issue for the purpose of prevent any hostile expedition against mexico from be set on foot in violation of the law of the united states i likewise issue a proclamation upon the subject a copy of which be herewith lay before you this appear to be render imperative by the obligation of treaty and the general duty of good neighborhood
 in my last annual message i inform congress that citizen of the united states have undertake the connection of the two ocean by mean of a railroad across the isthmus of tehuantepec under a grant of the mexican government to a citizen of that republic and that this enterprise would probably be prosecute with energy whenever mexico should consent to such stipulation with the government of the united states as should impart a feeling of security to those who should invest their property in the enterprise a convention between the two government for the accomplishment of that end have be ratify by this government and only await the decision of the congress and the executive of that republic
 some unexpected difficulty and delay have arise in the ratification of that convention by mexico but it be to be presume that her decision will be govern by just and enlightened view as well of the general importance of the object as of her own interest and obligation
 in negotiate upon this important subject this government have have in view one and only one object that object have be and be the construction or attainment of a passage from ocean to ocean the short and the good for traveler and merchandise and equally open to all the world it have seek to obtain no territorial acquisition nor any advantage peculiar to itself and it would see with the great regret that mexico should oppose any obstacle to the accomplishment of an enterprise which promise so much convenience to the whole commercial world and such eminent advantage to mexico herself impressed with these sentiment and these conviction the government will continue to exert all proper effort to bring about the necessary arrangement with the republic of mexico for the speedy completion of the work for some month past the republic of nicaragua have be the theater of one of those civil convulsion from which the cause of free institution and the general prosperity and social progress of the states of central america have so often and so severely suffer until quiet shall have be restore and a government apparently stable shall have be organize no advance can prudently be make in dispose of the question pende between the two country
 i be happy to announce that an interoceanic communication from the mouth of the st. john to the pacific have be so far accomplish as that passenger have actually traverse it and merchandise have be transport over it and when the canal shall have be complete accord to the original plan the mean of communication will be far improve it be understand that a considerable part of the railroad across the isthmus of panama have be complete and that the mail and passenger will in future be convey thereon whichever of the several route between the two ocean may ultimately prove most eligible for traveler to and from the different states on the atlantic and gulf of mexico and our coast on the pacific there be little reason to doubt that all of they will be useful to the public and will liberally reward that individual enterprise by which alone they have be or be expect to be carry into effect peace have be conclude between the contend party in the island of st. domingo and it be hope upon a durable basis such be the extent of our commercial relation with that island that the united states can not fail to feel a strong interest in its tranquillity the office of commissioner to china remain unfilled several person have be appoint and the place have be offer to other all of whom have decline its acceptance on the ground of the inadequacy of the compensation the annual allowance by law be $ 6,000 and there be no provision for any outfit i earnestly recommend the consideration of this subject to congress our commerce with china be highly important and be become more and more so in consequence of the increase intercourse between our port on the pacific coast and eastern asia china be understand to be a country in which living be very expensive and i know of no reason why the american commissioner send thither should not be place in regard to compensation on an equal footing with minister who represent this country at the courts of europe
 by reference to the report of the secretary of the treasury it will be see that the aggregate receipt for the last fiscal year amount to $ 52,312,979.87 which with the balance in the treasury on the 1st july 1850 give as the available mean for the year the sum of $ 58,917,524.36
 the total expenditure for the same period be $ 48,005,878.68 the total import for the year end june 30 1851 be $ 215,725,995 of which there be in specie $ 4,967,901 the export for the same period be $ 217,517,130 of which there be of domestic product $ 178,546,555 foreign good reexporte $ 9,738,695 specie $ 29,231,880
 since the 1st of december last the payment in cash on account of the public debt exclusive of interest have amount to $ 7,501,456.56 which however include the sum of $ 3,242,400 pay under the twelfth article of the treaty with mexico and the further sum of $ 2,591,213.45 be the amount of award to american citizen under the late treaty with mexico for which the issue of stock be authorize but which be pay in cash from the treasury
 the public debt on the 20th ultimo exclusive of the stock authorize to be issue to texas by the act of 9th september 1850 be $ 62,560,395.26
 the receipt for the next fiscal year be estimate at $ 51,800,000 which with the probable unappropriated balance in the treasury on the 30th june next will give as the probable available mean for that year the sum of $ 63,258,743.09
 it have be deem proper in view of the large expenditure consequent upon the acquisition of territory from mexico that the estimate for the next fiscal year should be lay before congress in such manner as to distinguish the expenditure so require from the otherwise ordinary demand upon the treasury
 the total expenditure for the next fiscal year be estimate at $ 42,892,299.19 of which there be require for the ordinary purpose of the government other than those consequent upon the acquisition of our new territory and deduct the payment on account of the public debt the sum of $ 33,343,198.08 and for the purpose connect directly or indirectly with those territory and in the fulfillment of the obligation of the government contract in consequence of their acquisition the sum of $ 9,549,101.11
 if the view of the secretary of the treasury in reference to the expenditure require for these territory shall be meet by correspond action on the part of congress and appropriation make in accordance therewith there will be an estimate unappropriated balance in the treasury on the 30th june 1853 of $ 20,366,443.90 wherewith to meet that portion of the public debt due on the 1st of july following amount to $ 6,237,931.35 as well as any appropriation which may be make beyond the estimate
 in thus refer to the estimated expenditure on account of our newly acquire territory i may express the hope that congress will concur with i in the desire that a liberal course of policy may be pursue toward they and that every obligation express or imply enter into in consequence of their acquisition shall be fulfil by the most liberal appropriation for that purpose
 the value of our domestic export for the last fiscal year as compare with those of the previous year exhibit an increase of $ 43,646,322 at first view this condition of our trade with foreign nation would seem to present the most flattering hope of its future prosperity an examination of the detail of our export however will show that the increase value of our export for the last fiscal year be to be find in the high price of cotton which prevail during the first half of that year which price have since decline about one half
 the value of our export of breadstuff and provision which it be suppose the incentive of a low tariff and large importation from abroad would have greatly augment have fall from $ 68,701,921 in 1847 to $ 26,051,373 in 1850 and to $ 21,948,653 in 1851 with a strong probability amount almost to a certainty of a still further reduction in the current year
 the aggregate value of rice export during the last fiscal year as compare with the previous year also exhibit a decrease amount to $ 460,917 which with a decline in the value of the export of tobacco for the same period make an aggregate decrease in these two article of $ 1,156,751
 the policy which dictate a low rate of duty on foreign merchandise it be think by those who promote and establish it would tend to benefit the farming population of this country by increase the demand and raise the price of agricultural product in foreign market
 the foregoing fact however seem to show incontestably that no such result have follow the adoption of this policy on the contrary notwithstanding the repeal of the restrictive corn law in england the foreign demand for the product of the american farmer have steadily decline since the short crop and consequent famine in a portion of europe have be happily replace by full crop and comparative abundance of food
 it will be see by recur to the commercial statistic for the past year that the value of our domestic export have be increase in the single item of raw cotton by $ 40,000,000 over the value of that export for the year precede this be not due to any increase general demand for that article but to the short crop of the precede year which create an increase demand and an augmented price for the crop of last year should the cotton crop now go forward to market be only equal in quantity to that of the year precede and be sell at the present price then there would be a fall off in the value of our export for the present fiscal year of at least $ 40,000,000 compare with the amount export for the year end 30th june 1851
 the production of gold in california for the past year seem to promise a large supply of that metal from that quarter for some time to come this large annual increase of the currency of the world must be attend with its usual result these have be already partially disclose in the enhancement of price and a rise spirit of speculation and adventure tend to overtrade as well at home as abroad unless some salutary check shall be give to these tendency it be to be fear that importation of foreign good beyond a healthy demand in this country will lead to a sudden drain of the precious metal from we bring with it as it have do in former time the most disastrous consequence to the business and capital of the american people
 the export of specie to liquidate our foreign debt during the past fiscal year have be $ 24,963,979 over the amount of specie import the export of specie during the first quarter of the present fiscal year have be $ 14,651,827 should specie continue to be export at this rate for the remain three quarter of this year it will drain from our metallic currency during the year end 30th june 1852 the enormous amount of $ 58,607,308
 in the present prosperous condition of the national finance it will become the duty of congress to consider the good mode of pay off the public debt if the present and anticipated surplus in the treasury should not be absorb by appropriation of an extraordinary character this surplus should be employ in such way and under such restriction as congress may enact in extinguish the outstanding debt of the nation
 by reference to the act of congress approve 9th september 1850 it will be see that in consideration of certain concession by the state of texas it be provide that--
 the united states shall pay to the state of texas the sum of $ 10,000,000 in a stock bear 5 per cent interest and redeemable at the end of fourteen year the interest payable half yearly at the treasury of the united states
 in the same section of the law it be further provided--
 that no more than five million of say stock shall be issue until the creditor of the state hold bond and other certificate of stock of texas for which duty on import be specially pledge shall first file at the treasury of the united states release of all claim against the united states for or on account of say bond or certificate in such form as shall be prescribe by the secretary of the treasury and approve by the president of the united states
 the form of release thus provide for have be prescribe by the secretary of the treasury and approve it have be publish in all the lead newspaper in the commercial city of the united states and all person hold claim of the kind specify in the forego proviso be require to file their release in the form thus prescribe in the treasury of the united states on or before the 1st day of october 1851 although this publication have be continue from the 25th day of march 1851 yet up to the 1st of october last comparatively few release have be file by the creditor of texas
 the authority of the state of texas at the request of the secretary of the treasury have furnish a schedule of the public debt of that state create prior to her admission into the union with a copy of the law under which each class be contract i have from the document furnish by the state of texas determine the class of claim which in my judgment fall within the provision of the act of congress of the 9th of september 1850
 on be officially inform of the acceptance by texas of the proposition contain in the act refer to i cause the stock to be prepare and the five million which be to be issue unconditionally bear an interest of 5 per cent from the 1st day of january 1851 have be for some time ready to be deliver to the state of texas the authority of texas up to the present time have not authorize anyone to receive this stock and it remain in the treasury department subject to the order of texas the release require by law to be deposit in the treasury not having be file there the remain five million have not be issue this last amount of the stock will be withhold from texas until the condition upon which it be to be deliver shall be comply with by the creditor of that state unless congress shall otherwise direct by a modification of the law
 in my last annual message to which i respectfully refer i state briefly the reason which induce i to recommend a modification of the present tariff by convert the ad valorem into a specific duty wherever the article import be of such a character as to permit it and that such a discrimination should be make in favor of the industrial pursuit of our own country as to encourage home production without exclude foreign competition
 the numerous fraud which continue to be practice upon the revenue by false invoice and undervaluation constitute an unanswerable reason for adopt specific instead of ad valorem duty in all case where the nature of the commodity do not forbid it a striking illustration of these fraud will be exhibit in the report of the secretary of the treasury show the custom house valuation of article import under a former law subject to specific duty when there be no inducement to undervaluation and the custom house valuation of the same article under the present system of ad valorem duty so greatly reduce as to leave no doubt of the existence of the most flagrant abuse under the exist law this practical evasion of the present law combine with the languish condition of some of the great interest of the country cause by over importation and consequent depressed price and with the failure in obtain a foreign market for our increase surplus of breadstuff and provision have induce i again to recommend a modification of the exist tariff the report of the secretary of the interior which accompany this communication will present a condense statement of the operation of that important department of the government
 it will be see that the cash sale of the public land exceed those of the precede year and that there be reason to anticipate a still further increase notwithstanding the large donation which have be make to many of the states and the liberal grant to individual as a reward for military service this fact furnish very gratifying evidence of the grow wealth and prosperity of our country
 suitable measure have be adopt for commence the survey of the public land in california and oregon survey party have be organize and some progress have be make in establish the principal base and meridian line but further legislation and additional appropriation will be necessary before the proper subdivision can be make and the general land system extend over those remote part of our territory
 on the 3d of march last an act be pass provide for the appointment of three commissioner to settle private land claim in california three person be immediately appoint all of whom however decline accept the office in consequence of the inadequacy of the compensation other be promptly select who for the same reason also decline and it be not until late in the season that the service of suitable person could be secure a majority of the commissioner convene in this city on the 10th of september last when detailed instruction be give to they in regard to their duty their first meeting for the transaction of business will be hold in san francisco on the 8th day of the present month
 i have think it proper to refer to these fact not only to explain the cause of the delay in fill the commission but to call your attention to the propriety of increase the compensation of the commissioner the office be one of great labor and responsibility and the compensation should be such as to command man of a high order of talent and the most unquestionable integrity
 the proper disposal of the mineral land of california be a subject surround by great difficulty in my last annual message i recommend the survey and sale of they in small parcel under such restriction as would effectually guard against monopoly and speculation but upon further information and in deference to the opinion of person familiar with the subject i be inclined to change that recommendation and to advise that they be permit to remain as at present a common field open to the enterprise and industry of all our citizen until further experience shall have develop the good policy to be ultimately adopt in regard to they it be safe to suffer the inconvenience that now exist for a short period than by premature legislation to fasten on the country a system found in error which may place the whole subject beyond the future control of congress
 the agricultural land should however be survey and bring into market with as little delay as possible that the title may become settle and the inhabitant stimulate to make permanent improvement and enter on the ordinary pursuit of life to effect these object it be desirable that the necessary provision be make by law for the establishment of land office in california and oregon and for the efficient prosecution of the survey at an early day
 some difficulty have occur in organize the territorial government of new mexico and utah and when more accurate information shall be obtain of the cause a further communication will be make on that subject
 in my last annual communication to congress i recommend the establishment of an agricultural bureau and i take this occasion again to invoke your favorable consideration of the subject
 agriculture may justly be regard as the great interest of our people four fifth of our active population be employ in the cultivation of the soil and the rapid expansion of our settlement over new territory be daily add to the number of those engage in that vocation justice and sound policy therefore alike require that the government should use all the mean authorize by the constitution to promote the interest and welfare of that important class of our fellow citizen and yet it be a singular fact that whilst the manufacturing and commercial interest have engage the attention of congress during a large portion of every session and our statute abound in provision for their protection and encouragement little have yet be do directly for the advancement of agriculture it be time that this reproach to our legislation should be remove and i sincerely hope that the present congress will not close their labor without adopt efficient mean to supply the omission of those who have precede they
 an agricultural bureau charge with the duty of collect and disseminate correct information as to the good mode of cultivation and of the most effectual mean of preserve and restore the fertility of the soil and of procure and distribute seed and plant and other vegetable production with instruction in regard to the soil climate and treatment well adapt to their growth could not fail to be in the language of washington in his last annual message to congress a very cheap instrument of immense national benefit
 regard the act of congress approve 28th september 1850 grant bounty land to person who have be engage in the military service of the country as a great measure of national justice and munificence an anxious desire have be feel by the officer intrust with its immediate execution to give prompt effect to its provision all the mean within their control be therefore bring into requisition to expedite the adjudication of claim and i be gratified to be able to state that near 100,000 application have be consider and about 70,000 warrant issue within the short space of nine month if adequate provision be make by law to carry into effect the recommendation of the department it be confidently expect that before the close of the next fiscal year all who be entitle to the benefit of the act will have receive their warrant
 the secretary of the interior have suggest in his report various amendment of the law relate to pension and bounty land for the purpose of more effectually guard against abuse and fraud on the government to all of which i invite your particular attention the large accession to our indian population consequent upon the acquisition of new mexico and california and the extension of our settlement into utah and oregon have give increase interest and importance to our relation with the aboriginal race no material change have take place within the last year in the condition and prospect of the indian tribe who reside in the northwestern territory and west of the mississippi river we be at peace with all of they and it will be a source of pleasure to you to learn that they be gradually advance in civilization and the pursuit of social life
 along the mexican frontier and in california and oregon there have be occasional manifestation of unfriendly feeling and some depredation commit i be satisfied however that they result more from the destitute and starve condition of the indians than from any settle hostility toward the white as the settlement of our citizen progress toward they the game upon which they mainly rely for subsistence be drive off or destroy and the only alternative leave to they be starvation or plunder it become we to consider in view of this condition of thing whether justice and humanity as well as an enlightened economy do not require that instead of seek to punish they for offense which be the result of our own policy toward they we should not provide for their immediate want and encourage they to engage in agriculture and to rely on their labor instead of the chase for the mean of support
 various important treaty have be negotiate with different tribe during the year by which their title to large and valuable tract of country have be extinguish all of which will at the proper time be submit to the senate for ratification
 the joint commission under the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo have be actively engage in run and mark the boundary line between the united states and mexico it be state in the last annual report of the secretary of the interior that the initial point on the pacific and the point of junction of the gila with the colorado river have be determine and the intervene line about 150 mile in length run and mark by temporary monument since that time a monument of marble have be erect at the initial point and permanent landmark of iron have be place at suitable distance along the line
 the initial point on the rio grande have also be fix by the commissioner at latitude 32 degree 22&#39 and at the date of the last communication the survey of the line have be make thence westward about 150 mile to the neighborhood of the copper mine the commission on our part be at first organize on a scale which experience prove to be unwieldy and attend with unnecessary expense order have therefore be issue for the reduction of the number of person employ within the small limit consistent with the safety of those engage in the service and the prompt and efficient execution of their important duty
 return have be receive from all the officer engage in take the census in the states and territories except california the superintendent employ to make the enumeration in that state have not yet make his full report from cause as he allege beyond his control this failure be much to be regret as it have prevent the secretary of the interior from make the decennial apportionment of representatives among the states as require by the act approve may 23 1850 it be hope however that the return will soon be receive and no time will then be lose in make the necessary apportionment and in transmit the certificate require by law
 the superintendent of the seventh census be diligently employ under the direction of the secretary of the interior in classifying and arrange in tabular form all the statistical information derive from the return of the marshal and it be believe that when the work shall be complete it will exhibit a more perfect view of the population wealth occupation and social condition of a great country than have ever be present to the world the value of such a work as the basis of enlightened legislation can hardly be overestimate and i earnestly hope that congress will lose no time in make the appropriation necessary to complete the classification and to publish the result in a style worthy of the subject and of our national character
 the want of a uniform fee bill prescribe the compensation to be allow district attorney clerk marshal and commissioner in civil and criminal case be the cause of much vexation injustice and complaint i would recommend a thorough revision of the law on the whole subject and the adoption of a tariff of fee which as far as practicable should be uniform and prescribe a specific compensation for every service which the officer may be require to perform this subject will be fully present in the report of the secretary of the interior in my last annual message i give briefly my reason for believe that you possess the constitutional power to improve the harbor of our great lakes and seacoast and the navigation of our principal river and recommend that appropriation should be make for complete such work as have already be commence and for commence such other as might seem to the wisdom of congress to be of public and general importance without repeat the reason then urge i deem it my duty again to call your attention to this important subject the work on many of the harbor be leave in an unfinished state and consequently expose to the action of the element which be fast destroy they great number of life and vast amount of property be annually lose for want of safe and convenient harbor on the lakes none but those who have be expose to that dangerous navigation can fully appreciate the importance of this subject the whole northwest appeal to you for relief and i trust their appeal will receive due consideration at your hand
 the same be in a measure true in regard to some of the harbor and inlet on the seacoast
 the unobstructed navigation of our large river be of equal importance our settlement be now extend to the source of the great river which empty into and form a part of the mississippi and the value of the public land in those region would be greatly enhance by free the navigation of those water from obstruction in view therefore of this great interest i deem it my duty again to urge upon congress to make such appropriation for these improvement as they may deem necessary
 the survey of the delta of the mississippi with a view to the prevention of the overflow that have prove so disastrous to that region of country have be nearly complete and the report thereof be now in course of preparation and will shortly be lay before you
 the protection of our southwestern frontier and of the adjacent mexican states against the indian tribe within our border have claim my earnest and constant attention congress having fail at the last session to adopt my recommendation that an additional regiment of mount man specially adapt to that service should be raise all that remain to be do be to make the good use of the mean at my disposal accordingly all the troop adapt to that service that could properly be spare from other quarter have be concentrate on that frontier and officer of high reputation select to command they a new arrangement of the military post have also be make whereby the troop be bring near to the mexican frontier and to the tribe they be intend to overawe
 sufficient time have not yet elapse to realize all the benefit that be expect to result from these arrangement but i have every reason to hope that they will effectually check their marauding expedition the nature of the country which furnish little for the support of an army and abound in place of refuge and concealment be remarkably well adapt to this predatory warfare and we can scarcely hope that any military force combine with the great vigilance can entirely suppress it
 by the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo we be bind to protect the territory of mexico against the incursion of the savage tribe within our border with equal diligence and energy as if the same be make within our territory or against our citizen i have endeavor to comply as far as possible with this provision of the treaty order have be give to the officer command on that frontier to consider the mexican territory and its inhabitant as equally with our own entitle to their protection and to make all their plan and arrangement with a view to the attainment of this object instruction have also be give to the indian commissioner and agent among these tribe in all treaty to make the clause design for the protection of our own citizen apply also to those of mexico i have no reason to doubt that these instruction have be fully carry into effect nevertheless it be probable that in spite of all our effort some of the neighboring states of mexico may have suffer as our own have from depredation by the indians
 to the difficulty of defend our own territory as above mention be superadde in defend that of mexico those that arise from its remoteness from the fact that we have no right to station our troop within her limit and that there be no efficient military force on the mexican side to cooperate with our own
 so long as this shall continue to be the case the number and activity of our troop will rather increase than diminish the evil as the indians will naturally turn toward that country where they encounter the least resistance yet these troop be necessary to subdue they and to compel they to make and observe treaty until this shall have be do neither country will enjoy any security from their attack
 the indians in california who have previously appear of a peaceable character and dispose to cultivate the friendship of the white have recently commit several act of hostility as a large portion of the reenforcement send to the mexican frontier be draw from the pacific the military force now station there be consider entirely inadequate to its defense it can not be increase however without an increase of the army and i again recommend that measure as indispensable to the protection of the frontier
 i invite your attention to the suggestion on this subject and on other connect with his department in the report of the secretary of war the appropriation for the support of the army during the current fiscal year end 30th june next be reduce far below the estimate submit by the department the consequence of this reduction be a considerable deficiency to which i invite your early attention the expenditure of that department for the year end 30th june last be $ 9,060,268.58 the estimate for the year commencing 1st july next and end june 30 1853 be $ 7,898,775.83 show a reduction of $ 1,161,492.75 the board of commissioner to whom the management of the affair of the military asylum create by the act of 3d march last be intrust have select a site for the establishment of an asylum in the vicinity of this city which have be approve by i subject to the production of a satisfactory title
 the report of the secretary of the navy will exhibit the condition of the public service under the supervision of that department our naval force afloat during the present year have be actively and usefully employ in give protection to our widely extend and increase commerce and interest in the various quarter of the globe and our flag have everywhere afford the security and receive the respect inspire by the justice and liberality of our intercourse and the dignity and power of the nation

 the reduction of postage under the act of march last do not take effect until the commencement of the present fiscal year the account for the first quarter under the operation of the reduce rate will not be settle before january next and no reliable estimate of the receipt for the present year can yet be make it be believe however that they will fall far short of those of the last year the surplus of the revenue now on hand be however so large that no further appropriation from the treasury in aid of the revenue of the department be require for the current fiscal year but an additional appropriation for the year end june 30 1853 will probably be find necessary when the receipt of the first two quarter of the fiscal year be fully ascertain
 in his last annual report the postmaster general recommend a reduction of postage to rate which he deem as low as could be prudently adopt unless congress be prepared to appropriate from the treasury for the support of the department a sum more than equivalent to the mail service perform by it for the government the recommendation of the postmaster general in respect to letter postage except on letter from and to california and oregon be substantially adopt by the last congress he now recommend adherence to the present letter rate and advise against a further reduction until justify by the revenue of the department

 the public statute of the united states have now be accumulate for more than sixty year and intersperse with private act be scatter through numerous volume and from the cost of the whole have become almost inaccessible to the great mass of the community they also exhibit much of the incongruity and imperfection of hasty legislation as it seem to be generally concede that there be no common law of the united states to supply the defect of their legislation it be most important that that legislation should be as perfect as possible define every power intend to be confer every crime intend to be make punishable and prescribe the punishment to be inflict in addition to some particular case speak of more at length the whole criminal code be now lamentably defective some offense be imperfectly describe and other be entirely omit so that flagrant crime may be commit with impunity the scale of punishment be not in all case graduate accord to the degree and nature of the offense and be often render more unequal by the different mode of imprisonment or penitentiary confinement in the different states
 many law of a permanent character have be introduce into appropriation bill and it be often difficult to determine whether the particular clause expire with the temporary act of which it be a part or continue in force it have also frequently happen that enactment and provision of law have be introduce into bill with the title or general subject of which they have little or no connection or relation in this mode of legislation so many enactment have be heap upon each other and often with but little consideration that in many instance it be difficult to search out and determine what be the law
 the government of the united states be emphatically a government of write law the statute should therefore as far as practicable not only be make accessible to all but be express in language so plain and simple as to be understand by all and arrange in such method as to give perspicuity to every subject many of the states have revise their public act with great and manifest benefit and i recommend that provision be make by law for the appointment of a commission to revise the public statute of the united states arrange they in order supply deficiency correct incongruity simplify their language and report they to congress for its action
 an act of congress approve 30th september 1850 contain a provision for the extension of the capitol accord to such plan as might be approve by the president and appropriate $ 100,000 to be expend under his direction by such architect as he should appoint to execute the same on examine the various plan which have be submit by different architect in pursuance of an advertisement by a committee of the senate no one be find to be entirely satisfactory and it be therefore deem advisable to combine and adopt the advantage of several
 the great object to be accomplish be to make such an addition as would afford ample and convenient hall for the deliberation of the two houses of congress with sufficient accommodation for spectator and suitable apartment for the committee and officer of the two branch of the legislature it be also desirable not to mar the harmony and beauty of the present structure which as a speciman of architecture be so universally admired keep these object in view i conclude to make the addition by wing detach from the present building yet connect with it by corridor this mode of enlargement will leave the present capitol uninjured and afford great advantage for ventilation and the admission of light and will enable the work to progress without interrupt the deliberation of congress to carry this plan into effect i have appoint an experienced and competent architect the corner stone be lay on the 4th day of july last with suitable ceremony since which time the work have advance with commendable rapidity and the foundation of both wing be now nearly complete
 i again commend to your favorable regard the interest of the district of columbia and deem it only necessary to remind you that although its inhabitant have no voice in the choice of representatives in congress they be not the less entitled to a just and liberal consideration in your legislation my opinion on this subject be more fully express in my last annual communication
 other subject be bring to the attention of congress in my last annual message to which i would respectfully refer but there be one of more than ordinary interest to which i again invite your special attention i allude to the recommendation for the appointment of a commission to settle private claim against the united states justice to individual as well as to the government imperatively demand that some more convenient and expeditious mode than an appeal to congress should be adopt
 it be deeply to be regret that in several instance officer of the government in attempt to execute the law for the return of fugitive from labor have be openly resist and their effort frustrate and defeat by lawless and violent mob that in one case such resistance result in the death of an estimable citizen and in other serious injury ensue to those officer and to individual who be use their endeavor to sustain the law prosecution have be institute against the allege offender so far as they could be identify and be still pende i have regard it as my duty in these case to give all aid legally in my power to the enforcement of the law and i shall continue to do so wherever and whenever their execution may be resist
 the act of congress for the return of fugitive from labor be one require and demand by the express word of the constitution the constitution declare that-- no person hold to service or labor in one state under the law thereof escape into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharge from such service or labor but shall be deliver up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due this constitutional provision be equally obligatory upon the legislative the executive and judicial department of the government and upon every citizen of the united states
 congress however must from necessity first act upon the subject by prescribe the proceeding necessary to ascertain that the person be a fugitive and the mean to be use for his restoration to the claimant this be do by an act pass during the first term of president washington which be amend by that enact by the last congress and it now remain for the executive and judicial department to take care that these law be faithfully execute this injunction of the constitution be as peremptory and as binding as any other it stand exactly on the same foundation as that clause which provide for the return of fugitive from justice or that which declare that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be pass or that which provide for an equality of taxation accord to the census or the clause declare that all duty shall be uniform throughout the united states or the important provision that the trial of all crime shall be by jury these several article and clause of the constitution all rest on the same authority must stand or fall together some objection have be urge against the detail of the act for the return of fugitive from labor but it be worthy of remark that the main opposition be aim against the constitution itself and proceed from person and class of person many of whom declare their wish to see that constitution overturn they avow their hostility to any law which shall give full and practical effect to this requirement of the constitution fortunately the number of these person be comparatively small and be believe to be daily diminishing but the issue which they present be one which involve the supremacy and even the existence of the constitution
 case have heretofore arise in which individual have deny the bind authority of act of congress and even states have propose to nullify such act upon the ground that the constitution be the supreme law of the land and that those act of congress be repugnant to that instrument but nullification be now aim not so much against particular law as be inconsistent with the constitution as against the constitution itself and it be not to be disguise that a spirit exist and have be actively at work to rend asunder this union which be our cherish inheritance from our revolutionary father
 in my last annual message i state that i consider the series of measure which have be adopt at the previous session in reference to the agitation grow out of the territorial and slavery question as a final settlement in principle and substance of the dangerous and exciting subject which they embrace and i recommend adherence to the adjustment establish by those measure until time and experience should demonstrate the necessity of further legislation to guard against evasion or abuse i be not induce to make this recommendation because i think those measure perfect for no human legislation can be perfect wide difference and jarring opinion can only be reconcile by yield something on all side and this result have be reach after an angry conflict of many month in which one part of the country be array against another and violent convulsion seem to be imminent look at the interest of the whole country i feel it to be my duty to seize upon this compromise as the good that could be obtain amid conflict interest and to insist upon it as a final settlement to be adhere to by all who value the peace and welfare of the country a year have now elapse since that recommendation be make to that recommendation i still adhere and i congratulate you and the country upon the general acquiescence in these measure of peace which have be exhibit in all part of the republic and not only be there this general acquiescence in these measure but the spirit of conciliation which have be manifest in regard to they in all part of the country have remove doubt and uncertainty in the mind of thousand of good man concern the durability of our popular institution and give renew assurance that our liberty and our union may subsist together for the benefit of this and all succeed generation

politically hold the follow pathetic and beautiful language which i adopt partly because such high and exclusive eulogy originate with a political friend might offend good taste but chiefly because i could not in any language of my own so well express my thoughts---"alas who can realize that henry clay be dead who can realize that never again that majestic form shall rise in the council chamber of his country to beat back the storm of anarchy which may threaten or pour the oil of peace upon the troubled billow as they rage and menace around who can realize that the working of that mighty mind have cease that the throbbing of that gallant heart be still that the mighty sweep of that graceful arm will be feel no more and the magic of that eloquent tongue which spake as spake no other tongue besides hush hush forever who can realize that freedom 's champion the champion of a civilized world and of all tongue and kindred and people have indeed fall alas in those dark hour which as they come in the history of all nation must come in ours those hour of peril and dread which our land have experience and which she may be call to experience again to whom now may her people look up for that council counsel and advice which only wisdom and experience and patriotism can give and which only the undoubting confidence of a nation will receive perchance in the whole circle of the great and gifted of our land there remain but one on whose shoulder the mighty mantle of the depart statesman may fall one while we now write be doubtless pour his tear over the bier of his brother and his friend brother friend ever yet in political sentiment as far apart as party could make they ah it be at time like these that the petty distinction of mere party disappear we see only the great the grand the noble feature of the depart statesman and we do not even beg permission to bow at his foot and mingle our tear with those who have ever be his political adherent we do not beg this permission we claim it as a right though we feel it as a privilege henry clay belong to his country to the world mere party can not claim man like he his career have be national his fame have fill the earth his memory will endure to ` the last syllable of record time '"henry clay be dead!---he breathe his last on yesterday at twenty minute after eleven in his chamber at washington to those who follow his lead in public affair it more appropriately belong to pronounce his eulogy and pay specific honor to the memory of the illustrious dead but all americans may show the grief which his death inspire for his character and fame be national property as on a question of liberty he know no north no south no east no west but only the union which hold they all in its sacred circle so now his countryman will know no grief that be not as wide spread as the bound of the confederacy the career of henry clay be a public career from his youth he have be devote to the public service at a period too in the world 's history justly regard as a remarkable era in human affair he witness in the beginning the throe of the french revolution he see the rise and fall of napoleon he be call upon to legislate for america and direct her policy when all europe be the battle field of contend dynasty and when the struggle for supremacy imperille the right of all neutral nation his voice speak war and peace in the contest with great britain "when greece rise against the turks and strike for liberty his name be mingle with the battle cry of freedom when south america throw off the thraldom of spain his speech be read at the head of her army by bolivar his name have be and will continue to be hallow in two hemisphere for it is---`one of the few the immortal namesthat be not bear to die,'"to the ardent patriot and profound statesman he add a quality possess by few of the gifted on earth his eloquence have not be surpass in the effective power to move the heart of man clay be without an equal and the heaven bear endowment in the spirit of its origin have be most conspicuously exhibit against intestine feud on at least three important occasion he have quell our civil commotion by a power and influence which belong to no other statesman of his age and time and in our last internal discord when this union tremble to its center in old age he leave the shade of private life and give the death blow to fraternal strife with the vigor of his early year in a series of senatorial effort which in themselves would bring immortality by challenge comparison with the effort of any statesman in any age he exorcise the demon which possess the body politic and give peace to a distracted land alas the achievement cost he his life he sink day by day to the tomb his pale but noble brow bind with a triple wreath put there by a grateful country may his ashe rest in peace while his spirit go to take its station among the great and good man who precede him!''while it be customary and proper upon occasion like the present to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased in the case of mr. clay it be less necessary than most other for his biography have be write and re write and read and re read for the last twenty five year so that with the exception of a few of the late incident of his life all be as well know as it can be the short sketch which i give be therefore merely to maintain the connection of this discourse henry clay be bear on the 12th of april 1777 in hanover county virginia of his father who die in the fourth or fifth year of henry 's age little seem to be know except that he be a respectable man and a preacher of the baptist persuasion mr. clay 's education to the end of his life be comparatively limited i say ` ` to the end of his life because i have understand that from time to time he add something to his education during the great part of his whole life mr. clay 's lack of a more perfect early education however it may be regret generally teach at least one profitable lesson it teach that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that if he will he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably in his twenty third year mr. clay be licence to practice law and emigrate to lexington kentucky here he commence and continue the practice till the year 1803 when he be first elect to the kentucky legislature by successive election he be continue in the legislature till the latter part of 1806 when he be elect to fill a vacancy of a single session in the united states senate in 1807 he be again elect to the kentucky house of representatives and by that body choose its speaker in 1808 he be re elect to the same body in 1809 he be again choose to fill a vacancy of two year in the united states senate in 1811 he be elect to the united states house of representatives and on the first day of take his seat in that body he be choose its speaker in 1813 he be again elect speaker early in 1814 be the period of our last british war mr. clay be send as commissioner with other to negotiate a treaty of peace which treaty be conclude in the latter part of the same year on his return from europe he be again elect to the low branch of congress and on take his seat in december 1815 be call to his old post the speaker 's chair a position in which he be retain by successive election with one brief intermission till the inauguration of john q. adams in march 1825 he be then appoint secretary of state and occupy that important station till the inauguration of gen. jackson in march 1829 after this he return to kentucky resume the practice of the law and continue it till the autumn of 1831 when he be by the legislature of kentucky again place in the united states senate by a re election he be continue in the senate till he resign his seat and retire in march 1842 in december 1849 he again take his seat in the senate which he again resign only a few month before his death by the foregoing it be perceive that the period from the beginning of mr. clay 's official life in 1803 to the end of it in 1852 be but one year short of half a century and that the sum of all the interval in it will not amount to ten year but mere duration of time in office constitute the small part of mr. clay 's history throughout that long period he have constantly be the most love and most implicitly follow by friend and the most dread by opponent of all live american politician in all the great question which have agitate the country and particularly in those great and fearful crisis the missouri question the nullification question and the late slavery question as connect with the newly acquire territory involve and endanger the stability of the union his have be the lead and most conspicuous part in 1824 he be first a candidate for the presidency and be defeat and although he be successively defeat for the same office in 1832 and in 1844 there have never be a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion of the american people do not cling to he with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevate he to the presidency with other man to be defeat be to be forget but to he defeat be but a trifling incident neither change he or the world 's estimate of he even those of both political party who have be prefer to he for the high office have run far brief course than he and leave he still shine high in the heaven of the political world jackson van buren harrison polk and taylor all rise after and set long before he the spell the long endure spell with which the soul of man be bind to he be a miracle who can compass it it be probably true he owe his pre eminence to no one quality but to a fortunate combination of several he be surpassingly eloquent but many eloquent man fail utterly and they be not as a class generally successful his judgment be excellent but many man of good judgment live and die unnoticed his will be indomitable but this quality often secure to its owner nothing well than a character for useless obstinacy these then be mr. clay 's lead quality no one of they be very uncommon but all take together be rarely combine in a single individual and this be probably the reason why such man as henry clay be so rare in the world mr. clay 's eloquence do not consist as many fine specimen of eloquence do do of type and figure of antithesis and elegant arrangement of word and sentence but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone and manner which can proceed only from great sincerity and a thorough conviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause this it be that truly touch the chord of human sympathy and those who hear mr. clay never fail to be move by it or ever afterwards forget the impression all his effort be make for practical effect he never speak merely to be hear he never deliver a fourth of july oration or an eulogy on an occasion like this as a politician or statesman no one be so habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground whatever he do he do for the whole country in the construction of his measure he ever carefully survey every part of the field and duly weigh every conflicting interest feel as he do and as the truth surely be that the world 's good hope depend on the continued union of these states he be ever jealous of and watchful for whatever might have the slight tendency to separate they mr. clay 's predominant sentiment from first to last be a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty a strong sympathy with the oppress every where and an ardent wish for their elevation with he this be a primary and all control passion subsidiary to this be the conduct of his whole life he love his country partly because it be his own country but mostly because it be a free country and he burn with a zeal for its advancement prosperity and glory because he see in such the advancement prosperity and glory of human liberty human right and human nature he desire the prosperity of his countryman partly because they be his countryman but chiefly to show to the world that freeman could be prosperous that his view and measure be always the wise need not to be affirm nor should it be on this occasion where so many think differently join in do honor to his memory a free people in time of peace and quiet when press by no common danger naturally divide into party at such time the man who be of neither party be not cannot be of any consequence mr. clay therefore be of a party take a prominent part as he do in all the great political question of his country for the last half century the wisdom of his course on many be doubt and deny by a large portion of his countryman and of such it be not now proper to speak particularly but there be many other about his course upon which there be little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic americans of these last be the war of 1812 the missouri question nullification and the now recent compromise measure in 1812 mr. clay though not unknown be still a young man whether we should go to war with great britain be the question of the day a minority oppose the declaration of war by congress while the majority though apparently incline to war have for year waver and hesitate to act decisively meanwhile british aggression multiply and grow more daring and aggravate by mr. clay more than any other man the struggle be bring to a decision in congress the question be now fully before congress come up in a variety of way in rapid succession on most of which occasion mr. clay speak add to all the logic of which the subject be susceptible that noble inspiration which come to he as it come to no other he arouse and nerve and inspire his friend and confound and bore down all opposition several of his speech on these occasion be report and be still extant but the good of these all never be during its delivery the reporter forget their vocation drop their pen and sit enchant from near the beginning to quite the close the speech now live only in the memory of a few old man and the enthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it be absolutely astonishing the precise language of this speech we shall never know but we do know we can not help know that with deep pathos it plead the cause of the injure sailor that it invoke the genius of the revolution that it apostrophise the name of otis of henry and of washington that it appeal to the interest the pride the honor and the glory of the nation that it shame and taunt the timidity of friend that it scorn and scout and wither the temerity of domestic foe that it beard and defy the british lion and rise and swell and madden in its course it sound the onset till the charge the shock the steady struggle and the glorious victory all pass in vivid review before the entrance hearer important and exciting as be the war question of 1812 it never so alarm the sagacious statesman of the country for the safety of the republic as afterwards do the missouri question this spring from that unfortunate source of discord negro slavery when our federal constitution be adopt we own no territory beyond the limit or ownership of the state except the territory north west of the river ohio and east of the mississippi what have since be form into the states of maine kentucky and tennessee be i believe within the limit of or own by massachusetts virginia and north carolina as to the north western territory provision have be make even before the adoption of the constitution that slavery should never go there on the admission of the states into the union carve from the territory we own before the constitution no question or at most no considerable question arise about slavery those which be within the limit of or own by the old state follow respectively the condition of the parent state and those within the north west territory follow the previously make provision but in 1803 we purchase louisiana of the french and it include with much more what have since be form into the state of missouri with regard to it nothing have be do to forestall the question of slavery when therefore in 1819 missouri having form a state constitution without exclude slavery and with slavery already actually exist within its limit knock at the door of the union for admission almost the entire representation of the non slave hold state object a fearful and angry struggle instantly follow this alarmed think man more than any previous question because unlike all the former it divide the country by geographical line other question have their oppose partizan in all locality of the country and in almost every family so that no division of the union could follow such without a separation of friend to quite as great an extent as that of opponent not so with the missouri question on this a geographical line could be trace which in the main would separate opponent only this be the danger mr. jefferson then in retirement wrote:``i have for a long time cease to read newspaper or to pay any attention to public affair confident they be in good hand and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which i be not distant but this momentous question like a fire bell in the night awaken and fill i with terror i consider it at once as the knell of the union it be hush indeed for the moment but this be a reprieve only not a final sentence a geographical line co incide with a marked principle moral and political once conceive and hold up to the angry passion of man will never be obliterate and every irritation will mark it deeply and deep i can say with conscious truth that there be not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than i would to relieve we from this heavy reproach in any practicable way the cession of that kind of property for so it be misname be a bagatelle which would not cost i a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effect and gradually and with due sacrifice i think it might be but as it be we have the wolf by the ear and we can neither hold he nor safely let he go justice be in one scale and self preservation in the other ''mr clay be in congress and perceive the danger at once engage his whole energy to avert it it begin as i have say in 1819 and it do not terminate till 1821 missouri would not yield the point and congress that is a majority in congress by repeat vote show a determination to not admit the state unless it should yield after several failure and great labor on the part of mr. clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission it be by a vote reject and as all seem to think finally a sullen gloom hang over the nation all feel that the rejection of missouri be equivalent to a dissolution of the union because those state which already have what missouri be reject for refuse to relinquish would go with missouri all deprecate and deplore this but none see how to avert it for the judgment of member to be convince of the necessity of yield be not the whole difficulty each have a constituency to meet and to answer to mr. clay though wear down and exhaust be appeal to by member to renew his effort at compromise he do so and by some judicious modification of his plan couple with laborious effort with individual member and his own over master eloquence upon the floor he finally secure the admission of the state brightly and captivate as it have previously show it be now perceive that his great eloquence be a mere embellishment or at most but a help hand to his inventive genius and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril after the settlement of the missouri question although a portion of the american people have differ with

life of the deceased in the case of mr. clay it be less necessary than most other for his biography have be write and re write and read and re read for the last twenty five year so that with the exception of a few of the late incident of his life all be as well know as it can be the short sketch which i give be therefore merely to maintain the connection of this discourse henry clay be bear on the 12th of april 1777 in hanover county virginia of his father who die in the fourth or fifth year of henry 's age little seem to be know except that he be a respectable man and a preacher of the baptist persuasion mr. clay 's education to the end of his life be comparatively limited i say to the end of his life because i have understand that from time to time he add something to his education during the great part of his whole life mr. clay 's lack of a more perfect early education however it may be regret generally teach at least one profitable lesson it teach that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that if he will he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably in his twenty third year mr. clay be licence to practice law and emigrate to lexington kentucky here he commence and continue the practice till the year 1803 when he be first elect to the kentucky legislature by successive election he be continue in the legislature till the latter part of 1806 when he be elect to fill a vacancy of a single session in the united states senate in 1807 he be again elect to the kentucky house of representatives and by that body choose its speaker in 1808 he be re elect to the same body in 1809 he be again choose to fill a vacancy of two year in the united states senate in 1811 he be elect to the united states house of representatives and on the first day of take his seat in that body he be choose its speaker in 1813 he be again elect speaker early in 1814 be the period of our last british war mr. clay be send as commissioner with other to negotiate a treaty of peace which treaty be conclude in the latter part of the same year on his return from europe he be again elect to the low branch of congress and on take his seat in december 1815 be call to his old post the speaker 's chair a position in which he be retain by successive election with one brief intermission till the inauguration of john q. adams in march 1825 he be then appoint secretary of state and occupy that important station till the inauguration of gen. jackson in march 1829 after this he return to kentucky resume the practice of the law and continue it till the autumn of 1831 when he be by the legislature of kentucky again place in the united states senate by a re election he be continue in the senate till he resign his seat and retire in march 1842 in december 1849 he again take his seat in the senate which he again resign only a few month before his death by the foregoing it be perceive that the period from the beginning of mr. clay 's official life in 1803 to the end of it in 1852 be but one year short of half a century and that the sum of all the interval in it will not amount to ten year but mere duration of time in office constitute the small part of mr. clay 's history throughout that long period he have constantly be the most love and most implicitly follow by friend and the most dread by opponent of all live american politician in all the great question which have agitate the country and particularly in those great and fearful crisis the missouri question&mdash;the nullification question and the late slavery question as connect with the newly acquire territory involve and endanger the stability of the union his have be the lead and most conspicuous part in 1824 he be first a candidate for the presidency and be defeat and although he be successively defeat for the same office in 1832 and in 1844 there have never be a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion of the american people do not cling to he with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevate he to the presidency with other man to be defeat be to be forget but to he defeat be but a trifling incident neither change he or the world 's estimate of he even those of both political party who have be prefer to he for the high office have run far brief course than he and leave he still shine high in the heaven of the political world jackson van buren harrison polk and taylor all rise after and set long before he the spell&mdash;the long endure spell&mdash;with which the soul of man be bind to he be a miracle who can compass it it be probably true he owe his pre eminence to no one quality but to a fortunate combination of several he be surpassingly eloquent but many eloquent man fail utterly and they be not as a class generally successful his judgment be excellent but many man of good judgment live and die unnoticed his will be indomitable but this quality often secure to its owner nothing well than a character for useless obstinacy these then be mr. clay 's lead quality no one of they be very uncommon but all take together be rarely combine in a single individual and this be probably the reason why such man as henry clay be so rare in the world mr. clay 's eloquence do not consist as many fine specimen of eloquence do of type and figures&mdash;of antithesis and elegant arrangement of word and sentence but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone and manner which can proceed only from great sincerity and a thorough conviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause this it be that truly touch the chord of human sympathy and those who hear mr. clay never fail to be move by it or ever afterwards forget the impression all his effort be make for practical effect he never speak merely to be hear he never deliver a fourth of july oration or an eulogy on an occasion like this as a politician or statesman no one be so habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground whatever he do he do for the whole country in the construction of his measure he ever carefully survey every part of the field and duly weigh every conflicting interest feel as he do and as the truth surely be that the world 's good hope depend on the continued union of these states he be ever jealous of and watchful for whatever might have the slight tendency to separate they mr. clay 's predominant sentiment from first to last be a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty&mdash;a strong sympathy with the oppress every where and an ardent wish for their elevation with he this be a primary and all control passion subsidiary to this be the conduct of his whole life he love his country partly because it be his own country but mostly because it be a free country and he burn with a zeal for its advancement prosperity and glory because he see in such the advancement prosperity and glory of human liberty human right and human nature he desire the prosperity of his countryman partly because they be his countryman but chiefly to show to the world that freeman could be prosperous that his view and measure be always the wise need not to be affirm nor should it be on this occasion where so many think differently join in do honor to his memory a free people in time of peace and quiet when press by no common danger&mdash;naturally divide into party at such time the man who be of neither party be not&mdash;cannot be of any consequence mr. clay therefore be of a party take a prominent part as he do in all the great political question of his country for the last half century the wisdom of his course on many be doubt and deny by a large portion of his countryman and of such it be not now proper to speak particularly but there be many other about his course upon which there be little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic americans of these last be the war of 1812 the missouri question nullification and the now recent compromise measure in 1812 mr. clay though not unknown be still a young man whether we should go to war with great britain be the question of the day a minority oppose the declaration of war by congress while the majority though apparently incline to war have for year waver and hesitate to act decisively meanwhile british aggression multiply and grow more daring and aggravate by mr. clay more than any other man the struggle be bring to a decision in congress the question be now fully before congress come up in a variety of way in rapid succession on most of which occasion mr. clay speak add to all the logic of which the subject be susceptible that noble inspiration which come to he as it come to no other he arouse and nerve and inspire his friend and confound and bore down all opposition several of his speech on these occasion be report and be still extant but the good of these all never be during its delivery the reporter forget their vocation drop their pen and sit enchant from near the beginning to quite the close the speech now live only in the memory of a few old man and the enthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it be absolutely astonishing the precise language of this speech we shall never know but we do know&mdash;we can not help know that with deep pathos it plead the cause of the injure sailor&mdash;that it invoke the genius of the revolution that it apostrophise the name of otis of henry and of washington&mdash;that it appeal to the interest the pride the honor and the glory of the nation&mdash;that it shame and taunt the timidity of friends&mdash;that it scorn and scout and wither the temerity of domestic foes&mdash;that it beard and defy the british lion&mdash;and rise and swell and madden in its course it sound the onset till the charge the shock the steady struggle and the glorious victory all pass in vivid review before the entrance hearer important and exciting as be the war question of 1812 it never so alarm the sagacious statesman of the country for the safety of the republic as afterwards do the missouri question this spring from that unfortunate source of discord&mdash;negro slavery when our federal constitution be adopt we own no territory beyond the limit or ownership of the state except the territory north west of the river ohio and east of the mississippi what have since be form into the states of maine kentucky and tennessee be i believe within the limit of or own by massachusetts virginia and north carolina as to the north western territory provision have be make even before the adoption of the constitution that slavery should never go there on the admission of the states into the union carve from the territory we own before the constitution no question&mdash;or at most no considerable question&mdash;arose about slavery&mdash;those which be within the limit of or own by the old state follow respectively the condition of the parent state and those within the north west territory follow the previously make provision but in 1803 we purchase louisiana of the french and it include with much more what have since be form into the state of missouri with regard to it nothing have be do to forestall the question of slavery when therefore in 1819 missouri having form a state constitution without exclude slavery and with slavery already actually exist within its limit knock at the door of the union for admission almost the entire representation of the non slave hold state object a fearful and angry struggle instantly follow this alarmed think man more than any previous question because unlike all the former it divide the country by geographical line other question have their oppose partizan in all locality of the country and in almost every family so that no division of the union could follow such without a separation of friend to quite as great an extent as that of opponent not so with the missouri question on this a geographical line could be trace which in the main would separate opponent only this be the danger mr. jefferson then in retirement wrote:"i have for a long time cease to read newspaper or to pay any attention to public affair confident they be in good hand and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which i be not distant but this momentous question like a fire bell in the night awaken and fill i with terror i consider it at once as the knell of the union it be hush indeed for the moment but this be a reprieve only not a final sentence a geographical line co incide with a marked principle moral and political once conceive and hold up to the angry passion of man will never be obliterate and every irritation will mark it deeply and deep i can say with conscious truth that there be not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than i would to relieve we from this heavy reproach in any practicable way the cession of that kind of property for so it be misname be a bagatelle which would not cost i a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effect and gradually and with due sacrifice i think it might be but as it be we have the wolf by the ear and we can neither hold he nor safely let he go justice be in one scale and self preservation in the other "mr clay be in congress and perceive the danger at once engage his whole energy to avert it it begin as i have say in 1819 and it do not terminate till 1821 missouri would not yield the point and congress&mdash;that be a majority in congress&mdash;by repeat vote show a determination to not admit the state unless it should yield after several failure and great labor on the part of mr. clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission it be by a vote reject and as all seem to think finally a sullen gloom hang over the nation all feel that the rejection of missouri be equivalent to a dissolution of the union because those state which already have what missouri be reject for refuse to relinquish would go with missouri all deprecate and deplore this but none see how to avert it for the judgment of member to be convince of the necessity of yield be not the whole difficulty each have a constituency to meet and to answer to mr. clay though wear down and exhaust be appeal to by member to renew his effort at compromise he do so and by some judicious modification of his plan couple with laborious effort with individual member and his own over master eloquence upon the floor he finally secure the admission of the state brightly and captivate as it have previously show it be now perceive that his great eloquence be a mere embellishment or at most but a help hand to his inventive genius and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril after the settlement of the missouri question although a portion of the american people have differ with mr. clay and a majority even appear generally to have be oppose to he on question of ordinary administration he seem constantly to have be regard by all as the man for a crisis accordingly in the day of nullification and more recently in the re appearance of the slavery question connect with our territory newly acquire of mexico the task of devise a mode of adjustment seem to have be cast upon mr. clay by common consent&mdash;and his performance of the task in each case be little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation mr. clay 's effort in behalf of the south americans and afterwards in behalf of the greeks in the time of their respective struggle for civil liberty be among the fine on record upon the noblest of all theme and bear ample corroboration of what i have say be his rule passion&mdash;a love of liberty and right unselfishly and for their own sake having be lead to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already i be unwilling to close without refer more particularly to mr. clay 's view and conduct in regard to it he ever be on principle and in feeling oppose to slavery the very

 be this island comparatively destitute of inhabitant or occupy by a kindre race i should regard it if voluntarily cede by spain as a most desirable acquisition but under exist circumstance i should look upon its incorporation into our union as a very hazardous measure it would bring into the confederacy a population of a different national stock speak a different language and not likely to harmonize with the other member it would probably affect in a prejudicial manner the industrial interest of the south and it might revive those conflict of opinion between the different section of the country which lately shake the union to its center and which have be so happily compromise

 in my first annual message to congress i call your attention to what seem to i some defect in the present tariff and recommend such modification as in my judgment be well adapt to remedy its evil and promote the prosperity of the country nothing have since occur to change my view on this important question
 without repeat the argument contain in my former message in favor of discriminate protective duty i deem it my duty to call your attention to one or two other consideration affect this subject the first be the effect of large importation of foreign good upon our currency most of the gold of california as fast as it be coin find its way directly to europe in payment for good purchase in the second place as our manufacturing establishment be break down by competition with foreigner the capital invest in they be lose thousand of honest and industrious citizen be throw out of employment and the farmer to that extent be deprive of a home market for the sale of his surplus produce in the third place the destruction of our manufacture leave the foreigner without competition in our market and he consequently raise the price of the article send here for sale as be now see in the increase cost of iron import from england the prosperity and wealth of every nation must depend upon its productive industry the farmer be stimulate to exertion by find a ready market for his surplus product and benefit by be able to exchange they without loss of time or expense of transportation for the manufacture which his comfort or convenience require this be always do to the good advantage where a portion of the community in which he live be engage in other pursuit but most manufacture require an amount of capital and a practical skill which can not be command unless they be protect for a time from ruinous competition from abroad hence the necessity of lay those duty upon import good which the constitution authorize for revenue in such a manner as to protect and encourage the labor of our own citizen duty however should not be fix at a rate so high as to exclude the foreign article but should be so graduate as to enable the domestic manufacturer fairly to compete with the foreigner in our own market and by this competition to reduce the price of the manufactured article to the consumer to the low rate at which it can be produce this policy would place the mechanic by the side of the farmer create a mutual interchange of their respective commodity and thus stimulate the industry of the whole country and render we independent of foreign nation for the supply require by the habit or necessity of the people
 another question wholly independent of protection present itself and that be whether the duty levy should be upon the value of the article at the place of shipment or where it be practicable a specific duty graduate accord to quantity as ascertain by weight or measure all our duty be at present ad valorem a certain percentage be levy on the price of the good at the port of shipment in a foreign country most commercial nation have find it indispensable for the purpose of prevent fraud and perjury to make the duty specific whenever the article be of such a uniform value in weight or measure as to justify such a duty legislation should never encourage dishonesty or crime it be impossible that the revenue officer at the port where the good be enter and the duty pay should know with certainty what they cost in the foreign country yet the law require that they should levy the duty accord to such cost they be therefore compel to resort to very unsatisfactory evidence to ascertain what that cost be they take the invoice of the importer attest by his oath as the good evidence of which the nature of the case admit but everyone must see that the invoice may be fabricate and the oath by which it be support false by reason of which the dishonest importer pay a part only of the duty which be pay by the honest one and thus indirectly receive from the treasury of the united states a reward for his fraud and perjury the report of the secretary of the treasury heretofore make on this subject show conclusively that these fraud have be practice to a great extent the tendency be to destroy that high moral character for which our merchant have long be distinguish to defraud the government of its revenue to break down the honest importer by a dishonest competition and finally to transfer the business of importation to foreign and irresponsible agent to the great detriment of our own citizen i therefore again most earnestly recommend the adoption of specific duty wherever it be practicable or a home valuation to prevent these fraud
 i would also again call your attention to the fact that the present tariff in some case impose a high duty upon the raw material import than upon the article manufacture from it the consequence of which be that the duty operate to the encouragement of the foreigner and the discouragement of our own citizen
 for full and detailed information in regard to the general condition of our indian affair i respectfully refer you to the report of the secretary of the interior and the accompany document
 the senate not having think proper to ratify the treaty which have be negotiate with the tribe of indians in california and oregon our relation with they have be leave in a very unsatisfactory condition
 in other part of our territory particular district of country have be set apart for the exclusive occupation of the indians and their right to the land within those limit have be acknowledge and respect but in california and oregon there have be no recognition by the government of the exclusive right of the indians to any part of the country they be therefore mere tenant at sufferance and liable to be drive from place to place at the pleasure of the white
 the treaty which have be reject propose to remedy this evil by allot to the different tribe district of country suitable to their habit of life and sufficient for their support this provision more than any other it be believe lead to their rejection and as no substitute for it have be adopt by congress it have not be deem advisable to attempt to enter into new treaty of a permanent character although no effort have be spare by temporary arrangement to preserve friendly relation with they
 if it be the desire of congress to remove they from the country altogether or to assign to they particular district more remote from the settlement of the white it will be proper to set apart by law the territory which they be to occupy and to provide the mean necessary for remove they to it justice alike to our own citizen and to the indians require the prompt action of congress on this subject the amendment propose by the senate to the treaty which be negotiate with the sioux indians of minnesota have be submit to the tribe who be party to they and have receive their assent a large tract of valuable territory have thus be open for settlement and cultivation and all danger of collision with these powerful and warlike band have be happily remove
 the removal of the remnant of the tribe of seminole indians from florida have long be a cherished object of the government and it be one to which my attention have be steadily direct admonish by past experience of the difficulty and cost of the attempt to remove they by military force resort have be have to conciliatory measure by the invitation of the commissioner of indian affairs several of the principal chief recently visit washington and whilst here acknowledge in write the obligation of their tribe to remove with the least possible delay late advice from the special agent of the government represent that they adhere to their promise and that a council of their people have be call to make their preliminary arrangement a general emigration may therefore be confidently expect at an early day

 much the large portion of the labor of arrange and classify the return of the last census have be finish and it will now devolve upon congress to make the necessary provision for the publication of the result in such form as shall be deem well the apportionment of representation on the basis of the new census have be make by the secretary of the interior in conformity with the provision of law relate to that subject and the recent election have be make in accordance with it
 i commend to your favorable regard the suggestion contain in the report of the secretary of the interior that provision be make by law for the publication and distribution periodically of an analytical digest of all the patent which have be or may hereafter be grant for useful invention and discovery with such description and illustration as may be necessary to present an intelligible view of their nature and operation the cost of such publication could easily be defray out of the patent fund and i be persuade that it could be apply to no object more acceptable to inventor and beneficial to the public at large
 an appropriation of $ 100,000 having be make at the last session for the purchase of a suitable site and for the erection furnishing and fitting up of an asylum for the insane of the district of columbia and of the army and navy of the united states the proper measure have be adopt to carry this beneficent purpose into effect
 by the late advice from the mexican boundary commission it appear that the survey of the river gila from its continence with the colorado to its suppose intersection with the western line of new mexico have be complete the survey of the rio grande have also be finish from the point agree on by the commissioner as the point where it strike the southern boundary of new mexico to a point 135 mile below eagle pass which be about two third of the distance along the course of the river to its mouth
 the appropriation which be make at the last session of congress for the continuation of the survey be subject to the follow proviso provide that no part of this appropriation shall be use or expend until it shall be make satisfactorily to appear to the president of the united states that the southern boundary of new mexico be not establish by the commissioner and surveyor of the united states far north of the town call paso than the same be lay down in disturnell&#39;s map which be add to the treaty
 my attention be draw to this subject by a report from the department of the interior which review all the fact of the case and submit for my decision the question whether under exist circumstance any part of the appropriation could be lawfully use or expend for the further prosecution of the work after a careful consideration of the subject i come to the conclusion that it could not and so inform the head of that department order be immediately issue by he to the commissioner and surveyor to make no further requisition on the department as they could not be pay and to discontinue all operation on the southern line of new mexico but as the department have no exact information as to the amount of provision and money which remain unexpended in the hand of the commissioner and surveyor it be leave discretionary with they to continue the survey down the rio grande as far as the mean at their disposal would enable they or at once to disband the commission a special messenger have since arrive from the officer in charge of the survey on the river with information that the fund subject to his control be exhausted and that the officer and other employ in the service be destitute alike of the mean of prosecute the work and of return to their home
 the object of the proviso be doubtless to arrest the survey of the southern and western line of new mexico in regard to which different opinion have be express for it be hardly to be suppose that there could be any objection to that part of the line which extend along the channel of the rio grande but the term of the law be so broad as to forbid the use of any part of the money for the prosecution of the work or even for the payment to the officer and agent of the arrearage of pay which be justly due to they
 i earnestly invite your prompt attention to this subject and recommend a modification of the term of the proviso so as to enable the department to use as much of the appropriation as will be necessary to discharge the exist obligation of the government and to complete the survey of the rio grande to its mouth
 it will also be proper to make further provision by law for the fulfillment of our treaty with mexico for run and mark the residue of the boundary line between the two country
 permit i to invite your particular attention to the interest of the district of columbia which be confide by the constitution to your peculiar care
 among the measure which seem to i of the great importance to its prosperity be the introduction of a copious supply of water into the city of washington and the construction of suitable bridge across the potomac to replace those which be destroy by high water in the early part of the present year
 at the last session of congress an appropriation be make to defray the cost of the survey necessary for determine the good mean of afford an unfailing supply of good and wholesome water some progress have be make in the survey and as soon as it be complete the result will be lay before you
 further appropriation will also be necessary for grade and pave the street and avenue and inclosing and embellish the public ground within the city of washington
 i commend all these object together with the charitable institution of the district to your favorable regard every effort have be make to protect our frontier and that of the adjoining mexican states from the incursion of the indian tribe of about 11,000 man of which the army be compose nearly 8,000 be employ in the defense of the newly acquire territory include texas and of emigrant proceed thereto i be gratified to say that these effort have be unusually successful with the exception of some partial outbreak in california and oregon and occasional depredation on a portion of the rio grande owing it be believe to the disturbed state of that border region the inroad of the indians have be effectually restrain
 experience have show however that whenever the two race be bring into contact collision will inevitably occur to prevent these collision the united states have generally set apart portion of their territory for the exclusive occupation of the indian tribe a difficulty occur however in the application of this policy to texas by the term of the compact by which that state be admit into the union she retain the ownership of all the vacant land within her limit the government of that state it be understand have assign no portion of her territory to the indians but as fast as her settlement advance lay it off into county and proceed to survey and sell it this policy manifestly tend not only to alarm and irritate the indians but to compel they to resort to plunder for subsistence it also deprive this government of that influence and control over they without which no durable peace can ever exist between they and the white i trust therefore that a due regard for her own interest apart from consideration of humanity and justice will induce that state to assign a small portion of her vast domain for the provisional occupancy of the small remnant of tribe within her border subject of course to her ownership and eventual jurisdiction if she should fail to do this the fulfillment of our treaty stipulation with mexico and our duty to the indians themselves will it be fear become a subject of serious embarrassment to the government it be hope however that a timely and just provision by texas may avert this evil
 no appropriation for fortification be make at the two last session of congress the cause of this omission be probably to be find in a grow belief that the system of fortification adopt in 1816 and heretofore act on require revision
 the subject certainly deserve full and careful investigation but it should not be delay long than can be avoid in the meantime there be certain work which have be commence some of they nearly complete design to protect our principal seaport from boston to new orleans and a few other important point in regard to the necessity for these work it be believe that little difference of opinion exist among military man i therefore recommend that the appropriation necessary to prosecute they be make
 i invite your attention to the remark on this subject and on other connect with his department contain in the accompany report of the secretary of war
 measure have be take to carry into effect the law of the last session make provision for the improvement of certain river and harbor and it be believe that the arrangement make for that purpose will combine efficiency with economy owe chiefly to the advanced season when the act be pass little have yet be do in regard to many of the work beyond make the necessary preparation with respect to a few of the improvement the sum already appropriate will suffice to complete they but most of they will require additional appropriation i trust that these appropriation will be make and that this wise and beneficent policy so auspiciously resume will be continue great care should be take however to commence no work which be not of sufficient importance to the commerce of the country to be view as national in its character but work which have be commence should not be discontinue until complete as otherwise the sum expend will in most case be lose
 the report from the navy department will inform you of the prosperous condition of the branch of the public service commit to its charge it present to your consideration many topic and suggestion of which i ask your approval it exhibit an unusual degree of activity in the operation of the department during the past year the preparation for the japan expedition to which i have already allude the arrangement make for the exploration and survey of the china seas the northern pacific and behrings straits the incipient measure take toward a reconnoissance of the continent of africa eastward of liberia the preparation for an early examination of the tributary of the river la plata which a recent decree of the provisional chief of the argentine confederation have open to navigation all these enterprise and the mean by which they be propose to be accomplish have command my full approbation and i have no doubt will be productive of most useful result

 among other subject offer to your notice by the secretary of the navy i select for special commendation in view of its connection with the interest of the navy the plan submit by he for the establishment of a permanent corps of seaman and the suggestion he have present for the reorganization of the naval academy
 in reference to the first of these i take occasion to say that i think it will greatly improve the efficiency of the service and that i regard it as still more entitled to favor for the salutary influence it must exert upon the naval discipline now greatly disturb by the increase spirit of insubordination result from our present system the plan propose for the organization of the seamen furnish a judicious substitute for the law of september 1850 abolish corporal punishment and satisfactorily sustain the policy of that act under condition well adapt to maintain the authority of command and the order and security of our ship it be believe that any change which propose permanently to dispense with this mode of punishment should be precede by a system of enlistment which shall supply the navy with seaman of the most meritorious class whose good deportment and pride of character may preclude all occasion for a resort to penalty of a harsh or degrading nature the safety of a ship and her crew be often dependent upon immediate obedience to a command and the authority to enforce it must be equally ready the arrest of a refractory seaman in such moment not only deprive the ship of indispensable aid but impose a necessity for double service on other whose fidelity to their duty may be rely upon in such an emergency the exposure to this increase and arduous labor since the passage of the act of 1850 have already have to a most observable and injurious extent the effect of prevent the enlistment of the good seaman in the navy the plan now suggest be design to promote a condition of service in which this objection will no long exist the detail of this plan may be establish in great part if not altogether by the executive under the authority of exist law but i have think it proper in accordance with the suggestion of the secretary of the navy to submit it to your approval
 the establishment of a corps of apprentice for the navy or boy to be enlist until they become of age and to be employ under such regulation as the navy department may devise as propose in the report i cordially approve and commend to your consideration and i also concur in the suggestion that this system for the early training of seaman may be most usefully ingraft upon the service of our merchant marine the other proposition of the report to which i have refer the reorganization of the naval academy i recommend to your attention as a project worthy of your encouragement and support the valuable service already render by this institution entitle it to the continuance of your foster care
 your attention be respectfully call to the report of the postmaster general for the detailed operation of his department during the last fiscal year from which it will be see that the receipt from postage for that time be less by $ 1,431,696 than for the precede fiscal year be a decrease of about 23 per cent
 this diminution be attributable to the reduction in the rate of postage make by the act of march 3 1851 which reduction take effect at the commencement of the last fiscal year
 although in its operation during the last year the act refer to have not fulfil the prediction of its friend by increase the correspondence of the country in proportion to the reduction of postage i should nevertheless question the policy of return to high rate experience warrant the expectation that as the community become accustomed to cheap postage correspondence will increase it be believe that from this cause and from the rapid growth of the country in population and business the receipt of the department must ultimately exceed its expense and that the country may safely rely upon the continuance of the present cheap rate of postage
 in former message i have among other thing respectfully recommend to the consideration of congress the propriety and necessity of further legislation for the protection and punishment of foreign consul reside in the united states to revive with certain modification the act of 10th march 1838 to restrain unlawful military expedition against the inhabitant of conterminous state or territory for the preservation and protection from mutilation or theft of the paper record and archive of the nation for authorize the surplus revenue to be apply to the payment of the public debt in advance of the time when it will become due for the establishment of land office for the sale of the public land in california and the territory of oregon for the construction of a road from the mississippi valley to the pacific ocean for the establishment of a bureau of agriculture for the promotion of that interest perhaps the most important in the country for the prevention of fraud upon the government in application for pension and bounty land for the establishment of a uniform fee bill prescribe a specific compensation for every service require of clerk district attorney and marshal for authorize an additional regiment of mount man for the defense of our frontier against the indians and for fulfil our treaty stipulation with mexico to defend her citizen against the indians with equal diligence and energy as our own for determine the relative rank between the naval and civil officer in our public ship and between the officer of the army and navy in the various grade of each for reorganize the naval establishment by fix the number of officer in each grade and provide for a retire list upon reduce pay of those unfit for active duty for prescribing and regulating punishment in the navy for the appointment of a commission to revise the public statute of the united states by arrange they in order supply deficiency correct incongruity simplify their language and report they to congress for its final action and for the establishment of a commission to adjudicate and settle private claim against the united states i be not aware however that any of these subject have be finally act upon by congress without repeat the reason for legislation on these subject which have be assign in former message i respectfully recommend they again to your favorable consideration
 i think it due to the several executive departments of this government to bear testimony to the efficiency and integrity with which they be conduct with all the careful superintendence which it be possible for the head of those departments to exercise still the due administration and guardianship of the public money must very much depend on the vigilance intelligence and fidelity of the subordinate officer and clerk and especially on those intrust with the settlement and adjustment of claim and account i be gratified to believe that they have generally perform their duty faithfully and well they be appoint to guard the approach to the public treasury and they occupy position that expose they to all the temptation and seduction which the cupidity of peculator and fraudulent claimant can prompt they to employ it will be but a wise precaution to protect the government against that source of mischief and corruption as far as it can be do by the enactment of all proper legal penalty the law in this respect be suppose to be defective and i therefore deem it my duty to call your attention to the subject and to recommend that provision be make by law for the punishment not only of those who shall accept bribe but also of those who shall either promise give or offer to give to any of those officer or clerk a bribe or reward touch or relate to any matter of their official action or duty
 it have be the uniform policy of this government from its foundation to the present day to abstain from all interference in the domestic affair of other nation the consequence have be that while the nation of europe have be engage in desolate war our country have pursue its peaceful course to unexampled prosperity and happiness the war in which we have be compel to engage in defense of the right and honor of the country have be fortunately of short duration during the terrific contest of nation against nation which succeed the french revolution we be enable by the wisdom and firmness of president washington to maintain our neutrality while other nation be draw into this wide sweep whirlpool we sit quiet and unmove upon our own shore while the flower of their numerous army be waste by disease or perish by hundred of thousand upon the battlefield the youth of this favor land be permit to enjoy the blessing of peace beneath the paternal roof while the states of europe incur enormous debt under the burden of which their subject still groan and which must absorb no small part of the product of the honest industry of those country for generation to come the united states have once be enable to exhibit the proud spectacle of a nation free from public debt and if permit to pursue our prosperous way for a few year long in peace we may do the same again
 but it be now say by some that this policy must be change europe be no long separate from we by a voyage of month but steam navigation have bring she within a few days&#39 sail of our shore we see more of her movement and take a deep interest in her controversy although no one propose that we should join the fraternity of potentate who have for age lavish the blood and treasure of their subject in maintain the balance of power yet it be say that we ought to interfere between contend sovereign and their subject for the purpose of overthrow the monarchy of europe and establish in their place republican institution it be allege that we have heretofore pursue a different course from a sense of our weakness but that now our conscious strength dictate a change of policy and that it be consequently our duty to mingle in these contest and aid those who be struggle for liberty
 this be a most seductive but dangerous appeal to the generous sympathy of freeman enjoy as we do the blessing of a free government there be no man who have an american heart that would not rejoice to see these blessing extend to all other nation we can not witness the struggle between the oppressed and his oppressor anywhere without the deep sympathy for the former and the most anxious desire for his triumph nevertheless be it prudent or be it wise to involve ourselves in these foreign war be it indeed true that we have heretofore refrain from do so merely from the degrading motive of a conscious weakness for the honor of the patriot who have go before we i can not admit it man of the revolution who draw the sword against the oppression of the mother country and pledge to heaven their life their fortune and their sacred honor to maintain their freedom could never have be actuate by so unworthy a motive they know no weakness or fear where right or duty point the way and it be a libel upon their fair fame for we while we enjoy the blessing for which they so nobly fight and bleed to insinuate it the truth be that the course which they pursue be dictate by a stern sense of international justice by a statesmanlike prudence and a far see wisdom look not merely to the present necessity but to the permanent safety and interest of the country they know that the world be govern less by sympathy than by reason and force that it be not possible for this nation to become a propagandist of free principle without array against it the combined power of europe and that the result be more likely to be the overthrow of republican liberty here than its establishment there history have be write in vain for those who can doubt this france have no soon establish a republican form of government than she manifest a desire to force its blessing on all the world her own historian inform we that hear of some petty act of tyranny in a neighboring principality the national convention declare that she would afford succor and fraternity to all nation who wish to recover their liberty and she give it in charge to the executive power to give order to the general of the french army to aid all citizen who might have be or should be oppress in the cause of liberty here be the false step which lead to her subsequent misfortune she soon find herself involve in war with all the rest of europe in less than ten year her government be change from a republic to an empire and finally after shed river of blood foreign power restore her exile dynasty and exhaust europe seek peace and repose in the unquestioned ascendency of monarchical principle let we learn wisdom from her example let we remember that revolution do not always establish freedom our own free institution be not the offspring of our revolution they exist before they be plant in the free charter of self government under which the english colony grow up and our revolution only free we from the dominion of a foreign power whose government be at variance with those institution but european nation have have no such training for self government and every effort to establish it by bloody revolution have be and must without that preparation continue to be a failure liberty unregulate by law degenerate into anarchy which soon become the most horrid of all despotism our policy be wisely to govern ourselves and thereby to set such an example of national justice prosperity and true glory as shall teach to all nation the blessing of self government and the unparalleled enterprise and success of a free people
 we live in an age of progress and our be emphatically a country of progress within the last half century the number of states in this union have nearly double the population have almost quadruple and our boundary have be extend from the mississippi to the pacific our territory be checker over with railroad and furrow with canal the inventive talent of our country be excited to the high pitch and the numerous application for patent for valuable improvement distinguish this age and this people from all other the genius of one american have enable our commerce to move against wind and tide and that of another have annihilate distance in the transmission of intelligence the whole country be full of enterprise our common school be diffuse intelligence among the people and our industry be fast accumulate the comfort and luxury of life this be in part owe to our peculiar position to our fertile soil and comparatively sparse population but much of it be also owe to the popular institution under which we live to the freedom which every man feel to engage in any useful pursuit accord to his taste or inclination and to the entire confidence that his person and property will be protect by the law but whatever may be the cause of this unparalleled growth in population intelligence and wealth one tiring be clear that the government must keep pace with the progress of the people it must participate in their spirit of enterprise and while it exact obedience to the law and restrain all unauthorized invasion of the right of neighboring state it should foster and protect home industry and lend its powerful strength to the improvement of such mean of intercommunication as be necessary to promote our internal commerce and strengthen the tie which bind we together as a people
 it be not strange however much it may be regret that such an exuberance of enterprise should cause some individual to mistake change for progress and the invasion of the right of other for national prowess and glory the former be constantly agitate for some change in the organic law or urge new and untried theory of human right the latter be ever ready to engage in any wild crusade against a neighboring people regardless of the justice of the enterprise and without look at the fatal consequence to ourselves and to the cause of popular government such expedition however be often stimulate by mercenary individual who expect to share the plunder or profit of the enterprise without expose themselves to danger and be lead on by some irresponsible foreigner who abuse the hospitality of our own government by seduce the young and ignorant to join in his scheme of personal ambition or revenge under the false and delusive pretense of extend the area of freedom these reprehensible aggression but retard the true progress of our nation and tarnish its fair fame they should therefore receive the indignant frown of every good citizen who sincerely love his country and take a pride in its prosperity and honor our constitution though not perfect be doubtless the good that ever be form therefore let every proposition to change it be well weigh and if find beneficial cautiously adopt every patriot will rejoice to see its authority so exert as to advance the prosperity and honor of the nation whilst he will watch with jealousy any attempt to mutilate this charter of our liberty or pervert its power to act of aggression or injustice thus shall conservatism and progress blend their harmonious action in preserve the form and spirit of the constitution and at the same time carry forward the great improvement of the country with a rapidity and energy which freeman only can display
 in close this my last annual communication permit i fellow citizen to congratulate you on the prosperous condition of our beloved country abroad its relation with all foreign power be friendly its right be respect and its high place in the family of nation cheerfully recognize at home we enjoy an amount of happiness public and private which have probably never fall to the lot of any other people besides afford to our own citizen a degree of prosperity of which on so large a scale i know of no other instance our country be annually afford a refuge and a home to multitude altogether without example from the old world
 we owe these blessing under heaven to the happy constitution and government which be bequeath to we by our father and which it be our sacred duty to transmit in all their integrity to our child we must all consider it a great distinction and privilege to have be choose by the people to bear a part in the administration of such a government call by an unexpected dispensation to its high trust at a season of embarrassment and alarm i enter upon its arduous duty with extreme diffidence i claim only to have discharge they to the good of an humble ability with a single eye to the public good and it be with devout gratitude in retire from office that i leave the country in a state of peace and prosperity

my countryman it a relief to feel that no heart but my own can know the personal regretand bitter sorrow over which i have be bear to a position so suitablefor other rather than desirable for myself the circumstance under which i have be call for a limited periodto preside over the destiny of the republic fill i with aprofound senseof responsibility but with nothing like shrink apprehension i repairto the post assign i not as to one seek but in obedience to the unsolicitedexpression of your will answerable only for a fearless faithful anddiligent exercise of my good power i ought to be and be truly gratefulfor the rare manifestation of the nation 's confidence but this so farfrom lighten my obligation only add to their weight you have summonedme in my weakness you must sustain i by your strength when look forthe fulfillment of reasonable requirement you will not be unmindful ofthe great change which have occur even within the last quarter ofa century and the consequent augmentation and complexity of duty imposedin the administration both of your home and foreign affair whether the element of inherent force in the republic have keep pacewith its unparalleled progression in territory population and wealthha be the subject of earnest thought and discussion on both side ofthe ocean less than sixty four year ago the father of his country made"the then recent accession of the important state of north carolina tothe constitution of the united states one of the subject of his specialcongratulation at that moment however when the agitation consequentupon the revolutionary struggle have hardly subside when we be justemerge from the weakness and embarrassment of the confederation therewa an evident consciousness of vigor equal to the great mission so wiselyand bravely fulfil by our father it be not a presumptuous assurance but a calm faith spring from a clear view of the source of power ina government constitute like ours it be no paradox to say that althoughcomparatively weak the new bear nation be intrinsically strong inconsiderablein population and apparent resource it be uphold by a broad and intelligentcomprehension of right and an all pervade purpose to maintain they strong than armament it come from the furnace of the revolution temperedto the necessity of the time the thought of the man of that day werea practical as their sentiment be patriotic they waste no portionof their energy upon idle and delusive speculation but with a firmand fearless step advanced beyond the governmental landmark which hadhitherto circumscribe the limit of human freedom and plant their standard where it have stand against danger which have threaten from abroad andinternal agitation which have at time fearfully menace at home theyproved themselves equal to the solution of the great problem to understandwhich their mind have be illuminate by the dawn light of the revolution the object seek be not a thing dream of it be a thing realize they have exhibit only the power to achieve but what all history affirmsto be so much more unusual the capacity to maintain the oppress throughoutthe world from that day to the present have turn their eye hitherward not to find those light extinguish or to fear lest they should wane but to be constantly cheer by their steady and increase radiance in this our country have in my judgment thus far fulfil its highestduty to suffer humanity it have speak and will continue to speak notonly by its word but by its act the language of sympathy encouragement and hope to those who earnestly listen to tone which pronounce for thelargest rational liberty but after all the most animating encouragementand potent appeal for freedom will be its own history its trial and itstriumph preeminently the power of our advocacy repose in our example;but no example be it remember can be powerful for last good whateverapparent advantage may be gain which be not base upon eternal principlesof right and justice our father decide for themselves both upon thehour to declare and the hour to strike they be their own judge of thecircumstance under which it become they to pledge to each other theirlive their fortune and their sacred honor for the acquisition of thepriceless inheritance transmit to we the energy with which that greatconflict be open and under the guidance of a manifest and beneficentprovidence the uncomplaine endurance with which it be prosecute toit consummation be only surpass by the wisdom and patriotic spiritof concession which characterize all the counsel of the early father one of the most impressive evidence of that wisdom be to be find inthe fact that the actual working of our system have dispel a degree ofsolicitude which at the outset disturb bold heart and far reach intellect the apprehension of danger from extended territory multiply states accumulate wealth and augmented population have prove to be unfounded the star upon your banner have become nearly threefold their originalnumber your densely populate possession skirt the shore of the twogreat ocean and yet this vast increase of people and territory have notonly show itself compatible with the harmonious action of the states andfederal government in their respective constitutional sphere but hasafforde an additional guaranty of the strength and integrity of both with an experience thus suggestive and cheer the policy of my administrationwill not be control by any timid foreboding of evil from expansion indeed it be not to be disguise that our attitude as a nation and ourposition on the globe render the acquisition of certain possession notwithin our jurisdiction eminently important for our protection if notin the future essential for the preservation of the right of commerceand the peace of the world should they be obtain it will be throughno grasp spirit but with a view to obvious national interest and security and in a manner entirely consistent with the strict observance of nationalfaith we have nothing in our history or position to invite aggression;we have everything to beckon we to the cultivation of relation of peaceand amity with all nation purpose therefore at once just and pacificwill be significantly mark in the conduct of our foreign affair i intendthat my administration shall leave no blot upon our fair record and trusti may safely give the assurance that no act within the legitimate scopeof my constitutional control will be tolerate on the part of any portionof our citizen which can not challenge a ready justification before thetribunal of the civilized world an administration would be unworthy ofconfidence at home or respect abroad should it cease to be influence bythe conviction that no apparent advantage can be purchase at a price sodear as that of national wrong or dishonor it be not your privilege asa nation to speak of a distant past the striking incident of your history replete with instruction and furnish abundant ground for hopeful confidence be comprise in a period comparatively brief but if your past be limited your future be boundless its obligation throng the unexplored pathwayof advancement and will be limitless as duration hence a sound and comprehensivepolicy should embrace not less the distant future than the urgent present the great object of our pursuit as a people be good to be attainedby peace and be entirely consistent with the tranquillity and interestsof the rest of mankind with the neighboring nation upon our continentwe should cultivate kindly and fraternal relation we can desire nothingin regard to they so much as to see they consolidate their strength andpursue the path of prosperity and happiness if in the course of theirgrowth we should open new channel of trade and create additional facilitiesfor friendly intercourse the benefit realize will be equal and mutual of the complicated european system of national polity we have heretoforebeen independent from their war their tumult and anxiety we havebeen happily almost entirely exempt whilst these be confine to thenation which give they existence and within their legitimate jurisdiction they can not affect we except as they appeal to our sympathy in the causeof human freedom and universal advancement but the vast interest of commerceare common to all mankind and the advantage of trade and internationalintercourse must always present a noble field for the moral influence ofa great people with these view firmly and honestly carry out we have a right toexpect and shall under all circumstance require prompt reciprocity the right which belong to we as a nation be not alone to be regard but those which pertain to every citizen in his individual capacity athome and abroad must be sacredly maintain so long as he can discernevery star in its place upon that ensign without wealth to purchase forhim preferment or title to secure for he place it will be his privilege and must be his acknowledge right to stand unabashed even in the presenceof prince with a proud consciousness that he be himself one of a nationof sovereign and that he can not in legitimate pursuit wander so far fromhome that the agent whom he shall leave behind in the place which i nowoccupy will not see that no rude hand of power or tyrannical passion islaid upon he with impunity he must realize that upon every sea and onevery soil where our enterprise may rightfully seek the protection of ourflag american citizenship be an inviolable panoply for the security ofamerican right and in this connection it can hardly be necessary to reaffirma principle which should now be regard as fundamental the right security and repose of this confederacy reject the idea of interference or colonizationon this side of the ocean by any foreign power beyond present jurisdictiona utterly inadmissible the opportunity of observation furnish by my brief experience asa soldier confirm in my own mind the opinion entertain and act uponby other from the formation of the government that the maintenance oflarge stand army in our country would be not only dangerous but unnecessary they also illustrate the importance i might well say the absolute necessity ofthe military science and practical skill furnish in such an eminent degreeby the institution which have make your army what it be under the disciplineand instruction of officer not more distinguished for their solid attainment gallantry and devotion to the public service than for unobtrusive bearingand high moral tone the army as organize must be the nucleus around whichin every time of need the strength of your military power the sure bulwarkof your defense a national militia may be readily form into a well disciplinedand efficient organization and the skill and self devotion of the navyassure you that you may take the performance of the past as a pledge forthe future and may confidently expect that the flag which have wave itsuntarnishe fold over every sea will still float in undiminished honor but these like many other subject will be appropriately bring at afuturetime to the attention of the coordinate branch of the government towhich i shall always look with profound respect and with trustful confidencethat they will accord to i the aid and support which i shall so much needand which their experience and wisdom will readily suggest in the administration of domestic affair you expect a devoted integrityin the public service and an observance of rigid economy in all department so marked as never justly to be question if this reasonable expectationbe not realize i frankly confess that one of your lead hope be doomedto disappointment and that my effort in a very important particular mustresult in a humiliating failure office can be properly regard onlyin the light of aid for the accomplishment of these object and as occupancycan confer no prerogative nor importunate desire for preferment any claim the public interest imperatively demand that they be consider with solereference to the duty to be perform good citizen may well claim theprotection of good law and the benign influence of good government buta claim for office be what the people of a republic should never recognize no reasonable man of any party will expect the administration to be soregardless of its responsibility and of the obvious element of successa to retain person know to be under the influence of political hostilityand partisan prejudice in position which will require not only severelabor but cordial cooperation have no imply engagement to ratify no reward to bestow no resentment to remember and no personal wishesto consult in selection for official station i shall fulfill this difficultand delicate trust admit no motive as worthy either of my characteror position which do not contemplate an efficient discharge of duty andthe good interest of my country i acknowledge my obligation to the massesof my countryman and to they alone high object than personal aggrandizementgave direction and energy to their exertion in the late canvass and theyshall not be disappoint they require at my hand diligence integrity and capacity wherever there be duty to be perform without these qualitiesin their public servant more stringent law for the prevention or punishmentof fraud negligence and peculation will be vain with they they willbe unnecessary but these be not the only point to which you look for vigilant watchfulness the danger of a concentration of all power in the general government ofa confederacy so vast as ours be too obvious to be disregard you havea right therefore to expect your agent in every department to regardstrictly the limit impose upon they by the constitution of the unitedstates the great scheme of our constitutional liberty rest upon a properdistribution of power between the state and federal authority and experiencehas show that the harmony and happiness of our people must depend upona just discrimination between the separate right and responsibilitiesof the states and your common right and obligation under the generalgovernment and here in my opinion be the consideration which shouldform the true basis of future concord in regard to the question whichhave most seriously disturb public tranquillity if the federal governmentwill confine itself to the exercise of power clearly grant by the constitution it can hardly happen that its action upon any question should endangerthe institution of the states or interfere with their right to managematter strictly domestic accord to the will of their own people in express briefly my view upon an important subject rich have recentlyagitate the nation to almost a fearful degree i be move by no otherimpulse than a most earnest desire for the perpetuation of that union whichha make we what we be shower upon we blessing and confer a powerand influence which our father could hardly have anticipate even withtheir most sanguine hope direct to a far off future the sentimentsi now announce be not unknown before the expression of the voice whichcalle i here my own position upon this subject be clear and unequivocal upon the record of my word and my act and it be only recur to atthis time because silence might perhaps be misconstrue with the unionmy well and dear earthly hope be entwine without it what be weindividually or collectively what become of the noble field ever openedfor the advancement of our race in religion in government in the art and in all that dignifie and adorn mankind from that radiant constellationwhich both illumine our own way and point out to struggle nation theircourse let but a single star be lose and if these be not utter darkness the luster of the whole be dim do my countryman need any assurancethat such a catastrophe be not to overtake they while i possess the powerto stay it it be with i an earnest and vital belief that as the unionhas be the source under providence of our prosperity to this time so it be the sure pledge of a continuance of the blessing we have enjoy and which we be sacredly bind to transmit undiminishe to our child the field of calm and free discussion in our country be open and willalway be so but never have be and never can be traverse for good ina spirit of sectionalism and uncharitableness the founder of the republicdealt with thing as they be present to they in a spirit of self sacrificingpatriotism and as time have prove with a comprehensive wisdom whichit will always be safe for we to consult every measure tend to strengthenthe fraternal feeling of all the member of our union have have my heartfeltapprobation to every theory of society or government whether the offspringof feverish ambition or of morbid enthusiasm calculate to dissolve thebond of law and affection which unite we i shall interpose a ready andstern resistance i believe that involuntary servitude as it exist indifferent state of this confederacy be recognize by the constitution i believe that it stand like any other admit right and that the stateswhere it exist be entitle to efficient remedy to enforce the constitutionalprovision i hold that the law of 1850 commonly call the compromisemeasure be strictly constitutional and to be unhesitatingly carriedinto effect i believe that the constituted authority of this republicare bind to regard the right of the south in this respect as they wouldview any other legal and constitutional right and that the law to enforcethem should be respect and obey not with a reluctance encourage byabstract opinion as to their propriety in a different state of society but cheerfully and accord to the decision of the tribunal to whichtheir exposition belong such have be and be my conviction andupon they i shall act i fervently hope that the question be at rest andthat no sectional or ambitious or fanatical excitement may again threatenthe durability of our institution or obscure the light of our prosperity but let not the foundation of our hope rest upon man 's wisdom it willnot be sufficient that sectional prejudice find no place in the publicdeliberation it will not be sufficient that the rash counsel of humanpassion be reject it must be feel that there be no national securitybut in the nation 's humble acknowledge dependence upon god and his overrulingprovidence we have be carry in safety through a perilous crisis wise counsel like those which give we the constitution prevail to uphold it letthe period be remember as an admonition and not as an encouragement in any section of the union to make experiment where experiment arefraught with such fearful hazard let it be impress upon all heart that beautiful as our fabric be no earthly power or wisdom could ever reuniteit broken fragment stand as i do almost within view of the greenslope of monticello and as it be within reach of the tomb of washington with all the cherish memory of the past gathering around i like somany eloquent voice of exhortation from heaven i can express no betterhope for my country than that the kind providence which smile upon ourfather may enable their child to preserve the blessing they have inherit
fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives the interest with which the people of the republic anticipate the assembling of congress and the fulfillment on that occasion of the duty impose upon a new president be one of the good evidence of their capacity to realize the hope of the founder of a political system at once complex and symmetrical while the different branch of the government be to a certain extent independent of each other the duty of all alike have direct reference to the source of power fortunately under this system no man be so high and none so humble in the scale of public station as to escape from the scrutiny or to be exempt from the responsibility which all official function imply upon the justice and intelligence of the masse in a government thus organize be the sole reliance of the confederacy and the only security for honest and earnest devotion to its interest against the usurpation and encroachment of power on the one hand and the assault of personal ambition on the other the interest of which i have speak be inseparable from an inquire self govern community but stimulated doubtless at the present time by the unsettled condition of our relation with several foreign power by the new obligation result from a sudden extension of the field of enterprise by the spirit with which that field have be enter and the amazing energy with which its resource for meet the demand of humanity have be develop although disease assume at one time the characteristic of a widespread and devastating pestilence have leave its sad trace upon some portion of our country we have still the most abundant cause for reverent thankfulness to god for an accumulation of signal mercy shower upon we as a nation it be well that a consciousness of rapid advancement and increase strength be habitually associate with an abide sense of dependence upon he who hold in his hand the destiny of man and of nation recognize the wisdom of the broad principle of absolute religious toleration proclaim in our fundamental law and rejoice in the benign influence which it have exert upon our social and political condition i should shrink from a clear duty do i fail to express my deep conviction that we can place no secure reliance upon any apparent progress if it be not sustain by national integrity rest upon the great truth affirm and illustrate by divine revelation in the midst of our sorrow for the afflicted and suffering it have be console to see how promptly disaster make true neighbor of district and city separate widely from each other and cheer to watch the strength of that common bond of brotherhood which unite all heart in all part of this union when danger threaten from abroad or calamity impend over we at home our diplomatic relation with foreign power have undergo no essential changesince the adjournment of the last congress with some of they question of a disturbing character be still pende but there be good reason to believe that these may all be amicably adjust for some year past great britain have so construe the first article of the convention of the 20th of april 1818 in regard to the fishery on the northeastern coast as to exclude our citizen from some of the fishing ground to which they freely resort for nearly a quarter of a century subsequent to the date of that treaty the united states have never acquiesce in this construction but have always claim for their fisherman all the right which they have so long enjoy without molestation with a view to remove all difficulty on the subject to extend the right of our fisherman beyond the limit fix by the convention of 1818 and to regulate trade between the united states and the british north american provinces a negotiation have be open with a fair prospect of a favorable result to protect our fisherman in the enjoyment of their right and prevent collision between they and british fisherman i deem it expedient to station a naval force in that quarter during the fishing season embarrassing question have also arise between the two government in regard to central america great britain have propose to settle they by an amicable arrangement and our minister at london be instruct to enter into negotiation on that subject a commission for adjust the claim of our citizen against great britain and those of british subject against the united states organize under the convention of the 8th of february last be now sit in london for the transaction of business it be in many respect desirable that the boundary line between the united states and the british provinces in the northwest as designate in the convention of the 15th of june 1846 and especially that part which separate the territory of washington from the british possession on the north should be trace and mark i therefore present the subject to your notice with france our relation continue on the most friendly footing the extensive commerce between the united states and that country might it be conceive be release from some unnecessary restriction to the mutual advantage of both party with a view to this object some progress have be make in negotiate a treaty of commerce and navigation independently of our valuable trade with spain we have important political relation with she grow out of our neighborhood to the island of cuba and porto rico i be happy to announce that since the last congress no attempt have be make by unauthorized expedition within the united states against either of those colony should any movement be manifest within our limit all the mean at my command will be vigorously exert to repress it several annoying occurrence have take place at havana or in the vicinity of the island of cuba between our citizen and the spanish authority consider the proximity of that island to our shore lie as it do in the track of trade between some of our principal city and the suspicious vigilance with which foreign intercourse particularly that with the united states be there guard a repetition of such occurrence may well be apprehend as no diplomatic intercourse be allow between our consul at havana and the captain general of cuba ready explanation can not be make or prompt redress afford where injury have result all complaint on the part of our citizen under the present arrangement must be in the first place present to this government and then refer to spain spain again refer it to her local authority in cuba for investigation and postpone an answer till she have hear from those authority to avoid these irritate and vexatious delay a proposition have be make to provide for a direct appeal for redress to the captain general by our consul in behalf of our injure fellow citizen hitherto the government of spain have decline to enter into any such arrangement this course on her part be deeply regret for without some arrangement of this kind the good understanding between the two country may be expose to occasional interruption our minister at madrid be instruct to renew the proposition and to press it again upon the consideration of her catholic majesty 's government for several year spain have be call the attention of this government to a claim for loss by some of her subject in the case of the schooner amistad this claim be believe to rest on the obligation impose by our exist treaty with that country its justice be admit in our diplomatic correspondence with the spanish government as early as march 1847 and one of my predecessor in his annual message of that year recommend that provision should be make for its payment in january last it be again submit to congress by the executive it have receive a favorable consideration by committee of both branch but as yet there have be no final action upon it i conceive that good faith require its prompt adjustment and i present it to your early and favorable consideration martin koszta a hungarian by birth come to this country in 1850 and declare his intention in due form of law to become a citizen of the united states after remain here nearly two year he visit turkey while at smyrna he be forcibly seize take on board an austrian brig of war then lie in the harbor of that place and there confine in iron with the avow design to take he into the dominion of austria our consul at smyrna and legation at constantinople interpose for his release but their effort be ineffectual while thus in prison commander ingraham with the united states ship of war st. louis arrive at smyrna and after inquire into the circumstance of the case come to the conclusion that koszta be entitle to the protection of this government and take energetic and prompt measure for his release under an arrangement between the agent of the united states and of austria he be transfer to the custody of the french consul general at smyrna there to remain until he should be dispose of by the mutual agreement of the consul of the respective government at that place pursuant to that agreement he have be release and be now in the united states the emperor of austria have make the conduct of our officer who take part in this transaction a subject of grave complaint regard koszta as still his subject and claim a right to seize he within the limit of the turkish empire he have demand of this government its consent to the surrender of the prisoner a disavowal of the act of its agent and satisfaction for the alleged outrage after a careful consideration of the case i come to the conclusion that koszta be seize without legal authority at smyrna that he be wrongfully detain on board of the austrian brig of war that at the time of his seizure he be clothe with the nationality of the united states and that the act of our officer under the circumstance of the case be justifiable and their conduct have be fully approve by i and a compliance with the several demand of the emperor of austria have be decline for a more full account of this transaction and my view in regard to it i refer to the correspondence between the charge d'affaires of austria and the secretary of state which be herewith transmit the principle and policy therein maintain on the part of the united states will whenever a proper occasion occur be apply and enforce the condition of china at this time render it probable that some important change will occur in that vast empire which will lead to a more unrestricted intercourse with it the commissioner to that country who have be recently appoint be instruct to avail himself of all occasion to open and extend our commercial relation not only with the empire of china but with other asiatic nation in 1852 an expedition be send to japan under the command of commodore perry for the purpose of open commercial intercourse with that empire intelligence have be receive of his arrival there and of his having make known to the emperor of japan the object of his visit but it be not yet ascertain how far the emperor will be dispose to abandon his restrictive policy and open that populous country to a commercial intercourse with the united states it have be my earnest desire to maintain friendly intercourse with the government upon this continent and to aid they in preserve good understanding among themselves with mexico a dispute have arise as to the true boundary line between our territory of new mexico and the mexican state of chihuahua a former commissioner of the united states employ in run that line pursuant to the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo make a serious mistake in determine the initial point on the rio grande but inasmuch as his decision be clearly a departure from the direction for trace the boundary contain in that treaty and be not concur in by the surveyor appoint on the part of the united states whose concurrence be necessary to give validity to that decision this government be not conclude thereby but that of mexico take a different view of the subject there be also other question of considerable magnitude pende between the two republic our minister in mexico have ample instruction to adjust they negotiation have be open but sufficient progress have not be make therein to enable i to speak of the probable result impressed with the importance of maintain amicable relation with that republic and of yield with liberality to all her just claim it be reasonable to expect that an arrangement mutually satisfactory to both country may be conclude and a last friendship between they confirm and perpetuate congress having provide for a full mission to the states of central america a minister be send thither in july last as yet he have have time to visit only one of these states nicaragua where he be receive in the most friendly manner it be hope that his presence and good office will have a benign effect in compose the dissension which prevail among they and in establish still more intimate and friendly relation between they respectively and between each of they and the united states consider the vast region of this continent and the number of state which would be make accessible by the free navigation of the river amazon particular attention have be give to this subject brazil through whose territory it pass into the ocean have hitherto persist in a policy so restrict in regard to the use of this river as to obstruct and nearly exclude foreign commercial intercourse with the states which lie upon its tributary and upper branch our minister to that country be instruct to obtain a relaxation of that policy and to use his effort to induce the brazilian government to open to common use under proper safeguard this great natural highway for international trade several of the south american states be deeply interested in this attempt to secure the free navigation of the amazon and it be reasonable to expect their cooperation in the measure as the advantage of free commercial intercourse among nation be well understood more liberal view be generally entertain as to the common right of all to the free use of those mean which nature have provide for international communication to these more liberal and enlightened view it be hope that brazil will conform her policy and remove all unnecessary restriction upon the free use of a river which traverse so many state and so large a part of the continent i be happy to inform you that the republic of paraguay and the argentine confederation have yield to the liberal policy still resist by brazil in regard to the navigable river within their respective territory treaty embrace this subject among other have be negotiate with these government which will be submit to the senate at the present session a new branch of commerce important to the agricultural interest of the united states have within a few year past be open with peru notwithstanding the inexhaustible deposit of guano upon the island of that country considerable difficulty be experience in obtain the requisite supply measure have be take to remove these difficulty and to secure a more abundant importation of the article unfortunately there have be a serious collision between our citizen who have resort to the chincha islands for it and the peruvian authority station there redress for the outrage commit by the latter be promptly demand by our minister at lima this subject be now under consideration and there be reason to believe that peru be disposed to offer adequate indemnity to the aggrieved party we be thus not only at peace with all foreign country but in regard to political affair be exempt from any cause of serious disquietude in our domestic relation the controversy which have agitate the country heretofore be pass away with the cause which produce they and the passion which they have awaken or if any trace of they remain it may be reasonably hope that it will only be perceive in the zealous rivalry of all good citizen to testify their respect for the right of the states their devotion to the union and their common determination that each one of the states its institution its welfare and its domestic peace shall be hold alike secure under the sacred aegis of the constitution this new league of amity and of mutual confidence and support into which the people of the republic have enter happily afford inducement and opportunity for the adoption of a more comprehensive and unembarrassed line of policy and action as to the great material interest of the country whether regard in themselves or in connection with the power of the civilized world the united states have continue gradually and steadily to expand through acquisition of territory which how much soever some of they may have be question be now universally see and admit to have be wise in policy just in character and a great element in the advancement of our country and with it of the human race in freedom in prosperity and in happiness the thirteen state have grow to be thirty one with relation reach to europe on the one side and on the other to the distant realm of asia i be deeply sensible of the immense responsibility which the present magnitude of the republic and the diversity and multiplicity of its interest devolve upon i the alleviation of which so far as relate to the immediate conduct of the public business be first in my reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of the two houses of congress and secondly in the direction afford i by the principle of public polity affirm by our father of the epoch of 1798 sanction by long experience and consecrate anew by the overwhelming voice of the people of the united states recur to these principle which constitute the organic basis of union we perceive that vast as be the function and the duty of the federal government vest in or intrust to its three great department the legislative executive and judicial yet the substantive power the popular force and the large capacity for social and material development exist in the respective states which all be of themselves well constitute republic as they precede so they alone be capable of maintain and perpetuate the american union the federal government have its appropriate line of action in the specific and limited power confer on it by the constitution chiefly as to those thing in which the states have a common interest in their relation to one another and to foreign government while the great mass of interest which belong to cultivate man the ordinary business of life the spring of industry all the diversify personal and domestic affair of society rest securely upon the general reserve power of the people of the several states there be the effective democracy of the nation and there the vital essence of its being and its greatness of the practical consequence which flow from the nature of the federal government the primary one be the duty of administer with integrity and fidelity the high trust repose in it by the constitution especially in the application of the public fund as draw by taxation from the people and appropriate to specific object by congress happily i have no occasion to suggest any radical change in the financial policy of the government ours be almost if not absolutely the solitary power of christendom have a surplus revenue draw immediately from impost on commerce and therefore measure by the spontaneous enterprise and national prosperity of the country with such indirect relation to agriculture manufacture and the product of the earth and sea as to violate no constitutional doctrine and yet vigorously promote the general welfare neither as to the source of the public treasure nor as to the manner of keep and manage it do any grave controversy now prevail there be a general acquiescence in the wisdom of the present system the report of the secretary of the treasury will exhibit in detail the state of the public finance and the condition of the various branch of the public service administer by that department of the government the revenue of the country levy almost insensibly to the taxpayer go on from year to year increase beyond either the interest or the prospective want of the government at the close of the fiscal year end june 30 1852 there remain in the treasury a balance of $ 14,632,136 the public revenue for the fiscal year end june 30 1853 amount to $ 58,931,865 from custom and to $ 2,405,708 from public land and other miscellaneous source amount together to $ 61,337,574 while the public expenditure for the same period exclusive of payment on account of the public debt amount to $ 43,554,262 leave a balance of $ 32,425,447 of receipt above expenditure this fact of increase surplus in the treasury become the subject of anxious consideration at a very early period of my administration and the path of duty in regard to it seem to i obvious and clear namely first to apply the surplus revenue to the discharge of the public debt so far as it could judiciously be do and secondly to devise mean for the gradual reduction of the revenue to the standard of the public exigency of these object the first have be in the course of accomplishment in a manner and to a degree highly satisfactory the amount of the public debt of all class be on the 4th of march 1853 $ 69,190,037 payment on account of which have be make since that period to the amount of $ 12,703,329 leave unpaid and in continuous course of liquidation the sum of $ 56,486,708 these payment although make at the market price of the respective class of stock have be effect readily and to the general advantage of the treasury and have at the same time prove of signal utility in the relief they have incidentally afford to the money market and to the industrial and commercial pursuit of the country the second of the above mention object that of the reduction of the tariff be of great importance and the plan suggest by the secretary of the treasury which be to reduce the duty on certain article and to add to the free list many article now tax and especially such as enter into manufacture and be not largely or at all produce in the country be commend to your candid and careful consideration you will find in the report of the secretary of the treasury also abundant proof of the entire adequacy of the present fiscal system to meet all the requirement of the public service and that while properly administer it operate to the advantage of the community in ordinary business relation i respectfully ask your attention to sundry suggestion of improvement in the settlement of account especially as regard the large sum of outstanding arrear due to the government and of other reform in the administrative action of his department which be indicate by the secretary as also to the progress make in the construction of marine hospital custom house and of a new mint in california and assay office in the city of new york heretofore provide for by congress and also to the eminently successful progress of the coast survey and of the light house board among the object merit your attention will be important recommendation from the secretaries of war and navy i be fully satisfied that the navy of the united states be not in a condition of strength and efficiency commensurate with the magnitude of our commercial and other interest and commend to your especial attention the suggestion on this subject make by the secretary of the navy i respectfully submit that the army which under our system must always be regard with the high interest as a nucleus around which the volunteer force of the nation gather in the hour of danger require augmentation or modification to adapt it to the present extend limit and frontier relation of the country and the condition of the indian tribe in the interior of the continent the necessity of which will appear in the communication of the secretaries of war and the interior in the administration of the post office department for the fiscal year end june 30 1853 the gross expenditure be $ 7,982,756 and the gross receipt during the same period $ 5,942,734 show that the current revenue fail to meet the current expense of the department by the sum of $ 2,042,032 the cause which under the present postal system and law lead inevitably to this result be fully explain by the report of the postmaster general one great cause be the enormous rate the department have be compel to pay for mail service render by railroad company the exhibit in the report of the postmaster general of the income and expenditure by mail steamer will be find peculiarly interesting and of a character to demand the immediate action of congress numerous and flagrant fraud upon the pension bureau have be bring to light within the last year and in some instance merit punishment inflict but unfortunately in other guilty party have escape not through the want of sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction but in consequence of the provision of limitation in the exist law from the nature of these claim the remoteness of the tribunal to pass upon they and the mode in which the proof be of necessity furnish temptation to crime have be greatly stimulate by the obvious difficulty of detection the defect in the law upon this subject be so apparent and so fatal to the end of justice that your early action relate to it be most desirable during the last fiscal year 9,819,411 acre of the public land have be survey and 10,363,891 acre bring into market within the same period the sale by public purchase and private entry amount to 1,083,495 acre locate under military bounty and warrant 6,142,360 acre locate under other certificate 9,427 acre cede to the states as swamp land 16,684,253 acre select for railroad and other object under act of congress 1,427,457 acre total amount of land dispose of within the fiscal year 25,346,992 acre which be an increase in quantity sell and locate under land warrant and grant of 12,231 818 acre over the fiscal year immediately precede the quantity of land sell during the second and third quarter of 1852 be 334,451 acre the amount receive therefor be $ 623,687 the quantity sell the second and third quarter of the year 1853 be 1,609,919 acre and the amount receive therefor $ 2,226,876.the whole number of land warrant issue under exist law prior to the 30th of september last be 266,042 of which there be outstanding at that date 66,947 the quantity of land require to satisfy these outstanding warrant be 4,778,120 acre warrant have be issue to 30th of september last under the act of 11th february 1847 call for 12,879,280 acre under act of september 28 1850 and march 22 1852 call for 12,505,360 acre make a total of 25,384,640 acre it be believe that experience have verify the wisdom and justice of the present system with regard to the public domain in most essential particular you will perceive from the report of the secretary of the interior that opinion which have often be express in relation to the operation of the land system as not be a source of revenue to the federal treasury be erroneous the net profit from the sale of the public land to june 30 1853 amount to the sum of $ 53,289,465.i recommend the extension of the land system over the territories of utah and new mexico with such modification as their peculiarity may require regard our public domain as chiefly valuable to provide home for the industrious and enterprising i be not prepared to recommend any essential change in the land system except by modification in favor of the actual settler and an extension of the preemption principle in certain case for reason and on ground which will be fully develop in the report to be lay before you congress represent the proprietor of the territorial domain and charge especially with power to dispose of territory belong to the united states have for a long course of year begin with the administration of mr. jefferson exercise the power to construct road within the territories and there be so many and obvious distinction between this exercise of power and that of make road within the states that the former have never be consider subject to such objection as apply to the latter and such may now be consider the settle construction of the power of the federal government upon the subject numerous application have be and no doubt will continue to be make for grant of land in aid of the construction of railway it be not believe to be within the intent and meaning of the constitution that the power to dispose of the public domain should be use otherwise than might be expect from a prudent proprietor and therefore that grant of land to aid in the construction of road should be restrict to case where it would be for the interest of a proprietor under like circumstance thus to contribute to the construction of these work for the practical operation of such grant thus far in advance the interest ot the states in which the work be locate and at the same time the substantial interest of all the other states by enhance the value and promote the rapid sale of the public domain i refer you to the report of the secretary of the interior a careful examination however will show that this experience be the result of a just discrimination and will be far from afford encouragement to a reckless or indiscriminate extension of the principle i commend to your favorable consideration the man of genius of our country who by their invention and discovery in science and art have contribute largely to the improvement of the age without in many instance secure for themselves anything like an adequate reward for many interesting detail upon this subject i refer you to the appropriate report and especially urge upon your early attention the apparently slight but really important modification of exist law therein suggest the liberal spirit which have so long mark the action of congress in relation to the district of columbia will i have no doubt continue to be manifest the erection of an asylum for the insane of the district of columbia and of the army and navy of the united states have be somewhat retarded by the great demand for material and labor during the past summer but full preparation for the reception of patient before the return of another winter be anticipate and there be the good reason to believe from the plan and contemplated arrangement which have be devise with the large experience furnish within the last few year in relation to the nature and treatment of the disease that it will prove an asylum indeed to this most helpless and afflict class of sufferer and stand as a noble monument of wisdom and mercy under the act of congress of august 31 1852 and of march 3 1853 design to secure for the city of washington and georgetown an abundant supply of good and wholesome water it become my duty to examine the report and plan of the engineer who have charge of the survey under the act first name the good if not the only plan calculate to secure permanently the object seek be that which contemplate take the water from the great falls of the potomac and consequently i give to it my approval for the progress and present condition of this important work and for its demand so far as appropriation be concern i refer you to the report of the secretary of war the present judicial system of the united states have now be in operation for so long a period of time and have in its general theory and much of its detail become so familiar to the country and acquire so entirely the public confidence that if modify in any respect it should only be in those particular which may adapt it to the increase extent population and legal business of the united states in this relation the organization of the court be now confessedly inadequate to the duty to be perform by they in consequence of which the states of florida wisconsin iowa texas and california and district of other states be in effect exclude from the full benefit of the general system by the function of the circuit court be devolve on the district judge in all those states or part of states the spirit of the constitution and a due regard to justice require that all the states of the union should be place on the same footing in regard to the judicial tribunal i therefore commend to your consideration this important subject which in my judgment demand the speedy action of congress i will present to you if deem desirable a plan which i be prepared to recommend for the enlargement and modification of the present judicial system the act of congress establish the smithsonian institution provide that the president of the united states and other person therein designate should constitute an establishment by that name and that the member should hold state and special meeting for the supervision of the affair of the institution the organization not having take place it seem to i proper that it should be effect without delay this have be do and an occasion be thereby present for inspect the condition of the institution and appreciate its successful progress thus far and its high promise of great and general usefulness i have omit to ask your favorable consideration for the estimate of work of a local character in twenty seven of the thirty one states amount to $ 1,754,500 because independently of the ground which have so often be urge against the application of the federal revenue for work of this character inequality with consequent injustice be inherent in the nature of the proposition and because the plan have prove entirely inadequate to the accomplishment of the object seek the subject of internal improvement claim alike the interest and good will of all have nevertheless be the basis of much political discussion and have stand as a deep graven line of division between statesman of eminent ability and patriotism the rule of strict construction of all power delegate by the states to the general government have array itself from time to time against the rapid progress of expenditure from the national treasury on work of a local character within the states memorable as an epoch in the history of this subject be the message of president jackson of the 27th of may 1830 which meet the system of internal improvement in its comparative infancy but so rapid have be its growth that the project appropriation in that year for work of this character have rise to the alarming amount of more than $ 100,000,000in that message the president admit the difficulty of bring back the operation of the government to the construction of the constitution set up in 1798 and mark it as an admonitory proof of the necessity of guard that instrument with sleepless vigilance against the authority of precedent which have not the sanction of its most plainly define power our government exist under a write compact between sovereign state unite for specific object and with specific grant to their general agent if then in the progress of its administration there have be departure from the term and intent of the compact it be and will ever be proper to refer back to the fixed standard which our father leave we and to make a stern effort to conform our action to it it would seem that the fact of a principle having be resist from the first by many of the wise and most patriotic man of the republic and a policy having provoke constant strife without arrive at a conclusion which can be regard as satisfactory to its most earnest advocate should suggest the inquiry whether there may not be a plan likely to be crown by happy result without perceive any sound distinction or intend to assert any principle as oppose to improvement need for the protection of internal commerce which do not equally apply to improvement upon the seaboard for the protection of foreign commerce i submit to you whether it may not be safely anticipate that if the policy be once settle against appropriation by the general government for local improvement for the benefit of commerce locality require expenditure would not by mode and mean clearly legitimate and proper raise the fund necessary for such construction as the safety or other interest of their commerce might require if that can be regard as a system which in the experience of mere than thirty year have at no time so command the public judgment as to give it the character of a settle policy which though it have produce some work of concede importance have be attend with an expenditure quite disproportionate to their value and have result in squander large sum upon object which have answer no valuable purpose the interest of all the states require it to be abandon unless hope may be indulge for the future which find no warrant in the past with an anxious desire for the completion of the work which be regard by all good citizen with sincere interest i have deem it my duty to ask at your hand a deliberate reconsideration of the question with a hope that animate by a desire to promote the permanent and substantial interest of the country your wisdom may prove equal to the task of devise and mature a plan which apply to this subject may promise something well than constant strife the suspension of the power of local enterprise the exciting of vain hope and the disappointment of cherished expectation in expend the appropriation make by the last congress several case have arise in relation to work for the improvement of harbor which involve question as to the right of soil and jurisdiction and have threaten conflict between the authority of the state and general governments the right to construct a breakwater jetty or dam would seem necessarily to carry with it the power to protect and preserve such construction this can only be effectually do by have jurisdiction over the soil but no clause of the constitution be find on which to rest the claim of the united states to exercise jurisdiction over the soil of a state except that confer by the eighth section of the first article of the constitution it be then submit whether in all case where construction be to be erect by the general government the right of soil should not first be obtain and legislative provision be make to cover all such case for the progress make in the construction of road within the territories as provide for in the appropriation of the last congress i refer you to the report of the secretary of war there be one subject of a domestic nature which from its intrinsic importance and the many interesting question of future policy which it involve can not fail to receive your early attention i allude to the mean of communication by which different part of the wide expanse of our country be to be place in close connection for purpose both of defense and commercial intercourse and more especially such as appertain to the communication of those great division of the union which lie on the opposite side of the rocky mountains that the government have not be unmindful of this heretofore be apparent from the aid it have afford through appropriation for mail facility and other purpose but the general subject will now present itself under aspect more imposing and more purely national by reason of the survey order by congress and now in the process of completion for communication by railway across the continent and wholly within the limit of the united states the power to declare war to raise and support army to provide and maintain a navy and to call forth the militia to execute the law suppress insurrection and repel invasion be confer upon congress as mean to provide for the common defense and to protect a territory and a population now widespread and vastly multiply as incidental to and indispensable for the exercise of this power it must sometimes be necessary to construct military road and protect harbor of refuge to appropriation by congress for such object no sound objection can be raise happily for our country its peaceful policy and rapidly increase population impose upon we no urgent necessity for preparation and leave but few trackless desert between assailable point and a patriotic people ever ready and generally able to protect they these necessary link the enterprise and energy of our people be steadily and boldly struggle to supply all experience affirm that wherever private enterprise will avail it be most wise for the general government to leave to that and individual watchfulness the location and execution of all mean of communication the survey before allude to be design to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the river mississippi to the pacific ocean party be now in the field make exploration where previous examination have not supply sufficient datum and where there be the good reason to hope the object seek might be find the mean and time be both limit it be not to be expect that all the accurate knowledge desire will be obtain but it be hope that much and important information will be add to the stock previously possess and that partial if not full report of the survey order will be receive in time for transmission to the two houses of congress on or before the first monday in february next as require by the act of appropriation the magnitude of the enterprise contemplate have arouse and will doubtless continue to excite a very general interest throughout the country in its political its commercial and its military bearing it have vary great and increase claim to consideration the heavy expense the great delay and at time fatality attend travel by either of the isthmus route have demonstrate the advantage which would result from interterritorial communication by such safe and rapid mean as a railroad would supply these difficulty which have be encounter in a period of peace would be magnify and still far increase in time of war but whilst the embarrassment already encounter and other under new contingency to be anticipate may serve strikingly to exhibit the importance of such a work neither these nor all consideration combine can have an appreciable value when weigh against the obligation strictly to adhere to the constitution and faithfully to execute the power it confer within this limit and to the extent of the interest of the government involve it would seem both expedient and proper if an economical and practicable route shall be find to aid by all constitutional mean in the construction of a road which will unite by speedy transit the population of the pacific and atlantic states to guard against misconception it should be remark that although the power to construct or aid in the construction of a road within the limit of a territory be not embarrassed by that question of jurisdiction which would arise within the limit of a state it be nevertheless hold to be of doubtful power and more than doubtful propriety even within the limit of a territory for the general government to undertake to administer the affair of a railroad a canal or other similar construction and therefore that its connection with a work of this character should be incidental rather than primary i will only add at present that fully appreciate the magnitude of the subject and solicitous that the atlantic and pacific shore of the republic may be bind together by inseparable tie of common interest as well as of common fealty and attachment to the union i shall be dispose so far as my own action be concern to follow the light of the constitution as expound and illustrate by those whose opinion and exposition constitute the standard of my political faith in regard to the power of the federal government it be i trust not necessary to say that no grandeur of enterprise and no present urgent inducement promise popular favor will lead i to disregard those light or to depart from that path which experience have prove to be safe and which be now radiant with the glow of prosperity and legitimate constitutional progress we can afford to wait but we can not afford to overlook the ark of our security it be no part of my purpose to give prominence to any subject which may properly be regard as set at rest by the deliberate judgment of the people but while the present be bright with promise and the future full of demand and inducement for the exercise of active intelligence the past can never be without useful lesson of admonition and instruction if its danger serve not as beacon they will evidently fail to fulfill the object of a wise design when the grave shall have close over all who be now endeavor to meet the obligation of duty the year 1850 will be recur to as a period fill with anxious apprehension a successful war have just terminate peace bring with it a vast augmentation of territory disturb question arise bear upon the domestic institution of one portion of the confederacy and involve the constitutional right of the states but notwithstanding difference of opinion and sentiment which then exist in relation to detail and specific provision the acquiescence of distinguished citizen whose devotion to the union can never be doubt have give renew vigor to our institution and restore a sense of repose and security to the public mind throughout the confederacy that this repose be to suffer no shock during my official term if i have power to avert it those who place i here may be assure the wisdom of man who know what independence cost who have put all at stake upon the issue of the revolutionary struggle dispose of the subject to which i refer in the only way consistent with the union of these states and with the march of power and prosperity which have make we what we be it be a significant fact that from the adoption of the constitution until the officer and soldier of the revolution have pass to their grave or through the infirmity of age and wound have cease to participate actively in public affair there be not merely a quiet acquiescence in but a prompt vindication of the constitutional right of the states the reserved power be scrupulously respect no statesman put forth the narrow view of casuist to justify interference and agitation but the spirit of the compact be regard as sacred in the eye of honor and indispensable for the great experiment of civil liberty which environ by inherent difficulty be yet bear forward in apparent weakness by a power superior to all obstacle there be no condemnation which the voice of freedom will not pronounce upon we should we prove faithless to this great trust while man inhabit different part of this vast continent can no more be expect to hold the same opinion or entertain the same sentiment than every variety of climate or soil can be expect to furnish the same agricultural product they can unite in a common object and sustain common principle essential to the maintenance of that object the gallant man of the south and the north could stand together during the struggle of the revolution they could stand together in the more trying period which succeed the clangor of arm as their united valor be adequate to all the trial of the camp and danger of the field so their united wisdom prove equal to the great task of found upon a deep and broad basis institution which it have be our privilege to enjoy and will ever be our most sacred duty to sustain it be but the feeble expression of a faith strong and universal to say that their son whose blood mingle so often upon the same field during the war of 1812 and who have more recently bear in triumph the flag of the country upon a foreign soil will never permit alienation of feeling to weaken the power of their united effort nor internal dissension to paralyze the great arm of freedom uplifted for the vindication of self government i have thus briefly present such suggestion as seem to i especially worthy of your consideration in provide for the present you can hardly fail to avail yourself of the light which the experience of the past cast upon the future the growth of our population have now bring we in the destine career of our national history to a point at which it well behoove we to expand our vision over the vast prospective the successive decennial return of the census since the adoption of the constitution have reveal a law of steady progressive development which may be state in general term as a duplication every quarter century carry forward from the point already reach for only a short period of time as applicable to the existence of a nation this law of progress if unchecked will bring we to almost incredible result a large allowance for a diminished proportional effect of emigration would not very materially reduce the estimate while the increase average duration of human life know to have already result from the scientific and hygienic improvement of the past fifty year will tend to keep up through the next fifty or perhaps hundred the same ratio of growth which have be thus reveal in our past progress and to the influence of these cause may be add the influx of labor masse from eastern asia to the pacific side of our possession together with the probable accession of the population already exist in other part of our hemisphere which within the period in question will feel with yearly increase force the natural attraction of so vast powerful and prosperous a confederation of self govern republic and will seek the privilege of be admit within its safe and happy bosom transfer with themselves by a peaceful and healthy process of incorporation spacious region of virgin and exuberant soil which be destine to swarm with the fast grow and fast spread million of our race these consideration seem fully to justify the presumption that the law of population above state will continue to act with undiminished effect through at least the next half century and that thousand of person who have already arrive at maturity and be now exercise the right of freeman will close their eye on the spectacle of more than 100,000,000 of population embrace within the majestic proportion of the american union it be not merely as an interesting topic of speculation that i present these view for your consideration they have important practical bearing upon all the political duty we be call upon to perform heretofore our system of government have work on what may be term a miniature scale in comparison with the development which it must thus assume within a future so near at hand as scarcely to be beyond the present of the exist generation it be evident that a confederation so vast and so varied both in number and in territorial extent in habit and in interest could only be keep in national cohesion by the strict fidelity to the principle of the constitution as understand by those who have adhere to the most restricted construction of the power grant by the people and the states interpret and apply accord to those principle the great compact adapt itself with healthy ease and freedom to an unlimited extension of that benign system of federative self government of which it be our glorious and i trust immortal charter let we then with redouble vigilance be on our guard against yield to the temptation of the exercise of doubtful power even under the pressure of the motive of concede temporary advantage and apparent temporary expediency the minimum of federal government compatible with the maintenance of national unity and efficient action in our relation with the rest of the world should afford the rule and measure of construction of our power under the general clause of the constitution a spirit of strict deference to the sovereign right and dignity of every state rather than a disposition to subordinate the states into a provincial relation to the central authority should characterize all our exercise of the respective power temporarily vest in we as a sacred trust from the generous confidence of our constituent in like manner as a manifestly indispensable condition of the perpetuation of the union and of the realization of that magnificent national future advert to do the duty become yearly strong and clear upon we as citizen of the several states to cultivate a fraternal and affectionate spirit language and conduct in regard to other states and in relation to the varied interest institution and habit of sentiment and opinion which may respectively characterize they mutual forbearance respect and noninterference in our personal action as citizen and an enlarged exercise of the most liberal principle of comity in the public dealing of state with state whether in legislation or in the execution of law be the mean to perpetuate that confidence and fraternity the decay of which a mere political union on so vast a scale could not long survive in still another point of view be an important practical duty suggest by this consideration of the magnitude of dimension to which our political system with its correspond machinery of government be so rapidly expand with increase vigilance do it require we to cultivate the cardinal virtue of public frugality and official integrity and purity public affair ought to be so conduct that a settle conviction shall pervade the entire union that nothing short of the high tone and standard of public morality mark every part of the administration and legislation of the general government thus will the federal system whatever expansion time and progress may give it continue more and more deeply rooted in the love and confidence of the people that wise economy which be as far remove from parsimony as from corrupt and corrupt extravagance that single regard for the public good which will frown upon all attempt to approach the treasury with insidious project of private interest cloak under public pretext that sound fiscal administration which in the legislative department guard against the dangerous temptation incident to overflow revenue and in the executive maintain an unsleeping watchfulness against the tendency of all national expenditure to extravagance while they be admit elementary political duty may i trust be deem as properly advert to and urge in view of the more impressive sense of that necessity which be directly suggest by the consideration now present since the adjournment of congress the vice president of the united states have pass from the scene of earth without having enter upon the duty of the station to which he have be call by the voice of his countryman having occupy almost continuously for more than thirty year a seat in one or the other of the two houses of congress and have by his singular purity and wisdom secure unbounded

to the senate of the united states
 in transmit to the senate the report of the secretary of state together with the document therein refer to be the correspondence call for by the resolution of that body of the 9th of january last i deem it proper to state briefly the reason which have deter i from send to the senate for ratification the propose convention between the united states of america and the united mexican states conclude by the respective plenipotentiary of the two government on the 21st day of march 1853 on the subject of a transit way across the isthmus of tehuantepec
 without advert to the want of authority on the part of the american minister to conclude any such convention or to the action of this government in relation to the right of certain of its citizen under the grant for a like object originally make to jos&eacute garay the objection to it upon its face be numerous and should in my judgment be regard as conclusive
 prominent among these objection be the fact that the convention bind we to a foreign government to guarantee the contract of a private company with that government for the construction of the contemplated transit way to protect the person engage and property employ in the construction of the say work from the commencement thereof to its completion against all confiscation spoliation or violence of whatsoever nature and to guarantee the entire security of the capital invest therein during the continuance of the contract such be the substance of the second and third article
 hence it will be perceive that the obligation which this government be ask to assume be not to terminate in a few year or even with the present generation
 and again if the regulation which may be prescribe concern the traffic on say transit way shall be clearly contrary to the spirit and intention of this convention even then this government be not to be at liberty to withdraw its protection and guaranty without first give one year&#39; notice to the mexican government
 when the fact be duly consider that the responsibility of this government be thus pledge for a long series of year to the interest of a private company establish for purpose of internal improvement in a foreign country and that country peculiarly subject to civil war and other public vicissitude it will be see how comprehensive and embarrassing would be those engagement to the government of the united states
 not less important than this objection be the consideration that the united states can not agree to the term of this convention without disregard the provision of the eighth article of the convention which this government enter into with great britain on april 19 1850 which expressly include any interoceanic communication whatever by the isthmus of tehuantepec however inconvenient may be the condition of that convention still they exist and the obligation of good faith rest alike upon the united states and great britain
 without enlarge upon these and other questionable feature of the propose convention which will suggest themselves to your mind i will only add that after the most careful consideration i have deem it my duty not to ask for its ratification by the senate

to the senate and house of representatives
 i transmit herewith report of the secretary of state the secretary of the navy and the attorney general in reply to a resolution of the senate of the 24th of march last and also to a resolution of the house of representatives of the 8th of may instant both have reference to the route of transit between the atlantic and pacific ocean through the republics of new granada and nicaragua and to the condition of affair in central america
 these document relate to question of the high importance and interest to the people of the united states
 the narrow isthmus which connect the continent of north and south america by the facility it afford for easy transit between the atlantic and pacific ocean render the country of central america an object of special consideration to all maritime nation which have be greatly augment in modern time by the operation of change in commercial relation especially those produce by the general use of steam as a motive power by land and sea to we on account of its geographical position and of our political interest as an american state of primary magnitude that isthmus be of peculiar importance just as the isthmus of suez be for correspond reason to the maritime power of europe but above all the importance to the united states of secure free transit across the american isthmus have render it of paramount interest to we since the settlement of the territories of oregon and washington and the accession of california to the union
 impel by these consideration the united states take step at an early day to assure suitable mean of commercial transit by canal railway or otherwise across this isthmus
 we conclude in the first place a treaty of peace amity navigation and commerce with the republic of new granada among the condition of which be a stipulation on the part of new granada guarantee to the united states the right of way or transit across that part of the isthmus which lie in the territory of new granada in consideration of which the united states guarantee in respect of the same territory the right of sovereignty and property of new granada
 the effect of this treaty be to afford to the people of the united states facility for at once open a common road from chagre to panama and for at length construct a railway in the same direction to connect regularly with steamship for the transportation of mail specie and passenger to and fro between the atlantic and pacific states and territories of the united states
 the united states also endeavor but unsuccessfully to obtain from the mexican republic the cession of the right of way at the northern extremity of the isthmus by tehuantepec and that line of communication continue to be an object of solicitude to the people of this republic
 in the meantime intervene between the republic of new granada and the mexican republic lie the states of guatemala salvador honduras nicaragua and costa rica the several member of the former republic of central america here in the territory of the central american states be the narrow part of the isthmus and hither of course public attention have be direct as the most invite field for enterprise of interoceanic communication between the opposite shore of america and more especially to the territory of the states of nicaragua and honduras
 paramount to that of any european state as be the interest of the united states in the security and freedom of project line of travel across the isthmus by the way of nicaragua and honduras still we do not yield in this respect to any suggestion of territorial aggrandizement or even of exclusive advantage either of communication or of commerce opportunity have not be want to the united states to procure such advantage by peaceful mean and with full and free assent of those who alone have any legitimate authority in the matter we disregard those opportunity from consideration alike of domestic and foreign policy just as even to the present day we have persevere in a system of justice and respect for the right and interest of other as well as our own in regard to each and all of the states of central america
 it be with surprise and regret therefore that the united states learn a few day after the conclusion of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo by which the united states become with the consent of the mexican republic the rightful owner of california and thus invest with augment special interest in the political condition of central america that a military expedition under the authority of the british government have land at san juan del norte in the state of nicaragua and take forcible possession of that port the necessary terminus of any canal or railway across the isthmus within the territory of nicaragua
 it do not diminish the unwelcomeness to we of this act on the part of great britain to find that she assume to justify it on the ground of an alleged protectorship of a small and obscure band of uncivilized indians whose proper name have even become lose to history who do not constitute a state capable of territorial sovereignty either in fact or of right and all political interest in whom and in the territory they occupy great britain have previously renounce by successive treaty with spain when spain be sovereign to the country and subsequently with independent spanish america
 nevertheless and injuriously affect as the united states conceive themselves to have be by this act of the british government and by its occupation about the same time of insular and of continental portion of the territory of the state of honduras we remember the many and powerful tie and mutual interest by which great britain and the united states be associate and we proceed in earnest good faith and with a sincere desire to do whatever might strengthen the bond of peace between we to negotiate with great britain a convention to assure the perfect neutrality of all interoceanic communication across the isthmus and as the indispensable condition of such neutrality the absolute independence of the states of central america and their complete sovereignty within the limit of their own territory as well against great britain as against the united states we suppose we have accomplish that object by the convention of april 19 1850 which would never have be sign nor ratify on the part of the united states but for the conviction that in virtue of its provision neither great britain nor the united states be thereafter to exercise any territorial sovereignty in fact or in name in any part of central america however or whensoever acquire either before or afterwards the essential object of the convention the neutralization of the isthmus would of course become a nullity if either great britain or the united states be to continue to hold exclusively island or mainland of the isthmus and more especially if under any claim of protectorship of indians either government be to remain forever sovereign in fact of the atlantic shore of the three states of costa rica nicaragua and honduras
 i have already communicate to the two houses of congress full information of the protracted and hitherto fruitless effort which the united states have make to arrange this international question with great britain it be refer to on the present occasion only because of its intimate connection with the special object now to be bring to the attention of congress
 the unsettled political condition of some of the spanish american republics have never cease to be regard by this government with solicitude and regret on their own account while it have be the source of continual embarrassment in our public and private relation with they in the midst of the violent revolution and the war by which they be continually agitate their public authority be unable to afford due protection to foreigner and to foreign interest within their territory or even to defend their own soil against individual aggressor foreign or domestic the burden of the inconvenience and loss of which therefore devolve in no inconsiderable degree upon the foreign state associate with they in close relation of geographical vicinity or of commercial intercourse
 such be more emphatically the situation of the united states with respect to the republics of mexico and of central america notwithstanding however the relative remoteness of the european states from america fact of the same order have not fail to appear conspicuously in their intercourse with spanish american republics great britain have repeatedly be constrain to recur to measure of force for the protection of british interest in those country france find it necessary to attack the castle of san juan de uloa and even to debark troop at vera cruz in order to obtain redress of wrong do to frenchmen in mexico
 what be memorable in this respect in the conduct and policy of the united states be that while it would be as easy for we to annex and absorb new territory in america as it be for european states to do this in asia or africa and while if do by we it might be justify as well on the alleged ground of the advantage which would accrue therefrom to the territory annex and absorb yet we have abstain from do it in obedience to consideration of right not less than of policy and that while the courageous and self reliant spirit of our people prompt they to hardy enterprise and they occasionally yield to the temptation of take part in the trouble of country near at hand where they know how potential their influence moral and material must be the american government have uniformly and steadily resist all attempt of individual in the united states to undertake armed aggression against friendly spanish american republics
 while the present incumbent of the executive office have be in discharge of its duty he have never fail to exert all the authority in he vest to repress such enterprise because they be in violation of the law of the land which the constitution require he to execute faithfully because they be contrary to the policy of the government and because to permit they would be a departure from good faith toward those american republics in amity with we which be entitle to and will never cease to enjoy in their calamity the cordial sympathy and in their prosperity the efficient good will of the government and of the people of the united states
 to say that our law in this respect be sometimes violate or successfully evade be only to say what be true of all law in all country but not more so in the united states than in any one whatever of the country of europe suffice it to repeat that the law of the united states prohibit all foreign military enlistment or expedition within our territory have be execute with impartial good faith and so far as the nature of thing permit as well in repression of private person as of the official agent of other government both of europe and america
 among the central american republics to which modern event have impart most prominence be that of nicaragua by reason of its particular position on the isthmus citizen of the united states have establish in its territory a regular interoceanic transit route second only in utility and value to the one previously establish in the territory of new granada the condition of nicaragua would it be believe have be much more prosperous than it have be but for the occupation of its only atlantic port by a foreign power and of the disturbing authority set up and sustain by the same power in a portion of its territory by mean of which its domestic sovereignty be impaired its public land be withhold from settlement and it be deprive of all the maritime revenue which it would otherwise collect on import merchandise at san juan del norte
 in these circumstance of the political debility of the republic of nicaragua and when its inhabitant be exhaust by long continue civil war between party neither of they strong enough to overcome the other or permanently maintain internal tranquillity one of the contend faction of the republic invite the assistance and cooperation of a small body of citizen of the united states from the state of california whose presence as it appear put an end at once to civil war and restore apparent order throughout the territory of nicaragua with a new administration have at its head a distinguished individual by birth a citizen of the republic d. patricio rivas as its provisional president
 it be the establish policy of the united states to recognize all government without question of their source or their organization or of the mean by which the govern person attain their power provide there be a government de facto accept by the people of the country and with reserve only of the time as to the recognition of revolutionary government arise out of the subdivision of parent state with which we be in relation of amity we do not go behind the fact of a foreign government exercise actual power to investigate question of legitimacy we do not inquire into the cause which may have lead to a change of government to we it be indifferent whether a successful revolution have be aid by foreign intervention or not whether insurrection have overthrow exist government and another have be establish in its place accord to preexist form or in a manner adopt for the occasion by those whom we may find in the actual possession of power all these matter we leave to the people and public authority of the particular country to determine and their determination whether it be by positive action or by ascertained acquiescence be to we a sufficient warranty of the legitimacy of the new government
 during the sixty seven year which have elapse since the establishment of the exist government of the united states in all which time this union have maintain undisturbed domestic tranquillity we have have occasion to recognize government de facto found either by domestic revolution or by military invasion from abroad in many of the governments of europe
 it be the more imperatively necessary to apply this rule to the spanish american republics in consideration of the frequent and not seldom anomalous change of organization or administration which they undergo and the revolutionary nature of most of these change of which the recent series of revolution in the mexican republic be an example where five successive revolutionary government have make their appearance in the course of a few month and be recognize successively each as the political power of that country by the united states
 when therefore some time since a new minister from the republic of nicaragua present himself bear the commission of president rivas he must and would have be receive as such unless he be find on inquiry subject to personal exception but for the absence of satisfactory information upon the question whether president rivas be in fact the head of an established government of the republic of nicaragua doubt as to which arise not only from the circumstance of his avow association with armed emigrant recently from the united states but that the propose minister himself be of that class of person and not otherwise or previously a citizen of nicaragua
 another minister from the republic of nicaragua have now present himself and have be receive as such satisfactory evidence appear that he represent the government de facto and so far as such exist the government de jure of that republic
 that reception while in accordance with the establish policy of the united states be likewise call for by the most imperative special exigency which require that this government shall enter at once into diplomatic relation with that of nicaragua in the first place a difference have occur between the government of president rivas and the nicaragua transit company which involve the necessity of inquiry into right of citizen of the united states who allege that they have be aggrieve by the act of the former and claim protection and redress at the hand of their government in the second place the interoceanic communication by the way of nicaragua be effectually interrupt and the person and property of unoffending private citizen of the united states in that country require the attention of their government neither of these object can receive due consideration without resumption of diplomatic intercourse with the government of nicaragua
 far than this the document communicate show that while the interoceanic transit by the way of nicaragua be cut off disturbance at panama have occur to obstruct temporarily at least that by the way of new granada involve the sacrifice of the life and property of citizen of the united states a special commissioner have be dispatch to panama to investigate the fact of this occurrence with a view particularly to the redress of party aggrieve but measure of another class will be demand for the future security of interoceanic communication by this as by the other route of the isthmus
 it would be difficult to suggest a single object of interest external or internal more important to the united states than the maintenance of the communication by land and sea between the atlantic and pacific states and territories of the union it be a material element of the national integrity and sovereignty
 i have adopt such precautionary measure and have take such action for the purpose of afford security to the several transit route of central america and to the person and property of citizen of the united states connect with or use the same as be within my constitutional power and as existing circumstance have seem to demand should these measure prove inadequate to the object that fact will be communicate to congress with such recommendation as the exigency of the case may indicate

to the senate of the united states
 i hasten to respond briefly to the resolution of the senate of this date request the president to inform the senate if in his opinion it be not incompatible with the public interest whether anything have arise since the date of his message to the house of representatives of the 15th of march last concern our relation with the government of spain which in his opinion may dispense with the suggestion therein contain touch the propriety of provisional measures&#39 by congress to meet any exigency that may arise in the recess of congress affect those relation
 in the message to the house of representatives refer to i avail myself of the occasion to present the follow reflection and suggestion
 in view of the position of the island of cuba its proximity to our coast the relation which it must ever bear to our commercial and other interest it be vain to expect that a series of unfriendly act infringe our commercial right and the adoption of a policy threaten the honor and security of these states can long consist with peaceful relation
 in case the measure take for amicable adjustment of our difficulty with spain should unfortunately fail i shall not hesitate to use the authority and mean which congress may grant to insure the observance of our just right to obtain redress for injury receive and to vindicate the honor of our flag
 in anticipation of that contingency which i earnestly hope may not arise i suggest to congress the propriety of adopt such provisional measure as the exigency may seem to demand
 the two houses of congress may have anticipate that the hope then express would be realize before the period of its adjournment and that our relation with spain would have assume a satisfactory condition so as to remove past cause of complaint and afford well security for tranquillity and justice in the future but i be constrain to say that such be not the fact the formal demand for immediate reparation in the case of the black warrior instead of having be meet on the part of spain by prompt satisfaction have only serve to call forth a justification of the local authority of cuba and thus to transfer the responsibility for their act to the spanish government itself
 meanwhile information not only reliable in its nature but of an official character be receive to the effect that preparation be make within the limit of the united states by private individual under military organization for a descent upon the island of cuba with a view to wrest that colony from the dominion of spain international comity the obligation of treaty and the express provision of law alike require in my judgment that all the constitutional power of the executive should be exert to prevent the consummation of such a violation of positive law and of that good faith on which mainly the amicable relation of neighboring nation must depend in conformity with these conviction of public duty a proclamation be issue to warn all person not to participate in the contemplated enterprise and to invoke the interposition in this behalf of the proper officer of the government no provocation whatever can justify private expedition of hostility against a country at peace with the united states the power to declare war be vest by the constitution in congress and the experience of our past history leave no room to doubt that the wisdom of this arrangement of constitutional power will continue to be verify whenever the national interest and honor shall demand a resort to ultimate measure of redress pende negotiation by the executive and before the action of congress individual could not be permit to embarrass the operation of the one and usurp the power of the other of these depositary of the function of government
 i have only to add that nothing have arise since the date of my former message to dispense with the suggestion therein contain touch the propriety of provisional measure by congress

i have receive the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the repair preservation and completion of certain public work heretofore commence under the authority of law it reach i in the expire hour of the session and time do not allow full opportunity for examine and consider its provision or of state at length the reason which forbid i to give it my signature
 it belong to that class of measure which be commonly know as internal improvement by the general government and which from a very early period have be deem of doubtful constitutionality and expediency and have thus fail to obtain the approbation of successive chief magistrates
 on such an examination of this bill as it have be in my power to make i recognize in it certain provision national in their character and which if they stand alone it would be compatible with my conviction of public duty to assent to but at the same time it embrace other which be merely local and not in my judgment warrant by any safe or true construction of the constitution
 to make proper and sound discrimination between these different pro vision would require a deliberate discussion of general principle as well as a careful scrutiny of detail for the purpose of rightfully apply those principle to each separate item of appropriation
 public opinion with regard to the value and importance of internal improvement in the country be undivide there be a disposition on all hand to have they prosecute with energy and to see the benefit seek to be attain by they fully realize
 the prominent point of difference between those who have be regard as the friend of a system of internal improvement by the general government and those adverse to such a system have be one of constitutional power though more or less connected with consideration of expediency
 my own judgment it be well know have on both ground be oppose to a general system of internal improvement by the federal government i have entertain the most serious doubt from the inherent difficulty of its application as well as from past unsatisfactory experience whether the power could be so exercise by the general government as to render its use advantageous either to the country at large or effectual for the accomplishment of the object contemplate
 i shall consider it incumbent on i to present to congress at its next session a mature view of the whole subject and to endeavor to define approximately at least and accord to my own conviction what appropriation of this nature by the general government the great interest of the united states require and the constitution will admit and sanction in case no substitute should be devise capable of reconcile difference both of constitutionality and expediency
 in the absence of the requisite mean and time for duly consider the whole subject at present and discuss such possible substitute it become necessary to return this bill to the house of representatives in which it originate and for the reason thus briefly submit to the consideration of congress to withhold from it my approval

the repeal of the missouri compromise and the propriety of its restoration constitute the subject of what i be about to say as i desire to present my own connected view of this subject my remark will not be specifically an answer to judge douglas yet as i proceed the main point he have present will arise and will receive such respectful attention as i may be able to give they i wish far to say that i do not propose to question the patriotism or to assail the motive of any man or class of man but rather to strictly confine myself to the naked merit of the question i also wish to be no less than national in all the position i may take and whenever i take ground which other have think or may think narrow sectional and dangerous to the union i hope to give a reason which will appear sufficient at least to some why i think differently and as this subject be no other than part and parcel of the large general question of domestic slavery i wish to make and to keep the distinction between the existing institution and the extension of it so broad and so clear that no honest man can misunderstand i and no dishonest one successfully misrepresent i in order to a clear understanding of what the missouri compromise be a short history of the precede kindre subject will perhaps be proper when we establish our independence we do not own or claim the country to which this compromise apply indeed strictly speak the confederacy then own no country at all the states respectively own the country within their limit and some of they own territory beyond their strict state limit virginia thus own the north western territory the country out of which the principal part of ohio all indiana all illinois all michigan and all wisconsin have since be form she also own perhaps within she then limit what have since be form into the state of kentucky north carolina thus own what be now the state of tennessee and south carolina and georgia in separate part own what be now mississippi and alabama connecticut i think own the little remain part of ohio be the same where they now send giddings to congress and beat all creation at make cheese these territory together with the states themselves constitute all the country over which the confederacy then claim any sort of jurisdiction we be then live under the articles of confederation which be supercede by the constitution several year afterwards the question of cede these territory to the general government be set on foot mr. jefferson the author of the declaration of independence and otherwise a chief actor in the revolution then a delegate in congress afterwards twice president who be be and perhaps will continue to be the most distinguished politician of our history a virginian by birth and continued residence and withal a slave holder conceive the idea of take that occasion to prevent slavery ever go into the north western territory he prevail on the virginia legislature to adopt his view and to cede the territory make the prohibition of slavery therein a condition of the deed congress accept the cession with the condition and in the first ordinance which the act of congress be then call for the government of the territory provide that slavery should never be permit therein this be the famed ordinance of 87 so often speak of thenceforward for sixty one year and until in 1848 the last scrap of this territory come into the union as the state of wisconsin all party act in quiet obedience to this ordinance it be now what jefferson foresee and intend the happy home of teem million of free white prosperous people and no slave amongst they thus with the author of the declaration of independence the policy of prohibit slavery in new territory originate thus away back of the constitution in the pure fresh free breath of the revolution the state of virginia and the national congress put that policy in practice thus through sixty odd of the good year of the republic do that policy steadily work to its great and beneficent end and thus in those five state and five million of free enterprise people we have before we the rich fruit of this policy but now new light break upon we now congress declare this ought never to have be and the like of it must never be again the sacred right of self government be grossly violate by it we even find some man who draw their first breath and every other breath of their life under this very restriction now live in dread of absolute suffocation if they should be restrict in the ldquo;sacred right&rdquo of take slave to nebraska that perfect liberty they sigh for the liberty of make slave of other people jefferson never think of their own father never think of they never think of themselves a year ago how fortunate for they they do not soon become sensible of their great misery oh how difficult it be to treat with respect such assault upon all we have ever really hold sacred but to return to history in 1803 we purchase what be then call louisiana of france it include the now state of louisiana arkansas missouri and iowa also the territory of minnesota and the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska slavery already exist among the french at new orleans and to some extent at st. louis in 1812 louisiana come into the union as a slave state without controversy in 1818 or 19 missouri show sign of a wish to come in with slavery this be resist by northern member of congress and thus begin the first great slavery agitation in the nation this controversy last several month and become very angry and exciting the house of representatives vote steadily for the prohibition of slavery in missouri and the senate voting as steadily against it threat of break up the union be freely make and the able public man of the day become seriously alarmed at length a compromise be make in which like all compromise both side yield something it be a law pass on the 6th day of march 1820 provide that missouri might come into the union with slavery but that in all the remain part of the territory purchase of france which lie north of 36 degree and 30 minute north latitude slavery should never be permit this provision of law be the missouri compromise in exclude slavery north of the line the same language be employ as in the ordinance of 87 it directly apply to iowa minnesota and to the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska whether there should or should not be slavery south of that line nothing be say in the law but arkansas constitute the principal remain part south of the line and it have since be admit as a slave state without serious controversy more recently iowa north of the line come in as a free state without controversy still later minnesota north of the line have a territorial organization without controversy texas principally south of the line and west of arkansas though originally within the purchase from france have in 1819 be trade off to spain in our treaty for the acquisition of florida it have thus become a part of mexico mexico revolutionize and become independent of spain american citizen begin settle rapidly with their slave in the southern part of texas soon they revolutionize against mexico and establish an independent government of their own adopt a constitution with slavery strongly resemble the constitution of our slave state by still another rapid move texas claim a boundary much far west than when we part with she in 1819 be bring back to the united states and admit into the union as a slave state there then be little or no settlement in the northern part of texas a considerable portion of which lie north of the missouri line and in the resolution admit she into the union the missouri restriction be expressly extend westward across her territory this be in 1845 only nine year ago thus originate the missouri compromise and thus have it be respect down to 1845 and even four year later in 1849 our distinguished senator in a public address hold the follow language in relation to it:&ldquo;the missouri compromise have be in practical operation for about a quarter of a century and have receive the sanction and approbation of man of all party in every section of the union it have allay all sectional jealousy and irritation grow out of this vex question and harmonize and tranquilize the whole country it have give to henry clay as its prominent champion the proud sobriquet of the ldquo;great pacificator&rdquo and by that title and for that service his political friend have repeatedly appeal to the people to rally under his standard as a presidential candidate as the man who have exhibit the patriotism and the power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation and preserve the union he be not aware that any man or any party from any section of the union have ever urge as an objection to mr. clay that he be the great champion of the missouri compromise on the contrary the effort be make by the opponent of mr. clay to prove that he be not entitle to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure and that the honor be equally due to other as well as to he for secure its adoption that it have its origin in the heart of all patriotic man who desire to preserve and perpetuate the blessing of our glorious union an origin akin that of the constitution of the united states conceive in the same spirit of fraternal affection and calculate to remove forever the only danger which seem to threaten at some distant day to sever the social bond of union all the evidence of public opinion at that day seem to indicate that this compromise have be canonize in the heart of the american people as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb.&rdquo;i do not read this extract to involve judge douglas in an inconsistency if he afterwards think he have be wrong it be right for he to change i bring this forward merely to show the high estimate place on the missouri compromise by all party up to so late as the year 1849.but go back a little in point of time our war with mexico break out in 1846 when congress be about adjourn that session president polk ask they to place two million of dollar under his control to be use by he in the recess if find practicable and expedient in negociate a treaty of peace with mexico and acquire some part of her territory a bill be duly get up for the purpose and be progress swimmingly in the house of representatives when a member by the name of david wilmot a democrat from pennsylvania move as an amendment ldquo;provide that in any territory thus acquire there shall never be slavery.&rdquo;this be the origin of the far fame ldquo;wilmot proviso.&rdquo it create a great flutter but it stick like wax be vote into the bill and the bill pass with it through the house the senate however adjourn without final action on it and so both appropriation and proviso be lose for the time the war continue and at the next session the president renew his request for the appropriation enlarge the amount i think to three million again come the proviso and defeat the measure congress adjourn again and the war go on in dec. 1847 the new congress assemble i be in the low house that term the ldquo;wilmot proviso&rdquo or the principle of it be constantly come up in some shape or other and i think i may venture to say i vote for it at least forty time during the short term i be there the senate however hold it in check and it never become law in the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace be make with mexico by which we obtain that portion of her country which now constitute the territory of new mexico and utah and the now state of california by this treaty the wilmot proviso be defeat as so far as it be intend to be a condition of the acquisition of territory its friend however be still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from get into the new country this new acquisition lie directly west of our old purchase from france and extend west to the pacific ocean and be so situated that if the missouri line should be extend straight west the new country would be divide by such extended line leave some north and some south of it on judge douglas motion a bill or provision of a bill pass the senate to so extend the missouri line the proviso man in the house include myself vote it down because by implication it give up the southern part to slavery while we be bent on have it all free in the fall of 1848 the gold mine be discover in california this attract people to it with unprecedented rapidity so that on or soon after the meeting of the new congress in dec. 1849 she already have a population of nearly a hundred thousand have call a convention form a state constitution exclude slavery and be knock for admission into the union the proviso man of course be for let she in but the senate always true to the other side would not consent to her admission and there california stand keep out of the union because she would not let slavery into her border under all the circumstance perhaps this be not wrong there be other point of dispute connect with the general question of slavery which equally need adjustment the south clamor for a more efficient fugitive slave law the north clamor for the abolition of a peculiar specie of slave trade in the district of columbia in connection with which in view from the window of the capitol a sort of negro livery stable where drove of negro be collect temporarily keep and finally take to southern market precisely like drove of horse have be openly maintain for fifty year utah and new mexico need territorial government and whether slavery should or should not be prohibit within they be another question the indefinite western boundary of texas be to be settle she be receive a slave state and consequently the farth west the slavery man could push her boundary the more slave country they secure and the farth east the slavery opponent could thrust the boundary back the less slave ground be secure thus this be just as clearly a slavery question as any of the other these point all need adjustment and they be all hold up perhaps wisely to make they help to adjust one another the union now as in 1820 be think to be in danger and devotion to the union rightfully incline man to yield somewhat in point where nothing else could have so incline they a compromise be finally effect the south get their new fugitive slave law and the north get california the far good part of our acquisition from mexico as a free state the south get a provision that new mexico and utah when admit as states may come in with or without slavery as they may then choose and the north get the slave trade abolish in the district of columbia the north get the western boundary of texas thence far back eastward than the south desire but in turn they give texas ten million of dollar with which to pay her old debt this be the compromise of 1850.precede the presidential election of 1852 each of the great political party democrats and whig meet in convention and adopt resolution endorse the compromise of 50 as a ldquo;finality,&rdquo a final settlement so far as these party could make it so of all slavery agitation previous to this in 1851 the illinois legislature have indorse it during this long period of time nebraska have remain substantially an uninhabited country but now emigration to and settlement within it begin to take place it be about one third as large as the present united states and its importance so long overlook begin to come into view the restriction of slavery by the missouri compromise directly apply to it in fact be first make and have since be maintain expressly for it in 1853 a bill to give it a territorial government pass the house of representatives and in the hand of judge douglas fail of pass the senate only for want of time this bill contain no repeal of the missouri compromise indeed when it be assail because it do not contain such repeal judge douglas defend it in its exist form on january 4th 1854 judge douglas introduce a new bill to give nebraska territorial government he accompany this bill with a report in which last he expressly recommend that the missouri compromise shall neither be affirm nor repeal before long the bill be so modified as to make two territory instead of one call the southern one kansas also about a month after the introduction of the bill on the judge 's own motion it be so amend as to declare the missouri compromise inoperative and void and substantially that the people who go and settle there may establish slavery or exclude it as they may see fit in this shape the bill pass both branch of congress and become a law this be the repeal of the missouri compromise the foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular but i be sure it be sufficiently so for all the use i shall attempt to make of it and in it we have before we the chief material enable we to correctly judge whether the repeal of the missouri compromise be right or wrong i think and shall try to show that it be wrong wrong in its direct effect let slavery into kansas and nebraska and wrong in its prospective principle allow it to spread to every other part of the wide world where man can be find incline to take it this declare indifference but as i must think covert real zeal for the spread of slavery i can not but hate i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself i hate it because it deprive our republican example of its just influence in the world enable the enemy of free institution with plausibility to taunt we as hypocrite cause the real friend of freedom to doubt our sincerity and especially because it force so many really good man amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principle of civil liberty criticise the declaration of independence and insist that there be no right principle of action but self interest before proceeding let i say i think i have no prejudice against the southern people they be just what we would be in their situation if slavery do not now exist amongst they they would not introduce it if it do now exist amongst we we should not instantly give it up this i believe of the masse north and south doubtless there be individual on both side who would not hold slave under any circumstance and other who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it be out of existence we know that some southern man do free their slave go north and become tip top abolitionist while some northern one go south and become most cruel slave master when southern people tell we they be no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we i acknowledge the fact when it be say that the institution exist and that it be very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way i can understand and appreciate the saying i surely will not blame they for not do what i should not know how to do myself if all earthly power be give i i should not know what to do as to the exist institution my first impulse would be to free all the slave and send they to liberia,---to their own native land but a moment 's reflection would convince i that whatever of high hope as i think there be there may be in this in the long run its sudden execution be impossible if they be all land there in a day they would all perish in the next ten day and there be not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry they there in many time ten day what then free they all and keep they among we as underling be it quite certain that this better their condition i think i would not hold one in slavery at any rate yet the point be not clear enough for i to denounce people upon what next free they and make they politically and socially our equal my own feeling will not admit of this and if mine would we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not whether this feel accord with justice and sound judgment be not the sole question if indeed it be any part of it a universal feeling whether well or ill found can not be safely disregarded we can not then make they equal it do seem to i that system of gradual emancipation might be adopt but for their tardiness in this i will not undertake to judge our brother of the south when they remind we of their constitutional right i acknowledge they not grudgingly but fully and fairly and i would give they any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitive which should not in its stringency be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than our ordinary criminal law be to hang an innocent one but all this to my judgment furnish no more excuse for permit slavery to go into our own free territory than it would for revive the african slave trade by law the law which forbid the bringing of slave from africa and that which have so long forbid the take they to nebraska can hardly be distinguish on any moral principle and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuse as that of the latter the argument by which the repeal of the missouri compromise be seek to be justify be these first that the nebraska country need a territorial government second that in various way the public have repudiate it and demand the repeal and therefore should not now complain of it and lastly that the repeal establish a principle which be intrinsically right i will attempt an answer to each of they in its turn first then if that country be in need of a territorial organization could it not have have it as well without as with the repeal iowa and minnesota to both of which the missouri restriction apply have without its repeal each in succession territorial organization and even the year before a bill for nebraska itself be within an ace of pass without the repeal clause and this in the hand of the same man who be now the champion of repeal why no necessity then for the repeal but still later when this very bill be first bring in it contain no repeal but say they because the public have demand or rather command the repeal the repeal be to accompany the organization whenever that should occur now i deny that the public ever demand any such thing ever repudiate the missouri compromise ever command its repeal i deny it and call for the proof it be not contend i believe that any such command have ever be give in express term it be only say that it be do in principle the support of the wilmot proviso be the first fact mention to prove that the missouri restriction be repudiate in principle and the second be the refusal to extend the missouri line over the country acquire from mexico these be near enough alike to be treat together the one be to exclude the chance of slavery from the whole new acquisition by the lump and the other be to reject a division of it by which one half be to be give up to those chance now whether this be a repudiation of the missouri line in principle depend upon whether the missouri law contain any principle require the line to be extend over the country acquire from mexico i contend it do not i insist that it contain no general principle but that it be in every sense specific that its term limit it to the country purchase from france be undenied and undeniable it could have no principle beyond the intention of those who make it they do not intend to extend the line to country which they do not own if they intend to extend it in the event of acquire additional territory why do they not say so it be just as easy to say that ` ` in all the country west of the mississippi which we now own or may hereafter acquire there shall never be slavery,&rdquo as to say what they do say and they would have say it if they have mean it an intention to extend the law be not only not mention in the law but be not mention in any contemporaneous history both the law itself and the history of the time be a blank as to any principle of extension and by neither the know rule for construe statute and contract nor by common sense can any such principle be infer another fact show the specific character of the missouri law show that it intend no more than it express show that the line be not intend as a universal dividing line between free and slave territory present and prospective north of which slavery could never go be the fact that by that very law missouri come in as a slave state north of the line if that law contain any prospective principle the whole law must be look to in order to ascertain what the principle be and by this rule the south could fairly contend that inasmuch as they get one slave state north of the line at the inception of the law they have the right to have another give they north of it occasionally now and then in the indefinite westward extension of the line this demonstrate the absurdity of attempt to deduce a prospective principle from the missouri compromise line when we vote for the wilmot proviso we be vote to keep slavery out of the whole missouri acquisition and little do we think we be thereby vote to let it into nebraska lay several hundred mile distant when we vote against extend the missouri line little do we think we be vote to destroy the old line then of near thirty year stand to argue that we thus repudiate the missouri compromise be no less absurd than it would be to argue that because we have so far forbear to acquire cuba we have thereby in principle repudiate our former acquisition and determine to throw they out of the union no less absurd than it would be to say that because i may have refuse to build an addition to my house i thereby have decide to destroy the exist house and if i catch you set fire to my house you will turn upon i and say i instruct you to do it the most conclusive argument however that while vote for the wilmot proviso and while vote against the extension of the missouri line we never think of disturb the original missouri compromise be find in the fact that there be then and still be an unorganized tract of fine country nearly as large as the state of missouri lie immediately west of arkansas and south of the missouri compromise line and that we never attempt to prohibit slavery as to it i wish particular attention to this it adjoin the original missouri compromise line by its northern boundary and consequently be part of the country into which by implication slavery be permit to go by that compromise there it have lain open ever since and there it still lie and yet no effort have be make at any time to wrest it from the south in all our struggle to prohibit slavery within our mexican acquisition we never so much as lift a finger to prohibit it as to this tract be not this entirely conclusive that at all time we have hold the missouri compromise as a sacred thing even when against ourselves as well as when for us?senator douglas sometimes say the missouri line itself be in principle only an extension of the line of the ordinance of 87 --that be to say an extension of the ohio river i think this be weak enough on its face i will remark however that as a glance at the map will show the missouri line be a long way far south than the ohio and that if our senator in propose his extension have stick to the principle of jogging southward perhaps it might not have be vote down so readily but next it be say that the compromise of 50 and the ratification of they by both political party in 52 establish a new principle which require the repeal of the missouri compromise this again i deny i deny it and demand the proof i have already state fully what the compromise of 50 be the particular part of those measure for which the virtual repeal of the missouri compromise be seek to be infer for it be admit they contain nothing about it in express term be the provision in the utah and new mexico law which permit they when they seek admission into the union as states to come in with or without slavery as they shall then see fit now i insist this provision be make for utah and new mexico and for no other place whatever it have no more direct reference to nebraska than it have to the territory of the moon but say they it have reference to nebraska in principle let we see the north consent to this provision not because they consider it right in itself but because they be compensate pay for it they at the same time get california into the union as a free state this be far the good part of all they have struggle for by the wilmot proviso they also get the area of slavery somewhat narrow in the settlement of the boundary of texas also they get the slave trade abolish in the district of columbia for all these desirable object the north could afford to yield something and they do yield to the south the utah and new mexico provision i do not mean that the whole north or even a majority yield when the law pass but enough yield when add to the vote of the south to carry the measure now can it be pretend that the principle of this arrangement require we to permit the same provision to be apply to nebraska without any equivalent at all give we another free state press the boundary of texas still far back give we another step toward the destruction of slavery in the district and you present we a similar case but ask we not to repeat for nothing what you pay for in the first instance if you wish the thing again pay again that be the principle of the compromise of 50 if indeed they have any principle beyond their specific term it be the system of equivalent again if congress at that time intend that all future territory should when admit as states come in with or without slavery at their own option why do it not say so with such an universal provision all know the bill could not have pass do they then could they establish a principle contrary to their own intention still far if they intend to establish the principle that wherever congress have control it should be leave to the people to do as they think fit with slavery why do they not authorize the people of the district of columbia at their adoption to abolish slavery within these limit i personally know that this have not be leave undo because it be unthought of it be frequently speak of by member of congress and by citizen of washington six year ago and i hear no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation with compensation to owner would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the district but without the action of congress they could say nothing and congress say ldquo;no.&rdquo in the measure of 1850 congress have the subject of slavery in the district expressly in hand if they be then establish the principle of allow the people to do as they please with slavery why do they not apply the principle to that people?again it be claim that by the resolutions of the illinois legislature pass in 1851 the repeal of the missouri compromise be demand this i deny also whatever may be work out by a criticism of the language of those resolution the people have never understand they as be any more than an endorsement of the compromise of 1850 and a release of our senator from vote for the wilmot proviso the whole people be live witness that this only be their view finally it be ask ldquo;if we do not mean to apply the utah and new mexico provision to all future territory what do we mean when we in 1852 endorse the compromise of 50?&rdquo;for myself i can answer this question most easily i mean not to ask a repeal or modification of the fugitive slave law i mean not to ask for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia i mean not to resist the admission of utah and new mexico even should they ask to come in as slave states i mean nothing about additional territory because as i understand we then have no territory whose character as to slavery be not already settle as to nebraska i regard its character as be fix by the missouri compromise for thirty year as unalterably fix as that of my own home in illinois as to new acquisition i say ldquo;sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof.&rdquo when we make new acquaintance we will as heretofore try to manage they some how that be my answer that be what i mean and say and i appeal to the people to say each for himself whether that be not also the universal meaning of the free state and now in turn let i ask a few question if by any or all these matter the repeal of the missouri compromise be command why be not the command soon obey why be the repeal omit in the nebraska bill of 1853 why be it omit in the original bill of 1854 why in the accompany report be such a repeal characterize as a departure from the course pursue in 1850 and its continue omission recommended?i be aware judge douglas now argue that the subsequent express repeal be no substantial alteration of the bill this argument seem wonderful to i it be as if one should argue that white and black be not different he admit however that there be a literal change in the bill and that he make the change in deference to other senators who would not support the bill without this prove that those other senators think the change a substantial one and that the judge think their opinion worth defer to his own opinion therefore seem not to rest on a very firm basis even in his own mind and i suppose the world believe and will continue to believe that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation have arise i conclude then that the public never demand the repeal of the missouri compromise i now come to consider whether the repeal with its avowed principle be intrinsically right i insist that it be not take the particular case a controversy have arise between the advocate and opponent of slavery in relation to its establishment within the country we have purchase of france the southern and then good part of the purchase be already in as a slave state the controversy be settle by also let missouri in as a slave state but with the agreement that within all the remain part of the purchase north of a certain line there should never be slavery as to what be to be do with the remain part south of the line nothing be say but perhaps the fair implication be that it should come in with slavery if it should so choose the southern part except a portion heretofore mention afterwards do come in with slavery as the state of arkansas all these many year since 1820 the northern part have remain a wilderness at length settlement begin in it also in due course iowa come in as a free state and minnesota be give a territorial government without remove the slavery restriction finally the sole remain part north of the line kansas and nebraska be to be organize and it be propose and carry to blot out the old dividing line of thirty four year stand and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery now this to my mind be manifestly unjust after an angry and dangerous controversy the party make friend by divide the bone of contention the one party first appropriate her own share beyond all power to be disturb in the possession of it and then seize the share of the other party it be as if two starve man have divide their only loaf the one have hastily swallow his half and then grab the other half just as he be put it to his mouth!let i here drop the main argument to notice what i consider rather an inferior matter it be argue that slavery will not go to kansas and nebraska in any event this be a palliation a lullaby i have some hope that it will not but let we not be too confident as to climate a glance at the map show that there be five slave states delaware maryland virginia kentucky and missouri and also the district of columbia all north of the missouri compromise line the census return of 1850 show that within these there be 867,276 slave be more than one fourth of all the slave in the nation it be not climate then that will keep slavery out of these territory be there any thing in the peculiar nature of the country missouri adjoin these territory by her entire western boundary and slavery be already within every one of her western county i have even hear it say that there be more slave in proportion to white in the north western county of missouri than within any county of the state slavery press entirely up to the old western boundary of the state and when rather recently a part of that boundary at the north west be move out a little far west slavery follow on quite up to the new line now when the restriction be remove what be to prevent it from go still far climate will not no peculiarity of the country will nothing in nature will will the disposition of the people prevent it those near the scene be all in favor of the extension the yankee who be oppose to it may be more numerous but in military phrase the battle field be too far from their base of operation but it be say there now be no law in nebraska on the subject of slavery and that in such case take a slave there operate his freedom that be good book law but be not the rule of actual practice wherever slavery be it have be first introduce without law the old law we find concern it be not law introduce it but regulate it as an already exist thing a white man take his slave to nebraska now who will inform the negro that he be free who will take he before court to test the question of his freedom in ignorance of his legal emancipation he be keep chop splitting and plowing other be bring and move on in the same track at last if ever the time for voting come on the question of slavery the institution already in fact exist in the country and can not well be remove the fact of its presence and the difficulty of its removal will carry the vote in its favor keep it out until a vote be take and a vote in favor of it can not be get in any population of forty thousand on earth who have be draw together by the ordinary motive of emigration and settlement to get slave into the country simultaneously with the white in the incipient stage of settlement be the precise stake play for and win in this nebraska measure the question be ask we ldquo;if slave will go in notwithstanding the general principle of law liberate they why would they not equally go in against positive statute law?---go in even if the missouri restriction be maintained?&rdquo i answer because it take a much bold man to venture in with his property in the latter case than in the former because the positive congressional enactment be know to and respect by all or nearly all whereas the negative principle that no law be free law be not much know except among lawyer we have some experience of this practical difference in spite of the ordinance of 87 a few negro be bring into illinois and hold in a state of quasi slavery not enough however to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they come to form a constitution but in the adjoining missouri country where there be no ordinance of 87 --wa no restriction they be carry ten time nay a hundred time as fast and actually make a slave state this be fact naked fact another lullaby argument be that take slave to new country do not increase their number do not make any one slave who otherwise would be free there be some truth in this and i be glad of it but it not wholly true the african slave trade be not yet effectually suppress and if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people amongst we who be foreigner and the descendant of foreigner arrive here since 1808 we shall find the increase of the black population out run that of the white to an extent unaccountable except by suppose that some of they too have be come from africa if this be so the opening of new country to the institution increase the demand for and augment the price of slave and so do in fact make slave of freeman by cause they to be bring from africa and sell into bondage but however this may be we know the opening of new country to slavery tend to the perpetuation of the institution and so do keep man in slavery who otherwise would be free this result we do not feel like favor and we be under no legal obligation to suppress our feeling in this respect equal justice to the south it be say require we to consent to the extending of slavery to new country that be to say inasmuch as you do not object to my take my hog to nebraska therefore i must not object to you take your slave now i admit this be perfectly logical if there be no difference between hog and negro but while you thus require i to deny the humanity of the negro i wish to ask whether you of the south yourself have ever be willing to do as much it be kindly provide that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage be natural tyrant that percentage be no large in the slave states than in the free the great majority south as well as north have human sympathy of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain these sympathy in the bosom of the southern people manifest in many way their sense of the wrong of slavery and their consciousness that after all there be humanity in the negro if they deny this let i address they a few plain question in 1820 you join the north almost unanimously in declare the african slave trade piracy and in annexing to it the punishment of death why do you do this if you do not feel that it be wrong why do you join in provide that man should be hang for it the practice be no more than bring wild negro from africa to sell to such as would buy they but you never think of hang man for catch and sell wild horse wild buffalo or wild bear again you have amongst you a sneak individual of the class of native tyrant know as the ldquo;slave dealer.&rdquo he watch your necessity and crawl up to buy your slave at a speculating price if you can not help it you sell to he but if you can help it you drive he from your door you despise he utterly you do not recognize he as a friend or even as an honest man your child must not play with his they may rollick freely with the little negro but not with the ldquo;slave dealers&rdquo child if you be oblige to deal with he you try to get through the job without so much as touch he it be common with you to join hand with the man you meet but with the slave dealer you avoid the ceremony instinctively shrink from the snaky contact if he grow rich and retire from business you still remember he and still keep up the ban of non intercourse upon he and his family now why be this you do not so treat the man who deal in corn cattle or tobacco and yet again there be in the united states and territory include the district of columbia 433,643 free black at $ 500 per head they be worth over two hundred million of dollar how come this vast amount of property to be run about without owner we do not see free horse or free cattle run at large how be this all these free black be the descendant of slave or have be slave themselves and they would be slave now but for something which have operate on their white owner induce they at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate they what be that something be there any mistake it in all these case it be your sense of justice and human sympathy continually tell you that the poor negro have some natural right to himself that those who deny it and make mere merchandise of he deserve kicking contempt and death and now why will you ask we to deny the humanity of the slave and estimate he only as the equal of the hog why ask we to do what you will not do yourself why ask we to do for nothing what two hundred million of dollar could not induce you to do?but one great argument in the support of the repeal of the missouri compromise be still to come that argument be ldquo;the sacred right of self government.&rdquo it seem our distinguished senator have find great difficulty in get his antagonist even in the senate to meet he fairly on this argument some poet have say ldquo;fool rush in where angel fear to tread.&rdquo;at the hazzard of be think one of the fool of this quotation i meet that argument i rush in i take that bull by the horn i trust i understand and truly estimate the right of self government my faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he please with all which be exclusively his own lie at the foundation of the sense of justice there be in i i extend the principle to community of man as well as to individual i so extend it because it be politically wise as well as naturally just politically wise in save we from broil about matter which do not concern we here or at washington i would not trouble myself with the oyster law of virginia or the cranberry law of indiana the doctrine of self government be right absolutely and eternally right but it have no just application as here attempt or perhaps i should rather say that whether it have such just application depend upon whether a negro be not or be a man if he be not a man why in that case he who be a man may as a matter of self government do just as he please with he but if the negro be a man be it not to that extent a total destruction of self government to say that he too shall not govern himself when the white man govern himself that be self government but when he govern himself and also govern another man that be more than self government that be despotism if the negro be a man why then my ancient faith teach i that ldquo;all man be create equal;&rdquo and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man 's make a slave of another judge douglas frequently with bitter irony and sarcasm paraphrase our argument by say ldquo;the white people of nebraska be good enough to govern themselves but they be not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes!!&rdquo;well i doubt not that the people of nebraska be and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere i do not say the contrary what i do say be that no man be good enough to govern another man without that other 's consent i say this be the lead principle the sheet anchor of american republicanism our declaration of independence says:&ldquo;we hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal that they be endow by their creator with certain inalienable right that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these right government be institute among man derive their just power from the consent of the governed.&rdquo;i have quote so much at this time merely to show that accord to our ancient faith the just power of government be derive from the consent of the governed now the relation of master and slave be pro tanto a total violation of this principle the master not only govern the slave without his consent but he govern he by a set of rule altogether different from those which he prescribe for himself allow all the govern an equal voice in the government and that and that only be self government let it not be say i be contend for the establishment of political and social equality between the white and black i have already say the contrary i be not now combat the argument of necessity arise from the fact that the black be already amongst we but i be combat what be set up as moral argument for allow they to be take where they have never yet be argue against the extension of a bad thing which where it already exist we must of necessity manage as we good can in support of his application of the doctrine of self government senator douglas have seek to bring to his aid the opinion and example of our revolutionary father i be glad he have do this i love the sentiment of those old time man and shall be most happy to abide by their opinion he show we that when it be in contemplation for the colony to break off from great britain and set up a new government for themselves several of the state instruct their delegate to go for the measure provide each state should be allowed to regulate its domestic concern in its own way i do not quote but this in substance this be right i see nothing objectionable in it i also think it probable that it have some reference to the existence of slavery amongst they i will not deny that it have but have it in any reference to the carrying of slavery into new country that be the question and we will let the father themselves answer it this same generation of man and mostly the same individual of the generation who declare this principle who declare independence who fight the war of the revolution through who afterwards make the constitution under which we still live these same man pass the ordinance of 87 declare that slavery should never go to the north west territory i have no doubt judge douglas think they be very inconsistent in this it be a question of discrimination between they and he but there be not an inch of ground leave for his claim that their opinion their example their authority be on his side in this controversy again be not nebraska while a territory a part of we do we not own the country and if we surrender the control of it do we not surrender the right of self government it be part of ourselves if you say we shall not control it because it be only part the same be true of every other part and when all the part be go what have become of the whole what be then leave of we what use for the general government when there be nothing leave for it govern?but you say this question should be leave to the people of nebraska because they be more particularly interested if this be the rule you must leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have slave what well moral right have thirty one citizen of nebraska to say that the thirty second shall not hold slave than the people of the thirty one states have to say that slavery shall not go into the thirty second state at all?but if it be a sacred right for the people of nebraska to take and hold slave there it be equally their sacred right to buy they where they can buy they cheap and that undoubtedly will be on the coast of africa provide you will consent to not hang they for go there to buy they you must remove this restriction too from the sacred right of self government i be aware you say that take slave from the states of nebraska do not make slave of freeman but the african slave trader can say just as much he do not catch free negro and bring they here he find they already slave in the hand of their black captor and he honestly buy they at the rate of about a red cotton handkerchief a head this be very cheap and it be a great abridgement of the sacred right of self government to hang man for engage in this profitable trade!another important objection to this application of the right of self government be that it enable the first few to deprive the succeed many of a free exercise of the right of self government the first few may get slavery in and the subsequent many can not easily get it out how common be the remark now in the slave states---&ldquo;if we be only clear of our slave how much well it would be for us.&rdquo they be actually deprive of the privilege of govern themselves as they would by the action of a very few in the beginning the same thing be true of the whole nation at the time our constitution be form whether slavery shall go into nebraska or other new territory be not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there the whole nation be interested that the good use shall be make of these territory we want they for the home of free white people this they can not be to any considerable extent if slavery shall be plant within they slave states be place for poor white people to remove from not to remove to new free state be the place for poor people to go to and well their condition for this use the nation need these territory still far there be constitutional relation between the slave and free states which be degrade to the latter we be under legal obligation to catch and return their runaway slave to they a sort of dirty disagreeable job which i believe as a general rule the slave holder will not perform for one another then again in the control of the government the management of the partnership affair they have greatly the advantage of we by the constitution each state have two senator each have a number of representatives in proportion to the number of its people and each have a number of presidential elector equal to the whole number of its senators and representatives together but in ascertain the number of the people for this purpose five slave be count as be equal to three white the slave do not vote they be only count and so used as to swell the influence of the white people 's vote the practical effect of this be more aptly show by a comparison of the states of south carolina and maine south carolina have six representative and so have maine south carolina have eight presidential elector and so have maine this be precise equality so far and of course they be equal in senator each have two thus in the control of the government the two states be equal precisely but how be they in the number of their white people maine have 581,813 --while south carolina have 274,567 maine have twice as many as south carolina and 32,679 over thus each white man in south carolina be more than the double of any man in maine this be all because south carolina besides her free people have 384,984 slave the south carolinian have precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free state as well as in maine he be more than the double of any one of we in this crowd the same advantage but not to the same extent be hold by all the citizen of the slave states over those of the free and it be an absolute truth without an exception that there be no voter in any slave state but who have more legal power in the government than any voter in any free state there be no instance of exact equality and the disadvantage be against we the whole chapter through this principle in the aggregate give the slave states in the present congress twenty additional representative be seven more than the whole majority by which they pass the nebraska bill now all this be manifestly unfair yet i do not mention it to complain of it in so far as it be already settle it be in the constitution and i do not for that cause or any other cause propose to destroy or alter or disregard the constitution i stand to it fairly fully and firmly but when i be tell i must leave it altogether to other people to say whether new partner be to be breed up and bring into the firm on the same degrading term against i i respectfully demur i insist that whether i shall be a whole man or only the half of one in comparison with other be a question in which i be somewhat concerned and one which no other man can have a sacred right of decide for i if i be wrong in this if it really be a sacred right of self government in the man who shall go to nebraska to decide whether he will be the equal of i or the double of i then after he shall have exercise that right and thereby shall have reduce i to a still small fraction of a man than i already be i should like for some gentleman deeply skilled in the mystery of sacred right to provide himself with a microscope and peep about and find out if he can what have become of my sacred right they will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye finally i insist that if there be any thing which it be the duty of the whole people to never entrust to any hand but their own that thing be the preservation and perpetuity of their own liberty and institution and if they shall think as i do that the extension of slavery endanger they more than any or all other cause how recreant to themselves if they submit the question and with it the fate of their country to a mere hand full of man bent only on temporary self interest if this question of slavery extension be an insignificant one one have no power to do harm it might be shuffle aside in this way but be as it be the great behemoth of danger shall the strong gripe of the nation be loosen upon he to entrust he to the hand of such feeble keepers?i have do with this mighty argument of self government go sacred thing go in peace but nebraska be urge as a great union save measure well i too go for save the union much as i hate slavery i would consent to the extension of it rather than see the union dissolve just as i would consent to any great evil to avoid a greater one but when i go to union saving i must believe at least that the mean i employ have some adaptation to the end to my mind nebraska have no such adaptation.&ldquo;it hath no relish of salvation in it.&rdquo;it be an aggravation rather of the only one thing which ever endanger the union when it come upon we all be peace and quiet the nation be look to the forming of new bond of union and a long course of peace and prosperity seem to lie before we in the whole range of possibility there scarcely appear to i to have be any thing out of which the slavery agitation could have be revive except the very project of repeal the missouri compromise every inch of territory we own already have a definite settlement of the slavery question and by which all party be pledge to abide indeed there be no uninhabited country on the continent which we could acquire if we except some extreme northern region which be wholly out of the question in this state of case the genius of discord himself could scarcely have invent a way of again get we by the ear but by turn back and destroy the peace measure of the past the council of that genius seem to have prevail the missouri compromise be repeal and here we be in the midst of a new slavery agitation such i think as we have never see before who be responsible for this be it those who resist the measure or those who causelessly bring it forward and press it through have reason to know and in fact know it must and would be so resisted it could not but be expect by its author that it would be look upon as a measure for the extension of slavery aggravate by a gross breach of faith argue as you will and long as you will this be the naked front and aspect of the measure and in this aspect it could not but produce agitation slavery be found in the selfishness of man 's nature opposition to it be his love of justice these principle be an eternal antagonism and when bring into collision so fiercely as slavery extension bring they shock and throe and convulsion must ceaselessly follow repeal the missouri compromise repeal all compromise repeal the declaration of independence repeal all past history you still can not repeal human nature it still will be the abundance of man 's heart that slavery extension be wrong and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will continue to speak the structure too of the nebraska bill be very peculiar the people be to decide the question of slavery for themselves but when they be to decide or how they be to decide or whether when the question be once decide it be to remain so or be it to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trial the law do not say be it to be decide by the first dozen settler who arrive there or be it to await the arrival of a hundred be it to be decide by a vote of the people or a vote of the legislature or indeed by a vote of any sort to these question the law give no answer there be a mystery about this for when a member propose to give the legislature express authority to exclude slavery it be hoot down by the friend of the bill this fact be worth remember some yankee in the east be send emigrant to nebraska to exclude slavery from it and so far as i can judge they expect the question to be decide by vote in some way or other but the missourians be awake too they be within a stone 's throw of the contest ground they hold meeting and pass resolution in which not the slight allusion to voting be make they resolve that slavery already exist in the territory that more shall go there that they remain in missouri will protect it and that abolitionist shall be hung or drive away through all this bowie knife and six shooter be see plainly enough but never a glimpse of the ballot box and really what be to be the result of this each party within have numerous and determined backer without be it not probable that the contest will come to blow and bloodshed could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence on the slavery question than this nebraska project be i do not charge or believe that such be intend by congress but if they have literally form a ring and place champion within it to fight out the controversy the fight could be no more likely to come off than it be and if this fight should begin be it likely to take a very peaceful union save turn will not the first drop of blood so shed be the real knell of the union?the missouri compromise ought to be restore for the sake of the union it ought to be restore we ought to elect a house of representatives which will vote its restoration if by any mean we omit to do this what follow slavery may or may not be establish in nebraska but whether it be or not we shall have repudiate discard from the council of the nation the spirit of compromise for who after this will ever trust in a national compromise the spirit of mutual concession that spirit which first give we the constitution and which have thrice save the union we shall have strangle and cast from we forever and what shall we have in lieu of it the south flush with triumph and tempt to excess the north betray as they believe brood on wrong and burn for revenge one side will provoke the other resent the one will taunt the other defy one agree the other retaliate already a few in the north defy all constitutional restraint resist the execution of the fugitive slave law and even menace the institution of slavery in the state where it exist already a few in the south claim the constitutional right to take to and hold slave in the free state demand the revival of the slave trade and demand a treaty with great britain by which fugitive slave may be reclaim from canada as yet they be but few on either side it be a grave question for the lover of the union whether the final destruction of the missouri compromise and with it the spirit of all compromise will or will not embolden and embitter each of these and fatally increase the number of both but restore the compromise and what then we thereby restore the national faith the national confidence the national feeling of brotherhood we thereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise that spirit which have never fail we in past peril and which may be safely trust for all the future the south ought to join in do this the peace of the nation be as dear to they as to we in memory of the past and hope of the future they share as largely as we it would be on their part a great act great in its spirit and great in its effect it would be worth to the nation a hundred year purchase of peace and prosperity and what of sacrifice would they make they only surrender to we what they give we for a consideration long long ago what they have not now ask for struggle or care for what have be thrust upon they not less to their own astonishment than to ours but it be say we can not restore it that though we elect every member of the low house the senate be still against we it be quite true that of the senators who pass the nebraska bill a majority of the whole senate will retain their seat in spite of the election of this and the next year but if at these election their several constituency shall clearly express their will against nebraska will these senator disregard their will will they neither obey nor make room for those who will?but even if we fail to technically restore the compromise it be still a great point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration the moral weight of such a vote can not be estimate too highly the author of nebraska be not at all satisfied with the destruction of the compromise an endorsement of this principle they proclaim to be the great object with they nebraska alone be a small matter to establish a principle for future use be what they particularly desire that future use be to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world local and unorganized opposition can not prevent it now if you wish to give they this endorsement if you wish to establish this principle do so i shall regret it but it be your right on the contrary if you be oppose to the principle intend to give it no such endorsement let no wheedling no sophistry divert you from throw a direct vote against it some man mostly whig who condemn the repeal of the missouri compromise nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration lest they be throw in company with the abolitionist will they allow i as an old whig to tell they good humoredly that i think this be very silly stand with anybody that stand right stand with he while he be right and part with he when he go wrong stand with the abolitionist in restore the missouri compromise and stand against he when he attempt to repeal the fugitive slave law in the latter case you stand with the southern disunionist what of that you be still right in both case you be right in both case you oppose the dangerous extreme in both you stand on middle ground and hold the ship level and steady in both you be national and nothing less than national this be good old whig ground to desert such ground because of any company be to be less than a whig less than a man less than an american i particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of this nebraska law give to slavery in the body politic i object to it because it assume that there can be moral right in the enslaving of one man by another i object to it as a dangerous dalliance for a few people a sad evidence that feel prosperity we forget right that liberty as a principle we have cease to revere i object to it because the father of the republic eschew and reject it the argument of ldquo;necessity&rdquo be the only argument they ever admit in favor of slavery and so far and so far only as it carry they do they ever go they find the institution exist among we which they could not help and they cast blame upon the british king for having permit its introduction before the constitution they prohibit its introduction into the north western territory the only country we own then free from it at the framing and adoption of the constitution they forbear to so much as mention the word ldquo;slave&rdquo or ldquo;slavery&rdquo in the whole instrument in the provision for the recovery of fugitive the slave be speak of as a ldquo;person hold to service or labor.&rdquo in that prohibit the abolition of the african slave trade for twenty year that trade be speak of as ldquo;the migration or importation of such person as any of the states now exist shall think proper to admit,&rdquo amp;c these be the only provision allude to slavery thus the thing be hide away in the constitution just as an afflicted man hide away a wen or a cancer which he dares not cut out at once lest he blee to death with the promise nevertheless that the cutting may begin at the end of a give time less than this our father could not do and now they would not do necessity drive they so far and far they would not go but this be not all the early congress under the constitution take the same view of slavery they hedge and hem it in to the narrow limit of necessity in 1794 they prohibit an out go slave trade that is the taking of slave from the united states to sell in 1798 they prohibit the bringing of slave from africa into the mississippi territory this territory then comprise what be now the states of mississippi and alabama this be ten year before they have the authority to do the same thing as to the states exist at the adoption of the constitution in 1800 they prohibit american citizen from trade in slave between foreign country as for instance from africa to brazil in 1803 they pass a law in aid of one or two state law in restraint of the internal slave trade in 1807 in apparent hot haste they pass the law nearly a year in advance to take effect the first day of 1808 --the very first day the constitution would permit prohibit the african slave trade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalty in 1820 find these provision ineffectual they declare the trade piracy and annex to it the extreme penalty of death while all this be pass in the general government five or six of the original slave states have adopt system of gradual emancipation and by which the institution be rapidly become extinct within these limit thus we see the plain unmistakable spirit of that age towards slavery be hostility to the principle and toleration only by necessity.but now it be to be transform into a ldquo;sacred right.&rdquo nebraska bring it forth place it on the high road to extension and perpetuity and with a pat on its back say to it ldquo;go and god speed you.&rdquo henceforth it be to be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure head of the ship of state little by little but steadily as man 's march to the grave we have be give up the old for the new faith near eighty year ago we begin by declare that all man be create equal but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration that for some man to enslave other be a ldquo;sacre right of self government.&rdquo these principle can not stand together they be as opposite as god and mammon and whoever hold to the one must despise the other when pettit in connection with his support of the nebraska bill call the declaration of independence ldquo;a self evident lie&rdquo he only do what consistency and candor require all other nebraska man to do of the forty odd nebraska senators who sit present and hear he no one rebuke he nor be i apprize that any nebraska newspaper or any nebraska orator in the whole nation have ever yet rebuke he if this have be say among marion 's man southerners though they be what would have become of the man who say it if this have be say to the man who capture andre the man who say it would probably have be hang soon than andre be if it have be say in old independence hall seventy eight year ago the very door keeper would have throttle the man and thrust he into the street let no one be deceive the spirit of seventy six and the spirit of nebraska be utter antagonism and the former be be rapidly displace by the latter fellow countryman americans south as well as north shall we make no effort to arrest this already the liberal party throughout the world express the apprehension ldquo;that the one retrograde institution in america be undermine the principle of progress and fatally violate the noble political system the world ever saw.&rdquo this be not the taunt of enemy but the warning of friend be it quite safe to disregard it to despise it be there no danger to liberty itself in discard the early practice and first precept of our ancient faith in our greedy chase to make profit of the negro let we beware lest we ldquo;cancel and tear to pieces&rdquo even the white man 's charter of freedom our republican robe be soil and trail in the dust let we repurify it let we turn and wash it white in the spirit if not the blood of the revolution let we turn slavery from its claim of ldquo;moral right,&rdquo back upon its exist legal right and its argument of ldquo;necessity.&rdquo let we return it to the position our father give it and there let it rest in peace let we re adopt the declaration of independence and with it the practice and policy which harmonize with it let north and south let all americans let all lover of liberty everywhere join in the great and good work if we do this we shall not only have save the union but we shall have so save it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the saving we shall have so save it that the succeed million of free happy people the world over shall rise up and call we bless to the late generation at springfield twelve day ago where i have speak substantially as i have here judge douglas reply to i and as he be to reply to i here i shall attempt to anticipate he by notice some of the point he make there he commence by state i have assume all the way through that the principle of the nebraska bill would have the effect of extend slavery he deny that this be intended or that this effect would follow i will not re open the argument upon this point that such be the intention the world believe at the start and will continue to believe this be the countenance of the thing and both friend and enemy instantly recognize it as such that countenance can not now be change by argument you can as easily argue the color out of the negro skin like the ldquo;bloody hand&rdquo you may wash it and wash it the red witness of guilt still stick and stare horribly at you next he say congressional intervention never prevent slavery any where that it do not prevent it in the north west territory now in illinois that in fact illinois come into the union as a slave state that the principle of the nebraska bill expel it from illinois from several old states from every where now this be mere quibble all the way through if the ordinance of 87 do not keep slavery out of the north west territory how happen it that the north west shore of the ohio river be entirely free from it while the south east shore less than a mile distant along nearly the whole length of the river be entirely cover with it?if that ordinance do not keep it out of illinois what be it that make the difference between illinois and missouri they lie side by side the mississippi river only divide they while their early settlement be within the same latitude between 1810 and 1820 the number of slave in missouri increased 7,211 while in illinois in the same ten year they decrease 51 this appear by the census return during nearly all of that ten year both be territory not state during this time the ordinance forbid slavery to go into illinois and nothing forbid it to go into missouri it do go into missouri and do not go into illinois that be the fact can any one doubt as to the reason of it?but he say illinois come into the union as a slave state silence perhaps would be the good answer to this flat contradiction of the know history of the country what be the fact upon which this bold assertion be base when we first acquire the country as far back as 1787 there be some slave within it hold by the french inhabitant at kaskaskia the territorial legislation admit a few negro from the slave states as indenture servant one year after the adoption of the first state constitution the whole number of they be what do you think just 117 --while the aggregate free population be 55,094 --about 470 to one upon this state of fact the people frame their constitution prohibit the further introduction of slavery with a sort of guaranty to the owner of the few indenture servant give freedom to their child to be bear thereafter and make no mention whatever of any suppose slave for life out of this small matter the judge manufacture his argument that illinois come into the union as a slave state let the fact be the answer to the argument the principle of the nebraska bill he say expel slavery from illinois the principle of that bill first plant it here that is it first come because there be no law to prevent it first come before we own the country and find it here and have the ordinance of 87 to prevent its increasing our people struggle along and finally get rid of it as well they could but the principle of the nebraska bill abolish slavery in several of the old states well it be true that several of the old states in the last quarter of the last century do adopt system of gradual emancipation by which the institution have finally become extinct within their limit but it may or may not be true that the principle of the nebraska bill be the cause that lead to the adoption of these measure it be now more than fifty year since the last of these states adopt its system of emancipation if nebraska bill be the real author of these benevolent work it be rather deplorable that he have for so long a time cease work all together be there not some reason to suspect that it be the principle of the revolution and not the principle of nebraska bill that lead to emancipation in these old states leave it to the people of those old emancipate state and i be quite sure they will decide that neither that nor any other good thing ever do or ever will come of nebraska bill in the course of my main argument judge douglas interrupt i to say that the principle the nebraska bill be very old that it originate when god make man and place good and evil before he allow he to choose for himself be responsible for the choice he should make at the time i think this be merely playful and i answer it accordingly but in his reply to i he renew it as a serious argument in seriousness then the fact of this proposition be not true as state god do not place good and evil before man tell he to make his choice on the contrary he do tell he there be one tree of the fruit of which he should not eat upon pain of certain death i should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in nebraska but this argument strike i as not a little remarkable in another particular in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the ldquo;divine right of kings.&rdquo by the latter the king be to do just as he please with his white subject be responsible to god alone by the former the white man be to do just as he please with his black slave be responsible to god alone the two thing be precisely alike and it be but natural that they should find similar argument to sustain they i have argue that the application of the principle of self government as contend for would require the revival of the african slave trade that no argument could be make in favor of a man 's right to take slave to nebraska which could not be equally well make in favor of his right to bring they from the coast of africa the judge reply that the constitution require the suppression of the foreign slave trade but do not require the prohibition of slavery in the territory that be a mistake in point of fact the constitution do not require the action of congress in either case and it do authorize it in both and so there be still no difference between the case in regard to what i have say the advantage the slave states have over the free in the matter of representation the judge reply that we in the free states count five free negro as five white people while in the slave states they count five slave as three white only and that the advantage at last be on the side of the free state now in the slave states they count free negro just as we do and it so happen that besides their slave they have as many free negro as we have and thirty three thousand over thus their free negro more than balance our and their advantage over we in consequence of their slave still remain as i state it in reply to my argument that the compromise measure of 1850 be a system of equivalent and that the provision of no one of they could fairly be carry to other subject without its corresponding equivalent be carry with it the judge deny out right that these measure have any connection with or dependence upon each other this be mere desperation if they have no connection why be they always speak of in connection why have he so speak of they a thousand time why have he constantly call they a series of measure why do everybody call they a compromise why be california keep out of the union six or seven month if it be not because of its connection with the other measure webster 's lead definition of the verb ldquo;to compromise&rdquo be ldquo;to adjust and settle a difference by mutual agreement with concession of claim by the parties.&rdquo this convey precisely the popular understanding of the word compromise we know before the judge tell we that these measure pass separately and in distinct bill and that no two of they be pass by the vote of precisely the same member but we also know and so do he know that no one of they could have pass both branch of congress but for the understanding that the other be to pass also upon this understanding each get vote which it could have get in no other way it be this fact that give to the measure their true character and it be the universal knowledge of this fact that have give they the name of compromise so expressive of that true character i have ask ldquo;if in carry the provision of the utah and new mexico law to nebraska you could clear away other objection how can you leave nebraska ldquo;perfectly free&rdquo to introduce slavery before she form a constitution during her territorial government?---while the utah and new mexico law only authorize it when they form constitution and be admit into the union?&rdquo to this judge douglas answer that the utah and new mexico law also authorize it before and to prove this he read from one of their law as follow ldquo;that the legislative power of say territory shall extend to all rightful subject of legislation consistent with the constitution of the united states and the provision of this act.&rdquo;now it be perceive from the reading of this that there be nothing express upon the subject but that the authority be seek to be imply merely for the general provision of ldquo;all rightful subject of legislation.&rdquo in reply to this i insist as a legal rule of construction as well as the plain popular view of the matter that the express provision for utah and new mexico come in with slavery if they choose when they shall form constitution be an exclusion of all imply authority on the same subject that congress have the subject distinctly in their mind when they make the express provision they therein express their whole meaning on that subject the judge rather insinuate that i have find it convenient to forget the washington territorial law pass in 1853 this be a division of oregon organize the northern part as the territory of washington he assert that by this act the ordinance of 87 theretofore exist in oregon be repeal that nearly all the member of congress vote for it begin in the h.r. with charles allen of massachusetts and end with richard yates of illinois and that he could not understand how those who now oppose the nebraska bill so vote then unless it be because it be then too soon after both the great political party have ratify the compromise of 1850 and the ratification therefore too fresh to be then repudiate now i have see the washington act before and i have carefully examine it since and i aver that there be no repeal of the ordinance of 87 or of any prohibition of slavery in it in express term there be absolutely nothing in the whole law upon the subject in fact nothing to lead a reader to think of the subject to my judgment it be equally free from every thing from which such repeal can be legally imply but however this may be be man now to be entrap by a legal implication extract from covert language introduce perhaps for the very purpose of entrap they i sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through carefully watch every sentence and every line for a repeal of the ordinance of 87 or any thing equivalent to it another point on the washington act if it be intend to be model after the utah and new mexico act as judge douglas insist why be it not insert in it as in they that washington be to come in with or without slavery as she may choose at the adoption of her constitution it have no such provision in it and i defy the ingenuity of man to give a reason for the omission other than that it be not intend to follow the utah and new mexico law in regard to the question of slavery the washington act not only differ vitally from the utah and new mexico act but the nebraska act differ vitally from both by the latter act the people be leave ldquo;perfectly free&rdquo to regulate their own domestic concern amp;c but in all the former all their law be to be submit to congress and if disapprove be to be null the washington act go even far it absolutely prohibit the territorial legislation by very strong and guard language from establish bank or borrow money on the faith of the territory be this the sacred right of self government we hear vaunted so much no sir the nebraska bill find no model in the act of 50 or the washington act it find no model in any law from adam till today as phillips say of napoleon the nebraska act be grand gloomy and peculiar wrap in the solitude of its own originality without a model and without a shadow upon the earth in the course of his reply senator douglas remark in substance that he have always consider this government be make for the white people and not for the negro why in point of mere fact i think so too but in this remark of the judge there be a significance which i think be the key to the great mistake if there be any such mistake which he have make in this nebraska measure it show that the judge have no very vivid impression that the negro be a human and consequently have no idea that there can be any moral question in legislate about he in his view the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free be a matter of as utter indifference as it be whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with tobacco or stock it with horn cattle now whether this view be right or wrong it be very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view they consider slavery a great moral wrong and their feeling against it be not evanescent but eternal it lie at the very foundation of their sense of justice and it can not be trifle with it be a great and durable element of popular action and i think no statesman can safely disregard it our senator also object that those who oppose he in this measure do not entirely agree with one another he remind i that in my firm adherence to the constitutional right of the slave states i differ widely from other who be co operate with i in oppose the nebraska bill and he say it be not quite fair to oppose he in this variety of way he should remember that he take we by surprise astound we by this measure we be thunderstruck and stun and we reel and fall in utter confusion but we rise each fighting grasp whatever he could first reach a scythe a pitchfork a chop axe or a butcher 's cleaver we strike in the direction of the sound and we be rapidly close in upon he he must not think to divert we from our purpose by show we that our drill our dress and our weapon be not entirely perfect and uniform when the storm shall be past he shall find we still americans no less devoted to the continued union and prosperity of the country than heretofore finally the judge invoke against i the memory of clay and of webster they be great man and man of great deed but where have i assail they for what be it that their life long enemy shall now make profit by assume to defend they against i their life long friend i go against the repeal of the missouri compromise do they ever go for it they go for the compromise of 1850 do i ever go against they they be greatly devoted to the union to the small measure of my ability be i ever less so clay and webster be dead before this question arise by what authority shall our senator say they would espouse his side of it if alive mr. clay be the lead spirit in make the missouri compromise be it very credible that if now alive he would take the lead in the breaking of it the truth be that some support from whig be now a necessity with the judge and for thus it be that the name of clay and webster be now invoke his old friend have desert he in such number as to leave too few to live by he come to his own and his own receive he not and lo he turn unto the gentiles a word now as to the judge 's desperate assumption that the compromise of 50 have no connection with one another that illinois come into the union as a slave state and some other similar one this be no other than a bold denial of the history of the country if we do not know that the compromise of 50 be dependent on each other if we do not know that illinois come into the union as a free state we do not know any thing if we do not know these thing we do not know that we ever have a revolutionary war or such a chief as washington to deny these thing be to deny our national axiom or dogma at least and it put an end to all argument if a man will stand up and assert and repeat and re assert that two and two do not make four i know nothing in the power of argument that can stop he i think i can answer the judge so long as he stick to the premise but when he fly from they i can not work an argument into the consistency of a maternal gag and actually close his mouth with it in such a case i can only commend he to the seventy thousand answer just in from pennsylvania ohio and indiana the repeal of the missouri compromise and the propriety of its restoration constitute the subject of what i be about to say as i desire to present my own connected view of this subject my remark will not be specifically an answer to judge douglas yet as i proceed the main point he have present will arise and will receive such respectful attention as i may be able to give they i wish far to say that i do not propose to question the patriotism or to assail the motive of any man or class of man but rather to strictly confine myself to the naked merit of the question i also wish to be no less than national in all the position i may take and whenever i take ground which other have think or may think narrow sectional and dangerous to the union i hope to give a reason which will appear sufficient at least to some why i think differently and as this subject be no other than part and parcel of the large general question of domestic slavery i wish to make and to keep the distinction between the existing institution and the extension of it so broad and so clear that no honest man can misunderstand i and no dishonest one successfully misrepresent i in order to a clear understanding of what the missouri compromise be a short history of the precede kindre subject will perhaps be proper when we establish our independence we do not own or claim the country to which this compromise apply indeed strictly speak the confederacy then own no country at all the states respectively own the country within their limit and some of they own territory beyond their strict state limit virginia thus own the north western territory&mdash;the country out of which the principal part of ohio all indiana all illinois all michigan and all wisconsin have since be form she also own perhaps within she then limit what have since be form into the state of kentucky north carolina thus own what be now the state of tennessee and south carolina and georgia in separate part own what be now mississippi and alabama connecticut i think own the little remain part of ohio&mdash;bee the same where they now send giddings to congress and beat all creation at make cheese these territory together with the states themselves constitute all the country over which the confederacy then claim any sort of jurisdiction we be then live under the articles of confederation which be supercede by the constitution several year afterwards the question of cede these territory to the general government be set on foot mr. jefferson the author of the declaration of independence and otherwise a chief actor in the revolution then a delegate in congress afterwards twice president who be be and perhaps will continue to be the most distinguished politician of our history a virginian by birth and continued residence and withal a slave holder conceive the idea of take that occasion to prevent slavery ever go into the north western territory he prevail on the virginia legislature to adopt his view and to cede the territory make the prohibition of slavery therein a condition of the deed congress accept the cession with the condition and in the first ordinance which the act of congress be then call for the government of the territory provide that slavery should never be permit therein this be the famed ordinance of 87 so often speak of thenceforward for sixty one year and until in 1848 the last scrap of this territory come into the union as the state of wisconsin all party act in quiet obedience to this ordinance it be now what jefferson foresee and intended&mdash;the happy home of teem million of free white prosperous people and no slave amongst they thus with the author of the declaration of independence the policy of prohibit slavery in new territory originate thus away back of the constitution in the pure fresh free breath of the revolution the state of virginia and the national congress put that policy in practice thus through sixty odd of the good year of the republic do that policy steadily work to its great and beneficent end and thus in those five state and five million of free enterprise people we have before we the rich fruit of this policy but now new light break upon we now congress declare this ought never to have be and the like of it must never be again the sacred right of self government be grossly violate by it we even find some man who draw their first breath and every other breath of their life under this very restriction now live in dread of absolute suffocation if they should be restrict in the ldquo;sacred right&rdquo of take slave to nebraska that perfect liberty they sigh for&mdash;the liberty of make slave of other people&mdash;jefferson never think of their own father never think of they never think of themselves a year ago how fortunate for they they do not soon become sensible of their great misery oh how difficult it be to treat with respect such assault upon all we have ever really hold sacred but to return to history in 1803 we purchase what be then call louisiana of france it include the now state of louisiana arkansas missouri and iowa also the territory of minnesota and the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska slavery already exist among the french at new orleans and to some extent at st. louis in 1812 louisiana come into the union as a slave state without controversy in 1818 or 19 missouri show sign of a wish to come in with slavery this be resist by northern member of congress and thus begin the first great slavery agitation in the nation this controversy last several month and become very angry and exciting the house of representatives vote steadily for the prohibition of slavery in missouri and the senate voting as steadily against it threat of break up the union be freely make and the able public man of the day become seriously alarmed at length a compromise be make in which like all compromise both side yield something it be a law pass on the 6th day of march 1820 provide that missouri might come into the union with slavery but that in all the remain part of the territory purchase of france which lie north of 36 degree and 30 minute north latitude slavery should never be permit this provision of law be the missouri compromise in exclude slavery north of the line the same language be employ as in the ordinance of 87 it directly apply to iowa minnesota and to the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska whether there should or should not be slavery south of that line nothing be say in the law but arkansas constitute the principal remain part south of the line and it have since be admit as a slave state without serious controversy more recently iowa north of the line come in as a free state without controversy still later minnesota north of the line have a territorial organization without controversy texas principally south of the line and west of arkansas though originally within the purchase from france have in 1819 be trade off to spain in our treaty for the acquisition of florida it have thus become a part of mexico mexico revolutionize and become independent of spain american citizen begin settle rapidly with their slave in the southern part of texas soon they revolutionize against mexico and establish an independent government of their own adopt a constitution with slavery strongly resemble the constitution of our slave state by still another rapid move texas claim a boundary much far west than when we part with she in 1819 be bring back to the united states and admit into the union as a slave state there then be little or no settlement in the northern part of texas a considerable portion of which lie north of the missouri line and in the resolution admit she into the union the missouri restriction be expressly extend westward across her territory this be in 1845 only nine year ago thus originate the missouri compromise and thus have it be respect down to 1845 and even four year later in 1849 our distinguished senator in a public address hold the follow language in relation to it:&ldquo;the missouri compromise have be in practical operation for about a quarter of a century and have receive the sanction and approbation of man of all party in every section of the union it have allay all sectional jealousy and irritation grow out of this vex question and harmonize and tranquilize the whole country it have give to henry clay as its prominent champion the proud sobriquet of the ldquo;great pacificator&rdquo and by that title and for that service his political friend have repeatedly appeal to the people to rally under his standard as a presidential candidate as the man who have exhibit the patriotism and the power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation and preserve the union he be not aware that any man or any party from any section of the union have ever urge as an objection to mr. clay that he be the great champion of the missouri compromise on the contrary the effort be make by the opponent of mr. clay to prove that he be not entitle to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure and that the honor be equally due to other as well as to he for secure its adoption&mdash;that it have its origin in the heart of all patriotic man who desire to preserve and perpetuate the blessing of our glorious union&mdash;an origin akin that of the constitution of the united states conceive in the same spirit of fraternal affection and calculate to remove forever the only danger which seem to threaten at some distant day to sever the social bond of union all the evidence of public opinion at that day seem to indicate that this compromise have be canonize in the heart of the american people as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb.&rdquo;i do not read this extract to involve judge douglas in an inconsistency if he afterwards think he have be wrong it be right for he to change i bring this forward merely to show the high estimate place on the missouri compromise by all party up to so late as the year 1849.but go back a little in point of time our war with mexico break out in 1846 when congress be about adjourn that session president polk ask they to place two million of dollar under his control to be use by he in the recess if find practicable and expedient in negociate a treaty of peace with mexico and acquire some part of her territory a bill be duly get up for the purpose and be progress swimmingly in the house of representatives when a member by the name of david wilmot a democrat from pennsylvania move as an amendment ldquo;provide that in any territory thus acquire there shall never be slavery.&rdquo;this be the origin of the far fame ldquo;wilmot proviso.&rdquo it create a great flutter but it stick like wax be vote into the bill and the bill pass with it through the house the senate however adjourn without final action on it and so both appropriation and proviso be lose for the time the war continue and at the next session the president renew his request for the appropriation enlarge the amount i think to three million again come the proviso and defeat the measure congress adjourn again and the war go on in dec. 1847 the new congress assemble i be in the low house that term the ldquo;wilmot proviso&rdquo or the principle of it be constantly come up in some shape or other and i think i may venture to say i vote for it at least forty time during the short term i be there the senate however hold it in check and it never become law in the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace be make with mexico by which we obtain that portion of her country which now constitute the territory of new mexico and utah and the now state of california by this treaty the wilmot proviso be defeat as so far as it be intend to be a condition of the acquisition of territory its friend however be still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from get into the new country this new acquisition lie directly west of our old purchase from france and extend west to the pacific ocean&mdash;and be so situated that if the missouri line should be extend straight west the new country would be divide by such extended line leave some north and some south of it on judge douglas motion a bill or provision of a bill pass the senate to so extend the missouri line the proviso man in the house include myself vote it down because by implication it give up the southern part to slavery while we be bent on have it all free in the fall of 1848 the gold mine be discover in california this attract people to it with unprecedented rapidity so that on or soon after the meeting of the new congress in dec. 1849 she already have a population of nearly a hundred thousand have call a convention form a state constitution exclude slavery and be knock for admission into the union the proviso man of course be for let she in but the senate always true to the other side would not consent to her admission and there california stand keep out of the union because she would not let slavery into her border under all the circumstance perhaps this be not wrong there be other point of dispute connect with the general question of slavery which equally need adjustment the south clamor for a more efficient fugitive slave law the north clamor for the abolition of a peculiar specie of slave trade in the district of columbia in connection with which in view from the window of the capitol a sort of negro livery stable where drove of negro be collect temporarily keep and finally take to southern market precisely like drove of horse have be openly maintain for fifty year utah and new mexico need territorial government and whether slavery should or should not be prohibit within they be another question the indefinite western boundary of texas be to be settle she be receive a slave state and consequently the farth west the slavery man could push her boundary the more slave country they secure and the farth east the slavery opponent could thrust the boundary back the less slave ground be secure thus this be just as clearly a slavery question as any of the other these point all need adjustment and they be all hold up perhaps wisely to make they help to adjust one another the union now as in 1820 be think to be in danger and devotion to the union rightfully incline man to yield somewhat in point where nothing else could have so incline they a compromise be finally effect the south get their new fugitive slave law and the north get california the far good part of our acquisition from mexico as a free state the south get a provision that new mexico and utah when admit as states may come in with or without slavery as they may then choose and the north get the slave trade abolish in the district of columbia the north get the western boundary of texas thence far back eastward than the south desire but in turn they give texas ten million of dollar with which to pay her old debt this be the compromise of 1850.precede the presidential election of 1852 each of the great political party democrats and whig meet in convention and adopt resolution endorse the compromise of 50 as a ldquo;finality,&rdquo a final settlement so far as these party could make it so of all slavery agitation previous to this in 1851 the illinois legislature have indorse it during this long period of time nebraska have remain substantially an uninhabited country but now emigration to and settlement within it begin to take place it be about one third as large as the present united states and its importance so long overlook begin to come into view the restriction of slavery by the missouri compromise directly apply to it in fact be first make and have since be maintain expressly for it in 1853 a bill to give it a territorial government pass the house of representatives and in the hand of judge douglas fail of pass the senate only for want of time this bill contain no repeal of the missouri compromise indeed when it be assail because it do not contain such repeal judge douglas defend it in its exist form on january 4th 1854 judge douglas introduce a new bill to give nebraska territorial government he accompany this bill with a report in which last he expressly recommend that the missouri compromise shall neither be affirm nor repeal before long the bill be so modified as to make two territory instead of one call the southern one kansas also about a month after the introduction of the bill on the judge 's own motion it be so amend as to declare the missouri compromise inoperative and void and substantially that the people who go and settle there may establish slavery or exclude it as they may see fit in this shape the bill pass both branch of congress and become a law this be the repeal of the missouri compromise the foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular but i be sure it be sufficiently so for all the use i shall attempt to make of it and in it we have before we the chief material enable we to correctly judge whether the repeal of the missouri compromise be right or wrong i think and shall try to show that it be wrong wrong in its direct effect let slavery into kansas and nebraska&mdash;and wrong in its prospective principle allow it to spread to every other part of the wide world where man can be find incline to take it this declare indifference but as i must think covert real zeal for the spread of slavery i can not but hate i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself i hate it because it deprive our republican example of its just influence in the world&mdash;enable the enemy of free institution with plausibility to taunt we as hypocrites&mdash;cause the real friend of freedom to doubt our sincerity and especially because it force so many really good man amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principle of civil liberty&mdash;criticise the declaration of independence and insist that there be no right principle of action but self interest before proceeding let i say i think i have no prejudice against the southern people they be just what we would be in their situation if slavery do not now exist amongst they they would not introduce it if it do now exist amongst we we should not instantly give it up this i believe of the masse north and south doubtless there be individual on both side who would not hold slave under any circumstance and other who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it be out of existence we know that some southern man do free their slave go north and become tip top abolitionist while some northern one go south and become most cruel slave master when southern people tell we they be no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we i acknowledge the fact when it be say that the institution exist and that it be very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way i can understand and appreciate the saying i surely will not blame they for not do what i should not know how to do myself if all earthly power be give i i should not know what to do as to the exist institution my first impulse would be to free all the slave and send they to liberia,&mdash;to their own native land but a moment 's reflection would convince i that whatever of high hope as i think there be there may be in this in the long run its sudden execution be impossible if they be all land there in a day they would all perish in the next ten day and there be not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry they there in many time ten day what then free they all and keep they among we as underling be it quite certain that this better their condition i think i would not hold one in slavery at any rate yet the point be not clear enough for i to denounce people upon what next free they and make they politically and socially our equal my own feeling will not admit of this and if mine would we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not whether this feel accord with justice and sound judgment be not the sole question if indeed it be any part of it a universal feeling whether well or ill found can not be safely disregarded we can not then make they equal it do seem to i that system of gradual emancipation might be adopt but for their tardiness in this i will not undertake to judge our brother of the south when they remind we of their constitutional right i acknowledge they not grudgingly but fully and fairly and i would give they any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitive which should not in its stringency be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than our ordinary criminal law be to hang an innocent one but all this to my judgment furnish no more excuse for permit slavery to go into our own free territory than it would for revive the african slave trade by law the law which forbid the bringing of slave from africa and that which have so long forbid the take they to nebraska can hardly be distinguish on any moral principle and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuse as that of the latter the argument by which the repeal of the missouri compromise be seek to be justify be these first that the nebraska country need a territorial government second that in various way the public have repudiate it and demand the repeal and therefore should not now complain of it and lastly that the repeal establish a principle which be intrinsically right i will attempt an answer to each of they in its turn first then if that country be in need of a territorial organization could it not have have it as well without as with the repeal iowa and minnesota to both of which the missouri restriction apply have without its repeal each in succession territorial organization and even the year before a bill for nebraska itself be within an ace of pass without the repeal clause and this in the hand of the same man who be now the champion of repeal why no necessity then for the repeal but still later when this very bill be first bring in it contain no repeal but say they because the public have demand or rather command the repeal the repeal be to accompany the organization whenever that should occur now i deny that the public ever demand any such thing&mdash;ever repudiate the missouri compromise&mdash;ever command its repeal i deny it and call for the proof it be not contend i believe that any such command have ever be give in express term it be only say that it be do in principle the support of the wilmot proviso be the first fact mention to prove that the missouri restriction be repudiate in principle and the second be the refusal to extend the missouri line over the country acquire from mexico these be near enough alike to be treat together the one be to exclude the chance of slavery from the whole new acquisition by the lump and the other be to reject a division of it by which one half be to be give up to those chance now whether this be a repudiation of the missouri line in principle depend upon whether the missouri law contain any principle require the line to be extend over the country acquire from mexico i contend it do not i insist that it contain no general principle but that it be in every sense specific that its term limit it to the country purchase from france be undenied and undeniable it could have no principle beyond the intention of those who make it they do not intend to extend the line to country which they do not own if they intend to extend it in the event of acquire additional territory why do they not say so it be just as easy to say that ` ` in all the country west of the mississippi which we now own or may hereafter acquire there shall never be slavery,&rdquo as to say what they do say and they would have say it if they have mean it an intention to extend the law be not only not mention in the law but be not mention in any contemporaneous history both the law itself and the history of the time be a blank as to any principle of extension and by neither the know rule for construe statute and contract nor by common sense can any such principle be infer another fact show the specific character of the missouri law&mdash;showing that it intend no more than it expressed&mdash;showe that the line be not intend as a universal dividing line between free and slave territory present and prospective&mdash;north of which slavery could never go&mdash;is the fact that by that very law missouri come in as a slave state north of the line if that law contain any prospective principle the whole law must be look to in order to ascertain what the principle be and by this rule the south could fairly contend that inasmuch as they get one slave state north of the line at the inception of the law they have the right to have another give they north of it occasionally&mdash;now and then in the indefinite westward extension of the line this demonstrate the absurdity of attempt to deduce a prospective principle from the missouri compromise line when we vote for the wilmot proviso we be vote to keep slavery out of the whole missouri acquisition and little do we think we be thereby vote to let it into nebraska lay several hundred mile distant when we vote against extend the missouri line little do we think we be vote to destroy the old line then of near thirty year stand to argue that we thus repudiate the missouri compromise be no less absurd than it would be to argue that because we have so far forbear to acquire cuba we have thereby in principle repudiate our former acquisition and determine to throw they out of the union no less absurd than it would be to say that because i may have refuse to build an addition to my house i thereby have decide to destroy the exist house and if i catch you set fire to my house you will turn upon i and say i instruct you to do it the most conclusive argument however that while vote for the wilmot proviso and while vote against the extension of the missouri line we never think of disturb the original missouri compromise be find in the fact that there be then and still be an unorganized tract of fine country nearly as large as the state of missouri lie immediately west of arkansas and south of the missouri compromise line and that we never attempt to prohibit slavery as to it i wish particular attention to this it adjoin the original missouri compromise line by its northern boundary and consequently be part of the country into which by implication slavery be permit to go by that compromise there it have lain open ever since and there it still lie and yet no effort have be make at any time to wrest it from the south in all our struggle to prohibit slavery within our mexican acquisition we never so much as lift a finger to prohibit it as to this tract be not this entirely conclusive that at all time we have hold the missouri compromise as a sacred thing even when against ourselves as well as when for we senator douglas sometimes say the missouri line itself be in principle only an extension of the line of the ordinance of 87&mdash;that be to say an extension of the ohio river i think this be weak enough on its face i will remark however that as a glance at the map will show the missouri line be a long way far south than the ohio and that if our senator in propose his extension have stick to the principle of jogging southward perhaps it might not have be vote down so readily but next it be say that the compromise of 50 and the ratification of they by both political party in 52 establish a new principle which require the repeal of the missouri compromise this again i deny i deny it and demand the proof i have already state fully what the compromise of 50 be the particular part of those measure for which the virtual repeal of the missouri compromise be seek to be infer for it be admit they contain nothing about it in express term be the provision in the utah and new mexico law which permit they when they seek admission into the union as states to come in with or without slavery as they shall then see fit now i insist this provision be make for utah and new mexico and for no other place whatever it have no more direct reference to nebraska than it have to the territory of the moon but say they it have reference to nebraska in principle let we see the north consent to this provision not because they consider it right in itself but because they be compensated&mdash;paid for it they at the same time get california into the union as a free state this be far the good part of all they have struggle for by the wilmot proviso they also get the area of slavery somewhat narrow in the settlement of the boundary of texas also they get the slave trade abolish in the district of columbia for all these desirable object the north could afford to yield something and they do yield to the south the utah and new mexico provision i do not mean that the whole north or even a majority yield when the law pass but enough yield when add to the vote of the south to carry the measure now can it be pretend that the principle of this arrangement require we to permit the same provision to be apply to nebraska without any equivalent at all give we another free state press the boundary of texas still far back give we another step toward the destruction of slavery in the district and you present we a similar case but ask we not to repeat for nothing what you pay for in the first instance if you wish the thing again pay again that be the principle of the compromise of 50 if indeed they have any principle beyond their specific terms&mdash;it be the system of equivalent again if congress at that time intend that all future territory should when admit as states come in with or without slavery at their own option why do it not say so with such an universal provision all know the bill could not have pass do they then&mdash;could they&mdash;establish a principle contrary to their own intention still far if they intend to establish the principle that wherever congress have control it should be leave to the people to do as they think fit with slavery why do they not authorize the people of the district of columbia at their adoption to abolish slavery within these limit i personally know that this have not be leave undo because it be unthought of it be frequently speak of by member of congress and by citizen of washington six year ago and i hear no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation with compensation to owner would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the district but without the action of congress they could say nothing and congress say ldquo;no.&rdquo in the measure of 1850 congress have the subject of slavery in the district expressly in hand if they be then establish the principle of allow the people to do as they please with slavery why do they not apply the principle to that people?again it be claim that by the resolutions of the illinois legislature pass in 1851 the repeal of the missouri compromise be demand this i deny also whatever may be work out by a criticism of the language of those resolution the people have never understand they as be any more than an endorsement of the compromise of 1850 and a release of our senator from vote for the wilmot proviso the whole people be live witness that this only be their view finally it be ask ldquo;if we do not mean to apply the utah and new mexico provision to all future territory what do we mean when we in 1852 endorse the compromise of 50?&rdquo;for myself i can answer this question most easily i mean not to ask a repeal or modification of the fugitive slave law i mean not to ask for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia i mean not to resist the admission of utah and new mexico even should they ask to come in as slave states i mean nothing about additional territory because as i understand we then have no territory whose character as to slavery be not already settle as to nebraska i regard its character as be fix by the missouri compromise for thirty years&mdash;as unalterably fix as that of my own home in illinois as to new acquisition i say ldquo;sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof.&rdquo when we make new acquaintance we will as heretofore try to manage they some how that be my answer that be what i mean and say and i appeal to the people to say each for himself whether that be not also the universal meaning of the free state and now in turn let i ask a few question if by any or all these matter the repeal of the missouri compromise be command why be not the command soon obey why be the repeal omit in the nebraska bill of 1853 why be it omit in the original bill of 1854 why in the accompany report be such a repeal characterize as a departure from the course pursue in 1850 and its continue omission recommended?i be aware judge douglas now argue that the subsequent express repeal be no substantial alteration of the bill this argument seem wonderful to i it be as if one should argue that white and black be not different he admit however that there be a literal change in the bill and that he make the change in deference to other senators who would not support the bill without this prove that those other senators think the change a substantial one and that the judge think their opinion worth defer to his own opinion therefore seem not to rest on a very firm basis even in his own mind&mdash;and i suppose the world believe and will continue to believe that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation have arise i conclude then that the public never demand the repeal of the missouri compromise i now come to consider whether the repeal with its avowed principle be intrinsically right i insist that it be not take the particular case a controversy have arise between the advocate and opponent of slavery in relation to its establishment within the country we have purchase of france the southern and then good part of the purchase be already in as a slave state the controversy be settle by also let missouri in as a slave state but with the agreement that within all the remain part of the purchase north of a certain line there should never be slavery as to what be to be do with the remain part south of the line nothing be say but perhaps the fair implication be that it should come in with slavery if it should so choose the southern part except a portion heretofore mention afterwards do come in with slavery as the state of arkansas all these many year since 1820 the northern part have remain a wilderness at length settlement begin in it also in due course iowa come in as a free state and minnesota be give a territorial government without remove the slavery restriction finally the sole remain part north of the line kansas and nebraska be to be organize and it be propose and carry to blot out the old dividing line of thirty four year stand and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery now this to my mind be manifestly unjust after an angry and dangerous controversy the party make friend by divide the bone of contention the one party first appropriate her own share beyond all power to be disturb in the possession of it and then seize the share of the other party it be as if two starve man have divide their only loaf the one have hastily swallow his half and then grab the other half just as he be put it to his mouth!let i here drop the main argument to notice what i consider rather an inferior matter it be argue that slavery will not go to kansas and nebraska in any event this be a palliation&mdash;a lullaby i have some hope that it will not but let we not be too confident as to climate a glance at the map show that there be five slave states&mdash;delaware maryland virginia kentucky and missouri&mdash;and also the district of columbia all north of the missouri compromise line the census return of 1850 show that within these there be 867,276 slaves&mdash;being more than one fourth of all the slave in the nation it be not climate then that will keep slavery out of these territory be there any thing in the peculiar nature of the country missouri adjoin these territory by her entire western boundary and slavery be already within every one of her western county i have even hear it say that there be more slave in proportion to white in the north western county of missouri than within any county of the state slavery press entirely up to the old western boundary of the state and when rather recently a part of that boundary at the north west be move out a little far west slavery follow on quite up to the new line now when the restriction be remove what be to prevent it from go still far climate will not no peculiarity of the country will&mdash;nothing in nature will will the disposition of the people prevent it those near the scene be all in favor of the extension the yankee who be oppose to it may be more numerous but in military phrase the battle field be too far from their base of operation but it be say there now be no law in nebraska on the subject of slavery and that in such case take a slave there operate his freedom that be good book law but be not the rule of actual practice wherever slavery be it have be first introduce without law the old law we find concern it be not law introduce it but regulate it as an already exist thing a white man take his slave to nebraska now who will inform the negro that he be free who will take he before court to test the question of his freedom in ignorance of his legal emancipation he be keep chop splitting and plowing other be bring and move on in the same track at last if ever the time for voting come on the question of slavery the institution already in fact exist in the country and can not well be remove the fact of its presence and the difficulty of its removal will carry the vote in its favor keep it out until a vote be take and a vote in favor of it can not be get in any population of forty thousand on earth who have be draw together by the ordinary motive of emigration and settlement to get slave into the country simultaneously with the white in the incipient stage of settlement be the precise stake play for and win in this nebraska measure the question be ask we ldquo;if slave will go in notwithstanding the general principle of law liberate they why would they not equally go in against positive statute law?&mdash;go in even if the missouri restriction be maintained?&rdquo i answer because it take a much bold man to venture in with his property in the latter case than in the former&mdash;because the positive congressional enactment be know to and respect by all or nearly all whereas the negative principle that no law be free law be not much know except among lawyer we have some experience of this practical difference in spite of the ordinance of 87 a few negro be bring into illinois and hold in a state of quasi slavery not enough however to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they come to form a constitution but in the adjoining missouri country where there be no ordinance of 87&mdash;wa no restriction&mdash;they be carry ten time nay a hundred time as fast and actually make a slave state this be fact&mdash;nake fact another lullaby argument be that take slave to new country do not increase their number&mdash;doe not make any one slave who otherwise would be free there be some truth in this and i be glad of it but it not wholly true the african slave trade be not yet effectually suppress and if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people amongst we who be foreigner and the descendant of foreigner arrive here since 1808 we shall find the increase of the black population out run that of the white to an extent unaccountable except by suppose that some of they too have be come from africa if this be so the opening of new country to the institution increase the demand for and augment the price of slave and so do in fact make slave of freeman by cause they to be bring from africa and sell into bondage but however this may be we know the opening of new country to slavery tend to the perpetuation of the institution and so do keep man in slavery who otherwise would be free this result we do not feel like favor and we be under no legal obligation to suppress our feeling in this respect equal justice to the south it be say require we to consent to the extending of slavery to new country that be to say inasmuch as you do not object to my take my hog to nebraska therefore i must not object to you take your slave now i admit this be perfectly logical if there be no difference between hog and negro but while you thus require i to deny the humanity of the negro i wish to ask whether you of the south yourself have ever be willing to do as much it be kindly provide that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage be natural tyrant that percentage be no large in the slave states than in the free the great majority south as well as north have human sympathy of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain these sympathy in the bosom of the southern people manifest in many way their sense of the wrong of slavery and their consciousness that after all there be humanity in the negro if they deny this let i address they a few plain question in 1820 you join the north almost unanimously in declare the african slave trade piracy and in annexing to it the punishment of death why do you do this if you do not feel that it be wrong why do you join in provide that man should be hang for it the practice be no more than bring wild negro from africa to sell to such as would buy they but you never think of hang man for catch and sell wild horse wild buffalo or wild bear again you have amongst you a sneak individual of the class of native tyrant know as the ldquo;slave dealer.&rdquo he watch your necessity and crawl up to buy your slave at a speculating price if you can not help it you sell to he but if you can help it you drive he from your door you despise he utterly you do not recognize he as a friend or even as an honest man your child must not play with his they may rollick freely with the little negro but not with the ldquo;slave dealers&rdquo child if you be oblige to deal with he you try to get through the job without so much as touch he it be common with you to join hand with the man you meet but with the slave dealer you avoid the ceremony&mdash;instinctively shrink from the snaky contact if he grow rich and retire from business you still remember he and still keep up the ban of non intercourse upon he and his family now why be this you do not so treat the man who deal in corn cattle or tobacco and yet again there be in the united states and territory include the district of columbia 433,643 free black at $ 500 per head they be worth over two hundred million of dollar how come this vast amount of property to be run about without owner we do not see free horse or free cattle run at large how be this all these free black be the descendant of slave or have be slave themselves and they would be slave now but for something which have operate on their white owner induce they at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate they what be that something be there any mistake it in all these case it be your sense of justice and human sympathy continually tell you that the poor negro have some natural right to himself&mdash;that those who deny it and make mere merchandise of he deserve kicking contempt and death and now why will you ask we to deny the humanity of the slave and estimate he only as the equal of the hog why ask we to do what you will not do yourself why ask we to do for nothing what two hundred million of dollar could not induce you to do?but one great argument in the support of the repeal of the missouri compromise be still to come that argument be ldquo;the sacred right of self government.&rdquo it seem our distinguished senator have find great difficulty in get his antagonist even in the senate to meet he fairly on this argument&mdash;some poet have say ldquo;fool rush in where angel fear to tread.&rdquo;at the hazzard of be think one of the fool of this quotation i meet that argument&mdash;i rush in i take that bull by the horn i trust i understand and truly estimate the right of self government my faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he please with all which be exclusively his own lie at the foundation of the sense of justice there be in i i extend the principle to community of man as well as to individual i so extend it because it be politically wise as well as naturally just politically wise in save we from broil about matter which do not concern we here or at washington i would not trouble myself with the oyster law of virginia or the cranberry law of indiana the doctrine of self government be right&mdash;absolutely and eternally right&mdash;but it have no just application as here attempt or perhaps i should rather say that whether it have such just application depend upon whether a negro be not or be a man if he be not a man why in that case he who be a man may as a matter of self government do just as he please with he but if the negro be a man be it not to that extent a total destruction of self government to say that he too shall not govern himself when the white man govern himself that be self government but when he govern himself and also govern another man that be more than self government&mdash;that be despotism if the negro be a man why then my ancient faith teach i that ldquo;all man be create equal;&rdquo and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man 's make a slave of another judge douglas frequently with bitter irony and sarcasm paraphrase our argument by say ldquo;the white people of nebraska be good enough to govern themselves but they be not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes!!&rdquo;well i doubt not that the people of nebraska be and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere i do not say the contrary what i do say be that no man be good enough to govern another man without that other 's consent i say this be the lead principle&mdash;the sheet anchor of american republicanism our declaration of independence says:&ldquo;we hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal that they be endow by their creator with certain inalienable right that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these right government be institute among man derive their just power from the consent of the governed.&rdquo;i have quote so much at this time merely to show that accord to our ancient faith the just power of government be derive from the consent of the governed now the relation of master and slave be pro tanto a total violation of this principle the master not only govern the slave without his consent but he govern he by a set of rule altogether different from those which he prescribe for himself allow all the govern an equal voice in the government and that and that only be self government let it not be say i be contend for the establishment of political and social equality between the white and black i have already say the contrary i be not now combat the argument of necessity arise from the fact that the black be already amongst we but i be combat what be set up as moral argument for allow they to be take where they have never yet been&mdash;argue against the extension of a bad thing which where it already exist we must of necessity manage as we good can in support of his application of the doctrine of self government senator douglas have seek to bring to his aid the opinion and example of our revolutionary father i be glad he have do this i love the sentiment of those old time man and shall be most happy to abide by their opinion he show we that when it be in contemplation for the colony to break off from great britain and set up a new government for themselves several of the state instruct their delegate to go for the measure provide each state should be allowed to regulate its domestic concern in its own way i do not quote but this in substance this be right i see nothing objectionable in it i also think it probable that it have some reference to the existence of slavery amongst they i will not deny that it have but have it in any reference to the carrying of slavery into new country that be the question and we will let the father themselves answer it this same generation of man and mostly the same individual of the generation who declare this principle&mdash;who declare independence&mdash;who fight the war of the revolution through&mdash;who afterwards make the constitution under which we still live&mdash;these same man pass the ordinance of 87 declare that slavery should never go to the north west territory i have no doubt judge douglas think they be very inconsistent in this it be a question of discrimination between they and he but there be not an inch of ground leave for his claim that their opinions&mdash;their example&mdash;their authority&mdash;are on his side in this controversy again be not nebraska while a territory a part of we do we not own the country and if we surrender the control of it do we not surrender the right of self government it be part of ourselves if you say we shall not control it because it be only part the same be true of every other part and when all the part be go what have become of the whole what be then leave of we what use for the general government when there be nothing leave for it govern?but you say this question should be leave to the people of nebraska because they be more particularly interested if this be the rule you must leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have slave what well moral right have thirty one citizen of nebraska to say that the thirty second shall not hold slave than the people of the thirty one states have to say that slavery shall not go into the thirty second state at all?but if it be a sacred right for the people of nebraska to take and hold slave there it be equally their sacred right to buy they where they can buy they cheap and that undoubtedly will be on the coast of africa provide you will consent to not hang they for go there to buy they you must remove this restriction too from the sacred right of self government i be aware you say that take slave from the states of nebraska do not make slave of freeman but the african slave trader can say just as much he do not catch free negro and bring they here he find they already slave in the hand of their black captor and he honestly buy they at the rate of about a red cotton handkerchief a head this be very cheap and it be a great abridgement of the sacred right of self government to hang man for engage in this profitable trade!another important objection to this application of the right of self government be that it enable the first few to deprive the succeed many of a free exercise of the right of self government the first few may get slavery in and the subsequent many can not easily get it out how common be the remark now in the slave states&mdash;&ldquo;if we be only clear of our slave how much well it would be for us.&rdquo they be actually deprive of the privilege of govern themselves as they would by the action of a very few in the beginning the same thing be true of the whole nation at the time our constitution be form whether slavery shall go into nebraska or other new territory be not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there the whole nation be interested that the good use shall be make of these territory we want they for the home of free white people this they can not be to any considerable extent if slavery shall be plant within they slave states be place for poor white people to remove from not to remove to new free state be the place for poor people to go to and well their condition for this use the nation need these territory still far there be constitutional relation between the slave and free states which be degrade to the latter we be under legal obligation to catch and return their runaway slave to them&mdash;a sort of dirty disagreeable job which i believe as a general rule the slave holder will not perform for one another then again in the control of the government&mdash;the management of the partnership affairs&mdash;they have greatly the advantage of we by the constitution each state have two senators&mdash;each have a number of representatives in proportion to the number of its people&mdash;and each have a number of presidential elector equal to the whole number of its senators and representatives together but in ascertain the number of the people for this purpose five slave be count as be equal to three white the slave do not vote they be only count and so used as to swell the influence of the white people 's vote the practical effect of this be more aptly show by a comparison of the states of south carolina and maine south carolina have six representative and so have maine south carolina have eight presidential elector and so have maine this be precise equality so far and of course they be equal in senator each have two thus in the control of the government the two states be equal precisely but how be they in the number of their white people maine have 581,813&mdash;while south carolina have 274,567 maine have twice as many as south carolina and 32,679 over thus each white man in south carolina be more than the double of any man in maine this be all because south carolina besides her free people have 384,984 slave the south carolinian have precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free state as well as in maine he be more than the double of any one of we in this crowd the same advantage but not to the same extent be hold by all the citizen of the slave states over those of the free and it be an absolute truth without an exception that there be no voter in any slave state but who have more legal power in the government than any voter in any free state there be no instance of exact equality and the disadvantage be against we the whole chapter through this principle in the aggregate give the slave states in the present congress twenty additional representatives&mdash;bee seven more than the whole majority by which they pass the nebraska bill now all this be manifestly unfair yet i do not mention it to complain of it in so far as it be already settle it be in the constitution and i do not for that cause or any other cause propose to destroy or alter or disregard the constitution i stand to it fairly fully and firmly but when i be tell i must leave it altogether to other people to say whether new partner be to be breed up and bring into the firm on the same degrading term against i i respectfully demur i insist that whether i shall be a whole man or only the half of one in comparison with other be a question in which i be somewhat concerned and one which no other man can have a sacred right of decide for i if i be wrong in this&mdash;if it really be a sacred right of self government in the man who shall go to nebraska to decide whether he will be the equal of i or the double of i then after he shall have exercise that right and thereby shall have reduce i to a still small fraction of a man than i already be i should like for some gentleman deeply skilled in the mystery of sacred right to provide himself with a microscope and peep about and find out if he can what have become of my sacred right they will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye finally i insist that if there be any thing which it be the duty of the whole people to never entrust to any hand but their own that thing be the preservation and perpetuity of their own liberty and institution and if they shall think as i do that the extension of slavery endanger they more than any or all other cause how recreant to themselves if they submit the question and with it the fate of their country to a mere hand full of man bent only on temporary self interest if this question of slavery extension be an insignificant one&mdash;one have no power to do harm&mdash;it might be shuffle aside in this way but be as it be the great behemoth of danger shall the strong gripe of the nation be loosen upon he to entrust he to the hand of such feeble keepers?i have do with this mighty argument of self government go sacred thing go in peace but nebraska be urge as a great union save measure well i too go for save the union much as i hate slavery i would consent to the extension of it rather than see the union dissolve just as i would consent to any great evil to avoid a greater one but when i go to union saving i must believe at least that the mean i employ have some adaptation to the end to my mind nebraska have no such adaptation.&ldquo;it hath no relish of salvation in it.&rdquo;it be an aggravation rather of the only one thing which ever endanger the union when it come upon we all be peace and quiet the nation be look to the forming of new bond of union and a long course of peace and prosperity seem to lie before we in the whole range of possibility there scarcely appear to i to have be any thing out of which the slavery agitation could have be revive except the very project of repeal the missouri compromise every inch of territory we own already have a definite settlement of the slavery question and by which all party be pledge to abide indeed there be no uninhabited country on the continent which we could acquire if we except some extreme northern region which be wholly out of the question in this state of case the genius of discord himself could scarcely have invent a way of again get we by the ear but by turn back and destroy the peace measure of the past the council of that genius seem to have prevail the missouri compromise be repeal and here we be in the midst of a new slavery agitation such i think as we have never see before who be responsible for this be it those who resist the measure or those who causelessly bring it forward and press it through have reason to know and in fact know it must and would be so resisted it could not but be expect by its author that it would be look upon as a measure for the extension of slavery aggravate by a gross breach of faith argue as you will and long as you will this be the naked front and aspect of the measure and in this aspect it could not but produce agitation slavery be found in the selfishness of man 's nature&mdash;opposition to it be his love of justice these principle be an eternal antagonism and when bring into collision so fiercely as slavery extension bring they shock and throe and convulsion must ceaselessly follow repeal the missouri compromise&mdash;repeal all compromises&mdash;repeal the declaration of independence&mdash;repeal all past history you still can not repeal human nature it still will be the abundance of man 's heart that slavery extension be wrong and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will continue to speak the structure too of the nebraska bill be very peculiar the people be to decide the question of slavery for themselves but when they be to decide or how they be to decide or whether when the question be once decide it be to remain so or be it to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trial the law do not say be it to be decide by the first dozen settler who arrive there or be it to await the arrival of a hundred be it to be decide by a vote of the people or a vote of the legislature or indeed by a vote of any sort to these question the law give no answer there be a mystery about this for when a member propose to give the legislature express authority to exclude slavery it be hoot down by the friend of the bill this fact be worth remember some yankee in the east be send emigrant to nebraska to exclude slavery from it and so far as i can judge they expect the question to be decide by vote in some way or other but the missourians be awake too they be within a stone 's throw of the contest ground they hold meeting and pass resolution in which not the slight allusion to voting be make they resolve that slavery already exist in the territory that more shall go there that they remain in missouri will protect it and that abolitionist shall be hung or drive away through all this bowie knife and six shooter be see plainly enough but never a glimpse of the ballot box and really what be to be the result of this each party within have numerous and determined backer without be it not probable that the contest will come to blow and bloodshed could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence on the slavery question than this nebraska project be i do not charge or believe that such be intend by congress but if they have literally form a ring and place champion within it to fight out the controversy the fight could be no more likely to come off than it be and if this fight should begin be it likely to take a very peaceful union save turn will not the first drop of blood so shed be the real knell of the union?the missouri compromise ought to be restore for the sake of the union it ought to be restore we ought to elect a house of representatives which will vote its restoration if by any mean we omit to do this what follow slavery may or may not be establish in nebraska but whether it be or not we shall have repudiated&mdash;discarde from the council of the nation&mdash;the spirit of compromise for who after this will ever trust in a national compromise the spirit of mutual concession&mdash;that spirit which first give we the constitution and which have thrice save the union&mdash;we shall have strangle and cast from we forever and what shall we have in lieu of it the south flush with triumph and tempt to excess the north betray as they believe brood on wrong and burn for revenge one side will provoke the other resent the one will taunt the other defy one agree the other retaliate already a few in the north defy all constitutional restraint resist the execution of the fugitive slave law and even menace the institution of slavery in the state where it exist already a few in the south claim the constitutional right to take to and hold slave in the free states&mdash;demand the revival of the slave trade and demand a treaty with great britain by which fugitive slave may be reclaim from canada as yet they be but few on either side it be a grave question for the lover of the union whether the final destruction of the missouri compromise and with it the spirit of all compromise will or will not embolden and embitter each of these and fatally increase the number of both but restore the compromise and what then we thereby restore the national faith the national confidence the national feeling of brotherhood we thereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise&mdash;that spirit which have never fail we in past peril and which may be safely trust for all the future the south ought to join in do this the peace of the nation be as dear to they as to we in memory of the past and hope of the future they share as largely as we it would be on their part a great act&mdash;great in its spirit and great in its effect it would be worth to the nation a hundred year purchase of peace and prosperity and what of sacrifice would they make they only surrender to we what they give we for a consideration long long ago what they have not now ask for struggle or care for what have be thrust upon they not less to their own astonishment than to ours but it be say we can not restore it that though we elect every member of the low house the senate be still against we it be quite true that of the senators who pass the nebraska bill a majority of the whole senate will retain their seat in spite of the election of this and the next year but if at these election their several constituency shall clearly express their will against nebraska will these senator disregard their will will they neither obey nor make room for those who will?but even if we fail to technically restore the compromise it be still a great point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration the moral weight of such a vote can not be estimate too highly the author of nebraska be not at all satisfied with the destruction of the compromise&mdash;an endorsement of this principle they proclaim to be the great object with they nebraska alone be a small matter&mdash;to establish a principle for future use be what they particularly desire that future use be to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world local and unorganized opposition can not prevent it now if you wish to give they this endorsement&mdash;if you wish to establish this principle&mdash;do so i shall regret it but it be your right on the contrary if you be oppose to the principle&mdash;intend to give it no such endorsement&mdash;let no wheedling no sophistry divert you from throw a direct vote against it some man mostly whig who condemn the repeal of the missouri compromise nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration lest they be throw in company with the abolitionist will they allow i as an old whig to tell they good humoredly that i think this be very silly stand with anybody that stand right stand with he while he be right and part with he when he go wrong stand with the abolitionist in restore the missouri compromise and stand against he when he attempt to repeal the fugitive slave law in the latter case you stand with the southern disunionist what of that you be still right in both case you be right in both case you oppose the dangerous extreme in both you stand on middle ground and hold the ship level and steady in both you be national and nothing less than national this be good old whig ground to desert such ground because of any company be to be less than a whig&mdash;less than a man&mdash;less than an american i particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of this nebraska law give to slavery in the body politic i object to it because it assume that there can be moral right in the enslaving of one man by another i object to it as a dangerous dalliance for a few people&mdash;a sad evidence that feel prosperity we forget right&mdash;that liberty as a principle we have cease to revere i object to it because the father of the republic eschew and reject it the argument of ldquo;necessity&rdquo be the only argument they ever admit in favor of slavery and so far and so far only as it carry they do they ever go they find the institution exist among we which they could not help and they cast blame upon the british king for having permit its introduction before the constitution they prohibit its introduction into the north western territory&mdash;the only country we own then free from it at the framing and adoption of the constitution they forbear to so much as mention the word ldquo;slave&rdquo or ldquo;slavery&rdquo in the whole instrument in the provision for the recovery of fugitive the slave be speak of as a ldquo;person hold to service or labor.&rdquo in that prohibit the abolition of the african slave trade for twenty year that trade be speak of as ldquo;the migration or importation of such person as any of the states now exist shall think proper to admit,&rdquo amp;c these be the only provision allude to slavery thus the thing be hide away in the constitution just as an afflicted man hide away a wen or a cancer which he dares not cut out at once lest he blee to death with the promise nevertheless that the cutting may begin at the end of a give time less than this our father could not do and now they would not do necessity drive they so far and far they would not go but this be not all the early congress under the constitution take the same view of slavery they hedge and hem it in to the narrow limit of necessity in 1794 they prohibit an out go slave trade&mdash;that be the taking of slave from the united states to sell in 1798 they prohibit the bringing of slave from africa into the mississippi territory&mdash;this territory then comprise what be now the states of mississippi and alabama this be ten year before they have the authority to do the same thing as to the states exist at the adoption of the constitution in 1800 they prohibit american citizen from trade in slave between foreign countries&mdash;as for instance from africa to brazil in 1803 they pass a law in aid of one or two state law in restraint of the internal slave trade in 1807 in apparent hot haste they pass the law nearly a year in advance to take effect the first day of 1808&mdash;the very first day the constitution would permit&mdash;prohibite the african slave trade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalty in 1820 find these provision ineffectual they declare the trade piracy and annex to it the extreme penalty of death while all this be pass in the general government five or six of the original slave states have adopt system of gradual emancipation and by which the institution be rapidly become extinct within these limit thus we see the plain unmistakable spirit of that age towards slavery be hostility to the principle and toleration only by necessity.but now it be to be transform into a ldquo;sacred right.&rdquo nebraska bring it forth place it on the high road to extension and perpetuity and with a pat on its back say to it ldquo;go and god speed you.&rdquo henceforth it be to be the chief jewel of the nation&mdash;the very figure head of the ship of state little by little but steadily as man 's march to the grave we have be give up the old for the new faith near eighty year ago we begin by declare that all man be create equal but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration that for some man to enslave other be a ldquo;sacre right of self government.&rdquo these principle can not stand together they be as opposite as god and mammon and whoever hold to the one must despise the other when pettit in connection with his support of the nebraska bill call the declaration of independence ldquo;a self evident lie&rdquo he only do what consistency and candor require all other nebraska man to do of the forty odd nebraska senators who sit present and hear he no one rebuke he nor be i apprize that any nebraska newspaper or any nebraska orator in the whole nation have ever yet rebuke he if this have be say among marion 's man southerners though they be what would have become of the man who say it if this have be say to the man who capture andre the man who say it would probably have be hang soon than andre be if it have be say in old independence hall seventy eight year ago the very door keeper would have throttle the man and thrust he into the street let no one be deceive the spirit of seventy six and the spirit of nebraska be utter antagonism and the former be be rapidly displace by the latter fellow countrymen&mdash;american south as well as north shall we make no effort to arrest this already the liberal party throughout the world express the apprehension ldquo;that the one retrograde institution in america be undermine the principle of progress and fatally violate the noble political system the world ever saw.&rdquo this be not the taunt of enemy but the warning of friend be it quite safe to disregard it&mdash;to despise it be there no danger to liberty itself in discard the early practice and first precept of our ancient faith in our greedy chase to make profit of the negro let we beware lest we ldquo;cancel and tear to pieces&rdquo even the white man 's charter of freedom our republican robe be soil and trail in the dust let we repurify it let we turn and wash it white in the spirit if not the blood of the revolution let we turn slavery from its claim of ldquo;moral right,&rdquo back upon its exist legal right and its argument of ldquo;necessity.&rdquo let we return it to the position our father give it and there let it rest in peace let we re adopt the declaration of independence and with it the practice and policy which harmonize with it let north and south&mdash;let all americans&mdash;let all lover of liberty everywhere&mdash;join in the great and good work if we do this we shall not only have save the union but we shall have so save it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the saving we shall have so save it that the succeed million of free happy people the world over shall rise up and call we bless to the late generation at springfield twelve day ago where i have speak substantially as i have here judge douglas reply to me&mdash;and as he be to reply to i here i shall attempt to anticipate he by notice some of the point he make there he commence by state i have assume all the way through that the principle of the nebraska bill would have the effect of extend slavery he deny that this be intended or that this effect would follow i will not re open the argument upon this point that such be the intention the world believe at the start and will continue to believe this be the countenance of the thing and both friend and enemy instantly recognize it as such that countenance can not now be change by argument you can as easily argue the color out of the negro skin like the ldquo;bloody hand&rdquo you may wash it and wash it the red witness of guilt still stick and stare horribly at you next he say congressional intervention never prevent slavery any where&mdash;that it do not prevent it in the north west territory now in illinois&mdash;that in fact illinois come into the union as a slave state&mdash;that the principle of the nebraska bill expel it from illinois from several old states from every where now this be mere quibble all the way through if the ordinance of 87 do not keep slavery out of the north west territory how happen it that the north west shore of the ohio river be entirely free from it while the south east shore less than a mile distant along nearly the whole length of the river be entirely cover with it?if that ordinance do not keep it out of illinois what be it that make the difference between illinois and missouri they lie side by side the mississippi river only divide they while their early settlement be within the same latitude between 1810 and 1820 the number of slave in missouri increased 7,211 while in illinois in the same ten year they decrease 51 this appear by the census return during nearly all of that ten year both be territories&mdash;not states during this time the ordinance forbid slavery to go into illinois and nothing forbid it to go into missouri it do go into missouri and do not go into illinois that be the fact can any one doubt as to the reason of it?but he say illinois come into the union as a slave state silence perhaps would be the good answer to this flat contradiction of the know history of the country what be the fact upon which this bold assertion be base when we first acquire the country as far back as 1787 there be some slave within it hold by the french inhabitant at kaskaskia the territorial legislation admit a few negro from the slave states as indenture servant one year after the adoption of the first state constitution the whole number of they was&mdash;what do you think just 117&mdash;while the aggregate free population be 55,094&mdash;about 470 to one upon this state of fact the people frame their constitution prohibit the further introduction of slavery with a sort of guaranty to the owner of the few indenture servant give freedom to their child to be bear thereafter and make no mention whatever of any suppose slave for life out of this small matter the judge manufacture his argument that illinois come into the union as a slave state let the fact be the answer to the argument the principle of the nebraska bill he say expel slavery from illinois the principle of that bill first plant it here&mdash;that be it first come because there be no law to prevent it&mdash;first come before we own the country and find it here and have the ordinance of 87 to prevent its increasing our people struggle along and finally get rid of it as well they could but the principle of the nebraska bill abolish slavery in several of the old states well it be true that several of the old states in the last quarter of the last century do adopt system of gradual emancipation by which the institution have finally become extinct within their limit but it may or may not be true that the principle of the nebraska bill be the cause that lead to the adoption of these measure it be now more than fifty year since the last of these states adopt its system of emancipation if nebraska bill be the real author of these benevolent work it be rather deplorable that he have for so long a time cease work all together be there not some reason to suspect that it be the principle of the revolution and not the principle of nebraska bill that lead to emancipation in these old states leave it to the people of those old emancipate state and i be quite sure they will decide that neither that nor any other good thing ever do or ever will come of nebraska bill in the course of my main argument judge douglas interrupt i to say that the principle the nebraska bill be very old that it originate when god make man and place good and evil before he allow he to choose for himself be responsible for the choice he should make at the time i think this be merely playful and i answer it accordingly but in his reply to i he renew it as a serious argument in seriousness then the fact of this proposition be not true as state god do not place good and evil before man tell he to make his choice on the contrary he do tell he there be one tree of the fruit of which he should not eat upon pain of certain death i should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in nebraska but this argument strike i as not a little remarkable in another particular&mdash;in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the ldquo;divine right of kings.&rdquo by the latter the king be to do just as he please with his white subject be responsible to god alone by the former the white man be to do just as he please with his black slave be responsible to god alone the two thing be precisely alike and it be but natural that they should find similar argument to sustain they i have argue that the application of the principle of self government as contend for would require the revival of the african slave trade&mdash;that no argument could be make in favor of a man 's right to take slave to nebraska which could not be equally well make in favor of his right to bring they from the coast of africa the judge reply that the constitution require the suppression of the foreign slave trade but do not require the prohibition of slavery in the territory that be a mistake in point of fact the constitution do not require the action of congress in either case and it do authorize it in both and so there be still no difference between the case in regard to what i have say the advantage the slave states have over the free in the matter of representation the judge reply that we in the free states count five free negro as five white people while in the slave states they count five slave as three white only and that the advantage at last be on the side of the free state now in the slave states they count free negro just as we do and it so happen that besides their slave they have as many free negro as we have and thirty three thousand over thus their free negro more than balance our and their advantage over we in consequence of their slave still remain as i state it in reply to my argument that the compromise measure of 1850 be a system of equivalent and that the provision of no one of they could fairly be carry to other subject without its corresponding equivalent be carry with it the judge deny out right that these measure have any connection with or dependence upon each other this be mere desperation if they have no connection why be they always speak of in connection why have he so speak of they a thousand time why have he constantly call they a series of measure why do everybody call they a compromise why be california keep out of the union six or seven month if it be not because of its connection with the other measure webster 's lead definition of the verb ldquo;to compromise&rdquo be ldquo;to adjust and settle a difference by mutual agreement with concession of claim by the parties.&rdquo this convey precisely the popular understanding of the word compromise we know before the judge tell we that these measure pass separately and in distinct bill and that no two of they be pass by the vote of precisely the same member but we also know and so do he know that no one of they could have pass both branch of congress but for the understanding that the other be to pass also upon this understanding each get vote which it could have get in no other way it be this fact that give to the measure their true character and it be the universal knowledge of this fact that have give they the name of compromise so expressive of that true character i have ask ldquo;if in carry the provision of the utah and new mexico law to nebraska you could clear away other objection how can you leave nebraska ldquo;perfectly free&rdquo to introduce slavery before she form a constitution&mdash;dure her territorial government?&mdash;while the utah and new mexico law only authorize it when they form constitution and be admit into the union?&rdquo to this judge douglas answer that the utah and new mexico law also authorize it before and to prove this he read from one of their law as follow ldquo;that the legislative power of say territory shall extend to all rightful subject of legislation consistent with the constitution of the united states and the provision of this act.&rdquo;now it be perceive from the reading of this that there be nothing express upon the subject but that the authority be seek to be imply merely for the general provision of ldquo;all rightful subject of legislation.&rdquo in reply to this i insist as a legal rule of construction as well as the plain popular view of the matter that the express provision for utah and new mexico come in with slavery if they choose when they shall form constitution be an exclusion of all imply authority on the same subject&mdash;that congress have the subject distinctly in their mind when they make the express provision they therein express their whole meaning on that subject the judge rather insinuate that i have find it convenient to forget the washington territorial law pass in 1853 this be a division of oregon organize the northern part as the territory of washington he assert that by this act the ordinance of 87 theretofore exist in oregon be repeal that nearly all the member of congress vote for it begin in the h.r. with charles allen of massachusetts and end with richard yates of illinois and that he could not understand how those who now oppose the nebraska bill so vote then unless it be because it be then too soon after both the great political party have ratify the compromise of 1850 and the ratification therefore too fresh to be then repudiate now i have see the washington act before and i have carefully examine it since and i aver that there be no repeal of the ordinance of 87 or of any prohibition of slavery in it in express term there be absolutely nothing in the whole law upon the subject&mdash;in fact nothing to lead a reader to think of the subject to my judgment it be equally free from every thing from which such repeal can be legally imply but however this may be be man now to be entrap by a legal implication extract from covert language introduce perhaps for the very purpose of entrap they i sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through carefully watch every sentence and every line for a repeal of the ordinance of 87 or any thing equivalent to it another point on the washington act if it be intend to be model after the utah and new mexico act as judge douglas insist why be it not insert in it as in they that washington be to come in with or without slavery as she may choose at the adoption of her constitution it have no such provision in it and i defy the ingenuity of man to give a reason for the omission other than that it be not intend to follow the utah and new mexico law in regard to the question of slavery the washington act not only differ vitally from the utah and new mexico act but the nebraska act differ vitally from both by the latter act the people be leave ldquo;perfectly free&rdquo to regulate their own domestic concern amp;c but in all the former all their law be to be submit to congress and if disapprove be to be null the washington act go even far it absolutely prohibit the territorial legislation by very strong and guard language from establish bank or borrow money on the faith of the territory be this the sacred right of self government we hear vaunted so much no sir the nebraska bill find no model in the act of 50 or the washington act it find no model in any law from adam till today as phillips say of napoleon the nebraska act be grand gloomy and peculiar wrap in the solitude of its own originality without a model and without a shadow upon the earth in the course of his reply senator douglas remark in substance that he have always consider this government be make for the white people and not for the negro why in point of mere fact i think so too but in this remark of the judge there be a significance which i think be the key to the great mistake if there be any such mistake which he have make in this nebraska measure it show that the judge have no very vivid impression that the negro be a human and consequently have no idea that there can be any moral question in legislate about he in his view the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free be a matter of as utter indifference as it be whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with tobacco or stock it with horn cattle now whether this view be right or wrong it be very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view they consider slavery a great moral wrong and their feeling against it be not evanescent but eternal it lie at the very foundation of their sense of justice and it can not be trifle with it be a great and durable element of popular action and i think no statesman can safely disregard it our senator also object that those who oppose he in this measure do not entirely agree with one another he remind i that in my firm adherence to the constitutional right of the slave states i differ widely from other who be co operate with i in oppose the nebraska bill and he say it be not quite fair to oppose he in this variety of way he should remember that he take we by surprise&mdash;astounde us&mdash;by this measure we be thunderstruck and stun and we reel and fall in utter confusion but we rise each fighting grasp whatever he could first reach&mdash;a scythe&mdash;a pitchfork&mdash;a chop axe or a butcher 's cleaver we strike in the direction of the sound and we be rapidly close in upon he he must not think to divert we from our purpose by show we that our drill our dress and our weapon be not entirely perfect and uniform when the storm shall be past he shall find we still americans no less devoted to the continued union and prosperity of the country than heretofore finally the judge invoke against i the memory of clay and of webster they be great man and man of great deed but where have i assail they for what be it that their life long enemy shall now make profit by assume to defend they against i their life long friend i go against the repeal of the missouri compromise do they ever go for it they go for the compromise of 1850 do i ever go against they they be greatly devoted to the union to the small measure of my ability be i ever less so clay and webster be dead before this question arise by what authority shall our senator say they would espouse his side of it if alive mr. clay be the lead spirit in make the missouri compromise be it very credible that if now alive he would take the lead in the breaking of it the truth be that some support from whig be now a necessity with the judge and for thus it be that the name of clay and webster be now invoke his old friend have desert he in such number as to leave too few to live by he come to his own and his own receive he not and lo he turn unto the gentiles a word now as to the judge 's desperate assumption that the compromise of 50 have no connection with one another that illinois come into the union as a slave state and some other similar one this be no other than a bold denial of the history of the country if we do not know that the compromise of 50 be dependent on each other if we do not know that illinois come into the union as a free state&mdash;we do not know any thing if we do not know these thing we do not know that we ever have a revolutionary war or such a chief as washington to deny these thing be to deny our national axiom or dogma at least and it put an end to all argument if a man will stand up and assert and repeat and re assert that two and two do not make four i know nothing in the power of argument that can stop he i think i can answer the judge so long as he stick to the premise but when he fly from they i can not work an argument into the consistency of a maternal gag and actually close his mouth with it in such a case i can only commend he to the seventy thousand answer just in from pennsylvania ohio and indiana
fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives the past have be an eventful year and will be hereafter refer to as a marked epoch in the history of the world while we have be happily preserve from the calamity of war our domestic prosperity have not be entirely uninterrupted the crop in portion of the country have be nearly cut off disease have prevail to a great extent than usual and the sacrifice of human life through casualty by sea and land be without parallel but the pestilence have sweep by and restore salubrity invite the absent to their home and the return of business to its ordinary channel if the earth have reward the labor of the husbandman less bountifully than in precede season it have leave he with abundance for domestic want and a large surplus for exportation in the present therefore as in the past we find ample ground for reverent thankfulness to the god of grace and providence for his protect care and merciful dealing with we as a people although our attention have be arrest by painful interest in pass event yet our country feel no more than the slight vibration of the convulsion which have shake europe as individual we can not repress sympathy with human suffering nor regret for the cause which produce it as a nation we be remind that whatever interrupt the peace or check the prosperity of any part of christendom tend more or less to involve our own the condition of states be not unlike that of individual they be mutually dependent upon each other amicable relation between they and reciprocal good will be essential for the promotion of whatever be desirable in their moral social and political condition hence it have be my earnest endeavor to maintain peace and friendly intercourse with all nation the wise theory of this government so early adopt and steadily pursue of avoid all entangle alliance have hitherto exempt it from many complication in which it would otherwise have become involve notwithstanding this our clearly define and well sustain course of action and our geographical position so remote from europe increase disposition have be manifest by some of its government to supervise and in certain respect to direct our foreign policy in plan for adjust the balance of power among themselves they have assume to take we into account and would constrain we to conform our conduct to their view one or another of the power of europe have from time to time undertake to enforce arbitrary regulation contrary in many respect to establish principle of international law that law the united states have in their foreign intercourse uniformly respect and observe and they can not recognize any such interpolation therein as the temporary interest of other may suggest they do not admit that the sovereign of one continent or of a particular community of state can legislate for all other leave the transatlantic nation to adjust their political system in the way they may think well for their common welfare the independent power of this continent may well assert the right to be exempt from all annoying interference on their part systematic abstinence from intimate political connection with distant foreign nation do not conflict with give the wide range to our foreign commerce this distinction so clearly mark in history seem to have be overlook or disregard by some lead foreign state our refusal to be bring within and subject to their peculiar system have i fear create a jealous distrust of our conduct and induce on their part occasional act of disturb effect upon our foreign relation our present attitude and past course give assurance which should not be question that our purpose be not aggressive nor threaten to the safety and welfare of other nation our military establishment in time of peace be adapt to maintain exterior defense and to preserve order among the aboriginal tribe within the limit of the union our naval force be intend only for the protection of our citizen abroad and of our commerce diffused as it be over all the sea of the globe the government of the united states be essentially pacific in policy stand prepared to repel invasion by the voluntary service of a patriotic people and provide no permanent mean of foreign aggression these consideration should allay all apprehension that we be disposed to encroach on the right or endanger the security of other state some european power have regard with disquieting concern the territorial expansion of the united states this rapid growth have result from the legitimate exercise of sovereign right belong alike to all nation and by many liberally exercise under such circumstance it could hardly have be expect that those among they which have within a comparatively recent period subdue and absorb ancient kingdom plant their standard on every continent and now possess or claim the control of the island of every ocean as their appropriate domain would look with unfriendly sentiment upon the acquisition of this country in every instance honorably obtain or would feel themselves justify in impute our advancement to a spirit of aggression or to a passion for political predominance our foreign commerce have reach a magnitude and extent nearly equal to that of the first maritime power of the earth and exceed that of any other over this great interest in which not only our merchant but all class of citizen at least indirectly be concern it be the duty of the executive and legislative branch of the government to exercise a careful supervision and adopt proper measure for its protection the policy which i have in view in regard to this interest embrace its future as well as its present security long experience have show that in general when the principal power of europe be engage in war the right of neutral nation be endanger this consideration lead in the progress of the war of our independence to the formation of the celebrated confederacy of armed neutrality a primary object of which be to assert the doctrine that free ship make free good except in the case of article contraband of war a doctrine which from the very commencement of our national being have be a cherished idea of the statesman of this country at one period or another every maritime power have by some solemn treaty stipulation recognize that principle and it might have be hope that it would come to be universally receive and respect as a rule of international law but the refusal of one power prevent this and in the next great war which ensue that of the french revolution it fail to be respect among the belligerent states of europe notwithstanding this the principle be generally admit to be a sound and salutary one so much so that at the commencement of the exist war in europe great britain and france announce their purpose to observe it for the present not however as a recognize international fight but as a mere concession for the time be the cooperation however of these two powerful maritime nation in the interest of neutral right appear to i to afford an occasion inviting and justify on the part of the united states a renew effort to make the doctrine in question a principle of international law by mean of special convention between the several power of europe and america accordingly a proposition embrace not only the rule that free ship make free good except contraband article but also the less contested one that neutral property other than contraband though on board enemy 's ship shall be exempt from confiscation have be submit by this government to those of europe and america russia act promptly in this matter and a convention be conclude between that country and the united states provide for the observance of the principle announce not only as between themselves but also as between they and all other nation which shall enter into like stipulation none of the other power have as yet take final action on the subject i be not aware however that any objection to the propose stipulation have be make but on the contrary they be acknowledge to be essential to the security of neutral commerce and the only apparent obstacle to their general adoption be in the possibility that it may be encumber by inadmissible condition the king of the two sicilies have express to our minister at naples his readiness to concur in our proposition relative to neutral right and to enter into a convention on that subject the king of prussia entirely approve of the project of a treaty to the same effect submit to he but propose an additional article provide for the renunciation of privateering such an article for most obvious reason be much desire by nation have naval establishment large in proportion to their foreign commerce if it be adopt as an international rule the commerce of a nation have comparatively a small naval force would be very much at the mercy of its enemy in case of war with a power of decide naval superiority the bare statement of the condition in which the united states would be place after having surrender the right to resort to privateer in the event of war with a belligerent of naval supremacy will show that this government could never listen to such a proposition the navy of the first maritime power in europe be at least ten time as large as that of the united states the foreign commerce of the two country be nearly equal and about equally expose to hostile depredation in war between that power and the united states without resort on our part to our mercantile marine the mean of our enemy to inflict injury upon our commerce would be tenfold great than our to retaliate we could not extricate our country from this unequal condition with such an enemy unless we at once depart from our present peaceful policy and become a great naval power nor would this country be well situate in war with one of the secondary naval power though the naval disparity would be less the great extent and more exposed condition of our widespread commerce would give any of they a like advantage over we the proposition to enter into engagement to forego a resort to privateer in case this country should be force into war with a great naval power be not entitle to more favorable consideration than would be a proposition to agree not to accept the service of volunteer for operation on land when the honor or the right of our country require it to assume a hostile attitude it confidently rely upon the patriotism of its citizen not ordinarily devoted to the military profession to augment the army and the navy so as to make they fully adequate to the emergency which call they into action the proposal to surrender the right to employ privateer be professedly found upon the principle that private property of unoffending noncombatant though enemy should be exempt from the ravage of war but the propose surrender go but little way in carry out that principle which equally require that such private property should not be seize or molest by national ship of war should the lead power of europe concur in propose as a rule of international law to exempt private property upon the ocean from seizure by public armed cruiser as well as by privateer the united states will readily meet they upon that broad ground since the adjournment of congress the ratification of the treaty between the united states and great britain relative to coast fishery and to reciprocal trade with the british north american provinces have be exchange and some of its anticipated advantage be already enjoy by we although its full execution be to abide certain act of legislation not yet fully perform so soon as it be ratify great britain open to our commerce the free navigation of the river st. lawrence and to our fisherman unmoleste access to the shore and bay from which they have be previously exclude on the coast of her north american provinces in return for which she ask for the introduction free of duty into the port of the united states of the fish catch on the same coast by british fisherman this be the compensation stipulate in the treaty for privilege of the high importance and value to the united states which be thus voluntarily yield before it become effective the request seem to i to be a reasonable one but it could not be accede to from want of authority to suspend our law impose duty upon all foreign fish in the meantime the treasury department issue a regulation for ascertain the duty pay or secure by bond on fish catch on the coast of the british provinces and bring to our market by british subject after the fishing ground have be make fully accessible to the citizen of the united states i recommend to your favorable consideration a proposition which will be submit to you for authority to refund the duty and cancel the bond thus receive the provinces of canada and new brunswick have also anticipate the full operation of the treaty by legislative arrangement respectively to admit free of duty the product of the united states mention in the free list of the treaty and an arrangement similar to that regard british fish have be make for duty now chargeable on the product of those provinces enumerate in the same free list and introduce therefrom into the united states a proposition for refunding which will in my judgment be in like manner entitle to your favorable consideration there be difference of opinion between the united states and great britain as to the boundary line of the territory of washington adjoin the british possession on the pacific which have already lead to difficulty on the part of the citizen and local authority of the two government i recommend that provision he make for a commission to be join by one on the part of her britannic majesty for the purpose of run and establish the line in controversy certain stipulation of the third and fourth article of the treaty conclude by the united states and great britain in 1846 regard possessory right of the hudsons bay company and property of the pugets sound agricultural company have give rise to serious dispute and it be important to all concerned that summary mean of settle they amicably should be devise i have reason to believe that an arrangement can be make on just term for the extinguishment of the right in question embrace also the right of the hudsons bay company to the navigation of the river columbia and i therefore suggest to your consideration the expediency of make a contingent appropriation for that purpose france be the early and efficient ally of the united states in their struggle for independence from that time to the present with occasional slight interruption cordial relation of friendship have exist between the government and people of the two country the kindly sentiment cherish alike by both nation have lead to extensive social and commercial intercourse which i trust will not be interrupt or check by any casual event of an apparently unsatisfactory character the french consul at san francisco be not long since bring into the united states district court at that place by compulsory process as a witness in favor of another foreign consul in violation as the french government conceive of his privilege under our consular convention with france there be nothing in the transaction which could imply any disrespect to france or its consul such explanation have be make as i hope will be satisfactory subsequently misunderstanding arise on the subject of the french government have as it appear abruptly exclude the american minister to spain from pass through france on his way from london to madrid but that government have unequivocally disavow any design to deny the right of transit to the minister of the united states and after explanation to this effect he have resume his journey and actually return through france to spain i herewith lie before congress the correspondence on this subject between our envoy at paris and the minister of foreign relation of the french government the position of our affair with spain remain as at the close of the last session internal agitation assume very nearly the character of political revolution have recently convulse that country the late minister be violently expel from power and man of very different view in relation to its internal affair have succeed since this change there have be no propitious opportunity to resume and press on negotiation for the adjustment of serious question of difficulty between the spanish government and the united states there be reason to believe that our minister will find the present government more favorably inclined than the precede to comply with our just demand and to make suitable arrangement for restore harmony and preserve peace between the two country negotiation be pende with denmark to discontinue the practice of levy toll on our vessel and their cargo pass through the sound i do not doubt that we can claim exemption therefrom as a matter of right it be admit on all hand that this exaction be sanction not by the general principle of the law of nation but only by special convention which most of the commercial nation have enter into with denmark the fifth article of our treaty of 1826 with denmark provide that there shall not be pay on the vessel of the united states and their cargo when pass through the sound high duty than those of the most favor nation this may be regard as an imply agreement to submit to the toll during the continuance of the treaty and consequently may embarrass the assertion of our right to be release therefrom there be also other provision in the treaty which ought to be modify it be to remain in force for ten year and until one year after either party should give notice to the other of intention to terminate it i deem it expedient that the contemplated notice should be give to the government of denmark the naval expedition dispatch about two year since for the purpose of establish relation with the empire of japan have be ably and skillfully conduct to a successful termination by the officer to whom it be intrust a treaty open certain of the port of that populous country have be negotiate and in order to give full effect thereto it only remain to exchange ratification and adopt requisite commercial regulation the treaty lately conclude between the united states and mexico settle some of our most embarrassing difficulty with that country but numerous claim upon it for wrong and injury to our citizen remain unadjusted and many new ease have be recently add to the former list of grievance our legation have be earnest in its endeavor to obtain from the mexican government a favorable consideration of these claim but hitherto without success this failure be probably in some measure to be ascribe to the disturbed condition of that country it have be my anxious desire to maintain friendly relation with the mexican republic and to cause its right and territory to be respect not only by our citizen but by foreigner who have resort to the united states for the purpose of organize hostile expedition against some of the states of that republic the defenseless condition in which its frontier have be leave have stimulate lawless adventurer to embark in these enterprise and greatly increase the difficulty of enforce our obligation of neutrality regard it as my solemn duty to fulfill efficiently these obligation not only toward mexico but other foreign nation i have exert all the power with which i be invest to defeat such proceeding and bring to punishment those who by take a part therein violate our law the energy and activity of our civil and military authority have frustrate the design of those who meditate expedition of this character except in two instance one of these compose of foreigner be at first countenance and aid by the mexican government itself it having be deceive as to their real object the other small in number elude the vigilance of the magistrate at san francisco and succeed in reach the mexican territory but the effective measure take by this government compel the abandonment of the undertaking the commission to establish the new line between the united states and mexico accord to the provision of the treaty of the 30th of december last have be organize and the work be already commence our treaty with the argentine confederation and with the republics of uruguay and paraguay secure to we the free navigation of the river la plata and some of its large tributary but the same success have not attend our endeavor to open the amazon the reason in favor of the free use of that river i have occasion to present fully in a former message and consider the cordial relation which have long exist between this government and brazil it may be expect that pende negotiation will eventually reach a favorable result convenient mean of transit between the several part of a country be not only desirable for the object of commercial and personal communication but essential to its existence under one government separate as be the atlantic and pacific coast of the united states by the whole breadth of the continent still the inhabitant of each be closely bind together by community of origin and institution and by strong attachment to the union hence the constant and increase intercourse and vast interchange of commercial production between these remote division of the republic at the present time the most practicable and only commodious route for communication between they be by the way of the isthmus of central america it be the duty of the government to secure these avenue against all danger of interruption in relation to central america perplex question exist between the united states and great britain at the time of the cession of california these as well as question which subsequently arise concern interoceanic communication across the isthmus be as it be suppose adjust by the treaty of april 19 1850 but unfortunately they have be reopen by serious misunderstanding as to the import of some or its provision a readjustment of which be now under consideration our minister at london have make strenuous effort to accomplish this desirable object but have not yet find it possible to bring the negotiation to a termination as incidental to these question i deem it proper to notice an occurrence which happen in central america near the close of the last session of congress so soon as the necessity be perceive of establish interoceanic communication across the isthmus a company be organize under the authority of the state of nicaragua but compose for the most part of citizen of the united states for the purpose of open such a transit way by the river san juan and lake nicaragua which soon become an eligible and much use route in the transportation of our citizen and their property between the atlantic and pacific meanwhile and in anticipation of the completion and importance of this transit way a number of adventurer have take possession of the old spanish port at the mouth of the river san juan in open defiance of the state or states of central america which upon their become independent have rightfully succeed to the local sovereignty and jurisdiction of spain these adventurer undertake to change the name of the place from san juan del norte to greytown and though at first pretend to act as the subject of the fictitious sovereign of the mosquito indians they subsequently repudiate the control of any power whatever assume to adopt a distinct political organization and declare themselves an independent sovereign state if at some time a faint hope be entertain that they might become a stable and respectable community that hope soon vanish they proceed to assert unfounded claim to civil jurisdiction over punta arenas a position on the opposite side of the river san juan which be in possession under a title wholly independent of they of citizen of the united states interested in the nicaragua transit company and which be indispensably necessary to the prosperous operation of that route across the isthmus the company resist their groundless claim whereupon they proceed to destroy some of its building and attempt violently to dispossess it at a late period they organize a strong force for the purpose of demolish the establishment at punta arenas but this mischievous design be defeat by the interposition of one of our ship of war at that time in the harbor of san juan subsequently to this in may last a body of man from greytown cross over to punta arenas arrogate authority to arrest on the charge of murder a captain of one of the steamboat of the transit company be well aware that the claim to exercise jurisdiction there would be resist then as it have be on previous occasion they go prepared to assert it by force of arm our minister to central america happen to be present on that occasion believe that the captain of the steamboat be innocent for he witness the transaction on which the charge be founder and believe also that the intrude party have no jurisdiction over the place where they propose to make the arrest would encounter desperate resistance if they persist in their purpose he interpose effectually to prevent violence and bloodshed the american minister afterwards visit greytown and whilst he be there a mob include certain of the so call public functionary of the place surround the house in which he be avow that they have come to arrest he by order of some person exercise the chief authority while parley with they he be wound by a missile from the crowd a boat dispatch from the american steamer northern light to release he from the perilous situation in which he be understand to be be fire into by the town guard and compel to return these incident together with the known character of the population of greytown and their excited state induce just apprehension that the life and property of our citizen at punta arenas would be in imminent danger after the departure of the steamer with her passenger for new york unless a guard be leave for their protection for this purpose and in order to insure the safety of passenger and property pass over the route a temporary force be organize at considerable expense to the united states for which provision be make at the last session of congress this pretended community a heterogeneous assemblage gather from various country and compose for the most part of black and person of mixed blood have previously give other indication of mischievous and dangerous propensity early in the same month property be clandestinely abstract from the depot of the transit company and take to greytown the plunderer obtain shelter there and their pursuer be drive back by its people who not only protect the wrongdoer and share the plunder but treat with rudeness and violence those who seek to recover their property such in substance be the fact submit to my consideration and prove by trustworthy evidence i could not doubt that the case demand the interposition of this government justice require that reparation should be make for so many and such gross wrong and that a course of insolence and plunder tend directly to the insecurity of the life of numerous traveler and of the rich treasure belong to our citizen pass over this transit way should be peremptorily arrest whatever it might be in other respect the community in question in power to do mischief be not despicable it be well provide with ordnance small arm and ammunition and might easily seize on the unarmed boat freight with million of property which pass almost daily within its reach it do not profess to belong to any regular government and have in fact no recognize dependence on or connection with anyone to which the united states or their injured citizen might apply for redress or which could be hold responsible in any way for the outrage commit not stand before the world in the attitude of an organized political society be neither competent to exercise the right nor to discharge the obligation of a government it be in fact a maraud establishment too dangerous to be disregard and too guilty to pass unpunished and yet incapable of be treat in any other way than as a piratical resort of outlaws or a camp of savage depredate on emigrant train or caravans and the frontier settlement of civilized state seasonable notice be give to the people of greytown that this government require they to repair the injury they have do to our citizen and to make suitable apology for their insult of our minister and that a ship of war would be dispatch thither to enforce compliance with these demand but the notice pass unheeded thereupon a commander of the navy in charge of the sloop of war cyane be order to repeat the demand and to insist upon a compliance therewith find that neither the populace nor those assume to have authority over they manifest any disposition to make the require reparation or even to offer excuse for their conduct he warn they by a public proclamation that if they do not give satisfaction within a time specify he would bombard the town by this procedure he afford they opportunity to provide for their personal safety to those also who desire to avoid loss of property in the punishment about to be inflict on the offend town he furnish the mean of remove their effect by the boat of his own ship and of a steamer which he procure and tender to they for that purpose at length perceive no disposition on the part of the town to comply with his requisition he appeal to the commander of her britannic majesty 's schooner bermuda who be see to have intercourse and apparently much influence with the leader among they to interpose and persuade they to take some course calculate to save the necessity of resort to the extreme measure indicate in his proclamation but that officer instead of accede to the request do nothing more than to protest against the contemplated bombardment no step of any sort be take by the people to give the satisfaction require no individual if any there be who regard themselves as not responsible for the misconduct of the community adopt any mean to separate themselves from the fate of the guilty the several charge on which the demand for redress be found have be publicly know to all for some time and be again announce to they they do not deny any of these charge they offer no explanation nothing in extenuation of their conduct but contumaciously refuse to hold any intercourse with the commander of the cyane by their obstinate silence they seem rather desirous to provoke chastisement than to escape it there be ample reason to believe that this conduct of wanton defiance on their part be imputable chiefly to the delusive idea that the american government would be deter from punish they through fear of displease a formidable foreign power which they presume to think look with complacency upon their aggressive and insult deportment toward the united states the cyane at length fire upon the town before much injury have be do the fire be twice suspend in order to afford opportunity for an arrangement but this be decline most of the building of the place of little value generally be in the sequel destroy but owe to the considerate precaution take by our naval commander there be no destruction of life when the cyane be order to central america it be confidently hope and expect that no occasion would arise for a resort to violence and destruction of property and loss of life instruction to that effect be give to her commander and no extreme act would have be requisite have not the people themselves by their extraordinary conduct in the affair frustrate all the possible mild measure for obtain satisfaction a withdrawal from the place the object of his visit entirely defeat would under the circumstance in which the commander of the cyane find himself have be absolute abandonment of all claim of our citizen for indemnification and submissive acquiescence in national indignity it would have encourage in these lawless man a spirit of insolence and rapine most dangerous to the life and property of our citizen at punta arenas and probably embolden they to grasp at the treasure and valuable merchandise continually pass over the nicaragua route it certainly would have be most satisfactory to i if the object of the cyane 's mission could have be consummate without any act of public force but the arrogant contumacy of the offender render it impossible to avoid the alternative either to break up their establishment or to leave they impressed with the idea that they might persevere with impunity in a career of insolence and plunder this transaction have be the subject of complaint on the part of some foreign power and have be characterize with more of harshness than of justice if comparison be to be institute it would not be difficult to present repeat instance in the history of state stand in the very front of modern civilization where community far less offending and more defenseless than greytown have be chastise with much great severity and where not city only have be lay in ruin but human life have be recklessly sacrifice and the blood of the innocent make profusely to mingle with that of the guilty pass from foreign to domestic affair your attention be naturally direct to the financial condition of the country always a subject of general interest for complete and exact information regard the finance and the various branch of the public service connect therewith i refer you to the report of the secretary of the treasury from which it will appear that the amount of revenue during the last fiscal year from all source be $ 73,549,705 and that the public expenditure for the same period exclusive of payment on account of the public debt amount to $ 51 018,249 during the same period the payment make in redemption of the public debt include interest and premium amount to $ 24,336,380 to the sum total of the receipt of that year be to be add a balance remain in the treasury at the commencement thereof amount to $ 21,942,892 and at the close of the same year a corresponding balance amount to $ 20,137,967 of receipt above expenditure also remain in the treasury although in the opinion of the secretary of the treasury the receipt of the current fiscal year be not likely to equal in amount those of the last yet they will undoubtedly exceed the amount of expenditure by at least $ 15,000,000 i shall therefore continue to direct that the surplus revenue be apply so far as it can be judiciously and economically do to the reduction of the public debt the amount of which at the commencement of the last fiscal year be $ 67,340,628 of which there have be pay on the 20th day of november 1854 the sum of $ 22,365,172 leave a balance of outstanding public debt of only $ 44,975,456 redeemable at different period within fourteen year there be also remnant of other government stock most of which be already due and on which the interest have cease but which have not yet be present for payment amount to $ 233,179 this statement exhibit the fact that the annual income of the government greatly exceed the amount of its public debt which latter remain unpaid only because the time of payment have not yet mature and it can not be discharge at once except at the option of public creditor who prefer to retain the security of the united states and the other fact not less striking that the annual revenue from all source exceed by many million of dollar the amount need for a prudent and economical administration of the government the estimate present to congress from the different executive departments at the last session amount to $ 38,406,581 and the appropriation make to the sum of $ 58,116,958 of this excess of appropriation over estimate however more than twenty million be applicable to extraordinary object have no reference to the usual annual expenditure among these object be embrace ten million to meet the third article of the treaty between the united states and mexico so that in fact for object of ordinary expenditure the appropriation be limit to considerably less than $ 40,000,000 i therefore renew my recommendation for a reduction of the duty on import the report of the secretary of the treasury present a series of table show the operation of the revenue system for several successive year and as the general principle of reduction of duty with a view to revenue and not protection may now be regard as the settle policy of the country i trust that little difficulty will be encounter in settle the detail of a measure to that effect in connection with this subject i recommend a change in the law which recent experience have show to be essential to the protection of the government there be no express provision of law require the record and paper of a public character of the several officer of the government to be leave in their office for the use of their successor nor any provision declare it felony on their part to make false entry in the book or return false account in the absence of such express provision by law the outgoing officer in many instance have claim and exercise the right to take into their own possession important book and paper on the ground that these be their private property and have place they beyond the reach of the government conduct of this character bring in several instance to the notice of the present secretary of the treasury naturally awaken his suspicion and result in the disclosure that at four port namely oswego toledo sandusky and milwaukee the treasury have by false entry be defraud within the four year next precede march 1853 of the sum of $ 198,000 the great difficulty with which the detection of these fraud have be attend in consequence of the abstraction of book and paper by the retire officer and the facility with which similar fraud in the public service may be perpetrate render the necessity of new legal enactment in the respect above refer to quite obvious for other material modification of the revenue law which seem to i desirable i refer you to the report of the secretary of the treasury that report and the table which accompany it furnish ample proof of the solid foundation on which the financial security of the country rest and of the salutary influence of the independent treasury system upon commerce and all monetary operation the experience of the last year furnish additional reason i regret to say of a painful character for the recommendation heretofore make to provide for increase the military force employ in the territory inhabit by the indians the settler on the frontier have suffer much from the incursion of predatory band and large party of emigrant to our pacific possession have be massacre with impunity the recurrence of such scene can only be prevent by teach these wild tribe the power of and their responsibility to the united states from the garrison of our frontier post it be only possible to detach troop in small body and though these have on all occasion display a gallantry and a stern devotion to duty which on a large field would have command universal admiration they have usually suffer severely in these conflict with superior number and have sometimes be entirely sacrifice all the disposable force of the army be already employ on this service and be know to be wholly inadequate to the protection which should be afford the public mind of the country have be recently shock by savage atrocity commit upon defenseless emigrant and border settlement and hardly less by the unnecessary destruction of valuable life where inadequate detachment of troop have undertake to furnish the need aid without increase of the military force these scene will be repeat it be to be fear on a large scale and with more disastrous consequence congress i be sure will perceive that the plainest duty and responsibility of government be involve in this question and i doubt not that prompt action may be confidently anticipate when delay must be attend by such fearful hazard the bill of the last session provide for an increase of the pay of the rank and file of the army have have beneficial result not only in facilitate enlistment but in obvious improvement in the class of man who enter the service i regret that correspond consideration be not bestow on the officer who in view of their character and service and the expense to which they be necessarily subject receive at present what be in my judgment inadequate compensation the valuable service constantly render by the army and its inestimable importance as the nucleus around which the volunteer force of the nation can promptly gather in the hour of danger sufficiently attest the wisdom of maintain a military peace establishment but the theory of our system and the wise practice under it require that any propose augmentation in time of peace be only commensurate with our extend limit and frontier relation while scrupulously adhere to this principle i find in exist circumstance a necessity for increase of our military force and it be believe that four new regiment two of infantry and two of mount man will be sufficient to meet the present exigency if it be necessary carefully to weigh the cost in a case of such urgency it would be show that the additional expense would be comparatively light with the increase of the numerical force of the army should i think be combine certain measure of reform in its organic arrangement and administration the present organization be the result of partial legislation often direct to special object and interest and the law regulate rank and command having be adopt many year ago from the british code be not always applicable to our service it be not surprising therefore that the system should be deficient in the symmetry and simplicity essential to the harmonious working of its several part and require a careful revision the present organization by maintain large staff corp or department separate many officer from that close connection with troop and those active duty in the field which be deem requisite to qualify they for the varied responsibility of high command be the duty of the army staff mainly discharge by officer detach from their regiment it be believe that the special service would be equally well perform and the discipline and instruction of the army be improve while due regard to the security of the right of officer and to the nice sense of honor which should be cultivate among they would seem to exact compliance with the establish rule of promotion in ordinary case still it can hardly be doubt that the range of promotion by selection which be now practically confine to the grade of general officer might be somewhat extended with benefit to the public service observance of the rule of seniority sometimes lead especially in time of peace to the promotion of officer who after meritorious and even distinguished service may have be render by age or infirmity incapable of perform active duty and whose advancement therefore would tend to impair the efficiency of the army suitable provision for this class of officer by the creation of a retire list would remedy the evil without wound the just pride of man who by past service have establish a claim to high consideration in again commend this measure to the favorable consideration of congress i would suggest that the power of place officer on the retired list be limit to one year the practical operation of the measure would thus be test and if after the lapse of year there should be occasion to renew the provision it can be reproduce with any improvement which experience may indicate the present organization of the artillery into regiment be liable to obvious objection the service of artillery be that of battery and an organization of battery into a corps of artillery would be more consistent with the nature of their duty a large part of the troop now call artillery be and have be on duty as infantry the distinction between the two arm be merely nominal this nominal artillery in our service be disproportionate to the whole force and great than the want of the country demand i therefore commend the discontinuance of a distinction which have no foundation in either the arm use or the character of the service expect to be perform in connection with the proposition for the increase of the army i have present these suggestion with regard to certain measure of reform as the complement of a system which would produce the happy result from a give expenditure and which i hope may attract the early attention and be deem worthy of the approval of congress the recommendation of the secretary of the navy have reference to more ample provision for the discipline and general improvement in the character of seaman and for the reorganization and gradual increase of the navy i deem eminently worthy of your favorable consideration the principle which have control our policy in relation to the permanent military force by sea and land be sound consistent with the theory of our system and should by no mean be disregard but limit the force to the object particularly set forth in the precede part of this message we should not overlook the present magnitude and prospective extension of our commercial marine nor fail to give due weight to the fact that besides the 2,000 mile of atlantic seaboard we have now a pacific coast stretch from mexico to the british possession in the north teem with wealth and enterprise and demand the constant presence of ship of war the augmentation of the navy have not keep pace with the duty properly and profitably assign to it in time of peace and it be inadequate for the large field of its operation not merely in the present but still more in the progressively increase exigency of the commerce of the united states i cordially approve of the propose apprentice system for our national vessel recommend by the secretary of the navy the occurrence during the last few month of marine disaster of the most tragic nature involve great loss of human life have produce intense emotion of sympathy and sorrow throughout the country it may well be doubt whether all these calamitous event be wholly attributable to the necessary and inevitable danger of the sea the merchant mariner and shipbuilder of the united states be it be true unsurpasse in far reach enterprise skill intelligence and courage by any other in the world but with the increase amount of our commercial tonnage in the aggregate and the large size and improved equipment of the ship now construct a deficiency in the supply of reliable seaman begin to be very seriously feel the inconvenience may perhaps be meet in part by due regulation for the introduction into our merchant ship of indented apprentice which while it would afford useful and eligible occupation to numerous young man would have a tendency to raise the character of seaman as a class and it be deserve of serious reflection whether it may not be desirable to revise the exist law for the maintenance of discipline at sea upon which the security of life and property on the ocean must to so great an extent depend although much attention have already be give by congress to the proper construction and arrangement of steam vessel and all passenger ship still it be believe that the resource of science and mechanical skill in this direction have not be exhaust no good reason exist for the marked distinction which appear upon our statute between the law for protect life and property at sea and those for protect they on land in most of the states severe penalty be provide to punish conductor of train engineer and other employ in the transportation of person by railway or by steamboat on river why should not the same principle be apply to act of insubordination cowardice or other misconduct on the part of master and mariner produce injury or death to passenger on the high sea beyond the jurisdiction of any of the states and where such delinquency can be reach only by the power of congress the whole subject be earnestly commend to your consideration the report of the postmaster general to which you be refer for many interesting detail in relation to this important and rapidly extend branch of the public service show that the expenditure of the year end june 30 1854 include $ 133,483 of balance due to foreign office amount to $ 8,710,907 the gross receipt during the same period amount to $ 6,955,586 exhibit an expenditure over income of $ 1,755,321 and a diminution of deficiency as compare with the last year of $ 361,756 the increase of the revenue of the department for the year end june 30 1854 over the precede year be $ 970,399 no proportionate increase however can be anticipate for the current year in consequence of the act of congress of june 23 1854 provide for increase compensation to all postmaster from these statement it be apparent that the post office department instead of defray its expense accord to the design at the time of its creation be now and under exist law must continue to be to no small extent a charge upon the general treasury the cost of mail transportation during the year end june 30 1854 exceed the cost of the precede year by $ 495,074 i again call your attention to the subject of mail transportation by ocean steamer and commend the suggestion of the postmaster general to your early attention during the last fiscal year 11,070,935 acre of the public land have be survey and 8,190,017 acre bring into market the number of acre sell be 7,035,735 and the amount receive therefor $ 9,285,533 the aggregate amount of land sell locate under military scrip and land warrant select as swamp land by states and by locate under grant for road be upward of 23,000,000 acre the increase of land sell over the previous year be about 6,000,000 acre and the sale during the first two quarter of the current year present the extraordinary result of five and a half million sell exceed by nearly 4,000,000 acre the sale of the correspond quarter of the last year the commendable policy of the government in relation to set apart public domain for those who have serve their country in time of war be illustrate by the fact that since 1790 no less than 30,000,000 acre have be apply to this object the suggestion which i submit in my annual message of last year in reference to grant of land in aid of the construction of railway be less full and explicit than the magnitude of the subject and subsequent development would seem to render proper and desirable of the soundness of the principle then assert with regard to the limitation of the power of congress i entertain no doubt but in its application it be not enough that the value of land in a particular locality may be enhance that in fact a large amount of money may probably be receive in a give time for alternate section than could have be realize for all the section without the impulse and influence of the propose improvement a prudent proprietor look beyond limited section of his domain beyond present result to the ultimate effect which a particular line of policy be likely to produce upon all his possession and interest the government which be trustee in this matter for the people of the states be bind to take the same wise and comprehensive view prior to and during the last session of congress upward of 30,000,000 acre of land be withdraw from public sale with a view to application for grant of this character pende before congress a careful review of the whole subject lead i to direct that all such order be abrogate and the land restore to market and instruction be immediately give to that effect the application at the last session contemplate the construction of more than 5,000 mile of road and grant to the amount of nearly 20,000,000 acre of the public domain even admit the right on the part of congress to be unquestionable be it quite clear that the propose grant would be productive of good and not evil the different project be confine for the present to eleven states of this union and one territory the reason assign for the grant show that it be propose to put the work speedily in process of construction when we reflect that since the commencement of the construction of railway in the united states stimulate as they have be by the large dividend realize from the early work over the great thoroughfare and between the most important point of commerce and population encourage by state legislation and press forward by the amazing energy of private enterprise only 17,000 mile have be complete in all the states in a quarter of a century when we see the crippled condition of many work commence and prosecute upon what be deem to be sound principle and safe calculation when we contemplate the enormous absorption of capital withdraw from the ordinary channel of business the extravagant rate of interest at this moment pay to continue operation the bankruptcy not merely in money but in character and the inevitable effect upon finance generally can it be doubt that the tendency be to run to excess in this matter be it wise to augment this excess by encourage hope of sudden wealth expect to flow from magnificent scheme dependent upon the action of congress do the spirit which have produce such result need to be stimulate or check be it not the well rule to leave all these work to private enterprise regulate and when expedient aid by the cooperation of states if construct by private capital the stimulant and the check go together and furnish a salutary restraint against speculative scheme and extravagance but it be manifest that with the most effective guard there be danger of go too fast and too far we may well pause before a proposition contemplate a simultaneous movement for the construction of railroad which in extent will equal exclusive of the great pacific road and all its branch nearly one third of the entire length of such work now complete in the united states and which can not cost with equipment less than $ 150,000,000 the danger likely to result from combination of interest of this character can hardly be overestimate but independently of these consideration where be the accurate knowledge the comprehensive intelligence which shall discriminate between the relative claim of these twenty eight propose road in eleven states and one territory where will you begin and where end if to enable these company to execute their propose work it be necessary that the aid of the general government be primarily give the policy will present a problem so comprehensive in its bearing and so important to our political and social well being as to claim in anticipation the severe analysis entertain these view i recur with satisfaction to the experience and action of the last session of congress as furnish assurance that the subject will not fail to elicit a careful reexamination and rigid scrutiny it be my intention to present on this occasion some suggestion regard internal improvement by the general government which want of time at the close of the last session prevent my submitting on the return to the house of representatives with objection of the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the repair preservation and completion of certain public work heretofore commence under the authority of law but the space in this communication already occupy with other matter of immediate public exigency constrain i to reserve that subject for a special message which will be transmit to the two houses of congress at an early day the judicial establishment of the united states require modification and certain reform in the manner of conduct the legal business of the government be also much need but as i have address you upon both of these subject at length before i have only to call your attention to the suggestion then make my former recommendation in relation to suitable provision for various object of deep interest to the inhabitant of the district of columbia be renew many of these object partake largely of a national character and be important independently of their relation to the prosperity of the only considerable organized community in the union entirely unrepresented in congress i have thus present suggestion on such subject as appear to i to be of particular interest or importance and therefore most worthy of consideration during the short remain period allot to the labor of the present congress our forefather of the thirteen united colony in acquire their independence and in round this republic of the united states of america have devolve upon we their descendant the great and the most noble trust ever commit to the hand of man impose upon all and especially such as the public will may have invest for the time be with political function the most sacred obligation we have to maintain inviolate the great doctrine of the inherent right of popular self government to reconcile the large liberty of the individual citizen with complete security of the public order to render cheerful obedience to the law of the land to unite in enforce their execution and to frown indignantly on all combination to resist they to harmonize a sincere and ardent devotion to the institution of religion faith with the most universal religious toleration to preserve the right of all by cause each to respect those of the other to carry forward every social improvement to the uttermost limit of human perfectibility by the free action of mind upon mind not by the obtrusive intervention of misapplied force to uphold the integrity and guard the limitation of our organic law to preserve sacred from all touch of usurpation as the very palladium of our political salvation the reserve right and power of the several states and of the people to cherish with loyal fealty and devoted affection this union as the only sure foundation on which the hope of civil liberty rest to administer government with vigilant integrity and rigid economy to cultivate peace and friendship with foreign nation and to demand and exact equal justice from all but to do wrong to none to eschew intermeddle with the national policy and the domestic repose of other government and to repel it from our own never to shrink from war when the right and the honor of the country call we to arm but to cultivate in preference the art of peace seek enlargement of the right of neutrality and elevate and liberalize the intercourse of nation and by such just and honorable mean and such only whilst exalt the condition of the republic to assure to it the legitimate influence and the benign authority of a great example amongst all the power of christendom under the solemnity of these conviction the blessing of almighty god be earnestly invoke to attend upon your deliberation and upon all the counsel and act of the government to the end that with common zeal and common effort we may in humble submission to the divine will cooperate for the promotion of the supreme good of these united states
to the senate and house of representatives
 in return to the house of representatives in which it originate a bill entitle an act make appropriation for the repair preservation and completion of certain public work heretofore commence under the authority of law it become necessary for i owe to the late day at which the bill be pass to state my objection to it very briefly announce at the same time a purpose to resume the subject for more deliberate discussion at the present session of congress for while by no mean insensible of the arduousness of the task thus undertake by i i conceive that the two houses be entitle to an exposition of the consideration which have induce dissent on my part from their conclusion in this instance
 the great constitutional question of the power of the general government in relation to internal improvement have be the subject of earnest difference of opinion at every period of the history of the united states annual and special message of successive president have be occupy with it sometimes in remark on the general topic and frequently in objection to particular bill the conflict sentiment of eminent statesman express in congress or in convention call expressly to devise if possible some plan calculate to relieve the subject of the embarrassment with which it be environ while they have direct public attention strongly to the magnitude of the interest involve have yet leave unsettle the limit not merely of expediency but of constitutional power in relation to work of this class by the general government
 what be intend by the phrase internal improvement what do it embrace and what exclude no such language be find in the constitution not only be it not an expression of ascertainable constitutional power but it have no sufficient exactness of meaning to be of any value as the basis of a safe conclusion either of constitutional law or of practical statesmanship
 president john quincy adams in claim on one occasion after his retirement from office the authorship of the idea of introduce into the administration of the affair of the general government a permanent and regular system of internal improvement speak of it as a system by which the whole union would have be checker over with railroad and canal afford high wage and constant employment to hundred of thousand of laborer and he place it in express contrast with the construction of such work by the legislation of the states and by private enterprise
 it be quite obvious that if there be any constitutional power which authorize the construction of railroad and canal by congress the same power must comprehend turnpike and ordinary carriage road nay it must extend to the construction of bridge to the draining of marsh to the erection of levee to the construction of canal of irrigation in a word to all the possible mean of the material improvement of the earth by develop its natural resource anywhere and everywhere even within the proper jurisdiction of the several states but if there be any constitutional power thus comprehensive in its nature must not the same power embrace within its scope other kind of improvement of equal utility in themselves and equally important to the welfare of the whole country president jefferson while intimate the expediency of so amend the constitution as to comprise object of physical progress and well being do not fail to perceive that other object of public improvement include public education by name belong to the same class of power in fact not only public instruction but hospital establishment of science and art library and indeed everything appertain to the internal welfare of the country be just as much object of internal improvement or in other word of internal utility as canal and railway
 the admission of the power in either of its sense imply its existence in the other and since if it exist at all it involve dangerous augmentation of the political function and of the patronage of the federal government we ought to see clearly by what clause or clause of the constitution it be confer
 i have have occasion more than once to express and deem it proper now to repeat that it be in my judgment to be take for grant as a fundamental proposition not require elucidation that the federal government be the creature of the individual states and of the people of the states severally that the sovereign power be in they alone that all the power of the federal government be derivative one the enumeration and limitation of which be contain in the instrument which organize it and by express term the power not delegate to the united states by the constitution nor prohibit by it to the states be reserve to the states respectively or to the people
 start from this foundation of our constitutional faith and proceed to inquire in what part of the constitution the power of make appropriation for internal improvement be find it be necessary to reject all idea of there be any grant of power in the preamble when that instrument say we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity it only declare the inducement and the anticipated result of the thing ordain and establish by it to assume that anything more can be design by the language of the preamble would be to convert all the body of the constitution with its carefully weigh enumeration and limitation into mere surplusage the same may be say of the phrase in the grant of the power to congress to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states or to construe the word more exactly they be not significant of grant or concession but of restriction of the specific grant have the effect of say that in lay and collect taxis for each of the precise object of power grant to the general government congress must exercise any such definite and undoubted power in strict subordination to the purpose of the common defense and general welfare of all the states
 there be no specific grant in the constitution of a power to sanction appropriation for internal improvement and no general provision broad enough to cover any such indefinite object it become necessary to look for particular power to which one or another of the thing include in the phrase internal improvement may be refer
 in the discussion of this question by the advocate of the organization of a general system of internal improvement under the auspex of the federal government reliance be have for the justification of the measure on several of the power expressly grant to congress such as to establish post office and post road to declare war to provide and maintain a navy to raise and support army to regulate commerce and to dispose of the territory and other public property of the united states
 as to the last of these source of power that of dispose of the territory and other public property of the united states it may be concede that it authorize congress in the management of the public property to make improvement essential to the successful execution of the trust but this must be the primary object of any such improvement and it would be an abuse of the trust to sacrifice the interest of the property to incidental purpose
 as to the other assume source of a general power over internal improvement they be specific power of which this be suppose to be the incident if the framer of the constitution wise and thoughtful man as they be intend to confer on congress the power over a subject so wide as the whole field of internal improvement it be remarkable that they do not use language clearly to express it or in other word that they do not give it as a distinct and substantive power instead of make it the imply incident of some other one for such be the magnitude of the suppose incidental power and its capacity of expansion that any system establish under it would exceed each of the other in the amount of expenditure and number of the person employ which would thus be throw upon the general government
 this position may be illustrate by take as a single example one of the many thing comprehend clearly in the idea of a general system of internal improvement namely road let it be suppose that the power to construct road over the whole union accord to the suggestion of president j. q. adams in 1807 whilst a member of the senate of the united states have be concede congress would have begin in pursuance of the state of knowledge at the time by construct turnpike then as knowledge advance it would have construct canal and at the present time it would have be embark in an almost limitless scheme of railroad
 now there be in the united states the result of state or private enterprise upward of 17,000 mile of railroad and 5,000 mile of canal in all 22,000 mile the total cost of which may be estimate at little short of $ 600,000,000 and if the same work have be construct by the federal government suppose the thing to have be practicable the cost would have probably be not less than $ 900,000,000 the number of person employ in superintending managing and keep up these canal and railroad may be state at 126,000 or thereabout to which be to be add 70,000 or 80,000 employ on the railroad in construction make a total of at least 200,000 person represent in family nearly 1,000,000 soul employ on or maintain by this one class of public work in the united states
 in view of all this it be not easy to estimate the disastrous consequence which must have result from such extended local improvement be undertake by the general government state legislation upon this subject would have be suspend and private enterprise paralyze while application for appropriation would have pervert the legislation of congress exhaust the national treasury and leave the people burden with a heavy public debt beyond the capacity of generation to discharge
 be it conceivable that the framer of the constitution intend that authority draw after it such immense consequence should be infer by implication as the incident of enumerate power i can not think this and the impossibility of suppose it would be still more glaring if similar calculation be carry out in regard to the numerous object of material moral and political usefulness of which the idea of internal improvement admit it may be safely infer that if the framer of the constitution have intend to confer the power to make appropriation for the object indicate it would have be enumerate among the grant expressly make to congress when therefore any one of the power actually enumerate be adduce or refer to as the ground of an assumption to warrant the incidental or imply power of internal improvement that hypothesis must be reject or at least can be no far admit than as the particular act of internal improvement may happen to be necessary to the exercise of the grant power thus when the object of a give road the clearing of a particular channel or the construction of a particular harbor of refuge be manifestly require by the exigency of the naval or military service of the country then it seem to i undeniable that it may be constitutionally comprehend in the power to declare war to provide and maintain a navy and to raise and support army at the same time it would be a misuse of these power and a violation of the constitution to undertake to build upon they a great system of internal improvement and similar reasoning apply to the assumption of any such power as be involve in that to establish post road and to regulate commerce if the particular improvement whether by land or sea be necessary to the execution of the enumerate power then but not otherwise it fall within the jurisdiction of congress to this extent only can the power be claim as the incident of any express grant to the federal government
 but there be one clause of the constitution in which it have be suggest that express authority to construct work of internal improvement have be confer on congress namely that which empower it to exercise exclusive legislation in all case whatsoever over such district not exceed 10 mile square as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states and to exercise like authority over all place purchase by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of fort magazine arsenal dockyard and other needful building but any such supposition will be see to be groundless when this provision be carefully examine and compare with other part of the constitution
 it be undoubtedly true that like authority refer back to exclusive legislation in all case whatsoever as apply to the district of columbia and there be in the district no division of power as between the general and the state government
 in those place which the united states have purchase or retain within any of the states site for dockyard or fort for example legal process of the give state be still permit to run for some purpose and therefore the jurisdiction of the united states be not absolutely perfect but let we assume for the argument&#39;s sake that the jurisdiction of the united states in a tract of land cede to it for the purpose of a dockyard or fort by virginia or maryland be as complete as in that cede by they for the seat of government and then proceed to analyze this clause of the constitution
 it provide that congress shall have certain legislative authority over all place purchase by the united states for certain purpose it imply that congress have otherwise the power to purchase but where do congress get the power to purchase manifestly it must be from some other clause of the constitution for it be not confer by this one now as it be a fundamental principle that the constitution be one of limited power the authority to purchase must be confer in one of the enumeration of legislative power so that the power to purchase be itself not an unlimited one but be limit by the object in regard to which legislative authority be directly confer
 the other expression of the clause in question confirm this conclusion since the jurisdiction be give as to place purchase for certain enumerate object or purpose of these the first great division fort magazine arsenal and dockyard be obviously referable to recognize head of specific constitutional power there remain only the phrase and other needful building wherefore needful needful for any possible purpose within the whole range of the business of society and of government clearly not but only such building as be needful to the united states in the exercise of any of the power confer on congress
 thus the united states need in the exercise of admit power not only fort magazine arsenal and dockyard but also court house prison custom house and post office within the respective states place for the erection of such building the general government may constitutionally purchase and having purchase they the jurisdiction over they belong to the united states so if the general government have the power to build a light house or a beacon it may purchase a place for that object and having purchase it then this clause of the constitution give jurisdiction over it still the power to purchase for the purpose of erect a light house or beacon must depend on the existence of the power to erect and if that power exist it must be seek after in some other clause of the constitution
 from whatever point of view therefore the subject be regard whether as a question of express or imply power the conclusion be the same that congress have no constitutional authority to carry on a system of internal improvement and in this conviction the system have be steadily oppose by the sound expositor of the function of the government
 it be not to be suppose that in no conceivable case shall there be doubt as to whether a give object be or not a necessary incident of the military naval or any other power as man be imperfect so be his method of utter his thought human language save in expression for the exact science must always fail to preclude all possibility of controversy hence it be that in one branch of the subject the question of the power of congress to make appropriation in aid of navigation there be less of positive conviction than in regard to the general subject and it therefore seem proper in this respect to revert to the history of the practice of the government
 among the very early act of the first session of congress be that for the establishment and support of light house approve by president washington on the 7th of august 1789 which contain the follow provision
 that all expense which shall accrue from and after the 15th day of august 1789 in the necessary support maintenance and repair of all light house beacon buoy and public pier erect place or sink before the passing of this act at the entrance of or within any bay inlet harbor or port of the united states for render the navigation thereof easy and safe shall be defray out of the treasury of the united states provide nevertheless that none of the say expense shall continue to be so defray after the expiration of one year from the day aforesaid unless such light house beacon buoy and public pier shall in the meantime be cede to and vest in the united states by the state or states respectively in which the same may be together with the land and tenement thereunto belong and together with the jurisdiction of the same
 act contain appropriation for this class of public work be pass in 1791 1792 1793 and so on from year to year down to the present time and the tenor of these act when examine with reference to other part of the subject be worthy of special consideration
 it be a remarkable fact that for a period of more than thirty year after the adoption of the constitution all appropriation of this class be confine with scarcely an apparent exception to the construction of light house beacon buoy and public pier and the stakage of channel to render navigation safe and easy it be true but only by indicate to the navigator obstacle in his way not by remove those obstacle nor in any other respect change artificially the preexist natural condition of the earth and sea it be obvious however that work of art for the removal of natural impediment to navigation or to prevent their formation or for supply harbor where these do not exist be also mean of render navigation safe and easy and may in supposable case be the most efficient as well as the most economical of such mean nevertheless it be not until the year 1824 that in an act to improve the navigation of the river ohio and mississippi and in another act make appropriation for deepen the channel lead into the harbor of presque isle on lake erie and for repair plymouth beach in massachusetts bay we have any example of an appropriation for the improvement of harbor in the nature of those provide for in the bill return by i to the house of representatives
 it appear not probable that the abstinence of congress in this respect be attributable altogether to consideration of economy or to any failure to perceive that the removal of an obstacle to navigation might be not less useful than the indication of it for avoidance and it may be well assume that the course of legislation so long pursue be induce in whole or in part by solicitous consideration in regard to the constitutional power over such matter vest in congress
 one other peculiarity in this course of legislation be not less remarkable it be that when the general government first take charge of lighthouse and beacon it require the work themselves and the land on which they be situate to be cede to the united states and although for a time this precaution be neglect in the case of new work in the sequel it be provide by general law that no light house should be construct on any site previous to the jurisdiction over the same being cede to the united states
 constitutional authority for the construction and support of many of the public work of this nature it be certain may be find in the power of congress to maintain a navy and provide for the general defense but their number and in many instance their location preclude the idea of their be fully justify as necessary and proper incident of that power and they do not seem susceptible of be refer to any other of the specific power vest in congress by the constitution unless it be that to raise revenue in so far as this relate to navigation the practice under all my predecessor in office the express admission of some of they and absence of denial by any sufficiently manifest their belief that the power to erect light house beacon and pier be possess by the general government in the act of congress as we have already see the inducement and object of the appropriation be expressly declare those appropriation be for light house beacon buoy and public pier erect or place within any bay inlet harbor or port of the united states for render the navigation thereof easy and safe
 if it be contend that this review of the history of appropriation of this class lead to the inference that beyond the purpose of national defense and maintenance of a navy there be authority in the constitution to construct certain work in aid of navigation it be at the same time to be remember that the conclusion thus deduce from contemporaneous construction and long continue acquiescence be themselves directly suggestive of limitation of constitutionality as well as expediency regard the nature and the description of those aid to navigation which congress may provide as incident to the revenue power for at this point controversy begin not so much as to the principle as to its application
 in accordance with long establish legislative usage congress may construct light house and beacon and provide as it do other mean to prevent shipwreck on the coast of the united states but the general government can not go beyond this and make improvement of river and harbor of the nature and to the degree of all the provision of the bill of the last session of congress
 to justify such extend power it have be urge that if it be constitutional to appropriate money for the purpose of point out by the construction of light house or beacon where an obstacle to navigation exist it be equally so to remove such obstacle or to avoid it by the creation of an artificial channel that if the object be lawful then the mean adopt solely with reference to the end must be lawful and that therefore it be not material constitutionally speak whether a give obstruction to navigation be indicate for avoidance or be actually avoid by excavate a new channel that if it be a legitimate object of expenditure to preserve a ship from wreck by mean of a beacon or of revenue cutter it must be not less so to provide place of safety by the improvement of harbor or where none exist by their artificial construction and thence the argument naturally pass to the propriety of improve river for the benefit of internal navigation because all these object be of more or less importance to the commercial as well as the naval interest of the united states
 the answer to all this be that the question of open speedy and easy communication to and through all part of the country be substantially the same whether do by land or water that the use of road and canal in facilitate commercial intercourse and unite by community of interest the most remote quarter of the country by land communication be the same in their nature as the use of navigable water and that therefore the question of the facility and aid to be provide to navigation by whatsoever mean be but a subdivision of the great question of the constitutionality and expediency of internal improvement by the general government in confirmation of this it be to be remark that one of the most important act of appropriation of this class that of the year 1833 under the administration of president jackson by include together and provide for in one bill as well river and harbor work as road work impliedly recognize the fact that they be alike branch of the same great subject of internal improvement
 as the population territory and wealth of the country increase and settlement extend into remote region the necessity for additional mean of communication impress itself upon all mind with a force which have not be experience at the date of the formation of the constitution and more and more embarrassed those who be most anxious to abstain scrupulously from any exercise of doubtful power hence the recognition in the message of presidents jefferson madison and monroe of the eminent desirableness of such work with admission that some of they could lawfully and should be conduct by the general government but with obvious uncertainty of opinion as to the line between such as be constitutional and such as be not such as ought to receive appropriation from congress and such as ought to be consign to private enterprise or the legislation of the several states
 this uncertainty have not be remove by the practical working of our institution in later time for although the acquisition of additional territory and the application of steam to the propulsion of vessel have greatly magnify the importance of internal commerce this fact have at the same time complicate the question of the power of the general government over the present subject
 in fine a careful review of the opinion of all my predecessor and of the legislative history of the country do not indicate any fix rule by which to decide what of the infinite variety of possible river and harbor improvement be within the scope of the power delegate by the constitution and the question still remain unsettled president jackson concede the constitutionality under suitable circumstance of the improvement of river and harbor through the agency of congress and president polk admit the propriety of the establishment and support by appropriation from the treasury of light house beacon buoy and other improvement within the bay inlet and harbor of the ocean and lake coast immediately connect with foreign commerce
 but if the distinction thus make rest upon the difference between foreign and domestic commerce it can not be restrict thereby to the bay inlet and harbor of the ocean and lake because foreign commerce have already penetrate thousand of mile into the interior of the continent by mean of our great river and will continue so to extend itself with the progress of settlement until it reach the limit of navigability
 at the time of the adoption of the constitution the vast valley of the mississippi now teem with population and supply almost boundless resource be literally an unexplored wilderness our advancement have outstrip even the most sanguine anticipation of the father of the republic and it illustrate the fact that no rule be admissible which undertake to discriminate so far as regard river and harbor improvement between the atlantic or pacific coast and the great lake and river of the interior region of north america indeed it be quite erroneous to suppose that any such discrimination have ever exist in the practice of the government to the contrary of which be the significant fact before state that when after abstain from all such appropriation for more than thirty year congress enter upon the policy of improve the navigation of river and harbor it commence with the river mississippi and ohio
 the congress of the union adopt in this respect one of the idea of that of the confederation have take heed to declare from time to time as occasion require either in act for dispose of the public land in the territories or in act for admit new states that all navigable river within the same shall be deem to be and remain public highway
 out of this condition of thing arise a question which at successive period of our public annal have occupy the attention of the good mind in the union this question be what water be public navigable water so as not to be of state character and jurisdiction but of federal jurisdiction and character in the intent of the constitution and of congress a proximate but imperfect answer to this important question be furnish by the act of congress and the decision of the supreme court of the united states define the constitutional limit of the maritime jurisdiction of the general government that jurisdiction be entirely independent of the revenue power it be not derive from that nor be it measure thereby
 in that act of congress which in the first year of the government organize our judicial system and which whether we look to the subject the comprehensive wisdom with which it be treat or the deference with which its provision have come to be regard be only second to the constitution itself there be a section in which the statesman who frame the constitution have place on record their construction of it in this matte it enact that the district court of the united states shall have exclusive cognizance of all civil case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction include all seizure under the law of impost navigation or trade of the united states when the seizure be make on water which be navigable from the sea by vessel of 10 or more ton burden within their respective district as well as upon the high sea in this contemporaneous exposition of the constitution there be no trace or suggestion that nationality of jurisdiction be limit to the sea or even to tide water the law be mark by a sagacious apprehension of the fact that the great lakes and the mississippi be navigable water of the united states even then before the acquisition of louisiana have make wholly our own the territorial greatness of the west it repudiate unequivocally the rule of the common law accord to which the question of whether a water be public navigable water or not depend on whether it be salt or not and therefore in a river confine that quality to tide water a rule result from the geographical condition of england and applicable to an island with small and narrow stream the only navigable portion of which for ship be in immediate contact with the ocean but wholly inapplicable to the great inland fresh water sea of america and its mighty river with secondary branch exceed in magnitude the large river of great britain
 at a late period it be true that in disregard of the more comprehensive definition of navigability afford by that act of congress it be for a time hold by many that the rule establish for england be to be receive in the united states the effect of which be to exclude from the jurisdiction of the general government not only the water of the mississippi but also those of the great lakes to this construction it be with truth object that in so far as concern the lake they be in fact sea although of fresh water that they be the natural marine communication between a series of populous states and between they and the possession of a foreign nation that they be actually navigate by ship of commerce of the large capacity that they have once be and might again be the scene of foreign war and that therefore it be do violence to all reason to undertake by mean of an arbitrary doctrine of technical foreign law to exclude such water from the jurisdiction of the general government in regard to the river mississippi it be object that to draw a line across that river at the point of ebb and flood of tide and say that the part below be public navigable water and the part above not while in the latter the water be at least equally deep and navigable and its commerce as rich as in the former with numerous port of foreign entry and delivery be to sanction a distinction artificial and unjust because regardless of the real fact of navigability
 we may conceive that some such consideration lead to the enactment in the year 1845 of an act in addition to that of 1789 declare that--
 the district court of the united states shall have possess and exercise the same jurisdiction in matter of contract and tort arise in upon or concern steamboat and other vessel of 20 ton burden and upward enrol and license for the coast trade and at the time employ in business of commerce and navigation between port and place in different states and territories upon the lake and navigable water connect say lake as be now possess and exercise by the say court in case of the like steamboat and other vessel employ in navigation and commerce upon the high sea or tide water within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the united states
 it be observable that the act of 1789 apply the jurisdiction of the united states to all water which be navigable from the sea for vessel of 10 ton burden and that of 1845 extend the jurisdiction to enrol vessel of 20 ton burden on the lake and navigable water connect say lake though not water navigable from the sea provide such vessel be employ between place in different states and territories
 thus it appear that these provision of law in effect prescribe condition by which to determine whether any water be public navigable water subject to the authority of the federal government the condition include all water whether salt or fresh and whether of sea lake or river provide they be capable of navigation by vessel of a certain tonnage and for commerce either between the united states and foreign country or between any two or more of the states or territories of the union this exclude water wholly within any particular state and not use as the mean of commercial communication with any other state and subject to be improve or obstruct at will by the state within which it may happen to be
 the constitutionality of these provision of statute have be call in question their constitutionality have be maintain however by repeat decision of the supreme court of the united states and they be therefore the law of the land by the concurrent act of the legislative the executive and the judicial department of the government regard as afford a criterion of what be navigable water and as such subject to the maritime jurisdiction of the supreme court and of congress these act be objectionable in this that the rule of navigability be an arbitrary one that congress may repeal the present rule and adopt a new one and that thus a legislative definition will be able to restrict or enlarge the limit of constitutional power yet this variableness of standard seem inherent in the nature of thing at any rate neither the first congress compose of the statesman of the era when the constitution be adopt nor any subsequent congress have afford we the mean of attain great precision of construction as to this part of the constitution
 this reflection may serve to relieve from undeserved reproach an idea of one of the great man of the republic president jackson he seek amid all the difficulty of the subject for some practical rule of action in regard to appropriation for the improvement of river and harbor prescribe for his own official conduct the rule of confine such appropriation to place below the port of entry or delivery establish by law he see clearly as the author of the above mention act of 1789 and 1845 do that there be no inflexible natural line of discrimination between what be national and what local by mean of which to determine absolutely and unerringly at what point on a river the jurisdiction of the united states shall end he perceive and of course admit that the constitution while confer on the general government some power of action to render navigation safe and easy have of necessity leave to congress much of discretion in this matter he confide in the patriotism of congress to exercise that discretion wisely not permit himself to suppose it possible that a port of entry or delivery would ever be establish by law for the express and only purpose of evade the constitution
 it remain therefore to consider the question of the measure of discretion in the exercise by congress of the power to provide for the improvement of river and harbor and also that of the legitimate responsibility of the executive in the same relation
 in matter of legislation of the most unquestionable constitutionality it be always material to consider what amount of public money shall be appropriate for any particular object the same consideration apply with augmented force to a class of appropriation which be in their nature peculiarly prone to run to excess and which be make in the exercise of incidental power have intrinsic tendency to overstep the bound of constitutionality
 if an appropriation for improve the navigability of a river or deepen or protect a harbor have reference to military or naval purpose then its rightfulness whether in amount or in the object to which it be apply depend manifestly on the military or naval exigency and the subject matter afford its own measure of legislative discretion but if the appropriation for such an object have no distinct relation to the military or naval want of the country and be wholly or even mainly intend to promote the revenue from commerce then the very vagueness of the propose purpose of the expenditure constitute a perpetual admonition of reserve and caution through disregard of this it be undeniable that in many case appropriation of this nature have be make unwisely without accomplish beneficial result commensurate with the cost and sometimes for evil rather than good independently of their dubious relation to the constitution
 among the radical change of the course of legislation in these matter which in my judgment the public interest demand one be a return to the primitive idea of congress which require in this class of public work as in all other a conveyance of the soil and a cession of the jurisdiction to the united states i think this condition ought never to have be waive in the case of any harbor improvement of a permanent nature as where pier jetty sea wall and other like work be to be construct and maintain it would powerfully tend to counteract endeavor to obtain appropriation of a local character and chiefly calculate to promote individual interest the want of such a provision be the occasion of abuse in regard to exist work expose they to private encroachment without sufficient mean of redress by law indeed the absence in such case of a cession of jurisdiction have constitute one of the constitutional objection to appropriation of this class it be not easy to perceive any sufficient reason for require it in the case of arsenal or fort which do not equally apply to all other public work if to be construct and maintain by congress in the exercise of a constitutional power of appropriation they should be bring within the jurisdiction of the united states
 there be another measure of precaution in regard to such appropriation which seem to i to be worthy of the consideration of congress it be to make appropriation for every work in a separate bill so that each one shall stand on its own independent merit and if it pass shall do so under circumstance of legislative scrutiny entitle it to be regard as of general interest and a proper subject of charge on the treasury of the union
 during that period of time in which the country have not come to look to congress for appropriation of this nature several of the states whose production or geographical position invite foreign commerce have enter upon plan for the improvement of their harbor by themselves and through mean of support draw directly from that commerce in virtue of an express constitutional power need for its exercise only the permission of congress harbor improvement thus construct and maintain the expenditure upon they be defray by the very facility they afford be a voluntary charge on those only who see fit to avail themselves of such facility and can be justly complain of by none on the other hand so long as these improvement be carry on by appropriation from the treasury the benefit will continue to inure to those alone who enjoy the facility afford while the expenditure will be a burden upon the whole country and the discrimination a double injury to place equally require improvement but not equally favor by appropriation
 these consideration add to the embarrassment of the whole question amply suffice to suggest the policy of confine appropriation by the general government to work necessary to the execution of its undoubted power and of leave all other to individual enterprise or to the separate states to be provide for out of their own resource or by recurrence to the provision of the constitution which authorize the states to lay duty of tonnage with the consent of congress

fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives the constitution of the united states provide that congress shall assemble annually on the first monday of december and it have be usual for the president to make no communication of a public character to the senate and house of representatives until advise of their readiness to receive it i have defer to this usage until the close of the first month of the session but my conviction of duty will not permit i long to postpone the discharge of the obligation enjoin by the constitution upon the president to give to the congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient it be matter of congratulation that the republic be tranquilly advance in a career of prosperity and peace whilst relation of amity continue to exist between the united states and all foreign power with some of they grave question be depend which may require the consideration of congress of such question the most important be that which have arise out of the negotiation with great britain in reference to central america by the convention conclude between the two government on the 19th of april 1850 both party covenant that neither will ever occupy or fortify or colonize or assume or exercise any dominion over nicaragua costa rica the mosquito coast or any part of central america "it be the undoubted understanding of the united states in make this treaty that all the present states of the former republic of central america and the entire territory of each would thenceforth enjoy complete independence and that both contract party engage equally and to the same extent for the present and for the future that if either then have any claim of right in central america such claim and all occupation or authority under it be unreservedly relinquish by the stipulation of the convention and that no dominion be thereafter to be exercise or assume in any part of central america by great britain or the united states this government consent to restriction in regard to a region of country wherein we have specific and peculiar interest only upon the conviction that the like restriction be in the same sense obligatory on great britain but for this understanding of the force and effect of the convention it would never have be conclude by we so clear be this understanding on the part of the united states that in correspondence contemporaneous with the ratification of the convention it be distinctly express that the mutual covenant of nonoccupation be not intend to apply to the british establishment at the balize this qualification be to be ascribe to the fact that in virtue of successive treaty with previous sovereign of the country great britain have obtain a concession of the right to cut mahogany or dyewood at the balize but with positive exclusion of all domain or sovereignty and thus it confirm the natural construction and understand import of the treaty as to all the rest of the region to which the stipulation apply it however become apparent at an early day after enter upon the discharge of my present function that great britain still continue in the exercise or assertion of large authority in all that part of central america commonly call the mosquito coast and cover the entire length of the state of nicaragua and a part of costa rica that she regard the balize as her absolute domain and be gradually extend its limit at the expense of the state of honduras and that she have formally colonize a considerable insular group know as the bay islands and belong of right to that state all these act or pretension of great britain be contrary to the right of the states of central america and to the manifest tenor of her stipulation with the united states as understand by this government have be make the subject of negotiation through the american minister in london i transmit herewith the instruction to he on the subject and the correspondence between he and the british secretary for foreign affair by which you will perceive that the two government differ widely and irreconcilably as to the construction of the convention and its effect on their respective relation to central america great britain so construe the convention as to maintain unchanged all her previous pretension over the mosquito coast and in different part of central america these pretension as to the mosquito coast be found on the assumption of political relation between great britain and the remnant of a tribe of indians on that coast enter into at a time when the whole country be a colonial possession of spain it can not be successfully controvert that by the public law of europe and america no possible act of such indians or their predecessor could confer on great britain any political right great britain do not allege the assent of spain as the origin of her claim on the mosquito coast she have on the contrary by repeat and successive treaty renounce and relinquish all pretension of her own and recognize the full and sovereign right of spain in the most unequivocal term yet these pretension so without solid foundation in the beginning and thus repeatedly abjure be at a recent period revive by great britain against the central american states the legitimate successor to all the ancient jurisdiction of spain in that region they be first apply only to a define part of the coast of nicaragua afterwards to the whole of its atlantic coast and lastly to a part of the coast of costa rica and they be now reassert to this extent notwithstanding engagement to the united states on the eastern coast of nicaragua and costa rica the interference of great britain though exert at one time in the form of military occupation of the port of san juan del norte then in the peaceful possession of the appropriate authority of the central american states be now present by she as the rightful exercise of a protectorship over the mosqttito tribe of indians but the establishment at the balize now reach far beyond its treaty limit into the state of honduras and that of the bay islands appertaining of right to the same state be as distinctly colonial government as those of jamaica or canada and therefore contrary to the very letter as well as the spirit of the convention with the united states as it be at the time of ratification and now be understand by this government the interpretation which the british government thus in assertion and act persist in ascribe to the convention entirely change its character while it hold we to all our obligation it in a great measure release great britain from those which constitute the consideration of this government for enter into the convention it be impossible in my judgment for the united states to acquiesce in such a construction of the respective relation of the two government to central america to a renew call by this government upon great britain to abide by and carry into effect the stipulation of the convention accord to its obvious import by withdraw from the possession or colonization of portion of the central american states of honduras nicaragua and costa rica the british government have at length reply affirm that the operation of the treaty be prospective only and do not require great britain to abandon or contract any possession hold by she in central america at the date of its conclusion this reply substitute a partial issue in the place of the general one present by the united states the british government pass over the question of the right of great britain real or suppose in central america and assume that she have such right at the date of the treaty and that those right comprehend the protectorship of the mosquito indians the extended jurisdiction and limit of the balize and the colony of the bay islands and thereupon proceed by implication to infer that if the stipulation of the treaty be merely future in effect great britain may still continue to hold the contest portion of central america the united states can not admit either the inference or the premise we steadily deny that at the date of the treaty great britain have any possession there other than the limited and peculiar establishment at the balize and maintain that if she have any they be surrender by the convention this government recognize the obligation of the treaty have of course desire to see it execute in good faith by both party and in the discussion therefore have not look to right which we might assert independently of the treaty in consideration of our geographical position and of other circumstance which create for us relation to the central american states different from those of any government of europe the british government in its last communication although well know the view of the united states still declare that it see no reason why a conciliatory spirit may not enable the two government to overcome all obstacle to a satisfactory adjustment of the subject assured of the correctness of the construction of the treaty constantly adhere to by this government and resolve to insist on the right of the united states yet actuate also by the same desire which be avow by the british government to remove all cause of serious misunderstanding between two nation associate by so many tie of interest and kindre it have appear to i proper not to consider an amicable solution of the controversy hopeless there be however reason to apprehend that with great britain in the actual occupation of the dispute territory and the treaty therefore practically null so far as regard our right this international difficulty can not long remain undetermined without involve in serious danger the friendly relation which it be the interest as well as the duty of both country to cherish and preserve it will afford i sincere gratification if future effort shall result in the success anticipate heretofore with more confidence than the aspect of the case permit i now to entertain one other subject of discussion between the united states and great britain have grow out of the attempt which the exigency of the war in which she be engage with russia induce she to make to draw recruit from the united states it be the traditional and settle policy of the united states to maintain impartial neutrality during the war which from time to time occur among the great power of the world perform all the duty of neutrality toward the respective belligerent state we may reasonably expect they not to interfere with our lawful enjoyment of its benefit notwithstanding the existence of such hostility our citizen retain the individual right to continue all their accustomed pursuit by land or by sea at home or abroad subject only to such restriction in this relation as the law of war the usage of nation or special treaty may impose and it be our sovereign right that our territory and jurisdiction shall not be invade by either of the belligerent party for the transit of their army the operation of their fleet the levy of troop for their service the fitting out of cruiser by or against either or any other act or incident of war and these undeniable right of neutrality individual and national the united states will under no circumstance surrender in pursuance of this policy the law of the united states do not forbid their citizen to sell to either of the belligerent power article contraband of war or take munition of war or soldier on board their private ship for transportation and although in so do the individual citizen expose his property or person to some of the hazard of war his act do not involve any breach of national neutrality nor of themselves implicate the government thus during the progress of the present war in europe our citizen have without national responsibility therefor sell gunpowder and arm to all buyer regardless of the destination of those article our merchantman have be and still continue to be largely employ by great britain and by france in transport troop provision and munition of war to the principal seat of military operation and in bring home their sick and wounded soldier but such use of our mercantile marine be not interdict either by the international or by our municipal law and therefore do not compromise our neutral relation with russia but our municipal law in accordance with the law of nation peremptorily forbid not only foreigner but our own citizen to fit out within the united states a vessel to commit hostility against any state with which the united states be at peace or to increase the force of any foreign armed vessel intend for such hostility against a friendly state whatever concern may have be feel by either of the belligerent power lest private armed cruiser or other vessel in the service of one might be fit out in the port of this country to depredate on the property of the other all such fear have prove to be utterly groundless our citizen have be withhold from any such act or purpose by good faith and by respect for the law while the law of the union be thus peremptory in their prohibition of the equipment or armament of belligerent cruiser in our port they provide not less absolutely that no person shall within the territory or jurisdiction of the united states enlist or enter himself or hire or retain another person to enlist or enter himself or to go beyond the limit or jurisdiction of the united states with intent to be enlist or enter in the service of any foreign state either as a soldier or as a marine or seaman on board of any vessel of war letter of marque or privateer and these enactment be also in strict conformity with the law of nation which declare that no state have the right to raise troop for land or sea service in another state without its consent and that whether forbid by the municipal law or not the very attempt to do it without such consent be an attack on the national sovereignty such be the public right and the municipal law of the united states no solicitude on the subject be entertain by this government when a year since the british parliament pass an act to provide for the enlistment of foreigner in the military service of great britain nothing on the face of the act or in its public history indicate that the british government propose to attempt recruitment in the united states nor do it ever give intimation of such intention to this government it be matter of surprise therefore to find subsequently that the engagement of person within the united states to proceed to halifax in the british province of nova scotia and there enlist in the service of great britain be go on extensively with little or no disguise ordinary legal step be immediately take to arrest and punish party concern and so put an end to act infringe the municipal law and derogatory to our sovereignty meanwhile suitable representation on the subject be address to the british government thereupon it became know by the admission of the british government itself that the attempt to draw recruit from this country originate with it or at least have its approval and sanction but it also appear that the public agent engage in it bad stringent instruction not to violate the municipal law of the united states it be difficult to understand how it should have be suppose that troop could be raise here by great britain without violation of the municipal law the unmistakable object of the law be to prevent every such act which if perform must be either in violation of the law or in study evasion of it and in either alternative the act do would be alike injurious to the sovereignty of the united states in the meantime the matter acquire additional importance by the recruitment in the united states not be discontinue and the disclosure of the fact that they be prosecute upon a systematic plan devise by official authority that recruit rendezvous have be open in our principal city and depot for the reception of recruit establish on our frontier and the whole business conduct under the supervision and by the regular cooperation of british officer civil and military some in the north american provinces and some in the united states the complicity of those officer in an undertaking which could only be accomplish by defy our law throw suspicion over our attitude of neutrality and disregard our territorial right be conclusively prove by the evidence elicit on the trial of such of their agent as have be apprehend and convict some of the officer thus implicate be of high official position and many of they beyond our jurisdiction so that legal proceeding could not reach the source of the mischief these consideration and the fact that the cause of complaint be not a mere casual occurrence trot a deliberate design enter upon with full knowledge of our law and national policy and conduct by responsible public functionary impel i to present the case to the british government in order to secure not only a cessation of the wrong but its reparation the subject be still under discussion the result of which will be communicate to you in due time i repeat the recommendation submit to the last congress that provision be make for the appointment of a commissioner in connection with great britain to survey and establish the boundary line which divide the territory of washington from the contiguous british possession by reason of the extent and importance of the country in dispute there have be imminent danger of collision between the subject of great britain and the citizen of the united states include their respective authority in that quarter the prospect of a speedy arrangement have contribute hitherto to induce on both side forbearance to assert by force what each claim as a right continuance of delay on the part of the two government to act in the matter will increase the danger and difficulty of the controversy misunderstanding exist as to the extent character and value of the possessory right of the hudsons bay company and the property of the pugets sound agricultural company reserve in our treaty with great britain relative to the territory of oregon i have reason to believe that a cession of the right of both company to the united states which would be the readiest mean of terminate all question can be obtain on reasonable term and with a view to this end i present the subject to the attention of congress the colony of newfoundland having enact the law require by the treaty of the 5th of june 1854 be now place on the same footing in respect to commercial intercourse with the united states as the other british north american provinces the commission which that treaty contemplate for determine the right of fishery in river and mouth of river on the coast of the united states and the british north american provinces have be organize and have commence its labor to complete which there be need further appropriation for the service of another season in pursuance of the authority confer by a resolution of the senate of the united states pass on the 3d of march last notice be give to denmark on the 14th day of april of the intention of this government to avail itself of the stipulation of the subsist convention of friendship commerce and navigation between that kingdom and the united states whereby either party might after ten year terminate the same at the expiration of one year from the date of notice for that purpose the consideration which lead i to call the attention of congress to that convention and induce the senate to adopt the resolution refer to still continue in full force the convention contain an article which although it do not directly engage the united states to submit to the imposition of toll on the vessel and cargo of americans pass into or from the baltic sea during the continuance of the treaty yet may by possibility be construe as imply such submission the exaction of those toll not be justify by any principle of international law it become the right and duty of the united states to relieve themselves from the implication of engagement on the subject so as to be perfectly free to act in the premise in such way as their public interest and honor shall demand i remain of the opinion that the united states ought not to submit to the payment of the sound due not so much because of their amount which be a secondary matter but because it be in effect the recognition of the right of denmark to treat one of the great maritime highway of nation as a close sea and prevent the navigation of it as a privilege for which tribute may be impose upon those who have occasion to use it this government on a former occasion not unlike the present signalize its determination to maintain the freedom of the sea and of the great natural channel of navigation the barbary states have for a long time coerce the payment of tribute from all nation whose ship frequent the mediterranean to the last demand of such payment make by they the united states although suffer less by their depredation than many other nation return the explicit answer that we prefer war to tribute and thus open the way to the relief of the commerce of the world from an ignominious tax so long submit to by the more powerful nation of europe if the manner of payment of the sound due differ from that of the tribute formerly concede to the barbary states still their exaction by denmark have no well foundation in right each be in its origin nothing but a tax on a common natural right extort by those who be at that time able to obstruct the free and secure enjoyment of it but who no long possess that power denmark while resist our assertion of the freedom of the baltic sound and belt have indicate a readiness to make some new arrangement on the subject and have invite the government interest include the united states to be represent in a convention to assemble for the purpose of receive and consider a proposition which she intend to submit for the capitalization of the sound due and the distribution of the sum to be pay as commutation among the government accord to the respective proportion of their maritime commerce to and from the baltic i have decline in behalf of the united states to accept this invitation for the most cogent reason one be that denmark do not offer to submit to the convention the question of her right to levy the sound due the second be that if the convention be allow to take cognizance of that particular question still it would not be competent to deal with the great international principle involve which affect the right in other case of navigation and commercial freedom as well as that of access to the baltic above all by the express term of the proposition it be contemplate that the consideration of the sound due shall be commingle with and make subordinate to a matter wholly extraneous the balance of power among the government of europe while however reject this proposition and insist on the right of free transit into and from the baltic i have express to denmark a willingness on the part of the united states to share liberally with other power in compensate she for any advantage which commerce shall hereafter derive from expenditure make by she for the improvement and safety of the navigation of the sound or belt i lie before you herewith sundry document on the subject in which my view be more fully disclose should no satisfactory arrangement be soon conclude i shall again call your attention to the subject with recommendation of such measure as may appear to be require in order to assert and secure the right of the united states so far as they be affect by the pretension of denmark i announce with much gratification that since the adjournment of the last congress the question then exist between this government and that of france respect the french consul at san francisco have be satisfactorily determine and that the relation of the two government continue to be of the most friendly nature a question also which have be pende for several year between the united states and the kingdom of greece grow out of the sequestration by public authority of that country of property belong to the present american consul at athens and which have be the subject of very earnest discussion heretofore have recently be settle to the satisfaction of the party interested and of both government with spain peaceful relation be still maintain and some progress have be make in secure the redress of wrong complain of by this government spain have not only disavow and disapprove the conduct of the officer who illegally seize and detain the steam black warrior at havana but have also pay the sum claim as indemnity for the loss thereby inflict on citizen of the united states in consequence of a destructive hurricane which visit cuba in 1844 the supreme authority of that island issue a decree permit the importation for the period of six month of certain building material and provision free of duty but revoke it when about half the period only have elapse to the injury of citizen of the united states who have proceed to act on the faith of that decree the spanish government refuse indemnification to the party aggrieve until recently when it be assent to payment be promise to be make so soon as the amount due can be ascertain satisfaction claim for the arrest and search of the steamer el dorado have not yet be accord but there be reason to believe that it will be and that case with other continue to be urge on the attention of the spanish government i do not abandon the hope of conclude with spain some general arrangement which if it do not wholly prevent the recurrence of difficulty in cuba will render they less frequent and whenever they shall occur facilitate their more speedy settlement the interposition of this government have be invoke by many of its citizen on account of injury do to their person and property for which the mexican republic be responsible the unhappy situation of that country for some time past have not allow its government to give due consideration to claim of private reparation and have appear to call for and justify some forbearance in such matter on the part of this government but if the revolutionary movement which have lately occur in that republic end in the organization of a stable government urgent appeal to its justice will then be make and it may be hope with success for the redress of all complaint of our citizen in regard to the american republics which from their proximity and other consideration have peculiar relation to this government while it have be my constant aim strictly to observe all the obligation of political friendship and of good neighborhood obstacle to this have arise in some of they from their own insufficient power to cheek lawless irruption which in effect throw most of the task on the united states thus it be that the distracted internal condition of the state of nicaragua have make it incumbent on i to appeal to the good faith of our citizen to abstain from unlawful intervention in its affair and to adopt preventive measure to the same end which on a similar occasion have the good result in reassure the peace of the mexican states of sonora and lower california since the last session of congress a treaty of amity commerce and navigation and for the surrender of fugitive criminal with the kingdom of the two sicily a treaty of friendship commerce and navigation with nicaragua and a convention of commercial reciprocity with the hawaiian kingdom have be negotiate the latter kingdom and the state of nicaragua have also accede to a declaration recognize as international right the principle contain in the convention between the united states and russia of july 22 1854 these treaty and convention will be lay before the senate for ratification the statement make in my last annual message respect the anticipate receipt and expenditure of the treasury have be substantially verify it appear from the report of the secretary of the treasury that the receipt during the last fiscal year end june 30 1855 from all source be $ 65,003,930 and that the public expenditure for the same period exclusive of payment on account of the public debt amount to $ 56,365,393 during the same period the payment make in redemption of the public debt include interest and premium amount to $ 9,844,528.the balance in the treasury at the beginning of the present fiscal year july 1 1855 be $ 18,931,976 the receipt for the first quarter and the estimate receipt for the remain three quarter amount together to $ 67,918,734 thus afford in all as the available resource of the current fiscal year the sum of $ 86,856,710.if to the actual expenditure of the first quarter of the current fiscal year be add the probable expenditure for the remain three quarter as estimate by the secretary of the treasury the sum total will be $ 71,226,846 thereby leave an estimate balance in the treasury on july 1 1856 of $ 15,623,863.41.in the above estimate expenditure of the present fiscal year be include $ 3,000,000 to meet the last installment of the ten million provide for in the late treaty with mexico and $ 7,750,000 appropriate on account of the debt due to texas which two sum make an aggregate amount of $ 10,750,000 and reduce the expenditure actual or estimate for ordinary object of the year to the sum of $ 60,476,000.the amount of the public debt at the commencement of the present fiscal year be $ 40,583,631 and deduction be make of subsequent payment the whole public debt of the federal government remain at this time be less than $ 40,000,000 the remnant of certain other government stock amount to $ 243,000 refer to in my last message as outstanding have since be pay i be fully persuade that it would be difficult to devise a system superior to that by which the fiscal business of the government be now conduct notwithstanding the great number of public agent of collection and disbursement it be believe that the check and guard provide include the requirement of monthly return render it scarcely possible for any considerable fraud on the part of those agent or neglect involve hazard of serious public loss to escape detection i renew however the recommendation heretofore make by i of the enactment of a law declare it felony on the part of public officer to insert false entry in their book of record or account or to make false return and also require they on the termination of their service to deliver to their successor all book record and other object of a public nature in their custody derive as our public revenue be in chief part from duty on import its magnitude afford gratify evidence of the prosperity not only of our commerce but of the other great interest upon which that depend the principle that all money not require for the current expense of the government should remain for active employment in the hand of the people and the conspicuous fact that the annual revenue from all source exceed by many million of dollar the amount need for a prudent and economical administration of public affair can not fail to suggest the propriety of an early revision and reduction of the tariff of duty on import it be now so generally concede that the purpose of revenue alone can justify the imposition of duty on import that in readjust the impost table and schedule which unquestionably require essential modification a departure from the principle of the present tariff be not anticipate the army during the past year have be actively engage in defend the indian frontier the state of the service permit but few and small garrison in our permanent fortification the additional regiment authorize at the last session of congress have be recruit and organize and a large portion of the troop have already be send to the field all the duty which devolve on the military establishment have be satisfactorily perform and the danger and privation incident to the character of the service require of our troop have furnish additional evidence of their courage zeal and capacity to meet any requisition which their country may make upon they for the detail of the military operation the distribution of the troop and additional provision require for the military service i refer to the report of the secretary of war and the accompany document experience gather from event which have transpire since my last annual message have but serve to confirm the opinion then express of the propriety of make provision by a retire list for disabled officer and for increase compensation to the officer retain on the list for active duty all the reason which exist when these measure be recommend on former occasion continue without modification except so far as circumstance have give to some of they additional force the recommendation heretofore make for a partial reorganization of the army be also renew the thorough elementary education give to those officer who commence their service with the grade of cadet qualify they to a considerable extent to perform the duty of every arm of the service but to give the high efficiency to artillery require the practice and special study of many year and it be not therefore believe to be advisable to maintain in time of peace a large force of that arm than can be usually employ in the duty appertain to the service of field and siege artillery the duty of the staff in all its various branch belong to the movement of troop and the efficiency of an army in the field would materially depend upon the ability with which those duty be discharge it be not as in the case of the artillery a specialty but require also an intimate knowledge of the duty of an officer of the line and it be not doubt that to complete the education of an officer for either the line or the general staff it be desirable that he shall have serve in both with this view it be recommend on a former occasion that the duty of the staff should be mainly perform by detail from the line and with conviction of the advantage which would result from such a change it be again present for the consideration of congress the report of the secretary of the navy herewith submit exhibit in full the naval operation of the past year together with the present condition of the service and it make suggestion of further legislation to which your attention be invite the construction of the six steam frigate for which appropriation be make by the last congress have proceed in the most satisfactory manner and with such expedition as to warrant the belief that they will be ready for service early in the come spring important as this addition to our naval force be it still remain inadequate to the contingent exigency of the protection of the extensive seacoast and vast commercial interest of the united states in view of this fact and of the acknowledge wisdom of the policy of a gradual and systematic increase of the navy an appropriation be recommend for the construction of six steam sloop of war in regard to the step take in execution of the act of congress to promote the efficiency of the navy it be unnecessary for i to say more than to express entire concurrence in the observation on that subject present by the secretary in his report it will be perceive by the report of the postmaster general that the gross expenditure of the department for the last fiiscal year be $ 9,968,342 and the gross receipt $ 7,342,136 make an excess of expenditure over receipt of $ 2,626,206 and that the cost of mail transportation during that year be $ 674,952 great than the previous year much of the heavy expenditure to which the treasury be thus subject be to be ascribe to the large quantity of print matter convey by the mail either franked or liable to no postage by law or to very low rate of postage compare with that charge on letter and to the great cost of mail service on railroad and by ocean steamer the suggestion of the postmaster general on the subject deserve the consideration of congress the report of the secretary of the interior will engage your attention as well for useful suggestion it contain as for the interest and importance of the subject to which they refer the aggregate amount of public land sell during the last fiscal year locate with military scrip or land warrant take up under grant for road and select as swamp land by states be 24,557,409 acre of which the portion sell be 15,729,524 acre yield in receipt the sum of $ 11,485,380 in the same period of time 8,723,854 acre have be survey but in consideration of the quantity already subject to entry no additional tract have be bring into market the peculiar relation of the general government to the district of columbia render it proper to commend to your care not only its material but also its moral interest include education more especially in those part of the district outside of the city of washington and georgetown the commissioner appoint to revise and codify the law of the district have make such progress in the performance of their task as to insure its completion in the time prescribe by the act of congress information have recently be receive that the peace of the settlement in the territories of oregon and washington be disturb by hostility on the part of the indians with indication of extensive combination of a hostile character among the tribe in that quarter the more serious in their possible effect by reason of the undetermined foreign interest exist in those territories to which your attention have already be especially invite efficient measure have be take which it be believe will restore quiet and afford protection to our citizen in the territory of kansas there have be act prejudicial to good order but as yet none have occur under circumstance to justify the interposition of the federal executive that could only be in case of obstruction to federal law or of organize resistance to territorial law assume the character of insurrection which if it should occur it would be my duty promptly to overcome and suppress i cherish the hope however that the occurrence of any such untoward event will be prevent by the sound sense of the people of the territory who by its organic law possess the right to determine their own domestic institution be entitle while deport themselves peacefully to the free exercise of that right and must be protect in the enjoyment of it without interference on the part of the citizen of any of the states the southern boundary line of this territory have never be survey and establish the rapidly extend settlement in that region and the fact that the main route between independence in the state of missouri and new mexico be contiguous in this line suggest the probability that embarrassing question of jurisdiction may consequently arise for these and other consideration i commend the subject to your early attention i have thus pass in review the general state of the union include such particular concern of the federal government whether of domestic or foreign relation as it appear to i desirable and useful to bring to the special notice of congress unlike the great states of europe and asia and many of those of america these united states be waste their strength neither in foreign war nor domestic strife whatever of discontent or public dissatisfaction exist be attributable to the imperfection of human nature or be incident to all government however perfect which human wisdom can devise such subject of political agitation as occupy the public mind consist to a great extent of exaggeration of inevitable evil or over zeal in social improvement or mere imagination of grievance have but remote connection with any of the constitutional function or duty of the federal government to whatever extent these question exhibit a tendency menacing to the stability of the constitution or the integrity of the union and no far they demand the consideration of the executive and require to be present by he to congress before the thirteen colony become a confederation of independent states they be associate only by community of transatlantic origin by geographical position and by the mutual tie of common dependence on great britain when that tie be sunder they severally assume the power and right of absolute self government the municipal and social institution of each its law of property and of personal relation even its political organization be such only as each one choose to establish wholly without interference from any other in the language of the declaration of independence each state have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliance establish commerce and to do all other act and thing which independent state may of right do the several colony differ in climate in soil in natural production in religion in system of education in legislation and in the form of political administration and they continue to differ in these respect when they voluntarily ally themselves as states to carry on the war of the revolution the object of that war be to disenthrall the united colony from foreign rule which have prove to be oppressive and to separate they permanently from the mother country the political result be the foundation of a federal republic of the free white man of the colony constitute as they be in distinct and reciprocally independent state government as for the subject race whether indian or african the wise and brave statesman of that day be engage in no extravagant scheme of social change leave they as they be and thus preserve themselves and their posterity from the anarchy and the ever recur civil war which have prevail in other revolutionize european colony of america when the confederate state find it convenient to modify the condition of their association by give to the general government direct access in some respect to the people of the states instead of confine it to action on the states as such they proceed to frame the exist constitution adhere steadily to one guide thought which be to delegate only such power as be necessary and proper to the execution of specific purpose or in other word to retain as much as possible consistently with those purpose of the independent power of the individual state for object of common defense and security they intrust to the general government certain carefully define function leave all other as the undelegated right of the separate independent sovereignty such be the constitutional theory of our government the practical observance of which have carry we and we alone among modern republic through nearly three generation of time without the cost of one drop of blood shed in civil war with freedom and concert of action it have enable we to contend successfully on the battlefield against foreign foe have elevate the feeble colony into powerful states and have raise our industrial production and our commerce which transport they to the level of the rich and the great nation of europe and the admirable adaptation of our political institution to their object combine local self government with aggregate strength have establish the practicability of a government like our to cover a continent with confederate state the congress of the united states be in effect that congress of sovereignty which good man in the old world have seek for but could never attain and which impart to america an exemption from the mutable league for common action from the war the mutual invasion and vague aspiration after the balance of power which convulse from time to time the government of europe our cooperative action rest in the condition of permanent confederation prescribe by the constitution our balance of power be in the separate reserve right of the states and their equal representation in the senate that independent sovereignty in every one of the states with its reserved right of local self government assure to each by their coequal power in the senate be the fundamental condition of the constitution without it the union would never have exist however desirous the large state might be to reorganize the government so as to give to their population its proportionate weight in the common counsel they know it be impossible unless they concede to the small one authority to exercise at least a negative influence on all the measure of the government whether legislative or executive through their equal representation in the senate indeed the large states themselves could not have fail to perceive that the same power be equally necessary to they for the security of their own domestic interest against the aggregate force of the general government in a word the original states go into this permanent league on the agree premise of exert their common strength for the defense of the whole and of all its part but of utterly exclude all capability of reciprocal aggression each solemnly bind itself to all the other neither to undertake nor permit any encroachment upon or intermeddle with another 's reserve right where it be deem expedient particular right of the states be expressly guarantee by the constitution but in all thing besides these right be guard by the limitation of the power grant and by express reservation of all power not grant in the compact of union thus the great power of taxation be limit to purpose of common defense and general welfare exclude object appertain to the local legislation of the several states and those purpose of general welfare and common defense be afterwards define by specific enumeration as be matter only of co relation between the states themselves or between they and foreign government which because of their common and general nature could not be leave to the separate control of each state of the circumstance of local condition interest and right in which a portion of the states constitute one great section of the union differ from the rest and from another section the most important be the peculiarity of a large relative colored population in the southern than in the northern states a population of this class hold in subjection exist in nearly all the states but be more numerous and of more serious concernment in the south than in the north on account of natural difference of climate and production and it be foresee that for the same reason while this population would diminish and soon or later cease to exist in some states it might increase in other the peculiar character and magnitude of this question of local right not in material relation only but still more in social one cause it to enter into the special stipulation of the constitution hence while the general government as well by the enumerate power grant to it as by those not enumerate and therefore refuse to it be forbid to touch this matter in the sense of attack or offense it be place under the general safeguard of the union in the sense of defense against either invasion or domestic violence like all other local interest of the several states each state expressly stipulate as well for itself as for each and all of its citizen and every citizen of each state became solemnly bind by his allegiance to the constitution that any person hold to service or labor in one state escape into another should not in consequence of any law or regulation thereof be discharge from such service or labor but should be deliver up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor might be due by the law of his state thus and thus only by the reciprocal guaranty of all the right of every state against interference on the part of another be the present form of government establish by our father and transmit to we and by no other mean be it possible for it to exist if one state cease to respect the right of another and obtrusively intermeddle with its local interest if a portion of the states assume to impose their institution on the other or refuse to fulfill their obligation to they we be no long united friendly states but distracted hostile one with little capacity leave of common advantage but abundant mean of reciprocal injury and mischief practically it be immaterial whether aggressive interference between the states or deliberate refusal on the part of any one of they to comply with constitutional obligation arise from erroneous conviction or blind prejudice whether it be perpetrate by direction or indirection in either case it be full of threat and of danger to the durability of the union place in the office of chief magistrate as the executive agent of the whole country bind to take care that the law be faithfully execute and specially enjoin by the constitution to give information to congress on the state of the union it would be palpable neglect of duty on my part to pass over a subject like this which beyond all thing at the present time vitally concern individual and public security it have be matter of painful regret to see states conspicuous for their service in round this republic and equally share its advantage disregard their constitutional obligation to it although conscious of their inability to heal admit and palpable social evil of their own and which be completely within their jurisdiction they engage in the offensive and hopeless undertaking of reform the domestic institution of other states wholly beyond their control and authority in the vain pursuit of end by they entirely unattainable and which they may not legally attempt to compass they peril the very existence of the constitution and all the countless benefit which it have confer while the people of the southern states confine their attention to their own affair not presume officiously to intermeddle with the social institution of the northern states too many of the inhabitant of the latter be permanently organize in association to inflict injury on the former by wrongful act which would be cause of war as between foreign power and only fail to be such in our system because perpetrate under cover of the union be it possible to present this subject as truth and the occasion require without notice the reiterated but groundless allegation that the south have persistently assert claim and obtain advantage in the practical administration of the general government to the prejudice of the north and in which the latter have acquiesce that is the state which either promote or tolerate attack on the right of person and of property in other states to disguise their own injustice pretend or imagine and constantly aver that they whose constitutional right be thus systematically assail be themselves the aggressor at the present time this imputed aggression rest as it do only in the vague declamatory charge of political agitator resolve itself into misapprehension or misinterpretation of the principle and fact of the political organization of the new territories of the united states what be the voice of history when the ordinance which provide for the government of the territory northwest of the river ohio and for its eventual subdivision into new states be adopt in the congress of the confederation it be not to be suppose that the question of future relative power as between the states which retain and those which do not retain a numerous colored population escape notice or fail to be consider and yet the concession of that vast territory to the interest and opinion of the northern states a territory now the seat of five among the large member of the union be in great measure the act of the state of virginia and of the south when louisiana be acquire by the united states it be an acquisition not less to the north than to the south for while it be important to the country at the mouth of the river mississippi to become the emporium of the country above it so also it be even more important to the whole union to have that emporium and although the new province by reason of its imperfect settlement be mainly regard as on the gulf of mexico yet in fact it extend to the opposite boundary of the united states with far great breadth above than below and be in territory as in everything else equally at least an accession to the northern states it be mere delusion and prejudice therefore to speak of louisiana as acquisition in the special interest of the south the patriotic and just man who participate in the act be influence by motive far above all sectional jealousy it be in truth the great event which by complete for we the possession of the valley of the mississippi with commercial access to the gulf of mexico imparted unity and strength to the whole confederation and attach together by indissoluble tie the east and the west as well as the north and the south as to florida that be but the transfer by spain to the united states of territory on the east side of the river mississippi in exchange for large territory which the united states transfer to spain on the west side of that river as the entire diplomatic history of the transaction serve to demonstrate moreover it be an acquisition demand by the commercial interest and the security of the whole union in the meantime the people of the united states have grow up to a proper consciousness of their strength and in a brief contest with france and in a second serious war with great britain they have shake off all which remain of undue reverence for europe and emerge from the atmosphere of those transatlantic influence which surround the infant republic and have begin to turn their attention to the full and systematic development of the internal resource of the union among the evanescent controversy of that period the most conspicuous be the question of regulation by congress of the social condition of the future states to be round in the territory of louisiana the ordinance for the government of the territory northwest of the river ohio have contain a provision which prohibit the use of servile labor therein subject to the condition of the extradition of fugitive from service due in any other part of the united states subsequently to the adoption of the constitution this provision cease to remain as a law for its operation as such be absolutely supersede by the constitution but the recollection of the fact excite the zeal of social propagandism in some section of the confederation and when a second state that of missouri come to be form in the territory of louisiana proposition be make to extend to the latter territory the restriction originally apply to the country situate between the river ohio and mississippi most questionable as be this proposition in all its constitutional relation nevertheless it receive the sanction of congress with some slight modification of line to save the exist right of the intended new state it be reluctantly acquiesce in by southern states as a sacrifice to the cause of peace and of the union not only of the right stipulate by the treaty of louisiana but of the principle of equality among the states guarantee by the constitution it be receive by the northern states with angry and resentful condemnation and complaint because it do not concede all which they have exactingly demand having pass through the form of legislation it take its place in the statute book stand open to repeal like any other act of doubtful constitutionality subject to be pronounce null and void by the court of law and possess no possible efficacy to control the right of the states which might thereafter be organize out of any part of the original territory of louisiana in all this if any aggression there be any innovation upon preexist right to which portion of the union be they justly chargeable this controversy pass away with the occasion nothing survive it save the dormant letter of the statute but long afterwards when by the propose accession of the republic of texas the united states be to take their next step in territorial greatness a similar contingency occur and become the occasion for systematize attempt to intervene in the domestic affair of one section of the union in defiance of their right as states and of the stipulation of the constitution these attempt assume a practical direction in the shape of persevere endeavor by some of the representatives in both houses of congress to deprive the southern states of the suppose benefit of the provision of the act authorize the organization of the state of missouri but the good sense of the people and the vital force of the constitution triumph over sectional prejudice and the political error of the day and the state of texas return to the union as she be with social institution which her people have choose for themselves and with express agreement by the reannexing act that she should be susceptible of subdivision into a plurality of states whatever advantage the interest of the southern states as such gain by this be far inferior in result as they unfold in the progress of time to those which spring from previous concession make by the south to every thoughtful friend of the union to the true lover of their country to all who long and labor for the full success of this great experiment of republican institution it be cause of gratulation that such an opportunity have occur to illustrate our advance power on this continent and to furnish to the world additional assurance of the strength and stability of the constitution who would wish to see florida still a european colony who would rejoice to hail texas as a lone star instead of one in the galaxy of states who do not appreciate the incalculable benefit of the acquisition of louisiana and yet narrow view and sectional purpose would inevitably have exclude they all from the union but another struggle on the same point ensue when our victorious army return from mexico and it devolve on congress to provide for the territory acquire by the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo the great relation of the subject have now become distinct and clear to the perception of the public mind which appreciate the evil of sectional controversy upon the question of the admission of new states in that crisis intense solicitude pervade the nation but the patriotic impulse of the popular heart guide by the admonitory advice of the father of his country rise superior to all the difficulty of the incorporation of a new empire into the union in the counsel of congress there be manifest extreme antagonism of opinion and action between some representatives who seek by the abusive and unconstitutional employment of the legislative power of the government to interfere in the condition of the inchoate states and to impose their own social theory upon the latter and other representatives who repel the interposition of the general government in this respect and maintain the self constitute right of the states in truth the thing attempt be in form alone action of the general government while in reality it be the endeavor by abuse of legislative power to force the idea of internal policy entertain in particular states upon ally independent states once more the constitution and the union triumph signally the new territory be organize without restriction on the dispute point and be thus leave to judge in that particular for themselves and the sense of constitutional faith prove vigorous enough in congress not only to accomplish this primary object but also the incidental and hardly less important one of so amend the provision of the statute for the extradition of fugitive from service as to place that public duty under the safeguard of the general government and thus relieve it from obstacle raise up by the legislation of some of the states vain declamation regard the provision of law for the extradition of fugitive from service with occasional episode of frantic effort to obstruct their execution by riot and murder continue for a brief time to agitate certain locality but the true principle of leave each state and territory to regulate its own law of labor accord to its own sense of right and expediency have acquire fast hold of the public judgment to such a degree that by common consent it be observe in the organization of the territory of washington when more recently it become requisite to organize the territories of nebraska and kansas it be the natural and legitimate if not the inevitable consequence of previous event and legislation that the same great and sound principle which have already be apply to utah and new mexico should be apply to they that they should stand exempt from the restriction propose in the act relative to the state of missouri these restriction be in the estimation of many thoughtful man null from the beginning unauthorized by the constitution contrary to the treaty stipulation for the cession of louisiana and inconsistent with the equality of these states they have be strip of all moral authority by persistent effort to procure their indirect repeal through contradictory enactment they have be practically abrogate by the legislation attend the organization of utah new mexico and washington if any vitality remain in they it would have be take away in effect by the new territorial act in the form originally propose to the senate at the first session of the last congress it be manly and ingenuous as well as patriotic and just to do this directly and plainly and thus relieve the statute book of an act which might be of possible future injury but of no possible future benefit and the measure of its repeal be the final consummation and complete recognition of the principle that no portion of the united states shall undertake through assumption of the power of the general government to dictate the social institution of any other portion the scope and effect of the language of repeal be not leave in doubt it be declare in term to be the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institution in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states "the measure could not be withstand upon its merit alone it be attack with violence on the false or delusive pretext that it constitute a breach of faith never be objection more utterly destitute of substantial justification when before be it imagine by sensible man that a regulative or declarative statute whether enact ten or forty year ago be irrepealable that an act of congress be above the constitution if indeed there be in the fact any cause to impute bad faith it would attach to those only who have never cease from the time of the enactment of the restrictive provision to the present day to denounce and condemn it who have constantly refuse to complete it by needful supplementary legislation who have spare no exertion to deprive it of moral force who have themselves again and again attempt its repeal by the enactment of incompatible provision and who by the inevitable reactionary effect of their own violence on the subject awaken the country to perception of the true constitutional principle of leave the matter involve to the discretion of the people of the respective exist or incipient state it be not pretend that this principle or any other preclude the possibility of evil in practice disturb as political action be liable to be by human passion no form of government be exempt from inconvenience but in this case they be the result of the abuse and not of the legitimate exercise of the power reserve or confer in the organization of a territory they be not to be charge to the great principle of popular sovereignty on the contrary they disappear before the intelligence and patriotism of the people exert through the ballot box their peaceful and silent but irresistible power if the friend of the constitution be to have another struggle its enemy could not present a more acceptable issue than that of a state whose constitution clearly embrace a republican form of government be exclude from the union because its domestic institution may not in all respect comport with the idea of what be wise and expedient entertain in some other state fresh from groundless imputation of breach of faith against other man will commence the agitation of this new question with indubitable violation of an express compact between the independent sovereign power of the united states and of the republic of texas as well as of the old and equally solemn compact which assure the equality of all the states but deplorable as would be such a violation of compact in itself and in all its direct consequence that be the very least of the evil involve when sectional agitator shall have succeed in force on this issue can their pretension fail to be meet by counter pretension will not different state be compel respectively to meet extreme with extreme and if either extreme carry its point what be that so far forth but dissolution of the union if a new state form from the territory of the united states be absolutely exclude from admission therein that fact of itself constitute the disruption of union between it and the other states but the process of dissolution could not stop there would not a sectional decision produce such result by a majority of vote either northern or southern of necessity drive out the oppressed and aggrieved minority and place in presence of each other two irreconcilably hostile confederations?it be necessary to speak thus plainly of project the offspring of that sectional agitation now prevail in some of the states which be as impracticable as they be unconstitutional and which if persevere in must and will end calamitously it be either disunion and civil war or it be mere angry idle aimless disturbance of public peace and tranquillity disunion for what if the passionate rage of fanaticism and partisan spirit do not force the fact upon our attention it would be difficult to believe that any considerable portion of the people of this enlightened country could have so surrender themselves to a fanatical devotion to the suppose interest of the relatively few africans in the united states as totally to abandon and disregard the interest of the 25,000,000 americans to trample under foot the injunction of moral and constitutional obligation and to engage in plan of vindictive hostility against those who be associate with they in the enjoyment of the common heritage of our national institution nor be it hostility against their fellow citizen of one section of the union alone the interest the honor the duty the peace and the prosperity of the people of all section be equally involved and imperil in this question and be patriotic man in any part of the union prepare on such issue thus madly to invite all the consequence of the forfeiture of their constitutional engagement it be impossible the storm of frenzy and faction must inevitably dash itself in vain against the unshaken rock of the constitution i shall never doubt it i know that the union be strong a thousand time than all the wild and chimerical scheme of social change which be generate one after another in the unstable mind of visionary sophist and interested agitator i rely confidently on the patriotism of the people on the dignity and self respect of the states on the wisdom of congress and above all on the continue gracious favor of almighty god to maintain against all enemy whether at home or abroad the sanctity of the constitution and the integrity of the union
circumstance have occur to disturb the course of governmental organization in the territory of kansas and produce there a condition of thing which render it incumbent on i to call your attention to the subject and urgently to recommend the adoption by you of such measure of legislation as the grave exigency of the case appear to require
 a brief exposition of the circumstance refer to and of their cause will be necessary to the full understanding of the recommendation which it be propose to submit
 the act to organize the territories of nebraska and kansas be a manifestation of the legislative opinion of congress on two great point of constitutional construction one that the designation of the boundary of a new territory and provision for its political organization and administration as a territory be measure which of right fall within the power of the general government and the other that the inhabitant of any such territory consider as an inchoate state be entitle in the exercise of self government to determine for themselves what shall be their own domestic institution subject only to the constitution and the law duly enact by congress under it and to the power of the exist state to decide accord to the provision and principle of the constitution at what time the territory shall be receive as a state into the union such be the great political right which be solemnly declare and affirm by that act
 base upon this theory the act of congress define for each territory the outline of republican government distribute public authority among lawfully create agent executive judicial and legislative to be appoint either by the general government or by the territory the legislative function be intrust to a council and a house of representative duly elect and empower to enact all the local law which they might deem essential to their prosperity happiness and good government act in the same spirit congress also define the person who be in the first instance to be consider as the people of each territory enact that every free white male inhabitant of the same above the age of 21 year be an actual resident thereof and possess the qualification hereafter describe should be entitle to vote at the first election and be eligible to any office within the territory but that the qualification of voter and hold office at all subsequent election should be such as might be prescribe by the legislative assembly provide however that the right of suffrage and of hold office should be exercise only by citizen of the united states and those who should have declare on oath their intention to become such and have take an oath to support the constitution of the united states and the provision of the act and provide far that no officer soldier seaman or marine or other person in the army or navy of the united states or attach to troop in their service should be allow to vote or hold office in either territory by reason of be on service therein
 such of the public officer of the territories as by the provision of the act be to be appoint by the general government include the governor be appoint and commission in due season the law having be enact on the 30th of may 1854 and the commission of the governor of the territory of nebraska be date on the 2d day of august 1854 and of the territory of kansas on the 29th day of june 1854 among the duty impose by the act on the governor be that of direct and superintend the political organization of the respective territories
 the governor of kansas be require to cause a census or enumeration of the inhabitant and qualified voter of the several county and district of the territory to be take by such person and in such mode as he might designate and appoint to appoint and direct the time and place of hold the first election and the manner of conduct they both as to the person to superintend such election and the return thereof to declare the number of the member of the council and the house of representative for each county or district to declare what person might appear to be duly elect and to appoint the time and place of the first meeting of the legislative assembly in substance the same duty be devolve on the governor of nebraska
 while by this act the principle of constitution for each of the territories be one and the same and the detail of organic legislation regard both be as nearly as could be identical and while the territory of nebraska be tranquilly and successfully organize in the due course of law and its first legislative assembly meet on the 16th of january 1855 the organization of kansas be long delay and have be attend with serious difficulty and embarrassment partly the consequence of local maladministration and partly of the unjustifiable interference of the inhabitant of some of the states foreign by residence interest and right to the territory
 the governor of the territory of kansas commission as before state on the 29th of june 1854 do not reach the designate seat of his government until the 7th of the ensue october and even then fail to make the first step in its legal organization that of order the census or enumeration of its inhabitant until so late a day that the election of the member of the legislative assembly do not take place until the 30th of march 1855 nor its meeting until the 2d of july 1855 so that for a year after the territory be constitute by the act of congress and the officer to be appoint by the federal executive have be commission it be without a complete government without any legislative authority without local law and of course without the ordinary guaranty of peace and public order
 in other respect the governor instead of exercise constant vigilance and put forth all his energy to prevent or counteract the tendency to illegality which be prone to exist in all imperfectly organize and newly associate community allow his attention to be divert from official obligation by other object and himself set an example of the violation of law in the performance of act which render it my duty in the sequel to remove he from the office of chief executive magistrate of the territory
 before the requisite preparation be accomplish for election of a territorial legislature an election of delegate to congress have be hold in the territory on the 29th day of november 1854 and the delegate take his seat in the house of representatives without challenge it arrangement have be perfect by the governor so that the election for member of the legislative assembly might be hold in the several precinct at the same time as for delegate to congress any question appertain to the qualification of the person vote as people of the territory would have pass necessarily and at once under the supervision of congress as the judge of the validity of the return of the delegate and would have be determine before conflicting passion have become inflame by time and before opportunity could have be afford for systematic interference of the people of individual states
 this interference in so far as concern its primary cause and its immediate commencement be one of the incident of that pernicious agitation on the subject of the condition of the colored person hold to service in some of the states which have so long disturb the repose of our country and excited individual otherwise patriotic and law abide to toil with misdirect zeal in the attempt to propagate their social theory by the perversion and abuse of the power of congress
 the person and the party whom the tenor of the act to organize the territories of nebraska and kansas thwart in the endeavor to impose through the agency of congress their particular view of social organization on the people of the future new states now perceive that the policy of leave the inhabitant of each state to judge for themselves in this respect be ineradicably root in the conviction of the people of the union then have recourse in the pursuit of their general object to the extraordinary measure of propagandist colonization of the territory of kansas to prevent the free and natural action of its inhabitant in its internal organization and thus to anticipate or to force the determination of that question in this inchoate state
 with such view association be organize in some of the states and their purpose be proclaim through the press in language extremely irritate and offensive to those of whom the colonist be to become the neighbor those design and act have the necessary consequence to awaken emotion of intense indignation in states near to the territory of kansas and especially in the adjoining state of missouri whose domestic peace be thus the most directly endanger but they be far from justify the illegal and reprehensible countermovement which ensue
 under these inauspicious circumstance the primary election for member of the legislative assembly be hold in most if not all of the precinct at the time and the place and by the person designate and appoint by the governor accord to law
 angry accusation that illegal vote have be poll abound on all side and imputation be make both of fraud and violence but the governor in the exercise of the power and the discharge of the duty confer and impose by law on he alone officially receive and consider the return declare a large majority of the member of the council and the house of representative duly elect withhold certificate from other because of alleged illegality of vote appoint a new election to supply the place of the person not certify and thus at length in all the form of statute and with his own official authentication complete legality be give to the first legislative assembly of the territory
 those decision of the return officer and of the governor be final except that by the parliamentary usage of the country apply to the organic law it may be concede that each house of the assembly must have be competent to determine in the last resort the qualification and the election of its member the subject be by its nature one appertain exclusively to the jurisdiction of the local authority of the territory whatever irregularity may have occur in the election it seem too late now to raise that question at all event it be a question as to which neither now nor at any previous time have the least possible legal authority be possess by the president of the united states for all present purpose the legislative body thus constitute and elect be the legitimate legislative assembly of the territory
 accordingly the governor by proclamation convene the assembly thus elect to meet at a place call pawnee city the two house meet and be duly organize in the ordinary parliamentary form each send to and receive from the governor the official communication usual on such occasion an elaborate message open the session be communicate by the governor and the general business of legislation be enter upon by the legislative assembly
 but after a few day the assembly resolve to adjourn to another place in the territory a law be accordingly pass against the consent of the governor but in due form otherwise to remove the seat of government temporarily to the shawnee manual labor school or mission and thither the assembly proceed after this receive a bill for the establishment of a ferry at the town of kickapoo the governor refuse to sign it and by special message assign for reason of refusal not anything objectionable in the bill itself nor any pretense of the illegality or incompetency of the assembly as such but only the fact that the assembly have by its act transfer the seat of government temporarily from pawnee city to the shawnee mission for the same reason he continue to refuse to sign other bill until in the course of a few day he by official message communicate to the assembly the fact that he have receive notification of the termination of his function as governor and that the duty of the office be legally devolve on the secretary of the territory thus to the last recognize the body as a duly elect and constitute legislative assembly
 it will be perceive that if any constitutional defect attach to the legislative act of the assembly it be not pretend to consist in irregularity of election or want of qualification of the member but only in the change of its place of session however trivial this objection may seem to be it require to be consider because upon it be round all that superstructure of act plainly against law which now threaten the peace not only of the territory of kansas but of the union
 such an objection to the proceeding of the legislative assembly be of exceptionable origin for the reason that by the express term of the organic law the seat of government of the territory be locate temporarily at fort leavenworth and yet the governor himself remain there less than two month and of his own discretion transfer the seat of government to the shawnee mission where it in fact be at the time the assembly be call to meet at pawnee city if the governor have any such right to change temporarily the seat of government still more have the legislative assembly the objection be of exceptionable origin for the further reason that the place indicate by the governor without have any exclusive claim of preference in itself be a propose town site only which he and other be attempt to locate unlawfully upon land within a military reservation and for participation in which illegal act the commandant of the post a superior officer in the army have be dismiss by sentence of court martial nor be it easy to see why the legislative assembly might not with propriety pass the territorial act transfer its sitting to the shawnee mission if it could not that must be on account of some prohibitory or incompatible provision of act of congress but no such provision exist the organic act as already quote say the seat of government be hereby locate temporarily at fort leavenworth and it then provide that certain of the public building there may be occupy and use under the direction of the governor and legislative assembly these expression might possibly be construe to imply that when in a previous section of the act it be enact that the first legislative assembly shall meet at such place and on such day as the governor shall appoint the word place mean place at fort leavenworth not place anywhere in the territory if so the governor would have be the first to err in this matter not only in himself having remove the seat of government to the shawnee mission but in again remove it to pawnee city if there be any departure from the letter of the law therefore it be his in both instance but however this may be it be most unreasonable to suppose that by the term of the organic act congress intend to do impliedly what it have not do expressly that be to forbid to the legislative assembly the power to choose any place it might see fit as the temporary seat of its deliberation that be prove by the significant language of one of the subsequent act of congress on the subject that of march 3 1855 -which in make appropriation for public building of the territory enact that the same shall not be expend until the legislature of say territory shall have fix by law the permanent seat of government congress in these expression do not profess to be grant the power to fix the permanent seat of government but recognize the power as one already grant but how undoubtedly by the comprehensive provision of the organic act itself which declare that the legislative power of the territory shall extend to all rightful subject of legislation consistent with the constitution of the united states and the provision of this act if in view of this act the legislative assembly have the large power to fix the permanent seat of government at any place in its discretion of course by the same enactment it have the less and the include power to fix it temporarily
 nevertheless the allegation that the act of the legislative assembly be illegal by reason of this removal of its place of session be bring forward to justify the first great movement in disregard of law within the territory one of the act of the legislative assembly provide for the election of a delegate to the present congress and a delegate be elect under that law but subsequently to this a portion of the people of the territory proceed without authority of law to elect another delegate
 follow upon this movement be another and more important one of the same general character person confessedly not constitute the body politic or all the inhabitant but merely a party of the inhabitant and without law have undertake to summon a convention for the purpose of transform the territory into a state and have frame a constitution adopt it and under it elect a governor and other officer and a representative to congress in extenuation of these illegal act it be allege that the states of california michigan and other be self organize and as such be admit into the union without a previous enable act of congress it be true that while in a majority of case a previous act of congress have be pass to authorize the territory to present itself as a state and that this be deem the most regular course yet such an act have not be hold to be indispensable and in some case the territory have proceed without it and have nevertheless be admit into the union as a state it lie with congress to authorize beforehand or to confirm afterwards in its discretion but in no instance have a state be admit upon the application of person act against authority duly constitute by act of congress in every case it be the people of the territory not a party among they who have the power to form a constitution and ask for admission as a state no principle of public law no practice or precedent under the constitution of the united states no rule of reason right or common sense confer any such power as that now claim by a mere party in the territory in fact what have be do be of revolutionary character it be avowedly so in motive and in aim as respect the local law of the territory it will become treasonable insurrection if it reach the length of organize resistance by force to the fundamental or any other federal law and to the authority of the general government in such an event the path of duty for the executive be plain the constitution require he to take care that the law of the united states be faithfully execute if they be oppose in the territory of kansas he may and should place at the disposal of the marshal any public force of the united states which happen to be within the jurisdiction to be use as a portion of the posse comitatus and if that do not suffice to maintain order then he may call forth the militia of one or more state for that object or employ for the same object any part of the land or naval force of the united states so also if the obstruction be to the law of the territory and it be duly present to he as a case of insurrection he may employ for its suppression the militia of any state or the land or naval force of the united states and if the territory be invade by the citizen of other states whether for the purpose of decide election or for any other and the local authority find themselves unable to repel or withstand it they will be entitle to and upon the fact be fully ascertain they shall most certainly receive the aid of the general government
 but it be not the duty of the president of the united states to volunteer interposition by force to preserve the purity of election either in a state or territory to do so would be subversive of public freedom and whether a law be wise or unwise just or unjust be not a question for he to judge if it be constitutional that be if it be the law of the land it be his duty to cause it to be execute or to sustain the authority of any state or territory in execute it in opposition to all insurrectionary movement
 our system afford no justification of revolutionary act for the constitutional mean of relieve the people of unjust administration and law by a change of public agent and by repeal be ample and more prompt and effective than illegal violence these mean must be scrupulously guard this great prerogative of popular sovereignty sacredly respect
 it be the undoubted right of the peaceable and orderly people of the territory of kansas to elect their own legislative body make their own law and regulate their own social institution without foreign or domestic molestation interference on the one hand to procure the abolition or prohibition of slave labor in the territory have produce mischievous interference on the other for its maintenance or introduction one wrong beget another statement entirely unfounded or grossly exaggerated concern event within the territory be sedulously diffuse through remote states to feed the flame of sectional animosity there and the agitator there exert themselves indefatigably in return to encourage and stimulate strife within the territory
 the inflammatory agitation of which the present be but a part have for twenty year produce nothing save unmitigated evil north and south but for it the character of the domestic institution of the future new state would have be a matter of too little interest to the inhabitant of the contiguous state personally or collectively to produce among they any political emotion climate soil production hope of rapid advancement and the pursuit of happiness on the part of the settler themselves with good wish but with no interference from without would have quietly determine the question which be at this time of such disturbing character
 but we be constrain to turn our attention to the circumstance of embarrassment as they now exist it be the duty of the people of kansas to discountenance every act or purpose of resistance to its law above all the emergency appeal to the citizen of the states and especially of those contiguous to the territory neither by intervention of nonresident in election nor by unauthorized military force to attempt to encroach upon or usurp the authority of the inhabitant of the territory
 no citizen of our country should permit himself to forget that he be a part of its government and entitle to be hear in the determination of its policy and its measure and that therefore the high consideration of personal honor and patriotism require he to maintain by whatever of power or influence he may possess the integrity of the law of the republic
 entertain these view it will be my imperative duty to exert the whole power of the federal executive to support public order in the territory to vindicate its law whether federal or local against all attempt of organize resistance and so to protect its people in the establishment of their own institution undisturbe by encroachment from without and in the full enjoyment of the right of self government assure to they by the constitution and the organic act of congress
 although serious and threatening disturbance in the territory of kansas announce to i by the governor in december last be speedily quiet without the effusion of blood and in a satisfactory manner there be i regret to say reason to apprehend that disorder will continue to occur there with increase tendency to violence until some decisive measure be take to dispose of the question itself which constitute the inducement or occasion of internal agitation and of external interference
 this it seem to i can well be accomplish by provide that when the inhabitant of kansas may desire it and shall be of sufficient number to constitute a state a convention of delegate duly elect by the qualified voter shall assemble to frame a constitution and thus to prepare through regular and lawful mean for its admission into the union as a state
 i respectfully recommend the enactment of a law to that effect
 i recommend also that a special appropriation be make to defray any expense which may become requisite in the execution of the law or the maintenance of public order in the territory of kansas

by the president of the united states of america
 a proclamation
 whereas indication exist that public tranquillity and the supremacy of law in the territory of kansas be endanger by the reprehensible act or purpose of person both within and without the same who propose to direct and control its political organization by force it appear that combination have be form therein to resist the execution of the territorial law and thus in effect subvert by violence all present constitutional and legal authority it also appear that person reside without the territory but near its border contemplate armed intervention in the affair thereof it also appear that other person inhabitant of remote states be collect money engage man and provide arm for the same purpose and it far appear that combination within the territory be endeavor by the agency of emissary and otherwise to induce individual states of the union to intervene in the affair thereof in violation of the constitution of the united states and
 whereas all such plan for the determination of the future institution of the territory if carry into action from within the same will constitute the fact of insurrection and if from without that of invasive aggression and will in either case justify and require the forcible interposition of the whole power of the general government as well to maintain the law of the territory as those of the union
 now therefore i franklin pierce president of the united states do issue this my proclamation to command all person engage in unlawful combination against the constitute authority of the territory of kansas or of the united states to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abode and to warn all such person that any attempt insurrection in say territory or aggressive intrusion into the same will be resist not only by the employment of the local militia but also by that of any available force of the united states to the end of assure immunity from violence and full protection to the person property and civil right of all peaceable and law abide inhabitant of the territory
 if in any part of the union the fury of faction or fanaticism inflame into disregard of the great principle of popular sovereignty which under the constitution be fundamental in the whole structure of our institution be to bring on the country the dire calamity of an arbitrament of arm in that territory it shall be between lawless violence on the one side and conservative force on the other wield by legal authority of the general government
 i call on the citizen both of adjoining and of distant states to abstain from unauthorized intermeddling in the local concern of the territory admonish they that its organic law be to be execute with impartial justice that all individual act of illegal interference will incur condign punishment and that any endeavor to intervene by organized force will be firmly withstood
 i invoke all good citizen to promote order by render obedience to the law to seek remedy for temporary evil by peaceful mean to discountenance and repulse the counsel and the instigation of agitator and of disorganizer and to testify their attachment to their country their pride in its greatness their appreciation of the blessing they enjoy and their determination that republican institution shall not fail in their hand by cooperate to uphold the majesty of the law and to vindicate the sanctity of the constitution

 by the president
 w. l. marcy
 secretary of state

fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives
 in consequence of the failure of congress at its recent session to make provision for the support of the army it become imperatively incumbent on i to exercise the power which the constitution confer on the executive for extraordinary occasion and promptly to convene the two houses in order to afford they an opportunity of reconsider a subject of such vital interest to the peace and welfare of the union
 with the exception of a partial authority vest by law in the secretary of war to contract for the supply of clothing and subsistence the army be wholly dependent on the appropriation annually make by congress the omission of congress to act in this respect before the termination of the fiscal year have already cause embarrassment to the service which be overcome only in expectation of appropriation before the close of the present month if the requisite fund be not speedily provide the executive will no long be able to furnish the transportation equipment and munition which be essential to the effectiveness of a military force in the field with no provision for the pay of troop the contract of enlistment would be break and the army must in effect be disband the consequence of which would be so disastrous as to demand all possible effort to avert the calamity
 it be not merely that the officer and enlisted man of the army be to be thus deprive of the pay and emolument to which they be entitle by stand law that the construction of arm at the public armory the repair and construction of ordnance at the arsenal and the manufacture of military clothing and camp equipage must be discontinue and the person connect with this branch of the public service thus be deprive suddenly of the employment essential to their subsistence nor be it merely the waste consequent on the force abandonment of the seaboard fortification and of the interior military post and other establishment and the enormous expense of recruit and reorganize the army and again distribute it over the vast region which it now occupy these be evil which may it be true be repair hereafter by taxis impose on the country but other evil be involve which no expenditure however lavish could remedy in comparison with which local and personal injury or interest sink into insignificance
 a great part of the army be situate on the remote frontier or in the desert and mountain of the interior to discharge large body of man in such place without the mean of regain their home and where few if any could obtain subsistence by honest industry would be to subject they to suffer and temptation with disregard of justice and right most derogatory to the government
 in the territories of washington and oregon numerous band of indians be in arm and be wage a war of extermination against the white inhabitant and although our troop be actively carry on the campaign we have no intelligence as yet of a successful result on the western plain notwithstanding the impose display of military force recently make there and the chastisement inflict on the rebellious tribe other far from be dismay have manifest hostile intention and be guilty of outrage which if not design to provoke a conflict serve to show that the apprehension of it be insufficient wholly to restrain their vicious propensity a strong force in the state of texas have produce a temporary suspension of hostility there but in new mexico incessant activity on the part of the troop be require to keep in check the maraud tribe which infest that territory the hostile indians have not be remove from the state of florida and the withdrawal of the troop therefrom leave that object unaccomplished would be most injurious to the inhabitant and a breach of the positive engagement of the general government
 to refuse supply to the army therefore be to compel the complete cessation of all its operation and its practical disbandment and thus to invite horde of predatory savage from the western plain and the rocky mountains to spread devastation along a frontier of more than 4,000 mile in extent and to deliver up the sparse population of a vast tract of country to rapine and murder
 such in substance would be the direct and immediate effect of the refusal of congress for the first time in the history of the government to grant supply for the maintenance of the army the inevitable waste of million of public treasure the infliction of extreme wrong upon all person connect with the military establishment by service employment or contract the recall of our force from the field the fearful sacrifice of life and incalculable destruction of property on the remote frontier the striking of our national flag on the battlement of the fortress which defend our maritime city against foreign invasion the violation of the public honor and good faith and the discredit of the united states in the eye of the civilized world
 i confidently trust that these consideration and other appertain to the domestic peace of the country which can not fail to suggest themselves to every patriotic mind will on reflection be duly appreciate by both houses of congress and induce the enactment of the requisite provision of law for the support of the army of the united states

fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives the constitution require that the president shall from time to time not only recommend to the consideration of congress such measure as he may judge necessary and expedient but also that he shall give information to they of the state of the union to do this fully involve exposition of all matter in the actual condition of the country domestic or foreign which essentially concern the general welfare while perform his constitutional duty in this respect the president do not speak merely to express personal conviction but as the executive minister of the government enable by his position and call upon by his official obligation to scan with an impartial eye the interest of the whole and of every part of the united states of the condition of the domestic interest of the union its agriculture mine manufacture navigation and commerce it be necessary only to say that the internal prosperity of the country its continuous and steady advancement in wealth and population and in private as well as public well being attest the wisdom of our institution and the predominant spirit of intelligence and patriotism which notwithstanding occasional irregularity of opinion or action result from popular freedom have distinguish and characterize the people of america in the brief interval between the termination of the last and the commencement of the present session of congress the public mind have be occupy with the care of select for another constitutional term the president and vice president of the united states the determination of the person who be of right or contingently to preside over the administration of the government be under our system commit to the states and the people we appeal to they by their voice pronounce in the form of law to call whomsoever they will to the high post of chief magistrate and thus it be that as the senator represent the respective states of the union and the member of the house of representatives the several constituency of each state so the president represent the aggregate population of the united states their election of he be the explicit and solemn act of the sole sovereign authority of the union it be impossible to misapprehend the great principle which by their recent political action the people of the united states have sanction and announce they have assert the constitutional equality of each and all of the states of the union as states they have affirm the constitutional equality of each and all of the citizen of the united states as citizen whatever their religion wherever their birth or their residence they have maintain the inviolability of the constitutional right of the different section of the union and they have proclaim their devoted and unalterable attachment to the union and to the constitution as object of interest superior to all subject of local or sectional controversy as the safeguard of the right of all as the spirit and the essence of the liberty peace and greatness of the republic in do this they have at the same time emphatically condemn the idea of organize in these united states mere geographical party of marshal in hostile array toward each other the different part of the country north or south east or west scheme of this nature fraught with incalculable mischief and which the considerate sense of the people have reject could have have countenance in no part of the country have they not be disguise by suggestion plausible in appearance act upon an excited state of the public mind induce by cause temporary in their character and it be to be hope transient in their influence perfect liberty of association for political object and the wide scope of discussion be the received and ordinary condition of government in our country our institution frame in the spirit of confidence in the intelligence and integrity of the people do not forbid citizen either individually or associate together to attack by writing speech or any other method short of physical force the constitution and the very existence of the union under the shelter of this great liberty and protect by the law and usage of the government they assail association have be form in some of the states of individual who pretend to seek only to prevent the spread of the institution of slavery into the present or future inchoate states of the union be really inflame with desire to change the domestic institution of exist state to accomplish their object they dedicate themselves to the odious task of depreciate the government organization which stand in their way and of calumniate with indiscriminate invective not only the citizen of particular states with whose law they find fault but all other of their fellow citizen throughout the country who do not participate with they in their assault upon the constitution frame and adopt by our father and claim for the privilege it have secure and the blessing it have confer the steady support and grateful reverence of their child they seek an object which they well know to be a revolutionary one they be perfectly aware that the change in the relative condition of the white and black race in the slaveholding states which they would promote be beyond their lawful authority that to they it be a foreign object that it can not be effect by any peaceful instrumentality of theirs that for they and the states of which they be citizen the only path to its accomplishment be through burn city and ravage field and slaughter population and all there be most terrible in foreign complicated with civil and servile war and that the first step in the attempt be the forcible disruption of a country embrace in its broad bosom a degree of liberty and an amount of individual and public prosperity to which there be no parallel in history and substitute in its place hostile government drive at once and inevitably into mutual devastation and fratricidal carnage transform the now peaceful and felicitous brotherhood into a vast permanent camp of armed man like the rival monarchy of europe and asia well know that such and such only be the mean and the consequence of their plan and purpose they endeavor to prepare the people of the united states for civil war by do everything in their power to deprive the constitution and the law of moral authority and to undermine the fabric of the union by appeal to passion and sectional prejudice by indoctrinate its people with reciprocal hatred and by educate they to stand face to face as enemy rather than shoulder to shoulder as friend it be by the agency of such unwarrantable interference foreign and domestic that the mind of many otherwise good citizen have be so inflame into the passionate condemnation of the domestic institution of the southern states as at length to pass insensibly to almost equally passion late hostility toward their fellow citizen of those states and thus finally to fall into temporary fellowship with the avowed and active enemy of the constitution ardently attach to liberty in the abstract they do not stop to consider practically how the object they would attain can be accomplish nor to reflect that even if the evil be as great as they deem it they have no remedy to apply and that it can be only aggravate by their violence and unconstitutional action a question which be one of the most difficult of all the problem of social institution political economy and statesmanship they treat with unreasone intemperance of thought and language extreme beget extreme violent attack from the north find its inevitable consequence in the growth of a spirit of angry defiance at the south thus in the progress of event we have reach that consummation which the voice of the people have now so pointedly rebuke of the attempt of a portion of the states by a sectional organization and movement to usurp the control of the government of the united states i confidently believe that the great body of those who inconsiderately take this fatal step be sincerely attach to the constitution and the union they would upon deliberation shrink with unaffected horror from any conscious act of disunion or civil war but they have enter into a path which lead nowhere unless it be to civil war and disunion and which have no other possible outlet they have proceed thus far in that direction in consequence of the successive stage of their progress having consist of a series of secondary issue each of which profess to be confine within constitutional and peaceful limit but which attempt indirectly what few man be willing to do directly that be to act aggressively against the constitutional right of nearly one half of the thirty one state in the long series of act of indirect aggression the first be the strenuous agitation by citizen of the northern states in congress and out of it of the question of negro emancipation in the southern states the second step in this path of evil consist of act of the people of the northern states and in several instance of their government aim to facilitate the escape of person hold to service in the southern states and to prevent their extradition when reclaim accord to law and in virtue of express provision of the constitution to promote this object legislative enactment and other mean be adopt to take away or defeat right which the constitution solemnly guarantee in order to nullify the then exist act of congress concern the extradition of fugitive from service law be enact in many state forbid their officer under the severe penalty to participate in the execution of any act of congress whatever in this way that system of harmonious cooperation between the authority of the united states and of the several states for the maintenance of their common institution which exist in the early year of the republic be destroy conflict of jurisdiction come to be frequent and congress find itself compel for the support of the constitution and the vindication of its power to authorize the appointment of new officer charge with the execution of its act as if they and the officer of the states be the minister respectively of foreign government in a state of mutual hostility rather than fellow magistrate of a common country peacefully subsist under the protection of one well constitute union thus here also aggression be follow by reaction and the attack upon the constitution at this point do but serve to raise up new barrier for its defense and security the third stage of this unhappy sectional controversy be in connection with the organization of territorial government and the admission of new states into the union when it be propose to admit the state of maine by separation of territory from that of massachusetts and the state of missouri form of a portion of the territory cede by france to the united states representative in congress object to the admission of the latter unless with condition suit to particular view of public policy the imposition of such a condition be successfully resist but at the same period the question be present of impose restriction upon the residue of the territory cede by france that question be for the time dispose of by the adoption of a geographical line of limitation in this connection it should not be forget that when france of her own accord resolve for consideration of the most farsighte sagacity to cede louisiana to the united states and that accession be accept by the united states the latter expressly engage that the inhabitant of the cede territory shall be incorporate in the union of the united states and admit as soon as possible accord to the principle of the federal constitution to the enjoyment of all the right advantage and immunity of citizen of the united states and in the meantime they shall be maintain and protect in the free enjoyment of their liberty property and the religion which they profess that be to say while it remain in a territorial condition its inhabitant be maintain and protect in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property with a right then to pass into the condition of states on a footing of perfect equality with the original state the enactment which establish the restrictive geographical line be acquiesce in rather than approve by the states of the union it stand on the statute book however for a number of year and the people of the respective states acquiesce in the reenactment of the principle as apply to the state of texas and it be propose to acquiesce in its further application to the territory acquire by the united states from mexico but this proposition be successfully resist by the representative from the northern states who regardless of the statute line insist upon apply restriction to the new territory generally whether lie north or south of it thereby repeal it as a legislative compromise and on the part of the north persistently violate the compact if compact there be thereupon this enactment cease to have bind virtue in any sense whether as respect the north or the south and so in effect it be treat on the occasion of the admission of the state of california and the organization of the territories of new mexico utah and washington such be the state of this question when the time arrive for the organization of the territories of kansas and nebraska in the progress of constitutional inquiry and reflection it have now at length come to be see clearly that congress do not possess constitutional power to impose restriction of this character upon any present or future state of the union in a long series of decision on the full argument and after the most deliberate consideration the supreme court of the united states have finally determine this point in every form under which the question could arise whether as affect public or private right in question of the public domain of religion of navigation and of servitude the several states of the union be by force of the constitution coequal in domestic legislative power congress can not change a law of domestic relation in the state of maine no more can it in the state of missouri any statute which propose to do this be a mere nullity it take away no right it confer none if it remain on the statute book unrepeale it remain there only as a monument of error and a beacon of warning to the legislator and the statesman to repeal it will be only to remove imperfection from the statute without affect either in the sense of permission or of prohibition the action of the states or of their citizen still when the nominal restriction of this nature already a dead letter in law be in term repeal by the last congress in a clause of the act organize the territories of kansas and nebraska that repeal be make the occasion of a widespread and dangerous agitation it be allege that the original enactment be a compact of perpetual moral obligation its repeal constitute an odious breach of faith an act of congress while it remain unrepealed more especially if it be constitutionally valid in the judgment of those public functionary whose duty it be to pronounce on that point be undoubtedly bind on the conscience of each good citizen of the republic but in what sense can it be assert that the enactment in question be invest with perpetuity and entitle to the respect of a solemn compact between whom be the compact no distinct contend power of the government no separate section of the union treat as such enter into treaty stipulation on the subject it be a mere clause of an act of congress and like any other controvert matter of legislation receive its final shape and be pass by compromise of the conflict opinion or sentiment of the member of congress but if it have moral authority over man 's conscience to whom do this authority attach not to those of the north who have repeatedly refuse to confirm it by extension and who have zealously strive to establish other and incompatible regulation upon the subject and if as it thus appear the suppose compact have no obligatory force as to the north of course it could not have have any as to the south for all such compact must be mutual and of reciprocal obligation it have not unfrequently happen that lawgiver with undue estimation of the value of the law they give or in the view of impart to it peculiar strength make it perpetual in term but they can not thus bind the conscience the judgment and the will of those who may succeed they invest with similar responsibility and clothe with equal authority more careful investigation may prove the law to be unsound in principle experience may show it to be imperfect in detail and impracticable in execution and then both reason and right combine not merely to justify but to require its repeal the constitution supreme as it be over all the department of the government legislative executive and judicial be open to amendment by its very term and congress or the states may in their discretion propose amendment to it solemn compact though it in truth be between the sovereign states of the union in the present instance a political enactment which have cease to have legal power or authority of any kind be repeal the position assume that congress have no moral right to enact such repeal be strange enough and singularly so in view of the fact that the argument come from those who openly refuse obedience to exist law of the land have the same popular designation and quality as compromise act nay more who unequivocally disregard and condemn the most positive and obligatory injunction of the constitution itself and seek by every mean within their reach to deprive a portion of their fellow citizen of the equal enjoyment of those right and privilege guarantee alike to all by the fundamental compact of our union this argument against the repeal of the statute line in question be accompany by another of congenial character and equally with the former destitute of foundation in reason and truth it be impute that the measure originate in the conception of extend the limit of slave labor beyond those previously assign to it and that such be its natural as well as intended effect and these baseless assumption be make in the northern states the ground of uncease assault upon constitutional right the repeal in term of a statute which be already obsolete and also null for unconstitutionality could have no influence to obstruct or to promote the propagation of conflicting view of political or social institution when the act organize the territories of kansas and nebraska be pass the inherent effect upon that portion of the public domain thus open to legal settlement be to admit settler from all the states of the union alike each with his conviction of public policy and private interest there to found in their discretion subject to such limitation as the constitution and act of congress might prescribe new states hereafter to be admit into the union it be a free field open alike to all whether the statute line of assumed restriction be repeal or not that repeal do not open to free competition of the diverse opinion and domestic institution a field which without such repeal would have be close against they it find that field of competition already open in fact and in law all the repeal do be to relieve the statute book of an objectionable enactment unconstitutional in effect and injurious in term to a large portion of the states be it the fact that in all the unsettled region of the united states if emigration be leave free to act in this respect for itself without legal prohibition on either side slave labor will spontaneously go everywhere in preference to free labor be it the fact that the peculiar domestic institution of the southern states possess relatively so much of vigor that wheresoever an avenue be freely open to all the world they will penetrate to the exclusion of those of the northern states be it the fact that the former enjoy compare with the latter such irresistibly superior vitality independent of climate soil and all other accidental circumstance as to be able to produce the suppose result in spite of the assume moral and natural obstacle to its accomplishment and of the more numerous population of the northern states the argument of those who advocate the enactment of new law of restriction and condemn the repeal of old one in effect aver that their particular view of government have no self extend or self sustain power of their own and will go nowhere unless force by act of congress and if congress do but pause for a moment in the policy of stern coercion if it venture to try the experiment of leave man to judge for themselves what institution will well suit they if it be not strain up to perpetual legislative exertion on this point if congress proceed thus to act in the very spirit of liberty it be at once charge with aim to extend slave labor into all the new territories of the united states of course these imputation on the intention of congress in this respect conceive as they be in prejudice and disseminate in passion be utterly destitute of any justification in the nature of thing and contrary to all the fundamental doctrine and principle of civil liberty and self government while therefore in general the people of the northern states have never at any time arrogate for the federal government the power to interfere directly with the domestic condition of person in the southern states but on the contrary have disavow all such intention and have shrink from conspicuous affiliation with those few who pursue their fanatical object avowedly through the contemplated mean of revolutionary change of the government and with acceptance of the necessary consequence a civil and servile war yet many citizen have suffer themselves to be draw into one evanescent political issue of agitation after another appertain to the same set of opinion and which subside as rapidly as they arise when it come to be see as it uniformly do that they be incompatible with the compact of the constitution and the existence of the union thus when the act of some of the states to nullify the exist extradition law impose upon congress the duty of pass a new one the country be invite by agitator to enter into party organization for its repeal but that agitation speedily cease by reason of the impracticability of its object so when the statute restriction upon the institution of new states by a geographical line have be repeal the country be urge to demand its restoration and that project also die almost with its birth then follow the cry of alarm from the north against imputed southern encroachmeat which cry spring in reality from the spirit of revolutionary attack on the domestic institution of the south and after a troubled existence of a few month have be rebuke by the voice of a patriotic people of this last agitation one lamentable feature be that it be carry on at the immediate expense of the peace and happiness of the people of the territory of kansas that be make the battlefield not so much of oppose faction or interest within itself as of the conflict passion of the whole people of the united states revolutionary disorder in kansas have its origin in project of intervention deliberately arrange by certain member of that congress which enact the law for the organization of the territory and when propagandist colonization of kansas have thus be undertake in one section of the union for the systematic promotion of its peculiar view of policy there ensue as a matter of course a counteraction with opposite view in other section of the union in consequence of these and other incident many act of disorder it be undeniable have be perpetrate in kansas to the occasional interruption rather than the permanent suspension of regular government aggressive and most reprehensible incursion into the territory be undertake both in the north and the south and enter it on its northern border by the way of iowa as well as on the eastern by way of missouri and there have exist within it a state of insurrection against the constituted authority not without countenance from inconsiderate person in each of the great section of the union but the difficulty in that territory have be extravagantly exaggerated for purpose of political agitation elsewhere the number and gravity of the act of violence have be magnify partly by statement entirely untrue and partly by reiterate account of the same rumor or fact thus the territory have be seemingly fill with extreme violence when the whole amount of such act have not be great than what occasionally pass before we in single city to the regret of all good citizen but without be regard as of general or permanent political consequence imputed irregularity in the election have in kansas like occasional irregularity of the same description in the states be beyond the sphere of action of the executive but incident of actual violence or of organized obstruction of law pertinaciously renew from time to time have be meet as they occur by such mean as be available and as the circumstance require and nothing of this character now remain to affect the general peace of the union the attempt of a part of the inhabitant of the territory to erect a revolutionary government though sedulously encourage and supply with pecuniary aid from active agent of disorder in some of the states have completely fail body of armed man foreign to the territory have be prevent from enter or compel to leave it predatory band engage in act of rapine under cover of the exist political disturbance have be arrest or disperse and every well dispose person be now enable once more to devote himself in peace to the pursuit of prosperous industry for the prosecution of which he undertake to participate in the settlement of the territory it afford i unmingled satisfaction thus to announce the peaceful condition of thing in kansas especially consider the mean to which it be necessary to have recourse for the attainment of the end namely the employment of a part of the military force of the united states the withdrawal of that force from its proper duty of defend the country against foreign foe or the savage of the frontier to employ it for the suppression of domestic insurrection be when the exigency occur a matter of the most earnest solicitude on this occasion of imperative necessity it have be do with the good result and my satisfaction in the attainment of such result by such mean be greatly enhance by the consideration that through the wisdom and energy of the present executive of kansas and the prudence firmness and vigilance of the military officer on duty there tranquillity have be restore without one drop of blood having be shed in its accomplishment by the force of the united states the restoration of comparative tranquillity in that territory furnish the mean of observe calmly and appreciate at their just value the event which have occur there and the discussion of which the government of the territory have be the subject we perceive that controversy concern its future domestic institution be inevitable that no human prudence no form of legislation no wisdom on the part of congress could have prevent it it be idle to suppose that the particular provision of their organic law be the cause of agitation those provision be but the occasion or the pretext of an agitation which be inherent in the nature of thing congress legislate upon the subject in such term as be most consonant with the principle of popular sovereignty which underlie our government it could not have legislate otherwise without do violence to another great principle of our institution the imprescriptible right of equality of the several states we perceive also that sectional interest and party passion have be the great impediment to the salutary operation of the organic principle adopt and the chief cause of the successive disturbance in kansas the assumption that because in the organization of the territories of nebraska and kansas congress abstain from impose restraint upon they to which certain other territories have be subject therefore disorder occur in the latter territory be emphatically contradict by the fact that none have occur in the former those disorder be not the consequence in kansas of the freedom of self government concede to that territory by congress but of unjust interference on the part of person not inhabitant of the territory such interference wherever it have exhibit itself by act of insurrectionary character or of obstruction to process of law have be repel or suppress by all the mean which the constitution and the law place in the hand of the executive in those part of the united states where by reason of the inflame state of the public mind false rumor and misrepresentation have the great currency it have be assume that it be the duty of the executive not only to suppress insurrectionary movement in kansas but also to see to the regularity of local election it need little argument to show that the president have no such power all government in the united states rest substantially upon popular election the freedom of election be liable to be impair by the intrusion of unlawful vote or the exclusion of lawful one by improper influence by violence or by fraud but the people of the united states be themselves the all sufficient guardian of their own right and to suppose that they will not remedy in due season any such incident of civil freedom be to suppose they to have cease to be capable of self government the president of the united states have not power to interpose in election to see to their freedom to canvass their vote or to pass upon their legality in the territories any more than in the states if he have such power the government might be republican in form but it would be a monarchy in fact and if he have undertake to exercise it in the case of kansas he would have be justly subject to the charge of usurpation and of violation of the dear right of the people of the united states unwise law equally with irregularity at election be in period of great excitement the occasional incident of even the free and good political institution but all experience demonstrate that in a country like our where the right of self constitution exist in the complete form the attempt to remedy unwise legislation by resort to revolution be totally out of place inasmuch as exist legal institution afford more prompt and efficacious mean for the redress of wrong i confidently trust that now when the peaceful condition of kansas afford opportunity for calm reflection and wise legislation either the legislative assembly of the territory or congress will see that no act shall remain on its statute book violative of the provision of the constitution or subversive of the great object for which that be ordain and establish and will take all other necessary step to assure to its inhabitant the enjoyment without obstruction or abridgment of all the constitutional right privilege and immunity of citizen of the united states as contemplate by the organic law of the territory full information in relation to recent event in this territory will be find in the document communicate herewith from the departments of state and war i refer you to the report of the secretary of the treasury for particular information concern the financial condition of the government and the various branch of the public service connect with the treasury department during the last fiscal year the receipt from custom be for the first time more than $ 64,000,000 and from all source $ 73,918,141 which with the balance on hand up to the 1st of

be pay within a year without embarrass the public service but be not yet due and only redeemable at the option of the holder can not be press to payment by the government on examine the expenditure of the last five year it will be see that the average deduct payment on account of the public debt and $ 10,000,000 pay by treaty to mexico have be but about $ 48,000,000 it be believe that under an economical administration of the government the average expenditure for the ensue five year will not exceed that sum unless extraordinary occasion for its increase should occur the act grant bounty land will soon have be execute while the extension of our frontier settlement will cause a continue demand for land and augmented receipt probably from that source these consideration will justify a reduction of the revenue from custom so as not to exceed forty eight or fifty million dollar i think the exigency for such reduction be imperative and again urge it upon the consideration of congress the amount of reduction as well as the manner of effecting it be question of great and general interest it be essential to industrial enterprise and the public prosperity as well as the dictate of obvious justice that the burden of taxation be make to rest as equally as possible upon all class and all section and interest of the country i have heretofore recommend to your consideration the revision of the revenue law prepare under the direction of the secretary of the treasury and also legislation upon some special question affect the business of that department more especially the enactment of a law to punish the abstraction of official book or paper from the file of the government and require all such book and paper and all other public property to be turn over by the outgoing officer to his successor of a law require disburse officer to deposit all public money in the vault of the treasury or in other legal depository where the same be conveniently accessible and a law to extend exist penal provision to all person who may become possess of public money by deposit or otherwise and who shall refuse or neglect on due demand to pay the same into the treasury i invite your attention anew to each of these object the army during the past year have be so constantly employ against hostile indians in various quarter that it can scarcely be say with propriety of language to have be a peace establishment its duty have be satisfactorily perform and we have reason to expect as a result of the year 's operation great security to the frontier inhabitant than have be hitherto enjoy extensive combination among the hostile indians of the territories of washington and oregon at one time threaten the devastation of the newly form settlement of that remote portion of the country from recent information we be permit to hope that the energetic and successful operation conduct there will prevent such combination in future and secure to those territories an opportunity to make steady progress in the development of their agricultural and mineral resource legislation have be recommend by i on previous occasion to cure defect in the exist organization and to increase the efficiency of the army and further observation have but serve to confirm i in the view then express and to enforce on my mind the conviction that such measure be not only proper but necessary i have in addition to invite the attention of congress to a change of policy in the distribution of troop and to the necessity of provide a more rapid increase of the military armament for detail of these and other subject relate to the army i refer to the report of the secretary of war the condition of the navy be not merely satisfactory but exhibit the most gratifying evidence of increase vigor as it be comparatively small it be more important that it should be as complete as possible in all the element of strength that it should be efficient in the character of its officer in the zeal and discipline of its man in the reliability of its ordnance and in the capacity of its ship in all these various quality the navy have make great progress within the last few year the execution of the law of congress of february 28 1855 to promote the efficiency of the navy have be attend by the most advantageous result the law for promote discipline among the man be find convenient and salutary the system of grant an honorable discharge to faithful seaman on the expiration of the period of their enlistment and permit they to reenlist after a leave of absence of a few month without cessation of pay be highly beneficial in its influence the apprentice system recently adopt be evidently destine to incorporate into the service a large number of our countryman hitherto so difficult to procure several hundred american boy be now on a three year cruise in our national vessel and will return well train seaman in the ordnance department there be a decided and gratifying indication of progress creditable to it and to the country the suggestion of the secretary of the navy in regard to further improvement in that branch of the service i commend to your favorable action the new frigate order by congress be now afloat and two of they in active service they be superior model of naval architecture and with their formidable battery add largely to public strength and security i concur in the view express by the secretary of the department in favor of a still further increase of our naval force the report of the secretary of the interior present fact and view in relation to internal affair over which the supervision of his department extend of much interest and importance the aggregate sale of the public land during the last fiscal year amount to 9,227,878 acre for which have be receive the sum of $ 8,821,414 during the same period there have be locate with military scrip and land warrant and for other purpose 30,100,230 acre thus make a total aggregate of 39,328,108 acre on the 30th of september last survey have be make of 16,873,699 acre a large proportion of which be ready for market the suggestion in this report in regard to the complication and progressive expansion of the business of the different bureaus of the department to the pension system to the colonization of indian tribe and the recommendation in relation to various improvement in the district of columbia be especially commend to your consideration the report of the postmaster general present fully the condition of that department of the government its expenditure for the last fiscal year be $ 10,407,868 and its gross receipt $ 7,620,801 make an excess of expenditure over receipt of $ 2,787,046 the deficiency of this department be thus $ 744,000 great than for the year end june 30 1853 of this deficiency $ 330,000 be to be attribute to the additional compensation allow to postmaster by the act of congress of june 22 1854 the mail facility in every part of the country have be very much increase in that period and the large addition of railroad service amount to 7,908 mile have add largely to the cost of transportation the inconsiderable augmentation of the income of the post office department under the reduce rate of postage and its increase expenditure must for the present make it dependent to some extent upon the treasury for support the recommendation of the postmaster general in relation to the abolition of the franking privilege and his view on the establishment of mail steamship line deserve the consideration of congress i also call the special attention of congress to the statement of the postmaster general respect the sum now pay for the transportation of mail to the panama railroad company and commend to their early and favorable consideration the suggestion of that officer in relation to new contract for mail transportation upon that route and also upon the tehuantepec and nicaragua route the united states continue in the enjoyment of amicable relation with all foreign power when my last annual message be transmit to congress two subject of controversy one relate to the enlistment of soldier in this country for foreign service and the other to central america threaten to disturb the good understanding between the united states and great britain of the progress and termination of the former question you be inform at the time and the other be now in the way of satisfactory adjustment the object of the convention between the united states and great britain of the 19th of april 1850 be to secure for the benefit of all nation the neutrality and the common use of any transit way or interoceanic communication across the isthmus of panama which might be open within the limit of central america the pretension subsequently assert by great britain to dominion or control over territory in or near two of the route those of nicaragua and honduras be deem by the united states not merely incompatible with the main object of the treaty but oppose even to its express stipulation occasion of controversy on this point have be remove by an additional treaty which our minister at london have conclude and which will be immediately submit to the senate for its consideration should the propose supplemental arrangement be concur in by all the party to be affect by it the object contemplate by the original convention will have be fully attain the treaty between the united states and great britain of the 5th of june 1854 which go into effective operation in 1855 put an end to cause of irritation between the two country by secure to the united states the right of fishery on the coast of the british north american provinces with advantage equal to those enjoy by british subject besides the signal benefit of this treaty to a large class of our citizen engage in a pursuit connect to no inconsiderable degree with our national prosperity and strength it have have a favorable effect upon other interest in the provision it make for reciprocal freedom of trade between the united states and the british provinces in america the export of domestic article to those province during the last year amount to more than $ 22,000,000 exceed those of the precede year by nearly $ 7,000,000 and the import therefrom during the same period amount to more than twenty one million an increase of six million upon those of the previous year the improved condition of this branch of our commerce be mainly attributable to the above mention treaty provision be make in the first article of that treaty for a commission to designate the mouth of river to which the common right of fishery on the coast of the united states and the british provinces be not to extend this commission have be employ a part of two season but without much progress in accomplish the object for which it be institute in consequence of a serious difference of opinion between the commissioner not only as to the precise point where the river terminate but in many instance as to what constitute a river these difficulty however may be overcome by resort to the umpirage provide for by the treaty the effort perseveringly prosecute since the commencement of my administration to relieve our trade to the baltic from the exaction of sound due by denmark have not yet be attend with success other government have also seek to obtain a like relief to their commerce and denmark be thus induce to propose an arrangement to all the european power interested in the subject and the manner in which her proposition be receive warrant she to believe that a satisfactory arrangement with they could soon be conclude she make a strong appeal to this government for temporary suspension of definite action on its part in consideration of the embarrassment which might result to her european negotiation by an immediate adjustment of the question with the united states this request have be accede to upon the condition that the sum collect after the 16th of june last and until the 16th of june next from vessel and cargoe belong to our merchant be to be consider as pay under protest and subject to future adjustment there be reason to believe that an arrangement between denmark and the maritime power of europe on the subject will be soon conclude and that the pende negotiation with the united states may then be resume and terminate in a satisfactory manner with spain no new difficulty have arise nor have much progress be make in the adjustment of pende one negotiation enter into for the purpose of relieve our commercial intercourse with the island of cuba of some of its burden and provide for the more speedy settlement of local dispute grow out of that intercourse have not yet be attend with any result soon after the commencement of the late war in europe this government submit to the consideration of all maritime nation two principle for the security of neutral commerce one that the neutral flag should cover enemy good except article contraband of war and the other that neutral property on board merchant vessel of belligerent should be exempt from condemnation with the exception of contraband article these be not present as new rule of international law having be generally claim by neutral though not always admit by belligerent one of the party to the war russia as well as several neutral power promptly accede to these proposition and the two other principal belligerent great britain and france having consent to observe they for the present occasion a favorable opportunity seem to be present for obtain a general recognition of they both in europe and america but great britain and france in common with most of the states of europe while forbear to reject do not affirmatively act upon the overture of the united states while the question be in this position the representative of russia france great britain austria prussia sardinia and turkey assemble at paris take into consideration the subject of maritime right and put forth a declaration contain the two principle which this government have submit nearly two year before to the consideration of maritime power and add thereto the following proposition privateering be and remains abolish and blockade in order to be bind must be effective that be to say maintain by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy and to the declaration thus compose of four point two of which have already be propose by the united states this government have be invite to accede by all the power represent at paris except great britain and turkey to the last of the two additional proposition that in relation to blockade there can certainly be no objection it be merely the definition of what shall constitute the effectual investment of a blockade place a definition for which this government have always contend claim indemnity for loss where a practical violation of the rule thus define have be injurious to our commerce as to the remain article of the declaration of the conference of paris that privateering be and remains abolish i certainly can not ascribe to the power represent in the conference of paris any but liberal and philanthropic view in the attempt to change the unquestionable rule of maritime law in regard to privateering their proposition be doubtless intend to imply approval of the principle that private property upon the ocean although it might belong to the citizen of a belligerent state should be exempt from capture and have that proposition be so frame as to give full effect to the principle it would have receive my ready assent on behalf of the united states but the measure propose be inadequate to that purpose it be true that if adopt private property upon the ocean would be withdraw from one mode of plunder but leave expose meanwhile to another mode which could be use with increase effectiveness the aggressive capacity of great naval power would be thereby augment while the defensive ability of other would be reduce though the surrender of the mean of prosecute hostility by employ privateer as propose by the conference of paris be mutual in term yet in practical effect it would be the relinquishment of a right of little value to one class of state but of essential importance to another and a far large class it ought not to have be anticipate that a measure so inadequate to the accomplishment of the propose object and so unequal in its operation would receive the assent of all maritime power private property would be still leave to the depredation of the public armed cruiser i have express a readiness on the part of this government to accede to all the principle contain in the declaration of the conference of paris provide that the one relate to the abandonment of privateering can be so amend as to effect the object for which as be presume it be intend the immunity of private property on the ocean from hostile capture to effect this object it be propose to add to the declaration that privateering be and remains abolish the follow amendment and that the private property of subject and citizen of a belligerent on the high sea shall be exempt from seizure by the public armed vessel of the other belligerent except it be contraband this amendment have be present not only to the power which have ask our assent to the declaration to abolish privateering but to all other maritime state thus far it have not be reject by any and be favorably entertain by all which have make any communication in reply several of the government regard with favor the proposition of the united states have delay definitive action upon it only for the purpose of consult with other party to the conference of paris i have the satisfaction of state however that the emperor of russia have entirely and explicitly approve of that modification and will cooperate in endeavor to obtain the assent of other power and that assurance of a similar purport have be receive in relation to the disposition of the emperor of the french the present aspect of this important subject allow we to cherish the hope that a principle so humane in its character so just and equal in its operation so essential to the prosperity of commercial nation and so consonant to the sentiment of this enlightened period of the world will command the approbation of all maritime power and thus be incorporate into the code of international law my view on the subject be more fully set forth in the reply of the secretary of state a copy of which be herewith transmit to the communication on the subject make to this government especially to the communication of france the government of the united states have at all time regard with friendly interest the other states of america formerly like this country european colony and now independent member of the great family of nation but the unsettled condition of some of they distract by frequent revolution and thus incapable of regular and firm internal administration have tend to embarrass occasionally our public intercourse by reason of wrong which our citizen suffer at their hand and which they be slow to redress unfortunately it be against the republic of mexico with which it be our special desire to maintain a good understanding that such complaint be most numerous and although earnestly urge upon its attention they have not as yet receive the consideration which this government have a right to expect while reparation for past injury have be withhold other have be add the political condition of that country however have be such as to demand forbearance on the part of the united states i shall continue my effort to procure for the wrong of our citizen that redress which be indispensable to the continue friendly association of the two republic the peculiar condition of affair in nicaragua in the early part of the present year render it important that this government should have diplomatic relation with that state through its territory have be open one of the principal thoroughfare across the isthmus connect north and south america on which a vast amount of property be transport and to which our citizen resort in great number in pass between the atlantic and pacific coast of the united states the protection of both require that the exist power in that state should be regard as a responsible government and its minister be accordingly receive but he remain here only a short time soon thereafter the political affair of nicaragua undergo unfavorable change and become involved in much uncertainty and confusion diplomatic representative from two contend party have be recently send to this government but with the imperfect information possess it be not possible to decide which be the government de facto and await further development i have refuse to receive either question of the most serious nature be pende between the united states and the republic of new granada the government of that republic undertake a year since to impose tonnage duty on foreign vessel in her port but the purpose be resist by this government as be contrary to exist treaty stipulation with the united states and to right confer by charter upon the panama railroad company and be accordingly refurbish at that time it be admit that our vessel be entitle to be exempt from tonnage duty in the free port of panama and aspinwall but the purpose have be recently revive on the part of new granada by the enactment of a law to subject vessel visit her port to the tonnage duty of 40 cent per ton and although the law have not be put in force yet the right to enforce it be still assert and may at any time be act on by the government of that republic the congress of new granada have also enact a law during the last year which levy a tax of more than $ 3 on every pound of mail matter transport across the isthmus the sum thus require to be pay on the mail of the united states would be nearly $ 2,000,000 annually in addition to the large sum payable by contract to the panama railroad company if the only objection to this exaction be the exorbitancy of its amount it could not be submit to by the united states the imposition of it however would obviously contravene our treaty with new granada and infringe the contract of that republic with the panama railroad company the law provide for this tax be by its term to take effect on the 1st of september last but the local authority on the isthmus have be induce to suspend its execution and to await further instruction on the subject from the government of the republic i be not yet advise of the determination of that government if a measure so extraordinary in its character and so clearly contrary to treaty stipulation and the contract right of the panama railroad company compose mostly of american citizen should be persist in it will be the duty of the united states to resist its execution i regret exceedingly that occasion exist to invite your attention to a subject of still graver import in our relation with the republic of new granada on the 15th day of april last a riotous assemblage of the inhabitant of panama commit a violent and outrageous attack on the premise of the railroad company and the passenger and other person in or near the same involve the death of several citizen of the united states the pillage of many other and the destruction of a large amount of property belong to the railroad company i cause full investigation of that event to be make and the result show satisfactorily that complete responsibility for what occur attache to the government of new granada i have therefore demand of that government that the perpetrator of the wrong in question should be punish that provision should be make for the family of citizen of the united states who be kill with full indemnity for the property pillage or destroy the present condition of the isthmus of panama in so far as regard the security of person and property pass over it require serious consideration recent incident tend to show that the local authority can not be rely on to maintain the public peace of panama and there be just ground for apprehension that a portion of the inhabitant be meditate further outrage without adequate measure for the security and protection of person or property having be take either by the state of panama or by the general government of new granada under the guaranty of treaty citizen of the united states have by the outlay of several million dollar construct a railroad across the isthmus and it have become the main route between our atlantic and pacific possession over which multitude of our citizen and a vast amount of property be constantly pass to the security and protection of all which and the continuance of the public advantage involve it be impossible for the government of the united states to be indifferent i have deem the danger of the recurrence of scene of lawless violence in this quarter so imminent as to make it my duty to station a part of our naval force in the harbor of panama and aspinwall in order to protect the person and property of the citizen of the united states in those port and to insure to they safe passage across the isthmus and it would in my judgment be unwise to withdraw the naval force now in those port until by the spontaneous action of the republic of new granada or otherwise some adequate arrangement shall have be make for the protection and security of a line of interoceanic communication so important at this time not to the united states only but to all other maritime state both of europe and america meanwhile negotiation have be institute by mean of a special commission to obtain from new granada full indemnity for injury sustain by our citizen on the isthmus and satisfactory security for the general interest of the united states in address to you my last annual message the occasion seem to i an appropriate one to express my congratulation in view of the peace greatness and felicity which the united states now possess and enjoy to point you to the state of the various departments of the government and of all the great branch of the public service civil and military in order to speak of the intelligence and the integrity which pervade the whole would be to indicate but imperfectly the administrative condition of the country and the beneficial effect of that on the general welfare nor would it suffice to say that the nation be actually at peace at home and abroad that its industrial interest be prosperous that the canvas of its mariner whiten every sea and the plow of its husbandman be march steadily onward to the bloodless conquest of the continent that city and populous state be spring up as if by enchantment from the bosom of oar western wild and that the courageous energy of our people be make of these united states the great republic of the world these result have not be attain without pass through trial and peril by experience of which and thus only nation can harden into manhood our forefather be train to the wisdom which conceive and the courage which achieve independence by the circumstance which surround they and they be thus make capable of the creation of the republic it devolve on the next generation to consolidate the work of the revolution to deliver the country entirely from the influence of conflict transatlantic partiality or antipathy which attach to our colonial and revolutionary history and to organize the practical operation of the constitutional and legal institution of the union to we of this generation remain the not less noble task of maintain and extend the national power we have at length reach that stage of our country 's career in which the danger to be encounter and the exertion to be make be the incident not of weakness but of strength in foreign relation we have to attemper our power to the less happy condition of other republics in america and to place ourselves in the calmness and conscious dignity of right by the side of the great and wealthy of the empires of europe in domestic relation we have to guard against the shock of the discontent the ambition the interest and the exuberant and therefore sometimes irregular impulse of opinion or of action which be the natural product of the present political elevation the self reliance and the restless spirit of enterprise of the people of the united states i shall prepare to surrender the executive trust to my successor and retire to private life with sentiment of profound gratitude to the good providence which during the period of my administration have vouchsafe to carry the country through many difficulty domestic and foreign and which enable i to contemplate the spectacle of amicable and respectful relation between our and all other government and the establishment of constitutional order and tranquillity throughout the union
fellow citizen i appear before you this day to take the solemn oath that i will faithfullyexecute the office of president of the united states and will to the bestof my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the unitedstates in enter upon this great office i must humbly invoke the god of ourfather for wisdom and firmness to execute its high and responsible dutiesin such a manner as to restore harmony and ancient friendship among thepeople of the several states and to preserve our free institution throughoutmany generation convince that i owe my election to the inherent lovefor the constitution and the union which still animate the heart of theamerican people let i earnestly ask their powerful support in sustainingall just measure calculate to perpetuate these the rich politicalblessing which heaven have ever bestow upon any nation having determinednot to become a candidate for reelection i shall have no motive to influencemy conduct in administer the government except the desire ably and faithfullyto serve my country and to live in grateful memory of my countryman we have recently pass through a presidential contest in which thepassion of our fellow citizen be excited to the high degree by questionsof deep and vital importance but when the people proclaim their willthe tempest at once subside and all be calm the voice of the majority speak in the manner prescribe by theconstitution be hear and instant submission follow our own countrycould alone have exhibit so grand and strike a spectacle of the capacityof man for self government what a happy conception then be it for congress to apply this simplerule that the will of the majority shall govern to the settlement ofthe question of domestic slavery in the territories congress be neither"to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate theirdomestic institution in their own way subject only to the constitutionof the united states as a natural consequence congress have also prescribe that when theterritory of kansas shall be admit as a state it shall be receivedinto the union with or without slavery as their constitution may prescribeat the time of their admission a difference of opinion have arise inregard to the point of time when the people of a territory shall decidethis question for themselves this be happily a matter of but little practical importance besides it be a judicial question which legitimately belong to the supreme courtof the united states before whom it be now pende and will it be understand be speedily and finally settle to their decision in common with allgood citizen i shall cheerfully submit whatever this may be thoughit have ever be my individual opinion that under the nebraska kansas actthe appropriate period will be when the number of actual resident in theterritory shall justify the formation of a constitution with a view toit admission as a state into the union but be this as it may it be theimperative and indispensable duty of the government of the united statesto secure to every resident inhabitant the free and independent expressionof his opinion by his vote this sacred right of each individual must bepreserve that be accomplish nothing can be fair than to leavethe people of a territory free from all foreign interference to decidetheir own destiny for themselves subject only to the constitution of theunited states the whole territorial question be thus settle upon the principleof popular sovereignty a principle as ancient as free government itself everythingof a practical nature have be decide no other question remain for adjustment because all agree that under the constitution slavery in the states isbeyond the reach of any human power except that of the respective statesthemselves wherein it exist may we not then hope that the long agitationon this subject be approach its end and that the geographical partiesto which it have give birth so much dread by the father of his country will speedily become extinct most happy will it be for the country whenthe public mind shall be divert from this question to other of morepressing and practical importance throughout the whole progress of thisagitation which have scarcely know any intermission for more than twentyyear whilst it have be productive of no positive good to any human beingit have be the prolific source of great evil to the master to the slave and to the whole country it have alienate and estrange the people ofthe sister states from each other and have even seriously endanger thevery existence of the union nor have the danger yet entirely cease underour system there be a remedy for all mere political evil in the soundsense and sober judgment of the people time be a great corrective politicalsubject which but a few year ago excited and exasperate the public mindhave pass away and be now nearly forget but this question of domesticslavery be of far graver importance than any mere political question becauseshould the agitation continue it may eventually endanger the personal safetyof a large portion of our countryman where the institution exist in thatevent no form of government however admirable in itself and however productiveof material benefit can compensate for the loss of peace and domesticsecurity around the family altar let every union love man therefore exert his good influence to suppress this agitation which since the recentlegislation of congress be without any legitimate object it be an evil omen of the time that man have undertake to calculatethe mere material value of the union reasoned estimate have be presentedof the pecuniary profit and local advantage which would result to differentstate and section from its dissolution and of the comparative injurieswhich such an event would inflict on other state and section even descendingto this low and narrow view of the mighty question all such calculationsare at fault the bare reference to a single consideration will be conclusiveon this point we at present enjoy a free trade throughout our extensiveand expand country such as the world have never witness this tradeis conduct on railroad and canal on noble river and arm of the sea which bind together the north and the south the east and the west ofour confederacy annihilate this trade arrest its free progress by thegeographical line of jealous and hostile states and you destroy the prosperityand onward march of the whole and every part and involve all in one commonruin but such consideration important as they be in themselves sinkinto insignificance when we reflect on the terrific evil which would resultfrom disunion to every portion of the confederacy to the north not morethan to the south to the east not more than to the west these i shallnot attempt to portray because i feel an humble confidence that the kindprovidence which inspire our father with wisdom to frame the most perfectform of government and union ever devise by man will not suffer it toperish until it shall have be peacefully instrumental by its examplein the extension of civil and religious liberty throughout the world next in importance to the maintenance of the constitution and the unionis the duty of preserve the government free from the taint or even thesuspicion of corruption public virtue be the vital spirit of republic and history prove that when this have decay and the love of money hasusurpe its place although the form of free government may remain fora season the substance have depart forever our present financial condition be without a parallel in history nonation have ever before be embarrassed from too large a surplus in itstreasury this almost necessarily give birth to extravagant legislation it produce wild scheme of expenditure and beget a race of speculatorsand jobber whose ingenuity be exert in contrive and promote expedientsto obtain public money the purity of official agent whether rightfullyor wrongfully be suspect and the character of the government suffersin the estimation of the people this be in itself a very great evil the natural mode of relief from this embarrassment be to appropriatethe surplus in the treasury to great national object for which a clearwarrant can be find in the constitution among these i might mention theextinguishment of the public debt a reasonable increase of the navy whichis at present inadequate to the protection of our vast tonnage afloat now great than that of any other nation as well as to the defense ofour extended seacoast it be beyond all question the true principle that no more revenue oughtto be collect from the people than the amount necessary to defray theexpense of a wise economical and efficient administration of the government to reach this point it be necessary to resort to a modification of thetariff and this have i trust be accomplish in such a manner as todo as little injury as may have be practicable to our domestic manufacture especially those necessary for the defense of the country any discriminationagainst a particular branch for the purpose of benefit favor corporation individual or interest would have be unjust to the rest of the communityand inconsistent with that spirit of fairness and equality which oughtto govern in the adjustment of a revenue tariff but the squandering of the public money sink into comparative insignificancea a temptation to corruption when compare with the squandering of thepublic land no nation in the tide of time have ever be bless with so rich andnoble an inheritance as we enjoy in the public land in administeringthis important trust whilst it may be wise to grant portion of they forthe improvement of the remainder yet we should never forget that it isour cardinal policy to reserve these land as much as may be for actualsettler and this at moderate price we shall thus not only good promotethe prosperity of the new states and territories by furnish they ahardy and independent race of honest and industrious citizen but shallsecure home for our child and our child 's child as well as forthose exile from foreign shore who may seek in this country to improvetheir condition and to enjoy the blessing of civil and religious liberty such emigrant have do much to promote the growth and prosperity of thecountry they have prove faithful both in peace and in war after becomingcitizen they be entitle under the constitution and law to be placedon a perfect equality with native bear citizen and in this characterthey should ever be kindly recognize the federal constitution be a grant from the states to congress of certainspecific power and the question whether this grant should be liberallyor strictly construe have more or less divide political party from thebeginne without enter into the argument i desire to state at thecommencement of my administration that long experience and observationhave convince i that a strict construction of the power of the governmentis the only true as well as the only safe theory of the constitution whenever in our past history doubtful power have be exercise by congress these have never fail to produce injurious and unhappy consequence many such instance might be adduce if this be the proper occasion neither be it necessary for the public service to strain the language ofthe constitution because all the great and useful power require fora successful administration of the government both in peace and in war have be grant either in express term or by the plain implication whilst deeply convinced of these truth i yet consider it clear thatunder the war make power congress may appropriate money toward the constructionof a military road when this be absolutely necessary for the defense ofany state or territory of the union against foreign invasion under theconstitution congress have power to declare war to raise and supportarmie to provide and maintain a navy and to call forth the militiato repel invasion thus endow in an ample manner with the war makingpower the corresponding duty be require that the united states shallprotect each of they the states against invasion now how be it possibleto afford this protection to california and our pacific possession exceptby mean of a military road through the territories of the united states over which man and munition of war may be speedily transport from theatlantic states to meet and to repel the invader in the event of a warwith a naval power much strong than our own we should then have no otheravailable access to the pacific coast because such a power would instantlyclose the route across the isthmus of central america it be impossibleto conceive that whilst the constitution have expressly require congressto defend all the states it should yet deny to they by any fair construction the only possible mean by which one of these states can be defend besides the government ever since its origin have be in the constant practiceof construct military road it might also be wise to consider whetherthe love for the union which now animate our fellow citizen on the pacificcoast may not be impair by our neglect or refusal to provide for they in their remote and isolated condition the only mean by which the powerof the states on this side of the rocky mountains can reach they in sufficienttime to protect they against invasion i forbear for the present fromexpresse an opinion as to the wise and most economical mode in whichthe government can lend its aid in accomplish this great and necessarywork i believe that many of the difficulty in the way which now appearformidable will in a great degree vanish as soon as the near and bestroute shall have be satisfactorily ascertain it may be proper that on this occasion i should make some brief remarksin regard to our right and duty as a member of the great family of nation in our intercourse with they there be some plain principle approvedby our own experience from which we should never depart we ought to cultivatepeace commerce and friendship with all nation and this not merely asthe good mean of promote our own material interest but in a spiritof christian benevolence toward our fellow man wherever their lot maybe cast our diplomacy should be direct and frank neither seek to obtainmore nor accept less than be our due we ought to cherish a sacred regardfor the independence of all nation and never attempt to interfere inthe domestic concern of any unless this shall be imperatively requiredby the great law of self preservation to avoid entangle alliance hasbeen a maxim of our policy ever since the day of washington and its wisdom'sno one will attempt to dispute in short we ought to do justice in a kindlyspirit to all nation and require justice from they in return it be our glory that whilst other nation have extend their dominionsby the sword we have never acquire any territory except by fair purchaseor as in the case of texas by the voluntary determination of a brave kindre and independent people to blend their destiny with our own even our acquisition from mexico form no exception unwilling to takeadvantage of the fortune of war against a sister republic we purchasedthese possession under the treaty of peace for a sum which be consideredat the time a fair equivalent our past history forbid that we shall inthe future acquire territory unless this be sanction by the law of justiceand honor act on this principle no nation will have a right to interfereor to complain if in the progress of event we shall still far extendour possession hitherto in all our acquisition the people under theprotection of the american flag have enjoy civil and religious liberty as well as equal and just law and have be content prosperous andhappy their trade with the rest of the world have rapidly increase andthus every commercial nation have share largely in their successful progress i shall now proceed to take the oath prescribe by the constitution whilst humbly invoke the blessing of divine providence on this greatpeople
fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives in obedience to the command of the constitution it have now become my duty to give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measure as i judge to be necessary and expedient "but first and above all our thank be due to almighty god for the numerous benefit which he have bestow upon this people and our united prayer ought to ascend to he that he would continue to bless our great republic in time to come as he have bless it in time past since the adjournment of the last congress our constituent have enjoy an unusual degree of health the earth have yield her fruit abundantly and have bountifully reward the toil of the husbandman our great staple have command high price and up till within a brief period our manufacturing mineral and mechanical occupation have largely partake of the general prosperity we have possess all the element of material wealth in rich abundance and yet notwithstanding all these advantage our country in its monetary interest be at the present moment in a deplorable condition in the midst of unsurpassed plenty in all the production of agriculture and in all the element of national wealth we find our manufacture suspend our public work retard our private enterprise of different kind abandon and thousand of useful laborer throw out of employment and reduce to want the revenue of the government which be chiefly derive from duty on import from abroad have be greatly reduce whilst the appropriation make by congress at its last session for the current fiscal year be very large in amount under these circumstance a loan may be require before the close of your present session but this although deeply to be regret would prove to be only a slight misfortune when compare with the suffering and distress prevail among the people with this the government can not fail deeply to sympathize though it may be without the power to extend relief it be our duty to inquire what have produce such unfortunate result and whether their recurrence can be prevent in all former revulsion the blame might have be fairly attribute to a variety of cooperate cause but not so upon the present occasion it be apparent that our exist misfortune have proceed solely from our extravagant and vicious system of paper currency and bank credit excite the people to wild speculation and gambling in stock these revulsion must continue to recur at successive interval so long as the amount of the paper currency and bank loan and discount of the country shall be leave to the discretion of 1,400 irresponsible banking institution which from the very law of their nature will consult the interest of their stockholder rather than the public welfare the framer of the constitution when they give to congress the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and prohibit the states from coin money emit bill of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debt suppose they have protect the people against the evil of an excessive and irredeemable paper currency they be not responsible for the exist anomaly that a government endow with the sovereign attribute of coin money and regulate the value thereof should have no power to prevent other from drive this coin out of the country and fill up the channel of circulation with paper which do not represent gold and silver it be one of the high and most responsible duty of government to insure to the people a sound circulate medium the amount of which ought to be adapt with the utmost possible wisdom and skill to the want of internal trade and foreign exchange if this be either greatly above or greatly below the proper standard the marketable value of every man 's property be increase or diminish in the same proportion and injustice to individual as well as incalculable evil to the community be the consequence unfortunately under the construction of the federal constitution which have now prevail too long to be change this important and delicate duty have be dissever from the coin power and virtually transfer to more than 1,400 state bank act independently of each other and regulate their paper issue almost exclusively by a regard to the present interest of their stockholder exercise the sovereign power of provide a paper currency instead of coin for the country the first duty which these bank owe to the public be to keepin their vault a sufficient amount of gold and silver to insure the convertibility of their note into coin at all time and under all circumstance no bank ought ever to be charter without such restriction on its business as to secure this result all other restriction be comparatively vain this be the only true touchstone the only efficient regulator of a paper currency the only one which can guard the public against overissue and bank suspension as a collateral and eventual security it be doubtless wise and in all case ought to be require that bank shall hold an amount of united states or state security equal to their note in circulation and pledge for their redemption this however furnish no adequate security against overissue on the contrary it may be pervert to inflate the currency indeed it be possible by this mean to convert all the debt of the united states and state governments into bank note without reference to the specie require to redeem they however valuable these security may be in themselves they can not be convert into gold and silver at the moment of pressure as our experience teach in sufficient time to prevent bank suspension and the depreciation of bank note in england which be to a considerable extent a paper money country though vastly behind our own in this respect it be deem advisable anterior to the act of parliament of 1844 which wisely separate the issue of note from the banking department for the bank of england always to keep on hand gold and silver equal to one third of its combine circulation and deposit if this proportion be no more than sufficient to secure the convertibility of its note with the whole of great britain and to some extent the continent of europe as a field for its circulation render it almost impossible that a sudden and immediate run to a dangerous amount should be make upon it the same proportion would certainly be insufficient under our banking system each of our 1,400 bank have but a limited circumference for its circulation and in the course of a very few day the depositor and note holder might demand from such a bank a sufficient amount in specie to compel it to suspend even although it have coin in its vault equal to one third of its immediate liability and yet i be not aware with the exception of the bank of louisiana that any state bank throughout the union have be require by its charter to keep this or any other proportion of gold and silver compare with the amount of its combine circulation and deposit what have be the consequence in a recent report make by the treasury department on the condition of the bank throughout the different state accord to return date near to january 1857 the aggregate amount of actual specie in their vault be $ 58,349,838 of their circulation $ 214,778,822 and of their deposit $ 230,351,352 thus it appear that these bank in the aggregate have considerably less than one dollar in seven of gold and silver compare with their circulation and deposit it be palpable therefore that the very first pressure must drive they to suspension and deprive the people of a convertible currency with all its disastrous consequence it be truly wonderful that they should have so long continue to preserve their credit when a demand for the payment of one seventh of their immediate liability would have drive they into insolvency and this be the condition of the bank notwithstanding that four hundred million of gold from california have flow in upon we within the last eight year and the tide still continue to flow indeed such have be the extravagance of bank credit that the bank now hold a considerably less amount of specie either in proportion to their capital or to their circulation and deposit combine than they do before the discovery of gold in california whilst in the year 1848 their specie in proportion to their capital be more than equal to one dollar for four and a half in 1857 it do not amount to one dollar for every six dollar and thirty three cent of their capital in the year 1848 the specie be equal within a very small fraction to one dollar in five of their circulation and deposit in 1857 it be not equal to one dollar in seven and a half of their circulation and deposit from this statement it be easy to account for our financial history for the last forty year it have be a history of extravagant expansion in the business of the country follow by ruinous contraction at successive interval the good and most enterprising man have be tempt to their ruin by excessive bank loan of mere paper credit excite they to extravagant importation of foreign good wild speculation and ruinous and demoralize stock gambling when the crisis arrive as arrive it must the bank can extend no relief to the people in a vain struggle to redeem their liability in specie they be compel to contract their loan and their issue and at last in the hour of distress when their assistance be most need they and their debtor together sink into insolvency it be this paper system of extravagant expansion raise the nominal price of every article far beyond its real value when compare with the cost of similar article in country whose circulation be wisely regulate which have prevent we from compete in our own market with foreign manufacturer have produce extravagant importation and have counteract the effect of the large incidental protection afford to our domestic manufacture by the present revenue tariff but for this the branch of our manufacture compose of raw material the production of our own country such as cotton iron and woolen fabric would not only have acquire almost exclusive possession of the home market but would have create for themselves a foreign market throughout the world deplorable however as may be our present financial condition we may yet indulge in bright hope for the future no other nation have ever exist which could have endure such violent expansion and contraction of paper credit without last injury yet the buoyancy of youth the energy of our population and the spirit which never quail before difficulty will enable we soon to recover from our present financial embarrassment and may even occasion we speedily to forget the lesson which they have teach in the meantime it be the duty of the government by all proper mean within its power to aid in alleviate the suffering of the people occasion by the suspension of the bank and to provide against a recurrence of the same calamity unfortunately in either aspect of the ease it can do but little thank to the independent treasury the government have not suspend payment as it be compel to do by the failure of the bank in 1837 it will continue to discharge its liability to the people in gold and silver its disbursement in coin will pass into circulation and materially assist in restore a sound currency from its high credit should we be compel to make a temporary loan it can be effect on advantageous term this however shall if possible be avoid but if not then the amount shall be limit to the low practicable sum i have therefore determine that whilst no useful government work already in progress shall be suspend new work not already commence will be postpone if this can be do without injury to the country those necessary for its defense shall proceed as though there have be no crisis in our monetary affair but the federal government can not do much to provide against a recurrence of exist evil even if insurmountable constitutional objection do not exist against the creation of a national bank this would furnish no adequate preventive security the history of the last bank of the united states abundantly prove the truth of this assertion such a bank could not if it would regulate the issue and credit of 1,400 state bank in such a manner as to prevent the ruinous expansion and contraction in our currency which afflict the country throughout the existence of the late bank or secure we against future suspension in 1825 an effort be make by the bank of england to curtail the issue of the country bank under the most favorable circumstance the paper currency have be expand to a ruinous extent and the bank put forth all its power to contract it in order to reduce price and restore the equilibrium of the foreign exchange it accordingly commence a system of curtailment of its loan and issue in the vain hope that the joint stock and private bank of the kingdom would be compel to follow its example it find however that as it contract they expand and at the end of the process to employ the language of a very high official authority whatever reduction of the paper circulation be effect by the bank of england in 1825 be more than make up by the issue of the country bank "but a bank of the united states would not if it could restrain the issue and loan of the state bank because its duty as a regulator of the currency must often be in direct conflict with the immediate interest of its stockholder if we expect one agent to restrain or control another their interest must at least in some degree be antagonistic but the director of a bank of the united states would feel the same interest and the same inclination with the director of the state bank to expand the currency to accommodate their favorite and friend with loan and to declare large dividend such have be our experience in regard to the last bank after all we must mainly rely upon the patriotism and wisdom of the states for the prevention and redress of the evil if they will afford we a real specie basis for our paper circulation by increase the denomination of bank note first to twenty and afterwards to fifty dollar if they will require that the bank shall at all time keep on hand at least one dollar of gold and silver for every three dollar of their circulation and deposit and if they will provide by a self execute enactment which nothing can arrest that the moment they suspend they shall go into liquidation i believe that such provision with a weekly publication by each bank of a statement of its condition would go far to secure we against future suspension of specie payment congress in my opinion possess the power to pass a uniform bankrupt law applicable to all banking institution throughout the united states and i strongly recommend its exercise this would make it the irreversible organic law of each bank 's existence that a suspension of specie payment shall produce its civil death the instinct of self preservation would then compel it to perform its duty in such a manner as to escape the penalty and preserve its life the existence of bank and the circulation of bank paper be so identify with the habit of our people that they can not at this day be suddenly abolish without much immediate injury to the country if we could confine they to their appropriate sphere and prevent they from administer to the spirit of wild and reckless speculation by extravagant loan and issue they might be continue with advantage to the public but this i say after long and much reflection if experience shall prove it to be impossible to enjoy the facility which well regulate bank might afford without at the same time suffer the calamity which the excess of the bank have hitherto inflict upon the country it would then be far the less evil to deprive they altogether of the power to issue a paper currency and confine they to the function of bank of deposit and discount our relation with foreign government be upon the whole in a satisfactory condition the diplomatic difficulty which exist between the government of the united states and that of great britain at the adjournment of the last congress have be happily terminate by the appointment of a british minister to this country who have be cordially receive whilst it be greatly to the interest as i be convinced it be the sincere desire of the government and people of the two country to be on term of intimate friendship with each other it have be our misfortune almost always to have have some irritating if not dangerous outstanding question with great britain since the origin of the government we have be employ in negotiate treaty with that power and afterwards in discuss their true intent and meaning in this respect the convention of april 19 1850 commonly call the clayton and bulwer treaty have be the most unfortunate of all because the two government place directly opposite and contradictory construction upon its first and most important article whilst in the united states we believe that this treaty would place both power upon an exact equality by the stipulation that neither will ever occupy or fortify or colonize or assume or exercise any dominion over any part of central america it be contend by the british government that the true construction of this language have leave they in the rightful possession of all that portion of central america which be in their occupancy at the date of the treaty in fact that the treaty be a virtual recognition on the part of the united states of the right of great britain either as owner or protector to the whole extensive coast of central america sweeping round from the rio hondo to the port and harbor of san juan de nicaragua together with the adjacent bay islands except the comparatively small portion of this between the sarstoon and cape honduras accord to their construction the treaty do no more than simply prohibit they from extend their possession in central america beyond the present limit it be not too much to assert that if in the united states the treaty have be consider susceptible of such a construction it never would have be negotiate under the authority of the president nor would it have receive the approbation of the senate the universal conviction in the united states be that when our government consent to violate its traditional and time honor policy and to stipulate with a foreign government never to occupy or acquire territory in the central american portion of our own continent the consideration for this sacrifice be that great britain should in this respect at least be place in the same position with ourselves whilst we have no right to doubt the sincerity of the british government in their construction of the treaty it be at the same time my deliberate conviction that this construction be in opposition both to its letter and its spirit under the late administration negotiation be institute between the two government for the purpose if possible of remove these difficulty and a treaty have this laudable object in view be sign at london on the 17th october 1856 and be submit by the president to the senate on the follow 10th of december whether this treaty either in its original or amend form would have accomplish the object intend without give birth to new and embarrassing complication between the two government may perhaps be well question certain it be however it be render much less objectionable by the different amendment make to it by the senate the treaty as amend be ratify by i on the 12th march 1857 and be transmit to london for ratification by the british government that government express its willingness to concur in all the amendment make by the senate with the single exception of the clause relate to ruatan and the other island in the bay of honduras the article in the original treaty as submit to the senate after recite that these island and their inhabitant having be by a convention bear date the 27th day of august 1856 between her britannic majesty and the republic of honduras constitute and declare a free territory under the sovereignty of the say republic of honduras stipulate that the two contracting party do hereby mutually engage to recognize and respect in all future time the independence and right of the say free territory as a part of the republic of honduras "upon an examination of this convention between great britain and honduras of the 27th august 1856 it be find that whilst declare the bay islands to be a free territory under the sovereignty of the republic of honduras it deprive that republic of right without which its sovereignty over they could scarcely be say to exist it divide they from the remainder of honduras and give to their inhabitant a separate government of their own with legislative executive and judicial officer elect by themselves it deprive the government of honduras of the tax power in every form and exempt the people of the island from the performance of military duty except for their own exclusive defense it also prohibit that republic from erect fortification upon they for their protection thus leave they open to invasion from any quarter and finally it provide that slavery shall not at any time hereafter be permit to exist therein "had honduras ratify this convention she would have ratify the establishment of a state substantially independent within her own limit and a state at all time subject to british influence and control moreover have the united states ratify the treaty with great britain in its original form we should have be bind to recognize and respect in all future time these stipulation to the prejudice of honduras be in direct opposition to the spirit and meaning of the clayton and bulwer treaty as understand in the united states the senate reject the entire clause and substitute in its stead a simple recognition of the sovereign right of honduras to these island in the following language the two contracting party do hereby mutually engage to recognize and respect the island of ruatan bonaco utila barbaretta helena and moral situate in the bay of honduras and off the coast of the republic of honduras as under the sovereignty and as part of the say republic of honduras great britain reject this amendment assign as the only reason that the ratification of the convention of the 27th august 1856 between she and honduras have not be exchange owe to the hesitation of that government have this be do it be state that her majesty 's government would have have little difficulty in agree to the modification propose by the senate which then would have have in effect the same signification as the original wording whether this would have be the effect whether the mere circumstance of the exchange of the ratification of the british convention with honduras prior in point of time to the ratification of our treaty with great britain would in effect have have the same signification as the original wording and thus have nullify the amendment of the senate may well be doubt it be perhaps fortunate that the question have never arise the british government immediately after reject the treaty as amend propose to enter into a new treaty with the united states similar in all respect to the treaty which they have just refuse to ratify if the united states would consent to add to the senate 's clear and unqualified recognition of the sovereignty of honduras over the bay islands the follow conditional stipulation whenever and so soon as the republic of honduras shall have conclude and ratify a treaty with great britain by which great britain shall have cede and the republic of honduras shall have accept the say island subject to the provision and condition contain in such treaty this proposition be of course reject after the senate have refuse to recognize the british convention with honduras of the 27th august 1856 with full knowledge of its content it be impossible for i necessarily ignorant of the provision and condition which might be contain in a future convention between the same party to sanction they in advance the fact be that when two nation like great britain and the united states mutually desirous as they be and i trust ever may be of maintain the most friendly relation with each other have unfortunately conclude a treaty which they understand in sense directly opposite the wise course be to abrogate such a treaty by mutual consent and to commence anew have this be do promptly all difficulty in central america would most probably ere this have be adjust to the satisfaction of both party the time spend in discuss the meaning of the clayton and bulwer treaty would have be devote to this praiseworthy purpose and the task would have be the more easily accomplish because the interest of the two country in central america be identical be confine to secure safe transit over all the route across the isthmus whilst entertain these sentiment i shall nevertheless not refuse to contribute to any reasonable adjustment of the central american question which be not practically inconsistent with the american interpretation of the treaty overture for this purpose have be recently make by the british government in a friendly spirit which i cordially reciprocate but whether this renew effort will result in success i be not yet prepared to express an opinion a brief period will determine with france our ancient relation of friendship still continue to exist the french government have in several recent instance which need not be enumerate evince a spirit of good will and kindness toward our country which i heartily reciprocate it be notwithstanding much to be regret that two nation whose production be of such a character as to invite the most extensive exchange and free commercial intercourse should continue to enforce ancient and obsolete restriction of trade against each other our commercial treaty with france be in this respect an exception from our treaty with all other commercial nation it jealously levy discriminate duty both on tonnage and on article the growth produce or manufacture of the one country when arrive in vessel belong to the other more than forty year ago on the 3d march 1815 congress pass an act offer to all nation to admit their vessel laden with their national production into the port of the united states upon the same term with our own vessel provide they would reciprocate to we similar advantage this act confine the reciprocity to the production of the respective foreign nation who might enter into the propose arrangement with the united states the act of may 24 1828 remove this restriction and offer a similar reciprocity to all such vessel without reference to the origin of their cargo upon these principle our commercial treaty and arrangement have be round except with france and let we hope that this exception may not long exist our relation with russia remain as they have ever be on the most friendly footing the present emperor as well as his predecessor have never fail when the occasion offer to manifest their good will to our country and their friendship have always be highly appreciate by the government and people of the united states with all other european government except that of spain our relation be as peaceful as we could desire i regret to say that no progress whatever have be make since the adjournment of congress toward the settlement of any of the numerous claim of our citizen against the spanish government besides the outrage commit on our flag by the spanish war frigate ferrolana on the high sea off the coast of cuba in march 1855 by fire into the american mail steam el dorado and detain and search she remain unacknowledged and unredressed the general tone and temper of the spanish government toward that of the united states be much to be regret our present envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to madrid have ask to be recall and it be my purpose to send out a new minister to spain with special instruction on all question pende between the two government and with a determination to have they speedily and amicably adjust if this be possible in the meantime whenever our minister urge the just claim of our citizen on the notice of the spanish government he be meet with the objection that congress have never make the appropriation recommend by president polk in his annual message of december 1847 to be pay to the spanish government for the purpose of distribution among the claimant in the amistad case a similar recommendation be make by my immediate predecessor in his message of december 1853 and entirely concur with both in the opinion that this indemnity be justly due under the treaty with spain of the 27th of october 1795 i earnestly recommend such an appropriation to the favorable consideration of congress a treaty of friendship and commerce be conclude at constantinople on the 13th december 1856 between the united states and persia the ratification of which be exchange at constantinople on the 13th june 1857 and the treaty be proclaim by the president on the 18th august 1857 this treaty it be believe will prove beneficial to american commerce the shah have manifest an earnest disposition to cultivate friendly relation with our country and have express a strong wish that we should be represent at teheran by a minister plenipotentiary and i recommend that an appropriation be make for this purpose recent occurrence in china have be unfavorable to a revision of the treaty with that empire of the 3d july 1844 with a view to the security and extension of our commerce the twenty fourth article of this treaty stipulate for a revision of it in case experience should prove this to be requisite in which case the two government will at the expiration of twelve year from the date of say convention treat amicably concern the same by mean of suitable person appoint to conduct such negotiation these twelve year expire on the 3d july 1856 but long before that period it be ascertain that important change in the treaty be necessary and several fruitless attempt be make by the commissioner of the united states to effect these change another effort be about to be make for the same purpose by our commissioner in conjunction with the minister of england and france but this be suspend by the occurrence of hostility in the canton river between great britain and the chinese empire these hostility have necessarily interrupt the trade of all nation with canton which be now in a state of blockade and have occasion a serious loss of life and property meanwhile the insurrection within the empire against the exist imperial dynasty still continue and it be difficult to anticipate what will be the result under these circumstance i have deem it advisable to appoint a distinguished citizen of pennsylvania envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to proceed to china and to avail himself of any opportunity which may offer to effect change in the exist treaty favorable to american commerce he leave the united states for the place of his destination in july last in the war steamer minnesota special minister to china have also be appoint by the government of great britain and france whilst our minister have be instruct to occupy a neutral position in reference to the exist hostility at canton he will cordially cooperate with the british and french minister in all peaceful measure to secure by treaty stipulation those just concession to commerce which the nation of the world have a right to expect and which china can not long be permit to withhold from assurance receive i entertain no doubt that the three minister will act in harmonious concert to obtain similar commercial treaty for each of the power they represent we can not fail to feel a deep interest in all that concern the welfare of the independent republics on our own continent as well as of the empire of brazil our difficulty with new granada which a short time since bore so threaten an aspect be it be to be hope in a fair train of settlement in a manner just and honorable to both party the isthmus of central america include that of panama be the great highway between the atlantic and pacific over which a large portion of the commerce of the world be destine to pass the united states be more deeply interested than any other nation in preserve the freedom and security of all the communication across this isthmus it be our duty therefore to take care that they shall not be interrupt either by invasion from our own country or by war between the independent states of central america under our treaty with new granada of the 12th december 1846 we be bind to guarantee the neutrality of the isthmus of panama through which the panama railroad pass as well as the right of sovereignty and property which new granada have and possess over the said territory this obligation be round upon equivalent grant by the treaty to the government and people of the united states under these circumstance i recommend to congress the passage of an act authorize the president in case of necessity to employ the land and naval force of the united states to carry into effect this guaranty of neutrality and protection i also recommend similar legislation for the security of any other route across the isthmus in which we may acquire an interest by treaty with the independent republic on this continent it be both our duty and our interest to cultivate the most friendly relation we can never feel indifferent to their fate and must always rejoice in their prosperity unfortunately both for they and for we our example and advice have lose much of their influence in consequence of the lawless expedition which have be fit out against some of they within the limit of our country nothing be well calculate to retard our steady material progress or impair our character as a nation than the toleration of such enterprise in violation of the law of nation it be one of the first and high duty of any independent state in its relation with the member of the great family of nation to restrain its people from act of hostile aggression against their citizen or subject the most eminent writer on public law do not hesitate to denounce such hostile act as robbery and murder weak and feeble state like those of central america may not feel themselves able to assert and vindicate their right the case would be far different if expedition be set on foot within our own territory to make private war against a powerful nation if such expedition be fit out from abroad against any portion of our own country to burn down our city murder and plunder our people and usurp our government we should call any power on earth to the strict account for not prevent such enormity ever since the administration of general washington act of congress have be enforce to punish severely the crime of set on foot a military expedition within the limit of the united states to proceed from thence against a nation or state with whom we be at peace the present neutrality act of april 20 1818 be but little more than a collection of preexist law under this act the president be empower to employ the land and naval force and the militia for the purpose of prevent the carrying on of any such expedition or enterprise from the territory and jurisdiction of the united states and the collector of custom be authorize and require to detain any vessel in port when there be reason to believe she be about to take part in such lawless enterprise when it be first render probable that an attempt would be make to get up another unlawful expedition against nicaragua the secretary of state issue instruction to the marshal and district attorney which be direct by the secretaries of war and the navy to the appropriate army and navy officer require they to be vigilant and to use their good exertion in carry into effect the provision of the act of 1818 notwithstanding these precaution the expedition have escape from our shore such enterprise can do no possible good to the country but have already inflict much injury both on its interest and its character they have prevent peaceful emigration from the united states to the states of central america which could not fail to prove highly beneficial to all the party concern in a pecuniary point of view alone our citizen have sustain heavy loss from the seizure and closing of the transit route by the san juan between the two ocean the leader of the recent expedition be arrest at new orleans but be discharge on give bail for his appearance in the insufficient sum of $ 2,000.i commend the whole subject to the serious attention of congress believe that our duty and our interest as well as our national character require that we should adopt such measure as will be effectual in restrain our citizen from commit such outrage i regret to inform you that the president of paraguay have refuse to ratify the treaty between the united states and that state as amend by the senate the signature of which be mention in the message of my predecessor to congress at the opening of its session in december 1853 the reason assign for this refusal will appear in the correspondence herewith submit it be desirable to ascertain the fitness of the river la plata and its tributary for navigation by steam the united states steamer water witch be send thither for that purpose in 1853 this enterprise be successfully carry on until february 1855 when whilst in the peaceful prosecution of her voyage up the parana river the steamer be fire upon by a paraguayan fort the fire be return but as the water witch be of small force and not design for offensive operation she retire from the conflict the pretext upon which the attack be make be a decree of the president of paraguay of october 1854 prohibit foreign vessel of war from navigate the river of that state as paraguay however be the owner of but one bank of the river of that name the other belong to corientes a state of the argentine confederation the right of its government to expect that such a decree would be obey can not be acknowledge but the water witch be not properly speak a vessel of war she be a small steamer engage in a scientific enterprise intend for the advantage of commercial state generally under these circumstance i be constrain to consider the attack upon she as unjustifiable and as call for satisfaction from the paraguayan government citizen of the united states also who be establish in business in paraguay have have their property seize and take from they and have otherwise be treat by the authority in an insulting and arbitrary manner which require redress a demand for these purpose will be make in a firm but conciliatory spirit this will the more probably be grant if the executive shall have authority to use other mean in the event of a refusal this be accordingly recommend it be unnecessary to state in detail the alarming condition of the territory of kansas at the time of my inauguration the oppose party then stand in hostile array against each other and any accident might have relighte the flame of civil war besides at this critical moment kansas be leave without a governor by the resignation of governor geary on the 19th of february previous the territorial legislature have pass a law provide for the election of delegate on the third monday of june to a convention to meet on the first monday of september for the purpose of frame a constitution preparatory to admission into the union this law be in the main fair and just and it be to be regret that all the qualified elector have not register themselves and vote under its provision at the time of the election for delegate an extensive organization exist in the territory whose avow object it be if need be to put down the lawful government by force and to establish a government of their own under the so call topeka constitution the person attach to this revolutionary organization abstain from take any part in the election the act of the territorial legislature have omit to provide for submit to the people the constitution which might be frame by the convention and in the excited state of public feeling throughout kansas an apprehension extensively prevail that a design exist to force upon they a constitution in relation to slavery against their will in this emergency it become my duty as it be my unquestionable right have in view the union of all good citizen in support of the territorial law to express an opinion on the true construction of the provision concern slavery contain in the organic act of congress of the 30th may 1854 congress declare it to be the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institution in their own way under it kansas when admit as a state be to be receive into the union with or without slavery as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission "did congress mean by this language that the delegate elect to frame a constitution should have authority finally to decide the question of slavery or do they intend by leave it to the people that the people of kansas themselves should decide this question by a direct vote on this subject i confess i have never entertain a serious doubt and therefore in my instruction to governor walker of the 28th march last i merely say that when a constitution shall be submit to the people of the territory they must be protect in the exercise of their right of voting for or against that instrument and the fair expression of the popular will must not be interrupt by fraud or violence "in express this opinion it be far from my intention to interfere with the decision of the people of kansas either for or against slavery from this i have always carefully abstain intrust with the duty of take care that the law be faithfully execute my only desire be that the people of kansas should furnish to congress the evidence require by the organic act whether for or against slavery and in this manner smooth their passage into the union in emerge from the condition of territorial dependence into that of a sovereign state it be their duty in my opinion to make known their will by the vote of the majority on the direct question whether this important domestic institution should or should not continue to exist indeed this be the only possible mode in which their will could be authentically ascertain the election of delegate to a convention must necessarily take place in separate district from this cause it may readily happen as have often be the case that a majority of the people of a state or territory be on one side of a question whilst a majority of the representative from the several district into which it be divide may be upon the other side this arise front the fact that in some district delegate may be elect by small majority whilst in other those of different sentiment may receive majority sufficiently great not only to overcome the vote give for the former but to leave a large majority of the whole people in direct opposition to a majority of the delegate besides our history prove that influence may be bring to bear on the representative sufficiently powerful to induce he to disregard the will of his constituent the truth be that no other authentic and satisfactory mode exist of ascertain the will of a majority of the people of any state or territory on an important and exciting question like that of slavery in kansas except by leave it to a direct vote how wise then be it for congress to pass over all subordinate and intermediate agency and proceed directly to the source of all legitimate power under our institutions!how vain would any other principle prove in practice this may be illustrate by the case of kansas should she be admit into the union with a constitution either maintain or abolish slavery against the sentiment of the people this could have no other effect than to continue and to exasperate the exist agitation during the brief period require to make the constitution conform to the irresistible will of the majority the friend and supporter of the nebraska and kansas act when struggle on a recent occasion to sustain its wise provision before the great tribunal of the american people never differed about its true meaning on this subject everywhere throughout the union they publicly pledge their faith and their honor that they would cheerfully submit the question of slavery to the decision of the bona fide people of kansas without any restriction or qualification whatever all be cordially unite upon the great doctrine of popular sovereignty which be the vital principle of our free institution have it then be insinuate from any quarter that it would be a sufficient compliance with the requisition of the organic law for the member of a convention thereafter to be elect to withhold the question of slavery from the people and to substitute their own will for that of a legally ascertain majority of all their constituent this would have be instantly reject everywhere they remain true to the resolution adopt on a celebrate occasion recognize the right of the people of all the territories include kansas and nebraska act through the legally and fairly express will of a majority of actual resident and whenever the number of their inhabitant justify it to form a constitution with or without slavery and be admit into the union upon term of perfect equality with the other states "the convention to frame a constitution for kansas meet on the first monday of september last they be call together by virtue of an act of the territorial legislature whose lawful existence have be recognize by congress in different form and by different enactment a large proportion of the citizen of kansas do not think proper to register their name and to vote at the election for delegate but an opportunity to do this having be fairly afford their refusal to avail themselves of their right could in no manner affect the legality of the convention this convention proceed to frame a constitution for kansas and finally adjourn on the 7th day of november but little difficulty occur in the convention except on the subject of slavery the truth be that the general provision of our recent state constitution be so similar and i may add so excellent that the difference between they be not essential under the early practice of the government no constitution frame by the convention of a territory preparatory to its admission into the union as a state have be submit to the people i trust however the example set by the last congress require that the constitution of minnesota should be subject to the approval and ratification of the people of the propose state may be follow on future occasion i take it for grant that the convention of kansas would act in accordance with this example rounded as it be on correct principle and hence my instruction to governor walker in favor of submit the constitution to the people be express in general and unqualified term in the kansas nebraska act however this requirement as applicable to the whole constitution have not be insert and the convention be not bind by its term to submit any other portion of the instrument to an election except that which relate to the domestic institution of slavery this will be render clear by a simple reference to its language it be not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institution in their own way accord to the plain construction of the sentence the word domestic institution have a direct as they have an appropriate reference to slavery domestic institution be limit to the family the relation between master and slave and a few other be domestic institution and be entirely distinct from institution of a political character besides there be no question then before congress nor indeed have there since be any serious question before the people of kansas or the country except that which relate to the domestic institution of slavery the convention after an angry and excited debate finally determine by a majority of only two to submit the question of slavery to the people though at the last forty three of the fifty delegate present affix their signature to the constitution a large majority of the convention be in favor of establish slavery in kansas they accordingly insert an article in the constitution for this purpose similar in form to those which have be adopt by other territorial convention in the schedule however provide for the transition from a territorial to a state government the question have be fairly and explicitly refer to the people whether they will have a constitution with or without slavery it declare that before the constitution adopt by the convention shall be send to congress for admission into the union as a state an election shall be hold to decide this question at which all the white male inhabitant of the territory above the age of 21 be entitle to vote they be to vote by ballot and the ballot cast at say election shall be indorse constitution with slavery and constitution with no slavery if there be a majority in favor of the constitution with slavery then it be to be transmit to congress by the president of the convention in its original form if on the contrary there shall be a majority in favor of the constitution with no slavery then the article provide for slavery shall be stricken from the constitution by the president of this convention and it be expressly declare that no slavery shall exist in the state of kansas except that the right of property in slave now in the territory shall in no manner be interfere with and in that event it be make his duty to have the constitution thus ratify transmit to the congress of the united states for the admission of the state into the union at this election every citizen will have an opportunity of express his opinion by his vote whether kansas shall be receive into the union with or without slavery and thus this exciting question may be peacefully settle in the very mode require by the organic law the election will be hold under legitimate authority and if any portion of the inhabitant shall refuse to vote a fair opportunity to do so having be present this will be their own voluntary act and they alone will be responsible for the consequence whether kansas shall be a free or a slave state must eventually under some authority be decide by an election and the question can never be more clearly or distinctly present to the people than it be at the present moment should this opportunity be reject she may be involve for year in domestic discord and possibly in civil war before she can again make up the issue now so fortunately tender and again reach the point she have already attain kansas have for some year occupy too much of the public attention it be high time this should be direct to far more important object when once admit into the union whether with or without slavery the excitement beyond her own limit will speedily pass away and she will then for the first time be leave as she ought to have be long since to manage her own affair in her own way if her constitution on the subject of slavery or on any other subject be displease to a majority of the people no human power can prevent they from change it within a brief period under these circumstance it may well be question whether the peace and quiet of the whole country be not of great importance than the mere temporary triumph of either of the political party in kansas should the constitution without slavery be adopt by the vote of the majority the right of property in slave now in the territory be reserve the number of these be very small but if it be great the provision would be equally just and reasonable the slave be bring into the territory under the constitution of the united states and be now the property of their master this point have at length be finally decide by the high judicial tribunal of the country and this upon the plain principle that when a confederacy of sovereign states acquire a new territory at their joint expense both equality and justice demand that the citizen of one and all of they shall have the right to take into it whatsoever be recognize as property by the common constitution to have summarily confiscate the property in slave already in the territory would have be an act of gross injustice and contrary to the practice of the old states of the union which have abolish slavery a territorial government be establish for utah by act of congress approve the 9th september 1850 and the constitution and law of the united states be thereby extend over it so far as the same or any provision thereof may be applicable this act provide for the appointment by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate of a governor who be to be ex officio superintendent of indian affair a secretary three judge of the supreme court a marshal and a district attorney subsequent act provide for the appointment of the officer necessary to extend our land and our indian system over the territory brigham young be appoint the first governor on the 20th september 1850 and have hold the office ever since whilst governor young have be both governor and superintendent of indian affair throughout this period he have be at the same time the head of the church call the latter day saint and profess to govern its member and dispose of their property by direct inspiration and authority from the almighty his power have be therefore absolute over both church and state the people of utah almost exclusively belong to this church and believe with a fanatical spirit that he be governor of the territory by divine appointment they obey his command as if these be direct revelation from heaven if therefore he choose that his government shall come into collision with the government of the united states the member of the mormon church will yield implicit obedience to his will unfortunately existing fact leave but little doubt that such be his determination without enter upon a minute history of occurrence it be sufficient to say that all the officer of the united states judicial and executive with the single exception of two indian agent have find it necessary for their own personal safety to withdraw from the territory and there no long remain any government in utah but the despotism of brigham young this be the condition of affair in the territory i could not mistake the path of duty as chief executive magistrate i be bind to restore the supremacy of the constitution and law within its limit in order to effect this purpose i appoint a new governor and other federal officer for utah and send with they a military force for their protection and to aid as a posse comitatus in case of need in the execution of the law with the religious opinion of the mormons as long as they remain mere opinion however deplorable in themselves and revolt to the moral and religious sentiment of all christendom i have no right to interfere action alone when in violation of the constitution and law of the united states become the legitimate subject for the jurisdiction of the civil magistrate my instruction to governor cumming have therefore be frame in strict accordance with these principle at their date a hope be indulge that no necessity might exist for employ the military in restore and maintain the authority of the law but this hope have now vanish governor young have by proclamation declare his determination to maintain his power by force and have already commit act of hostility against the united states unless he should retrace his step the territory of utah will be in a state of open rebellion he have commit these act of hostility notwithstanding major van vliet an officer of the army send to utah by the commanding general to purchase provision for the troop have give he the strong assurance of the peaceful intention of the government and that the troop would only be employ as a posse comitatus when call on by the civil authority to aid in the execution of the law there be reason to believe that governor young have long contemplate this result he know that the continuance of his despotic power depend upon the exclusion of all settler from the territory except those who will acknowledge his divine mission and implicitly obey his will and that an enlightened public opinion there would soon prostrate institution at war with the law both of god and man he have therefore for several year in order to maintain his independence be industriously employ in collect and fabricate arm and munition of war and in discipline the mormon for military service as superintendent of indian affair he have have an opportunity of tamper with the indian tribe and excite their hostile feeling against the united states this accord to our information he have accomplish in regard to some of these tribe while other have remain true to their allegiance and have communicate his intrigue to our indian agent he have lay in a store of provision for three year which in case of necessity as he inform major van vliet he will conceal and then take to the mountain and bid defiance to all the power of the government "a great part of all this may be idle boasting but yet no wise government will lightly estimate the effort which may be inspire by such frenzied fanaticism as exist among the mormons in utah this be the first rebellion which have exist in our territories and humanity itself require that we should put it down in such a manner that it shall be the last to trifle with it would be to encourage it and to render it formidable we ought to go there with such an impose force as to convince these delude people that resistance would be vain and thus spare the effusion of blood we can in this manner good convince they that we be their friend not their enemy in order to accomplish this object it will be necessary accord to the estimate of the war department to raise four additional regiment and this i earnestly recommend to congress at the present moment of depression in the revenue of the country i be sorry to be oblige to recommend such a measure but i feel confident of the support of congress cost what it may in suppress the insurrection and in restore and maintain the sovereignty of the constitution and law over the territory of utah i recommend to congress the establishment of a territorial government over arizona incorporate with it such portion of new mexico as they may deem expedient i need scarcely adduce argument in support of this recommendation we be bind to protect the life and the property of our citizen inhabit arizona and these be now without any efficient protection their present number be already considerable and be rapidly increase notwithstanding the disadvantage under which they labor besides the propose territory be believe to be rich in mineral and agricultural resource especially in silver and copper the mail of the united states to california be now carry over it throughout its whole extent and this route be know to be the near and believe to be the good to the pacific long experience have deeply convince i that a strict construction of the power grant to congress be the only true as well as the only safe theory of the constitution whilst this principle shall guide my public conduct i consider it clear that under the war make power congress may appropriate money for the construction of a military road through the territories of the united states when this be absolutely necessary for the defense of any of the states against foreign invasion the constitution have confer upon congress power to declare war to raise and support army to provide and maintain a navy and to call forth the militia to repel invasion these high sovereign power necessarily involve important and responsible public duty and among they there be none so sacred and so imperative as that of preserve our soil from the invasion of a foreign enemy the constitution have therefore leave nothing on this point to construction but expressly require that the united states shall protect each of they the states against invasion now if a military road over our own territories be indispensably necessary to enable we to meet and repel the invader it follow as a necessary consequence not only that we possess the power but it be our imperative duty to construct such a road it would be an absurdity to invest a government with the unlimited power to make and conduct war and at the same time deny to it the only mean of reach and defeat the enemy at the frontier without such a road it be quite evident we can not protect california and our pacific possession against invasion we can not by any other mean transport man and munition of war from the atlantic states in sufficient time successfully to defend these remote and distant portion of the republic experience have prove that the route across the isthmus of central america be at good but a very uncertain and unreliable mode of communication but even if this be not the case they would at once be close against we in the event of war with a naval power so much strong than our own as to enable it to blockade the port at either end of these route after all therefore we can only rely upon a military road through our own territories and ever since the origin of the government congress have be in the practice of appropriate money from the public treasury for the construction of such road the difficulty and the expense of construct a military railroad to connect our atlantic and pacific states have be greatly exaggerated the distance on the arizona route near the thirty second parallel of north latitude between the western boundary of texas on the rio grande and the eastern boundary of california on the colorado from the good exploration now within our knowledge do not exceed 470 mile and the face of the country be in the main favorable for obvious reason the government ought not to undertake the work itself by mean of its own agent this ought to be commit to other agency which congress might assist either by grant of land or money or by both upon such term and condition as they may deem most beneficial for the country provision might thus be make not only for the safe rapid and economical transportation of troop and munition of war but also of the public mail the commercial interest of the whole country both east and west would be greatly promote by such a road and above all it would be a powerful additional bond of union and although advantage of this kind whether postal commercial or political can not confer constitutional power yet they may furnish auxiliary argument in favor of expedite a work which in my judgment be clearly embrace within the war make power for these reason i commend to the friendly consideration of congress the subject of the pacific railroad without finally commit myself to any particular route the report of the secretary of the treasury will furnish a detailed statement of the condition of the public finance and of the respective branch of the public service devolve upon that department of the government by this report it appear that the amount of revenue receive from all source into the treasury during the fiscal year end the 30th june 1857 be $ 68,631,513.67 which amount with the balance of $ 19,901,325.45 remain in the treasury at the commencement of the year make an aggregate for the service of the year of $ 88,532,839.12.the public expenditure for the fiscal year end 30th june 1857 amount to $ 70,822,724.85 of which $ 5,943,896.91 be apply to the redemption of the public debt include interest and premium leave in the treasury at the commencement of the present fiscal year on the 1st july 1857 $ 17,710,114.27.the receipt into the treasury for the first quarter of the present fiscal year commence 1st july 1857 be $ 20,929,819.81 and the estimate receipt of the remain three quarter to the 30th june 1858 be $ 36,750,000 make with the balance before state an aggregate of $ 75,389,934.08 for the service of the present fiscal year the actual expenditure during the first quarter of the present fiscal year be $ 23,714,528.37 of which $ 3,895,232.39 be apply to the redemption of the public debt include interest and premium the probable expenditure of the remain three quarter to 30th june 1858 be $ 51,248,530.04 include interest on the public debt make an aggregate of $ 74,963,058.41 leave an estimate balance in the treasury at the close of the present fiscal year of $ 426,875.67.the amount of the public debt at the commencement of the present fiscal year be $ 29,060,386.90.the amount redeem since the 1st of july be $ 3,895,232.39 leave a balance unredeeme at this time of $ 25,165,154.51.the amount of estimate expenditure for the remain three quarter of the present fiscal year will in all probability be increase from the cause set forth in the report of the secretary his suggestion therefore that authority should be give to supply any temporary deficiency by the issue of a limited amount of treasury note be approve and i accordingly recommend the passage of such a law as state in the report of the secretary the tariff of march 3 1857 have be in operation for so short a period of time and under circumstance so unfavorable to a just development of its result as a revenue measure that i should regard it as inexpedient at least for the present to undertake its revision i transmit herewith the report make to i by the secretaries of war and of the navy of the interior and of the postmaster general they all contain valuable and important information and suggestion which i commend to the favorable consideration of congress i have already recommend the raising of four additional regiment and the report of the secretary of war present strong reason prove this increase of the army under exist circumstance to be indispensable i would call the special attention of congress to the recommendation of the secretary of the navy in favor of the construction of ten small war steamer of light draft for some year the government have be oblige on many occasion to hire such steamer from individual to supply its press want at the present moment we have no armed vessel in the navy which can penetrate the river of china we have but few which can enter any of the harbor south of norfolk although many million of foreign and domestic commerce annually pass in and out of these harbor some of our most valuable interest and most vulnerable point be thus leave expose this class of vessel of light draft great speed and heavy gun would be formidable in coast defense the cost of their construction will not be great and they will require but a comparatively small expenditure to keep they in commission in time of peace they will prove as effective as much large vessel and more useful one of they should be at every station where we maintain a squadron and three or four should be constantly employ on our atlantic and pacific coast economy utility and efficiency combine to recommend they as almost indispensable ten of these small vessel would be of incalculable advantage to the naval service and the whole cost of their construction would not exceed $ 2,300,000 or $ 230,000 each the report of the secretary of the interior be worthy of grave consideration it treat of the numerous important and diversified branch of domestic administration intrust to he by law among these the most prominent be the public land and our relation with the indians our system for the disposal of the public land originate with the father of the republic have be improve as experience point the way and gradually adapt to the growth and settlement of our western states and territories it have work well in practice already thirteen states and seven territories have be carve out of these land and still more than a thousand million of acre remain unsold what a boundless prospect this present to our country of future prosperity and power!we have heretofore dispose of 363,862,464 acre of the public land whilst the public land as a source of revenue be of great importance their importance be far great as furnish home for a hardy and independent race of honest and industrious citizen who desire to subdue and cultivate the soil they ought to be administer mainly with a view of promote this wise and benevolent policy in appropriate they for any other purpose we ought to use even great economy than if they have be convert into money and the proceed be already in the public treasury to squander away this rich and noble inheritance which any people have ever enjoy upon object of doubtful constitutionality or expediency would be to violate one of the most important trust ever commit to any people whilst i do not deny to congress the power when act bona fide as a proprietor to give away portion of they for the purpose of increase the value of the remainder yet consider the great temptation to abuse this power we can not be too cautious in its exercise actual settler under exist law be protect against other purchaser at the public sale in their right of preemption to the extent of a quarter section or 160 acre of land the remainder may then be dispose of at public or enter at private sale in unlimited quantity speculation have of late year prevail to a great extent in the public land the consequence have be that large portion of they have become the property of individual and company and thus the price be greatly enhance to those who desire to purchase for actual settlement in order to limit the area of speculation as much as possible the extinction of the indian title and the extension of the public survey ought only to keep pace with the tide of emigration if congress should hereafter grant alternate section to states or company as they have do heretofore i recommend that the intermediate section retain by the government should be subject to preemption by actual settler it ought ever to be our cardinal policy to reserve the public land as much as may be for actual settler and this at moderate price we shall thus not only well promote the prosperity of the new states and territories and the power of the union but shall secure home for our posterity for many generation the extension of our limit have bring within our jurisdiction many additional and populous tribe of indians a large proportion of which be wild untractable and difficult to control predatory and warlike in their disposition and habit it be impossible altogether to restrain they from commit aggression on each other as well as upon our frontier citizen and those emigrate to our distant states and territories hence expensive military expedition be frequently necessary to overawe and chastise the more lawless and hostile the present system of make they valuable present to influence they to remain at peace have prove ineffectual it be believe to be the well policy to colonize they in suitable locality where they can receive the rudiment of education and be gradually induce to adopt habit of industry so far as the experiment have be try it have work well in practice and it will doubtless prove to be less expensive than the present system the whole number of indians within our territorial limit be believe to be from the good datum in the interior department about 325,000 the tribe of cherokees choctaws chickasaws and creeks settle in the territory set apart for they west of arkansas be rapidly advance in education and in all the art of civilization and self government and we may indulge the agreeable anticipation that at no very distant day they will be incorporate into the union as one of the sovereign state it will be see from the report of the postmaster general that the post office department still continue to depend on the treasury as it have be compel to do for several year past for an important portion of the mean of sustain and extend its operation their rapid growth and expansion be show by a decennial statement of the number of post office and the length of post road commence with the year 1827 in that year there be 7,000 post office in 1837 11,177 in 1847 15,146 and in 1857 they number 26,586 in this year 1,725 post office have be establish and 704 discontinue leave a net increase of 1,021 the postmaster of 368 office be appoint by the president the length of post road in 1827 be 105,336 mile in 1837,141,242 mile in 1847 153,818 mile and in the year 1857 there be 242,601 mile of post road include 22,530 mile of railroad on which the mail be transport the expenditure of the department for the fiscal year end on the 30th june 1857 as adjust by the auditor amount to $ 11,507,670 to defray these expenditure there be to the credit of the department on the 1st july 1856 the sum of $ 789,599 the gross revenue of the year include the annual allowance for the transportation of free mail matter produce $ 8,053,951 and the remainder be supply by the appropriation from the treasury of $ 2,250,000 grant by the act of congress approve august 18 1856 and by the appropriation of $ 666,883 make by the act of march 3 1857 leave $ 252,763 to be carry to the credit of the department in the account of the current year i commend to your consideration the report of the department in relation to the establishment of the overland mail route from the mississippi river to san francisco cal the route be select with my full concurrence as the one in my judgment well calculate to attain the important object contemplate by congress the late disastrous monetary revulsion may have one good effect should it cause both the government and the people to return to the practice of a wise and judicious economy both in public and private expenditure an overflowing treasury have lead to habit of prodigality and extravagance in our legislation it have induce congress to make large appropriation to object for which they never would have provide have it be necessary to raise the amount of revenue require to meet they by increase taxation or by loan we be now compel to pause in our career and to scrutinize our expenditure with the utmost vigilance and in perform this duty i pledge my cooperation to the extent of my constitutional competency it ought to be observe at the same time that true public economy do not consist in withhold the mean necessary to accomplish important national object intrust to we by the constitution and especially such as may be necessary for the common defense in the present crisis of the country it be our duty to confine our appropriation to object of this character unless in case where justice to individual may demand a different course in all case care ought to be take that the money grant by congress shall be faithfully and economically apply under the federal constitution every bill which shall have pass the house of representatives and the senate shall before it become a law be approve and sign by the president and if not approve he shall return it with his objection to that house in which it shall have originate in order to perform this high and responsible duty sufficient time must be allow the president to read and examine every bill present to he for approval unless this be afford the constitution become a dead letter in this particular and even bad it become a means of deception our constituent see the president 's approval and signature attach to each act of congress be induce to believe that he have actually perform his duty when in truth nothing be in many case more unfounded from the practice of congress such an examination of each bill as the constitution require have be render impossible the most important business of each session be generally crowd into its last hour and the alternative present to the president be either to violate the constitutional duty which he owe to the people and approve bill which for want of time it be impossible he should have examine or by his refusal to do this subject the country and individual to great loss and inconvenience besides a practice have grow up of late year to legislate in appropriation bill at the last hour of the session on new and important subject this practice constrain the president either to suffer measure to become law which he do not approve or to incur the risk of stop the wheel of the government by veto an appropriation bill formerly such bill be confine to specific appropriation for carry into effect exist law and the well establish policy of the country and little time be then requite by the president for their examination for my own part i have deliberately determine that i shall approve no bill which i have not examine and it will be a case of extreme and most urgent necessity which shall ever induce i to depart from this rule i therefore respectfully but earnestly recommend that the two houses would allow the president at least two day previous to the adjournment of each session within which no new bill shall be present to he for approval under the exist joint rule one day be allow but this rule have be hitherto so constantly suspend in practice that important bill continue to be present to he up till the very last moment of the session in a large majority of case no great public inconvenience can arise from the want of time to examine their provision because the constitution have declare that if a bill be present to the president within the last ten day of the session he be not require to return it either with an approval or with a veto in which case it shall not be a law it may then lie over and be take up and pass at the next session great inconvenience would only be experience in regard to appropriation bill but fortunately under the late excellent law allow a salary instead of a per diem to member of congress the expense and inconvenience of a call session will be greatly reduce i can not conclude without commend to your favorable consideration the interest of the people of this district without a representative on the floor of congress they have for this very reason peculiar claim upon our just regard to this i know from my long acquaintance with they they be eminently entitle
to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 i have receive from j. calhoun esq president of the late constitutional convention of kansas a copy duly certify by himself of the constitution frame by that body with the expression of a hope that i would submit the same to the consideration of congress with the view of the admission of kansas into the union as an independent state in compliance with this request i herewith transmit to congress for their action the constitution of kansas with the ordinance respect the public land as well as the letter of mr. calhoun date at lecompton on the 14th ultimo by which they be accompany having receive but a single copy of the constitution and ordinance i send this to the senate
 a great delusion seem to pervade the public mind in relation to the condition of party in kansas this arise from the difficulty of induce the american people to realize the fact that any portion of they should be in a state of rebellion against the government under which they live when we speak of the affair of kansas we be apt to refer merely to the existence of two violent political party in that territory divide on the question of slavery just as we speak of such party in the states this present no adequate idea of the true state of the case the dividing line there be not between two political party both acknowledge the lawful existence of the government but between those who be loyal to this government and those who have endeavor to destroy its existence by force and by usurpation between those who sustain and those who have do all in their power to overthrow the territorial government establish by congress this government they would long since have subvert have it not be protect from their assault by the troop of the united states such have be the condition of affair since my inauguration ever since that period a large portion of the people of kansas have be in a state of rebellion against the government with a military leader at their head of a most turbulent and dangerous character they have never acknowledge but have constantly renounce and defy the government to which they owe allegiance and have be all the time in a state of resistance against its authority they have all the time be endeavor to subvert it and to establish a revolutionary government under the so call topeka constitution in its stead even at this very moment the topeka legislature be in session whoever have read the correspondence of governor walker with the state department recently communicate to the senate will be convince that this picture be not overdrawn he always protest against the withdrawal of any portion of the military force of the united states from the territory deem its presence absolutely necessary for the preservation of the regular government and the execution of the law in his very first dispatch to the secretary of state date june 2 1857 he say
 the most alarming movement however proceed from the assembling on the 9th june of the so call topeka legislature with a view to the enactment of an entire code of law of course it will be my endeavor to prevent such a result as it would lead to inevitable and disastrous collision and in fact renew the civil war in kansas
 this be with difficulty prevent by the effort of governor walker but soon thereafter on the 14th of july we find he request general harney to furnish he a regiment of dragoon to proceed to the city of lawrence and this for the reason that he have receive authentic intelligence verify by his own actual observation that a dangerous rebellion have occur involve an open defiance of the law and the establishment of an insurgent government in that city
 in the governor&#39;s dispatch of july 15 he inform the secretary of state that--
 this movement at lawrence be the beginning of a plan originate in that city to organize insurrection throughout the territory and especially in all town city or county where the republican party have a majority lawrence be the hotbed of all the abolition movement in this territory it be the town establish by the abolition society of the east and whilst there be respectable people there it be fill by a considerable number of mercenary who be pay by abolition society to perpetuate and diffuse agitation throughout kansas and prevent a peaceful settlement of this question having fail in induce their own so call topeka state legislature to organize this insurrection lawrence have commence it herself and if not arrest the rebellion will extend throughout the territory
 and again
 in order to send this communication immediately by mail i must close by assure you that the spirit of rebellion pervade the great mass of the republican party of this territory instigate as i entertain no doubt they be by eastern society have in view result most disastrous to the government and to the union and that the continued presence of general harney here be indispensable as originally stipulate by i with a large body of dragoon and several battery
 on the 20th july 1857 general lane under the authority of the topeka convention undertake as governor walker inform we to organize the whole so call free state party into volunteer and to take the name of all who refuse enrollment the profess object be to protect the poll at the election in august of the new insurgent topeka state legislature
 the object of take the name of all who refuse enrollment be to terrify the free state conservative into submission this be prove by recent atrocity commit on such man by topekaites the speedy location of large body of regular troop here with two battery be necessary the lawrence insurgent await the development of this new revolutionary military organization
 in the governor&#39;s dispatch of july 27 he say that general lane and his staff everywhere deny the authority of the territorial law and counsel a total disregard of these enactment
 without make further quotation of a similar character from other dispatch of governor walker it appear by a reference to mr. stanton&#39;s communication to general cass of the 9th of december last that the important step of call the legislature together be take after i he have become satisfied that the election order by the convention on the 21st instant could not be conduct without collision and bloodshed so intense be the disloyal feeling among the enemy of the government establish by congress that an election which afford they an opportunity if in the majority of make kansas a free state accord to their own profess desire could not be conduct without collision and bloodshed
 the truth be that up till the present moment the enemy of the exist government still adhere to their topeka revolutionary constitution and government the very first paragraph of the message of governor robinson date on the 7th of december to the topeka legislature now assemble at lawrence contain an open defiance of the constitution and law of the united states the governor say
 the convention which frame the constitution at topeka originate with the people of kansas territory they have adopt and ratify the same twice by a direct vote and also indirectly through two election of state officer and member of the state legislature yet it have please the administration to regard the whole proceeding revolutionary
 this topeka government adhere to with such treasonable pertinacity be a government in direct opposition to the exist government prescribe and recognize by congress it be a usurpation of the same character as it would be for a portion of the people of any state of the union to undertake to establish a separate government within its limit for the purpose of redress any grievance real or imaginary of which they might complain against the legitimate state government such a principle if carry into execution would destroy all lawful authority and produce universal anarchy
 from this statement of fact the reason become palpable why the enemy of the government authorize by congress have refuse to vote for delegate to the kansas constitutional convention and also afterwards on the question of slavery submit by it to the people it be because they have ever refuse to sanction or recognize any other constitution than that frame at topeka
 have the whole lecompton constitution be submit to the people the adherent of this organization would doubtless have vote against it because if successful they would thus have remove an obstacle out of the way of their own revolutionary constitution they would have do this not upon a consideration of the merit of the whole or any part of the lecompton constitution but simply because they have ever resist the authority of the government authorize by congress from which it emanate
 such be the unfortunate condition of affair in the territory what be the right as well as the duty of the law abide people be they silently and patiently to submit to the topeka usurpation or adopt the necessary measure to establish a constitution under the authority of the organic law of congress
 that this law recognize the right of the people of the territory without any enable act from congress to form a state constitution be too clear for argument for congress to leave the people of the territory perfectly free in frame their constitution to form and regulate their domestic institution in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states and then to say that they shall not be permit to proceed and frame a constitution in their own way without an express authority from congress appear to be almost a contradiction in term it would be much more plausible to contend that congress have no power to pass such an enable act than to argue that the people of a territory might be keep out of the union for an indefinite period and until it might please congress to permit they to exercise the right of self government this would be to adopt not their own way but the way which congress might prescribe
 it be impossible that any people could have proceed with more regularity in the formation of a constitution than the people of kansas have do it be necessary first to ascertain whether it be the desire of the people to be relieve from their territorial dependence and establish a state government for this purpose the territorial legislature in 1855 pass a law for take the sense of the people of this territory upon the expediency of call a convention to form a state constitution at the general election to be hold in october 1856 the sense of the people be accordingly take and they decide in favor of a convention it be true that at this election the enemy of the territorial government do not vote because they be then engage at topeka without the slight pretext of lawful authority in frame a constitution of their own for the purpose of subvert the territorial government
 in pursuance of this decision of the people in favor of a convention the territorial legislature on the 27th day of february 1857 pass an act for the election of delegate on the third monday of june 1857 to frame a state constitution this law be as fair in its provision as any that ever pass a legislative body for a similar purpose the right of suffrage at this election be clearly and justly define every bona fide inhabitant of the territory of kansas on the third monday of june the day of the election who be a citizen of the united states above the age of 21 and have reside therein for three month previous to that date be entitle to vote in order to avoid all interference from neighbor states or territories with the freedom and fairness of the election provision be make for the registry of the qualified voter and in pursuance thereof 9,251 voter be register governor walker do his whole duty in urge all the qualified citizen of kansas to vote at this election in his inaugural address on the 27th may last he inform they that--
 under our practice the preliminary act of frame a state constitution be uniformly perform through the instrumentality of a convention of delegate choose by the people themselves that convention be now about to be elect by you under the call of the territorial legislature create and still recognize by the authority of congress and clothe by it in the comprehensive language of the organic law with full power to make such an enactment the territorial legislature then in assemble this convention be fully sustain by the act of congress and the authority of the convention be distinctly recognize in my instruction from the president of the united states
 the governor also clearly and distinctly warn they what would be the consequence if they should not participate in the election
 the people of kansas then he say be invite by the high authority know to the constitution to participate freely and fairly in the election of delegate to frame a constitution and state government the law have perform its entire appropriate function when it extend to the people the fight of suffrage but it can not compel the performance of that duty throughout our whole union however and wherever free government prevail those who abstain from the exercise of the right of suffrage authorize those who do vote to act for they in that contingency and the absentee be as much bind under the law and constitution where there be no fraud or violence by the act of the majority of those who do vote as if all have participate in the election otherwise as voting must be voluntary self government would be impracticable and monarchy or despotism would remain as the only alternative
 it may also be observe that at this period any hope if such have exist that the topeka constitution would ever be recognize by congress must have be abandon congress have adjourn on the 3d march previous having recognize the legal existence of the territorial legislature in a variety of form which i need not enumerate indeed the delegate elect to the house of representatives under a territorial law have be admit to his seat and have just complete his term of service on the day previous to my inauguration
 this be the propitious moment for settle all difficulty in kansas this be the time for abandon the revolutionary topeka organization and for the enemy of the exist government to conform to the law and to unite with its friend in frame a state constitution but this they refuse to do and the consequence of their refusal to submit to lawful authority and vote at the election of delegate may yet prove to be of a most deplorable character would that the respect for the law of the land which so eminently distinguish the man of the past generation could be revive it be a disregard and violation of law which have for year keep the territory of kansas in a state of almost open rebellion against its government it be the same spirit which have produce actual rebellion in utah our only safety consist in obedience and conformity to law should a general spirit against its enforcement prevail this will prove fatal to we as a nation we acknowledge no master but the law and should we cut loose from its restraint and everyone do what seemeth good in his own eye our case will indeed be hopeless
 the enemy of the territorial government determine still to resist the authority of congress they refuse to vote for delegate to the convention not because from circumstance which i need not detail there be an omission to register the comparatively few voter who be inhabitant of certain county of kansas in the early spring of 1857 but because they have predetermine at all hazard to adhere to their revolutionary organization and defeat the establishment of any other constitution than that which they have frame at topeka the election be therefore suffer to pass by default but of this result the qualified elector who refuse to vote can never justly complain
 from this review it be manifest that the lecompton convention accord to every principle of constitutional law be legally constitute and be invest with power to frame a constitution
 the sacred principle of popular sovereignty have be invoke in favor of the enemy of law and order in kansas but in what manner be popular sovereignty to be exercise in this country if not through the instrumentality of establish law in certain small republic of ancient time the people do assemble in primary meeting pass law and direct public affair in our country this be manifestly impossible popular sovereignty can be exercise here only through the ballot box and if the people will refuse to exercise it in this manner as they have do in kansas at the election of delegate it be not for they to complain that their right have be violate
 the kansas convention thus lawfully constitute proceed to frame a constitution and having complete their work finally adjourn on the 7th day of november last they do not think proper to submit the whole of this constitution to a popular vote but they do submit the question whether kansas should be a free or a slave state to the people this be the question which have convulse the union and shake it to its very center this be the question which have light up the flame of civil war in kansas and have produce dangerous sectional party throughout the confederacy it be of a character so paramount in respect to the condition of kansas as to rivet the anxious attention of the people of the whole country upon it and it alone no person think of any other question for my own part when i instruct governor walker in general term in favor of submit the constitution to the people i have no object in view except the all absorb question of slavery in what manner the people of kansas might regulate their other concern be not a subject which attract any attention in fact the general provision of our recent state constitution after an experience of eight year be so similar and so excellent that it would be difficult to go far wrong at the present day in frame a new constitution
 i then believe and still believe that under the organic act the kansas convention be bind to submit this all important question of slavery to the people it be never however my opinion that independently of this act they would have be bind to submit any portion of the constitution to a popular vote in order to give it validity have i entertain such an opinion this would have be in opposition to many precedent in our history commence in the very good age of the republic it would have be in opposition to the principle which pervade our institution and which be every day carry out into practice that the people have the right to delegate to representative choose by themselves their sovereign power to frame constitution enact law and perform many other important act without require that these should be subject to their subsequent approbation it would be a most inconvenient limitation of their own power impose by the people upon themselves to exclude they from exercise their sovereignty in any lawful manner they think proper it be true that the people of kansas might if they have please have require the convention to submit the constitution to a popular vote but this they have not do the only remedy therefore in this case be that which exist in all other similar case if the delegate who frame the kansas constitution have in any manner violate the will of their constituent the people always possess the power to change their constitution or their law accord to their own pleasure
 the question of slavery be submit to an election of the people of kansas on the 21st december last in obedience to the mandate of the constitution here again a fair opportunity be present to the adherent of the topeka constitution if they be the majority to decide this exciting question in their own way and thus restore peace to the distracted territory but they again refuse to exercise their right of popular sovereignty and again suffer the election to pass by default
 i heartily rejoice that a wise and well spirit prevail among a large majority of these people on the first monday of january and that they do on that day vote under the lecompton constitution for a governor and other state officer a member of congress and for member of the legislature this election be warmly contest by the party and a large vote be poll than at any previous election in the territory we may now reasonably hope that the revolutionary topeka organization will be speedily and finally abandon and this will go far toward the final settlement of the unhappy difference in kansas if fraud have be commit at this election either by one or both party the legislature and the people of kansas under their constitution will know how to redress themselves and punish these detestable but too common crime without any outside interference
 the people of kansas have then in their own way and in strict accordance with the organic act frame a constitution and state government have submit the all important question of slavery to the people and have elect a governor a member to represent they in congress member of the state legislature and other state officer they now ask admission into the union under this constitution which be republican in its form it be for congress to decide whether they will admit or reject the state which have thus be create for my own part i be decidedly in favor of its admission and thus terminate the kansas question this will carry out the great principle of nonintervention recognize and sanction by the organic act which declare in express language in favor of nonintervention by congress with slavery in the states or territories leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institution in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states in this manner by localize the question of slavery and confine it to the people whom it immediately concern every patriot anxiously expect that this question would be banish from the hall of congress where it have always exert a baneful influence throughout the whole country
 it be proper that i should briefly refer to the election hold under an act of the territorial legislature on the first monday of january last on the lecompton constitution this election be hold after the territory have be prepare for admission into the union as a sovereign state and when no authority exist in the territorial legislature which could possibly destroy its existence or change its character the election which be peaceably conduct under my instruction involve a strange inconsistency a large majority of the person who vote against the lecompton constitution be at the very same time and place recognize its valid existence in the most solemn and authentic manner by vote under its provision i have yet receive no official information of the result of this election
 as a question of expediency after the right have be maintain it may be wise to reflect upon the benefit to kansas and to the whole country which would result from its immediate admission into the union as well as the disaster which may follow its rejection domestic peace will be the happy consequence of its admission and that fine territory which have hitherto be tear by dissension will rapidly increase in population and wealth and speedily realize the blessing and the comfort which follow in the train of agricultural and mechanical industry the people will then be sovereign and can regulate their own affair in their own way if a majority of they desire to abolish domestic slavery within the state there be no other possible mode by which this can be effect so speedily as by prompt admission the will of the majority be supreme and irresistible when express in an orderly and lawful manner they can make and unmake constitution at pleasure it would be absurd to say that they can impose fetter upon their own power which they can not afterwards remove if they could do this they might tie their own hand for a hundred as well as for ten year these be fundamental principle of american freedom and be recognize i believe in some form or other by every state constitution and if congress in the act of admission should think proper to recognize they i can perceive no objection to such a course this have be do emphatically in the constitution of kansas it declare in the bill of right that all political power be inherent in the people and all free government be round on their authority and institute for their benefit and therefore they have at all time an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter reform or abolish their form of government in such manner as they may think proper the great state of new york be at this moment govern under a constitution frame and establish in direct opposition to the mode prescribe by the previous constitution if therefore the provision change the kansas constitution after the year 1864 could by possibility be construe into a prohibition to make such a change previous to that period this prohibition would be wholly unavaile the legislature already elect may at its very first session submit the question to a vote of the people whether they will or will not have a convention to amend their constitution and adopt all necessary mean for give effect to the popular will
 it have be solemnly adjudge by the high judicial tribunal know to our law that slavery exist in kansas by virtue of the constitution of the united states kansas be therefore at this moment as much a slave state as georgia or south carolina without this the equality of the sovereign states compose the union would be violate and the use and enjoyment of a territory acquire by the common treasure of all the states would be close against the people and the property of nearly half the member of the confederacy slavery can therefore never be prohibit in kansas except by mean of a constitutional provision and in no other manner can this be obtain so promptly if a majority of the people desire it as by admit it into the union under its present constitution
 on the other hand should congress reject the constitution under the idea of afford the disaffect in kansas a third opportunity of prohibit slavery in the state which they might have do twice before if in the majority no man can foretell the consequence
 if congress for the sake of those man who refuse to vote for delegate to the convention when they might have exclude slavery from the constitution and who afterwards refuse to vote on the 21st december last when they might as they claim have stricken slavery from the constitution should now reject the state because slavery remain in the constitution it be manifest that the agitation upon this dangerous subject will be renew in a more alarming form than it have ever yet assume
 every patriot in the country have indulge the hope that the kansas and nebraska act would put a final end to the slavery agitation at least in congress which have for more than twenty year convulse the country and endanger the union this act involve great and fundamental principle and if fairly carry into effect will settle the question should the agitation be again revive should the people of the sister states be again estranged from each other with more than their former bitterness this will arise from a cause so far as the interest of kansas be concern more trifling and insignificant than have ever stir the element of a great people into commotion to the people of kansas the only practical difference between admission or rejection depend simply upon the fact whether they can themselves more speedily change the present constitution if it do not accord with the will of the majority or frame a second constitution to be submit to congress hereafter even if this be a question of mere expediency and not of right the small difference of time one way or the other be of not the least importance when contrast with the evil which must necessarily result to the whole country from a revival of the slavery agitation
 in consider this question it should never be forget that in proportion to its insignificance let the decision be what it may so far as it may affect the few thousand inhabitant of kansas who have from the beginning resist the constitution and the law for this very reason the rejection of the constitution will be so much the more keenly feel by the people of fourteen of the states of this union where slavery be recognize under the constitution of the united states
 again the speedy admission of kansas into the union would restore peace and quiet to the whole country already the affair of this territory have engross an undue proportion of public attention they have sadly affect the friendly relation of the people of the states with each other and alarm the fear of patriot for the safety of the union kansas once admit into the union the excitement become localized and will soon die away for want of outside aliment then every difficulty will be settle at the ballot box
 besides and this be no trifling consideration i shall then be enable to withdraw the troop of the united states from kansas and employ they on branch of service where they be much need they have be keep there on the earnest importunity of governor walker to maintain the existence of the territorial government and secure the execution of the law he consider that at least 2,000 regular troop under the command of general harney be necessary for this purpose act upon his reliable information i have be oblige in some degree to interfere with the expedition to utah in order to keep down rebellion in kansas this have involve a very heavy expense to the government kansas once admit it be believe there will no long be any occasion there for troop of the united states
 i have thus perform my duty on this important question under a deep sense of responsibility to god and my country my public life will terminate within a brief period and i have no other object of earthly ambition than to leave my country in a peaceful and prosperous condition and to live in the affection and respect of my countryman the dark and ominous cloud which now appear to be impend over the union i conscientiously believe may be dissipate with honor to every portion of it by the admission of kansas during the present session of congress whereas if she should be reject i greatly fear these cloud will become dark and more ominous than any which have ever yet threaten the constitution and the union
 april 6 1858- proclamation regard the rebellion in utah
 whereas the territory of utah be settle by certain emigrant from the states and from foreign country who have for several year past manifest a spirit of insubordination to the constitution and law of the united states the great mass of those settler act under the influence of leader to whom they seem to have surrender their judgment refuse to be control by any other authority they have be often advise to obedience and these friendly counsel have be answer with defiance the officer of the federal government have be drive from the territory for no offense but an effort to do their swear duty other have be prevent from go there by threat of assassination judge have be violently interrupt in the performance of their function and the record of the court have be seize and destroy or conceal many other act of unlawful violence have be perpetrate and the right to repeat they have be openly claim by the lead inhabitant with at least the silent acquiescence of nearly all the other their hostility to the lawful government of the country have at length become so violent that no officer bear a commission from the chief magistrate of the union can enter the territory or remain there with safety and all those officer recently appoint have be unable to go to salt lake or anywhere else in utah beyond the immediate power of the army indeed such be believe to be the condition to which a strange system of terrorism have bring the inhabitant of that region that no one among they could express an opinion favorable to this government or even propose to obey its law without expose his life and property to peril
 after carefully consider this state of affair and maturely weigh the obligation i be under to see the law faithfully execute it seem to i right and proper that i should make such use of the military force at my disposal as might be necessary to protect the federal officer in go into the territory of utah and in perform their duty after arrive there i accordingly order a detachment of the army to march for the city of salt lake or within reach of that place and to act in case of need as a posse for the enforcement of the law but in the meantime the hatred of that misguided people for the just and legal authority of the government have become so intense that they resolve to measure their military strength with that of the union they have organize an armed force far from contemptible in point of number and train it if not with skill at least with great assiduity and perseverance while the troop of the united states be on their march a train of baggage wagon which happen to be unprotecte be attack and destroy by a portion of the mormon force and the provision and store with which the train be laden be wantonly burn in short their present attitude be one of decide and unreserve enmity to the united states and to all their loyal citizen their determination to oppose the authority of the government by military force have not only be express in word but manifest in overt act of the most unequivocal character
 fellow citizen of utah this be rebellion against the government to which you owe allegiance it be levy war against the united states and involve you in the guilt of treason persistence in it will bring you to condign punishment to ruin and to shame for it be mere madness to suppose that with your limited resource you can successfully resist the force of this great and powerful nation
 if you have calculate upon the forbearance of the united states if you have permit yourself to suppose that this government will fail to put forth its strength and bring you to submission you have fall into a grave mistake you have settle upon territory which lie geographically in the heart of the union the land you live upon be purchase by the united states and pay for out of their treasury the proprietary right and title to it be in they and not in you utah be bound on every side by states and territories whose people be true to the union it be absurd to believe that they will or can permit you to erect in their very midst a government of your own not only independent of the authority which they all acknowledge but hostile to they and their interest
 do not deceive yourself nor try to mislead other by propagate the idea that this be a crusade against your religion the constitution and law of this country can take no notice of your creed whether it be true or false that be a question between your god and yourself in which i disclaim all right to interfere if you obey the law keep the peace and respect the just right of other you will be perfectly secure and may live on in your present faith or change it for another at your pleasure every intelligent man among you know very well that this government have never directly or indirectly seek to molest you in your worship to control you in your ecclesiastical affair or even to influence you in your religious opinion
 this rebellion be not merely a violation of your legal duty it be without just cause without reason without excuse you never make a complaint that be not listen to with patience you never exhibit a real grievance that be not redress as promptly as it could be the law and regulation enact for your government by congress have be equal and just and their enforcement be manifestly necessary for your own welfare and happiness you have never ask their repeal they be similar in every material respect to the law which have be pass for the other territories of the union and which everywhere else with one partial exception have be cheerfully obey no people ever live who be free from unnecessary legal restraint than you human wisdom never devise a political system which bestow more blessing or impose light burden than the government of the united states in its operation upon the territories
 but be anxious to save the effusion of blood and to avoid the indiscriminate punishment of a whole people for crime of which it be not probable that all be equally guilty i offer now a free and full pardon to all who will submit themselves to the just authority of the federal government if you refuse to accept it let the consequence fall upon your own head but i conjure you to pause deliberately and reflect well before you reject this tender of peace and good will
 now therefore i james buchanan president of the united states have think proper to issue this my proclamation enjoin upon all public officer in the territory of utah to be diligent and faithful to the full extent of their power in the execution of the law command all citizen of the united states in say territory to aid and assist the officer in the performance of their duty offer to the inhabitant of utah who shall submit to the law a free pardon for the sedition and treason heretofore by they commit warn those who shall persist after notice of this proclamation in the present rebellion against the united states that they must expect no further lenity but look to be rigorously deal with accord to their desert and declare that the military force now in utah and hereafter to be send there will not be withdraw until the inhabitant of that territory shall manifest a proper sense of the duty which they owe to this government
 in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and cause the seal of the united states to be affix to these present do at the city of washington the 6th day of april 1858 and of the independence of the united states the eighty second
 james buchanan
 by the president
 lewis cass secretary of state

mr. president and gentlemen of the convention if we could first know where   we be and whither   we be tend we could then well judge what   to do and how   to do it we be now far into the fifth   year since a policy be initiate with the avow   object and confident   promise of put an end to slavery agitation under the operation of that policy that agitation have not only not cease but have constantly augment in my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have be reach and pass "a house divide against itself can not stand "i believe this government can not endure permanently half slave   and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolve i do not expect the house to fall but i do   expect it will cease to be divide it will become all   one thing or all   the other either the opponent   of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it be in course of ultimate extinction or its advocate   will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all   the states old   as well as new north   as well as south have we no tendency   to the latter condition?let any one who doubt carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination piece of machinery   so to speak compound of the nebraska doctrine and the dred scott decision let he consider not only what work   the machinery be adapt to do and how well   adapt but also let he study the history   of its construction and trace if he can or rather fail if he can to trace the evidence of design and concert of action among its chief boss from the beginning but so far congress   only have act and an indorsement   by the people real   or apparent be indispensable to save   the point already gain and give chance for more the new year of 1854 find slavery exclude from more than half the states by state constitutions and from most of the national territory by congressional prohibition four day later commence the struggle which end in repeal that congressional prohibition this open all the national territory to slavery and be the first point gain this necessity have not be overlook but have be provide for as well as might be in the notable argument of squatter sovereignty otherwise call sacred right of self government which latter phrase though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government be so pervert in this attempt use of it as to amount to just this that if any one   man choose to enslave another no third   man shall be allow to object that argument be incorporate into the nebraska bill itself in the language which follow it be the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state not exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institution in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states "then open the roar of loose declamation in favor of squatter sovereignty and sacred right of self government ""but say opposition member let we be more specific let we amend   the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the territory may   exclude slavery not we say the friend of the measure and down they vote the amendment while the nebraska bill be pass through congress a law case involve the question of a negroe 's freedom by reason of his owner having voluntarily take he first into a free state and then a territory cover by the congressional prohibition and hold he as a slave for a long time in each be pass through the u.s. circuit court for the district of missouri and both nebraska bill and law suit be bring to a decision in the same month of may 1854 the negroe 's name be dred scott which name now designate the decision finally make in the case before   the then   next presidential election the law case come to and be argue in   the supreme court of the united states but the decision   of it be defer until after   the election still before   the election senator trumbull on the floor of the senate request the lead advocate of the nebraska bill to state his opinion   whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limit and the latter answer that be a question for the supreme court "the election come mr. buchanan be elect and the indorsement such as it be secure that be the second   point gain the indorsement however fall short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand vote and so perhaps be not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory the outgoing   president in his last annual message as impressively as possible echo back   upon the people the weight   and authority   of the indorsement the supreme court meet again do not   announce their decision but order a re argument the presidential inauguration come and still no decision of the court but the incoming   president in his inaugural address fervently exhort the people to abide by the forthcoming decision whatever it might be then in a few day come the decision the reputed author of the nebraska bill find an early occasion to make a speech at this capitol indorse the dred scott decision and vehemently denounce all opposition to it the new president too seize the early occasion of the silliman letter to indorse   and strongly construe   that decision and to express his astonishment   that any different view have ever be entertain at length a squabble spring up between the president and the author of the nebraska bill on the mere   question of fact whether the lecompton constitution be or be not in any just sense make by the people of kansas and in that squabble the latter declare that all he want be a fair vote for the people and that he care   not whether slavery be vote down   or vote up i do not understand his declaration that he care not whether slavery be vote down or vote up to be intend by he other than as an apt definition   of the policy   he would impress upon the public mind the principle   for which he declare he have suffer much and be ready to suffer to the end and well may he cling to that principle if he have any parental feeling well may he cling to it that principle be the only shre   left of his original nebraska doctrine under the dred scott decision squatter sovereignty squat out of existence tumble down like temporary scaffolding like the mould at the foundry serve through one blast and fall back into loose sand help to carry an election and then be kick to the wind his late joint   struggle with the republicans against the lecompton constitution involve nothing of the original nebraska doctrine that struggle be make on a point the right of a people to make their own constitution upon which he and the republicans have never differ the several point of the dred scott decision in connection with senator douglas care not policy constitute the piece of machinery in its present   state of advancement this be the third point gain the work   point of that machinery be first that no negro slave import as such from africa and no descendant of such slave can ever be a citizen   of any state in the sense of that term as use in the constitution of the united states this point be make in order to deprive the negro in every possible event of the benefit of this provision of the united states constitution which declare that--"the citizen of each state shall be entitle to all privilege and immunity of citizen in the several states "secondly that subject to the constitution of the united states neither congress   nor a territorial legislature   can exclude slavery from any united states territory this point be make in order that individual man may fill up   the territory with slave without danger of lose they as property and thus to enhance the chance of permanency   to the institution through all the future thirdly that whether the hold a negro in actual slavery in a free state make he free as against the holder the united states court will not decide but will leave to be decide by the court of any slave state the negro may be force into by the master this point be make not to be press immediately but if acquiesce in for a while and apparently indorse   by the people at an election then   to sustain the logical conclusion that what dred scott 's master might lawfully do with dred scott in the free state of illinois every other master may lawfully do with any other one or one thousand   slave in illinois or in any other free state auxiliary to all this and work hand in hand with it the nebraska doctrine or what be leave of it be to educate   and mould   public opinion at least northern   public opinion to not care   whether slavery be vote down   or vote up this show exactly where we now be and partially   also whither we be tend it will throw additional light on the latter to go back and run the mind over the string of historical fact already state several thing will now   appear less dark   and mysterious   than they do when   they be transpire the people be to be leave perfectly free subject only to the constitution what the constitution   have to do with it outsider could not then   see plainly enough now it be an exactly fitted niche for the dred scott decision to afterwards come in and declare the perfect freedom   of the people to be just no freedom at all why be the amendment expressly declare the right of the people to exclude slavery vote down plainly enough now the adoption of it would have spoil the niche for the dred scott decision why be the court decision hold up why even a senator 's individual opinion withhold till after   the presidential election plainly enough now the speak out then   would have damage the perfectly free argument upon which the election be to be carry why the outgoing   president 's felicitation on the indorsement why the delay of a reargument why the incoming president 's advance   exhortation in favor of the decision?these thing look   like the cautious patting   and pet   a spirited horse preparatory to mount he when it be dread that he may give the rider a fall and why the hasty after indorsement of the decision by the president and others?we can not absolutely know   that all these exact adaptation be the result of preconcert but when we see a lot of framed timber different portion of which we know have be get out at different time and place and by different workman stephen franklin roger and james for instance and when we see these timber join together and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill all the tenon and mortice exactly fitting and all the length and proportion of the different piece exactly adapt to their respective place and not a piece too many or too few not omit even scaffold or if a single piece be lack we can see the place in the frame exactly fit and prepare to yet bring such piece in in such   a case we find it impossible to not believe   that stephen and franklin and roger and james all understand one another from the beginning and all work upon a common plan   or draft   draw up before the first lick be strike it should not be overlook that by the nebraska bill the people of a state   as well as territory be to be leave perfectly free subject only to the constitution "why mention a state they be legislate for territory and not for   or about   states certainly the people of a state be   and ought to be   subject to the constitution of the united states but why be mention of this lug   into this merely territorial   law why be the people of a territory   and the people of a state   therein lump   together and their relation to the constitution therein treat as be precisely   the same?while the opinion of the court by chief justice taney in the dred scott case and the separate opinion of all the concur judge expressly declare that the constitution of the united states neither permit congress nor a territorial legislature to exclude slavery from any united states territory they all omit   to declare whether or not the same constitution permit a state or the people of a state to exclude it possibly this be a mere omission but who can be quite   sure if mclean or curtis have seek to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a state   to exclude slavery from their limit just as chase and macy seek to get such declaration in behalf of the people of a territory into the nebraska bill i ask who can be quite sure   that it would not have be vote down in the one case as it have be in the other the near approach to the point of declare the power of a state over slavery be make by judge nelson he approach it more than once use the precise idea and almost   the language too of the nebraska act on one occasion his exact language be except in case where the power be restrain by the constitution of the united states the law of the state be supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction "in what case   the power of the state be   so restrained by the u.s. constitution be leave an open   question precisely as the same question as to the restraint on the power of the territory   be leave open in the nebraska act put that   and that   together and we have another nice little niche which we may ere long see fill with another supreme court decision declare that the constitution of the united states do not permit a state   to exclude slavery from its limit and this may especially be expect if the doctrine of care not whether slavery be vote down   or vote up shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintain when make such a decision be all that slavery now lack of be alike lawful in all the states welcome or unwelcome such decision be   probably come and will soon be upon we unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be meet and overthrow we shall lie down   pleasantly dream that the people of missouri   be on the verge of make their state free and we shall awake   to the reality instead that the supreme   court have make illinois   a slave   state to meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty be the work now before all those who would prevent that consummation that be what   we have to do but how   can we well do it?there be those who denounce we openly   to their own   friend and yet whisper we softly that senator douglas   be the apt   instrument there be with which to effect that object they   do not   tell we nor have he   tell we that he wish   any such object to be effect they wish we to infer   all from the fact that he now have a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty and that he have regularly vote with we on a single point upon which he and we have never differ they remind we that he   be a very great man and that the large of we   be very small one let this be grant but a live dog   be well than a dead lion judge douglas if not a dead   lion for this work be at least a cage   and toothless   one how can he oppose the advance of slavery he do not care   anything about it his avowed mission be impress   the public heart to care   nothing about it a lead douglas democratic newspaper think douglas superior talent will be need to resist the revival of the african slave trade do douglas believe an effort to revive that trade be approach he have not say so do he really   think so but if it be how can he resist it for year he have labor to prove it a sacred right   of white man to take negro slave into the new territory can he possibly show that it be less   a sacred right to buy   they where they can be buy cheap and unquestionably they can be buy cheap in africa   than in virginia .he have do all in his power to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right of property and as such how can he   oppose the foreign slave trade how can he refuse that trade in that property shall be perfectly free"--unless he do it as a protection   to the home production and as the home producer   will probably not ask   the protection he will be wholly without a ground of opposition senator douglas hold we know that a man may rightfully be wise to day   than he be yesterday that he may rightfully change   when he find himself wrong but can we for that reason run ahead and infer   that he will   make any particular change of which he himself have give no intimation can we safely   base our   action upon any such vague   inference?now as ever i wish to not misrepresent   judge douglas position question his motive or do ought that can be personally offensive to he whenever if ever he and we can come together on principle   so that our great cause   may have assistance from his great ability i hope to have interpose no adventitious obstacle but clearly he be not now   with we he do not pretend   to be he do not promise   to ever   be our cause then must be intrust to and conduct by its own undoubted friend those whose hand be free whose heart be in the work who do care   for the result two year ago the republicans of the nation muster over thirteen hundred thousand strong we do this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger with every external circumstance against we of strange discordant and even hostile   element we gather from the four wind and form   and fight the battle through under the constant hot fire of a discipline proud and pampered enemy do we brave all then to falter   now?--now when that same enemy be waver dissever and belligerent?the result be not doubtful we shall not fail if we stand firm we shall not fail    wise council may accelerate   or mistake delay   it but soon or later the victory be sure   to come the source for this text be the collected works of abraham lincoln
fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives when we compare the condition of the country at the present day with what it be one year ago at the meeting of congress we have much reason for gratitude to that almighty providence which have never fail to interpose for our relief at the most critical period of our history one year ago the sectional strife between the north and the south on the dangerous subject of slavery have again become so intense as to threaten the peace and perpetuity of the confederacy the application for the admission of kansas as a state into the union foster this unhappy agitation and bring the whole subject once more before congress it be the desire of every patriot that such measure of legislation might be adopt as would remove the excitement from the states and confine it to the territory where it legitimately belong much have be do i be happy to say toward the accomplishment of this object during the last session of congress the supreme court of the united states have previously decide that all american citizen have an equal right to take into the territories whatever be hold as property under the law of any of the states and to hold such property there under the guardianship of the federal constitution so long as the territorial condition shall remain this be now a well establish position and the proceeding of the last session be alone want to give it practical effect the principle have be recognize in some form or other by an almost unanimous vote of both houses of congress that a territory have a right to come into the union either as a free or a slave state accord to the will of a majority of its people the just equality of all the states have thus be vindicate and a fruitful source of dangerous dissension among they have be remove whilst such have be the beneficial tendency of your legislative proceeding outside of kansas their influence have nowhere be so happy as within that territory itself leave to manage and control its own affair in its own way without the pressure of external influence the revolutionary topeka organization and all resistance to the territorial government establish by congress have be finally abandon as a natural consequence that fine territory now appear to be tranquil and prosperous and be attract increase thousand of immigrant to make it their happy home the past unfortunate experience of kansas have enforce the lesson so often already teach that resistance to lawful authority under our form of government can not fail in the end to prove disastrous to its author have the people of the territory yield obedience to the law enact by their legislature it would at the present moment have contain a large additional population of industrious and enterprise citizen who have be deter from enter its border by the existence of civil strife and organized rebellion it be the resistance to rightful authority and the persevere attempt to establish a revolutionary government under the topeka constitution which cause the people of kansas to commit the grave error of refuse to vote for delegate to the convention to frame a constitution under a law not deny to be fair and just in its provision this refusal to vote have be the prolific source of all the evil which have follow in their hostility to the territorial government they disregard the principle absolutely essential to the working of our form of government that a majority of those who vote not the majority who may remain at home from whatever cause must decide the result of an election for this reason seek to take advantage of their own error they deny the authority of the convention thus elect to frame a constitution the convention notwithstanding proceed to adopt a constitution unexceptionable in its general feature and provide for the submission of the slavery question to a vote of the people which in my opinion they be bind to do under the kansas and nebraska act this be the all important question which have alone convulse the territory and yet the opponent of the lawful government persist in their first error refrain from exercise their right to vote and prefer that slavery should continue rather than surrender their revolutionary topeka organization a wise and well spirit seem to prevail before the first monday of january last when an election be hold under the constitution a majority of the people then vote for a governor and other state officer for a member of congress and member of the state legislature this election be warmly contest by the two political party in kansas and a great vote be poll than at any previous election a large majority of the member of the legislature elect belong to that party which have previously refuse to vote the antislavery party be thus place in the ascendant and the political power of the state be in their own hand have congress admit kansas into the union under the lecompton constitution the legislature might at its very first session have submit the question to a vote of the people whether they would or would not have a convention to amend their constitution either on the slavery or any other question and have adopt all necessary mean for give speedy effect to the will of the majority thus the kansas question would have be immediately and finally settle under these circumstance i submit to congress the constitution thus frame with all the officer already elect necessary to put the state government into operation accompany by a strong recommendation in favor of the admission of kansas as a state in the course of my long public life i have never perform any official act which in the retrospect have afford i more heartfelt satisfaction its admission could have inflict no possible injury on any human being whilst it would within a brief period have restore peace to kansas and harmony to the union in that event the slavery question would ere this have be finally settle accord to the legally express will of a majority of the voter and popular sovereignty would thus have be vindicate in a constitutional manner with my deep conviction of duty i could have pursue no other course it be true that as an individual i have express an opinion both before and during the session of the convention in favor of submit the remain clause of the constitution as well as that concern slavery to the people but act in an official character neither myself nor any human authority have the power to rejudge the proceeding of the convention and declare the constitution which it have frame to be a nullity to have do this would have be a violation of the kansas and nebraska act which leave the people of the territory perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institution in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states it would equally have violate the great principle of popular sovereignty at the foundation of our institution to deprive the people of the power if they think proper to exercise it of confide to delegate elect by themselves the trust of frame a constitution without require they to subject their constituent to the trouble expense and delay of a second election it would have be in opposition to many precedent in our history commence in the very good age of the republic of the admission of territories as states into the union without a previous vote of the people approve their constitution it be to be lament that a question so insignificant when view in its practical effect on the people of kansas whether decide one way or the other should have kindle such a flame of excitement throughout the country this reflection may prove to be a lesson of wisdom and of warn for our future guidance practically consider the question be simply whether the people of that territory should first come into the union and then change any provision in their constitution not agreeable to themselves or accomplish the very same object by remain out of the union and frame another constitution in accordance with their will in either case the result would be precisely the same the only difference in point of fact be that the object would have be much soon attain and the pacification of kansas more speedily effect have it be admit as a state during the last session of congress my recommendation however for the immediate admission of kansas fail to meet the approbation of congress they deem it wise to adopt a different measure for the settlement of the question for my own part i should have be willing to yield my assent to almost any constitutional measure to accomplish this object i therefore cordially acquiesce in what have be call the english compromise and approve the act for the admission of the state of kansas into the union upon the term therein prescribe under the ordinance which accompany the lecompton constitution the people of kansas have claim double the quantity of public land for the support of common school which have ever be previously grant to any state upon enter the union and also the alternate section of land for 12 mile on each side of two railroad propose to be construct from the northern to the southern boundary and from the eastern to the western boundary of the state congress deem these claim unreasonable provide by the act of may 4 1858 to which i have just refer for the admission of the state on an equal footing with the original states but upon the fundamental condition precedent that a majority of the people thereof at an election to be hold for that purpose should in place of the very large grant of public land which they have demand under the ordinance accept such grant as have be make to minnesota and other new states under this act should a majority reject the proposition offer they it shall be deem and hold that the people of kansas do not desire admission into the union with say constitution under the condition set forth in say proposition in that event the act authorize the people of the territory to elect delegate to form a constitution and state government for themselves whenever and not before it be ascertain by a census duly and legally take that the population of say territory equal or exceed the ratio of representation require for a member of the house of representatives of the congress of the united states the delegate thus assemble shall first determine by a vote whether it be the wish of the people of the propose state to be admit into the union at that time and if so shall proceed to form a constitution and take all necessary step for the establishment of a state government in conformity with the federal constitution after this constitution shall have be form congress carry out the principle of popular sovereignty and nonintervention have leave the mode and manner of its approval or ratification by the people of the propose state to be prescribe by law and they shall then be admit into the union as a state under such constitution thus fairly and legally make with or without slavery as say constitution may prescribe "an election be hold throughout kansas in pursuance of the provision of this act on the 2d day of august last and it result in the rejection by a large majority of the proposition submit to the people by congress this be the case they be now authorize to form another constitution preparatory to admission into the union but not until their number as ascertain by a census shall equal or exceed the ratio require to elect a member to the house of representatives it be not probable in the present state of the case that a third constitution can be lawfully frame and present to congress by kansas before its population shall have reach the designate number nor be it to be presume that after their sad experience in resist the territorial law they will attempt to adopt a constitution in express violation of the provision of an act of congress during the session of 1856 much of the time of congress be occupy on the question of admit kansas under the topeka constitution again nearly the whole of the last session be devoted to the question of its admission under the lecompton constitution surely it be not unreasonable to require the people of kansas to wait before make a third attempt until the number of their inhabitant shall amount to 93,420 during this brief period the harmony of the states as well as the great business interest of the country demand that the people of the union shall not for a third time be convulse by another agitation on the kansas question by wait for a short time and act in obedience to law kansas will glide into the union without the slight impediment this excellent provision which congress have apply to kansas ought to be extend and render applicable to all territories which may hereafter seek admission into the union whilst congress possess the undoubted power of admit a new state into the union however small may be the number of its inhabitant yet this power ought not in my opinion to be exercise before the population shall amount to the ratio require by the act for the admission of kansas have this be previously the rule the country would have escape all the evil and misfortune to which it have be expose by the kansas question of course it would be unjust to give this rule a retrospective application and exclude a state which act upon the past practice of the government have already form its constitution elect its legislature and other officer and be now prepared to enter the union the rule ought to be adopt whether we consider its bearing on the people of the territories or upon the people of the exist state many of the serious dissention which have prevail in congress and throughout the country would have be avoid have this rule be establish at an early period of the government immediately upon the formation of a new territory people from different states and from foreign country rush into it for the laudable purpose of improve their condition their first duty to themselves be to open and cultivate farm to construct road to establish school to erect place of religious worship and to devote their energy generally to reclaim the wilderness and to lay the foundation of a flourishing and prosperous commonwealth if in this incipient condition with a population of a few thousand they should prematurely enter the union they be oppress by the burden of state taxation and the mean necessary for the improvement of the territory and the advancement of their own interest be thus divert to very different purpose the federal government have ever be a liberal parent to the territories and a generous contributor to the useful enterprise of the early settler it have pay the expense of their government and legislative assembly out of the common treasury and thus relieve they from a heavy charge under these circumstance nothing can be well calculate to retard their material progress than to divert they from their useful employment by prematurely exciting angry political contest among themselves for the benefit of aspire leader it be surely no hardship for embryo governor senators and member of congress to wait until the number of inhabitant shall equal those of a single congressional district they surely ought not to be permit to rush into the union with a population less than one half of several of the large county in the interior of some of the states this be the condition of kansas when it make application to be admit under the topeka constitution besides it require some time to render the mass of a population collect in a new territory at all homogeneous and to unite they on anything like a fix policy establish the rule and all will look forward to it and govern themselves accordingly but justice to the people of the several states require that this rule should be establish by congress each state be entitle to two senators and at least one representative in congress should the people of the states fail to elect a vice president the power devolve upon the senate to select this officer from the two high candidate on the list in case of the death of the president the vice president thus elect by the senate become president of the united states on all question of legislation the senators from the small states of the union have an equal vote with those from the large the same may be say in regard to the ratification of treaty and of executive appointment all this have work admirably in practice whilst it conform in principle with the character of a government institute by sovereign states i presume no american citizen would desire the slight change in the arrangement still be it not unjust and unequal to the exist state to invest some 40,000 or 50,000 people collect in a territory with the attribute of sovereignty and place they on an equal footing with virginia and new york in the senate of the united states?for these reason i earnestly recommend the passage of a general act which shall provide that upon the application of a territorial legislature declare their belief that the territory contain a number of inhabitant which if in a state would entitle they to elect a member of congress it shall be the duty of the president to cause a census of the inhabitant to be take and if find sufficient then by the term of this act to authorize they to proceed in their own way to frame a state constitution preparatory to admission into the union i also recommend that an appropriation may be make to enable the president to take a census of the people of kansas the present condition of the territory of utah when contrast with what it be one year ago be a subject for congratulation it be then in a state of open rebellion and cost what it might the character of the government require that this rebellion should be suppress and the mormons compel to yield obedience to the constitution and the law in order to accomplish this object as i inform you in my last annual message i appoint a new governor instead of brigham young and other federal officer to take the place of those who consult their personal safety have find it necessary to withdraw from the territory to protect these civil officer and to aid they as a posse comitatus in the execution of the law in case of need i order a detachment of the army to accompany they to utah the necessity for adopt these measure be now demonstrate on the 15th of september 1857 governor young issue his proclamation in the style of an independent sovereign announce his purpose to resist by force of arm the entry of the united states troop into our own territory of utah by this he require all the force in the territory to hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment 's notice to repel any and all such invasion and establish martial law from its date throughout the territory these prove to be no idle threat forts bridger and supply be vacate and burn down by the mormons to deprive our troop of a shelter after their long and fatigue march order be issue by daniel h. wells style himself lieutenant general nauvoo legion to stampede the animal of the united states troop on their march to set fire to their train to burn the grass and the whole country before they and on their flank to keep they from sleep by night surprise and to blockade the road by fell tree and destroy the ford of river etc these order be promptly and effectually obey on the 4th of october 1857 the mormons capture and burn on green river three of our supply train consist of seventy five wagon load with provision and tent for the army and carry away several hundred animal this diminish the supply of provision so materially that general johnston be oblige to reduce the ration and even with this precaution there be only sufficient leave to subsist the troop until the 1st of june our little army behave admirably in their encampment at fort bridger under these try privation in the midst of the mountain in a dreary unsettled and inhospitable region more than a thousand mile from home they pass the severe and inclement winter without a murmur they look forward with confidence for relief from their country in due season and in this they be not disappointed the secretary of war employ all his energy to forward they the necessary supply and to muster and send such a military force to utah as would render resistance on the part of the mormon hopeless and thus terminate the war without the effusion of blood in his effort he be efficiently sustain by congress they grant appropriation sufficient to cover the deficiency thus necessarily create and also provide for raise two regiment of volunteer for the purpose of quell disturbance in the territory of utah for the protection of supply and emigrant train and the suppression of indian hostility on the frontier happily there be no occasion to call these regiment into service if there have be i should have feel serious embarrassment in select they so great be the number of our brave and patriotic citizen anxious to serve their country in this distant and apparently dangerous expedition thus it have ever be and thus may it ever be the wisdom and economy of send sufficient reenforcement to utah be establish not only by the event but in the opinion of those who from their position and opportunity be the most capable of form a correct judgment general johnston the commander of the force in address the secretary of war from fort bridger under date of october 18 1857 express the opinion that unless a large force be send here from the nature of the country a protract war on their the mormon 's part be inevitable this he consider necessary to terminate the war speedily and more economically than if attempt by insufficient mean "in the meantime it be my anxious desire that the mormons should yield obedience to the constitution and the law without render it necessary to resort to military force to aid in accomplish this object i deem it advisable in april last to dispatch two distinguished citizen of the united states messrs. powell and mcculloch to utah they bear with they a proclamation address by myself to the inhabitant of utah date on the 6th day of that month warn they of their true condition and how hopeless it be on their part to persist in rebellion against the united states and offer all those who should submit to the law a full pardon for their past sedition and treason at the same time i assure those who should persist in rebellion against the united states that they must expect no further lenity but look to be rigorously deal with accord to their desert the instruction to these agent as well as a copy of the proclamation and their report be herewith submit it will be see by their report of the 3d of july last that they have fully confirm the opinion express by general johnston in the previous october as to the necessity of send reenforcement to utah in this they state that they be firmly impressed with the belief that the presence of the army here and the large additional force that have be order to this territory be the chief inducement that cause the mormon to abandon the idea of resist the authority of the united states a less decisive policy would probably have result in a long bloody and expensive war "these gentleman conduct themselves to my entire satisfaction and render useful service in execute the humane intention of the government it also afford i great satisfaction to state that governor cumming have perform his duty in an able and conciliatory manner and with the happy effect i can not in this connection refrain from mention the valuable service of colonel thomas l. kane who from motive of pure benevolence and without any official character or pecuniary compensation visit utah during the last inclement winter for the purpose of contribute to the pacification of the territory i be happy to inform you that the governor and other civil officer of utah be now perform their appropriate function without resistance the authority of the constitution and the law have be fully restore and peace prevail throughout the territory a portion of the troop send to utah be now encamp in cedar valley 44 mile southwest of salt lake city and the remainder have be order to oregon to suppress indian hostility the march of the army to salt lake city through the indianterritory have have a powerful effect in restrain the hostile feeling against the united states which exist among the indians in that region and in secure emigrant to the far west against their depredation this will also be the mean of establish military post and promote settlement along the route i recommend that the benefit of our land law and preemption system be extend to the people of utah by the establishment of a land office in that territory i have occasion also to congratulate you on the result of our negotiation with china you be inform by my last annual message that our minister have be instruct to occupy a neutral position in the hostility conduct by great britain and france against canton he be however at the same time direct to cooperate cordially with the british and french minister in all peaceful measure to secure by treaty those just concession to foreign commerce which the nation of the world have a right to demand it be impossible for i to proceed far than this on my own authority without usurp the war make power which under the constitution belong exclusively to congress besides after a careful examination of the nature and extent of our grievance i do not believe they be of such a pressing and aggravate character as would have justify congress in declare war against the chinese empire without first make another earnest attempt to adjust they by peaceful negotiation i be the more inclined to this opinion because of the severe chastisement which have then but recently be inflict upon the chinese by our squadron in the capture and destruction of the barrier fort to avenge an alleged insult to our flag the event have prove the wisdom of our neutrality our minister have execute his instruction with eminent skill and ability in conjunction with the russian plenipotentiary he have peacefully but effectually cooperate with the english and french plenipotentiary and each of the four power have conclude a separate treaty with china of a highly satisfactory character the treaty conclude by our own plenipotentiary will immediately be submit to the senate i be happy to announce that through the energetic yet conciliatory effort of our consul general in japan a new treaty have be conclude with that empire which may be expect materially to augment our trade and intercourse in that quarter and remove from our countryman the disability which have heretofore be impose upon the exercise of their religion the treaty shall be submit to the senate for approval without delay it be my earnest desire that every misunderstanding with the government of great britain should be amicably and speedily adjust it have be the misfortune of both country almost ever since the period of the revolution to have be annoy by a succession of irritate and dangerous question threaten their friendly relation this have partially prevent the full development of those feeling of mutual friendship between the people of the two country so natural in themselves and so conducive to their common interest any serious interruption of the commerce between the united states and great britain would be equally injurious to both in fact no two nation have ever exist on the face of the earth which could do each other so much good or so much harm entertain these sentiment i be gratified to inform you that the long pende controversy between the two government in relation to the question of visitation and search have be amicably adjust the claim on the part of great britain forcibly to visit american vessel on the high sea in time of peace could not be sustain under the law of nation and it have be overrule by her own most eminent jurist this question be recently bring to an issue by the repeat act of british cruiser in boarding and search our merchant vessel in the gulf of mexico and the adjacent sea these act be the more injurious and annoying as these water be traverse by a large portion of the commerce and navigation of the united states and their free and unrestricted use be essential to the security of the coastwise trade between the different states of the union such vexatious interruption could not fail to excite the feeling of the country and to require the interposition of the government remonstrance be address to the british government against these violation of our right of sovereignty and a naval force be at the same time order to the cuban water with direction to protect all vessel of the united states on the high sea from search or detention by the vessel of war of any other nation these measure receive the unqualified and even enthusiastic approbation of the american people most fortunately however no collision take place and the british government promptly avow its recognition of the principle of international law upon this subject as lay down by the government of the united states in the note of the secretary of state to the british minister at washington of april 10 1858 which secure the vessel of the united states upon the high sea from visitation or search in time of peace under any circumstance whatever the claim have be abandon in a manner reflect honor on the british government and evince a just regard for the law of nation and can not fail to strengthen the amicable relation between the two country the british government at the same time propose to the united states that some mode should be adopt by mutual arrangement between the two country of a character which may be find effective without be offensive for verify the nationality of vessel suspect on good ground of carry false color they have also invite the united states to take the initiative and propose measure for this purpose whilst decline to assume so grave a responsibility the secretary of state have inform the british government that we be ready to receive any proposal which they may feel disposed to offer have this object in view and to consider they in an amicable spirit a strong opinion be however express that the occasional abuse of the flag of any nation be an evil far less to be deprecate than would be the establishment of any regulation which might be incompatible with the freedom of the sea this government have yet receive no communication specify the manner in which the british government would propose to carry out their suggestion and i be inclined to believe that no plan which can be devise will be free from grave embarrassment still i shall form no decide opinion on the subject until i shall have carefully and in the good spirit examine any proposal which they may think proper to make i be truly sorry i can not also inform you that the complication between great britain and the united states arise out of the clayton and bulwer treaty of april 1850 have be finally adjust at the commencement of your last session i have reason to hope that emancipate themselves from far unavaile discussion the two government would proceed to settle the central american question in a practical manner alike honorable and satisfactory to both and this hope i have not yet abandon in my last annual message i state that overture have be make by the british government for this purpose in a friendly spirit which i cordially reciprocate their proposal be to withdraw these question from direct negotiation between the two government but to accomplish the same object by a negotiation between the british government and each of the central american republics whose territorial interest be immediately involve the settlement be to be make in accordance with the general tenor of the interpretation place upon the clayton and bulwer treaty by the united states with certain modification as negotiation be still pende upon this basis it would not be proper for i now to communicate their present condition a final settlement of these question be greatly to be desire as this would wipe out the last remain subject of dispute between the two country our relation with the great empires of france and russia as well as with all other government on the continent of europe except that of spain continue to be of the most friendly character with spain our relation remain in an unsatisfactory condition in my message of december last i inform you that our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to madrid have ask for his recall and it be my purpose to send out a new minister to that court with special instruction on all question pende between the two government and with a determination to have they speedily and amicably adjust if that be possible this purpose have be hitherto defeat by cause which i need not enumerate the mission to spain have be intrust to a distinguished citizen of kentucky who will proceed to madrid without delay and make another and a final attempt to obtain justice from that government spanish official under the direct control of the captain general of cuba have insult our national flag and in repeat instance have from time to time inflict injury on the person and property of our citizen these have give birth to numerous claim against the spanish government the merit of which have be ably discuss for a series of year by our successive diplomatic representative notwithstanding this we have not arrive at a practical result in any single instance unless we may except the case of the black warrior under the late administration and that present an outrage of such a character as would have justify an immediate resort to war all our attempt to obtain redress have be baffle and defeat the frequent and oft recur change in the spanish ministry have be employ as reason for delay we have be compel to wait again and again until the new minister shall have have time to investigate the justice of our demand even what have be denominate the cuban claim in which more than 100 of our citizen be directly interested have furnish no exception these claim be for the refunding of duty unjustly exact from american vessel at different custom house in cuba so long ago as the year 1844 the principle upon which they rest be so manifestly equitable and just that after a period of nearly ten year in 1854 they be recognize by the spanish government proceeding be afterwards institute to ascertain their amount and this be finally fix accord to their own statement with which we be satisfied at the sum of $ 128,635.54 just at the moment after a delay of fourteen year when we have reason to expect that this sum would be repay with interest we have receive a proposal offer to refund one third of that amount $ 42,878.41 but without interest if we would accept this in full satisfaction the offer be also accompany by a declaration that this indemnification be not found on any reason of strict justice but be make as a special favor one alleged cause for procrastination in the examination and adjustment of our claim arise from an obstacle which it be the duty of the spanish government to remove whilst the captain general of cuba be invest with general despotic authority in the government of that island the power be withhold from he to examine and redress wrong commit by official under his control on citizen of the united states instead of make our complaint directly to he at havana we be oblige to present they through our minister at madrid these be then refer back to the captain general for information and much time be thus consume in preliminary investigation and correspondence between madrid and cuba before the spanish government will consent to proceed to negotiation many of the difficulty between the two government would be obviate and a long train of negotiation avoid if the captain general be invest with authority to settle question of easy solution on the spot where all the fact be fresh and could be promptly and satisfactorily ascertain we have hitherto in vain urge upon the spanish government to confer this power upon the captain general and our minister to spain will again be instruct to urge this subject on their notice in this respect we occupy a different position from the power of europe cuba be almost within sight of our shore our commerce with it be far great than that of any other nation include spain itself and our citizen be in habit of daily and extended personal intercourse with every part of the island it be therefore a great grievance that when any difficulty occur no matter how unimportant which might be readily settle at the moment we should be oblige to resort to madrid especially when the very first step to be take there be to refer it back to cuba the truth be that cuba in its exist colonial condition be a constant source of injury and annoyance to the american people it be the only spot in the civilized world where the african slave trade be tolerate and we be bind by treaty with great britain to maintain a naval force on the coast of africa at much expense both of life and treasure solely for the purpose of arrest slaver bind to that island the late serious difficulty between the united states and great britain respect the right of search now so happily terminate could never have arise if cuba have not afford a market for slave as long as this market shall remain open there can be no hope for the civilization of benighted africa whilst the demand for slave continue in cuba war will be wage among the petty and barbarous chief in africa for the purpose of seize subject to supply this trade in such a condition of affair it be impossible that the light of civilization and religion can ever penetrate these dark abode it have be make known to the world by my predecessor that the united states have on several occasion endeavor to acquire cuba from spain by honorable negotiation if this be accomplish the last relic of the african slave trade would instantly disappear we would not if we could acquire cuba in any other manner this be due to our national character all the territory which we have acquire since the origin of the government have be by fair purchase from france spain and mexico or by the free and voluntary act of the independent state of texas in blend her destiny with our own this course we shall ever pursue unless circumstance should occur which we do not now anticipate render a departure from it clearly justifiable under the imperative and overruling law of self preservation the island of cuba from its geographical position command the mouth of the mississippi and the immense and annually increase trade foreign and coastwise from the valley of that noble river now embrace half the sovereign states of the union with that island under the dominion of a distant foreign power this trade of vital importance to these states be expose to the danger of be destroy in time of war and it have hitherto be subject to perpetual injury and annoyance in time of peace our relation with spain which ought to be of the most friendly character must always be place in jeopardy whilst the exist colonial government over the island shall remain in its present condition whilst the possession of the island would be of vast importance to the united states its value to spain be comparatively unimportant such be the relative situation of the party when the great napoleon transfer louisiana to the united states jealous as he ever be of the national honor and interest of france no person throughout the world have impute blame to he for accept a pecuniary equivalent for this cession the publicity which have be give to our former negotiation upon this subject and the large appropriation which may be require to effect the purpose render it expedient before make another attempt to renew the negotiation that i should lay the whole subject before congress this be especially necessary as it may become indispensable to success that i should be intrust with the mean of make an advance to the spanish government immediately after the signing of the treaty without await the ratification of it by the senate i be encourage to make this suggestion by the example of mr. jefferson previous to the purchase of louisiana from france and by that of mr. polk in view of the acquisition of territory from mexico i refer the whole subject to congress and commend it to their careful consideration i repeat the recommendation make in my message of december last in favor of an appropriation to be pay to the spanish government for the purpose of distribution among the claimant in the amistad case president polk first make a similar recommendation in december 1847 and it be repeat by my immediate predecessor in december 1853 i entertain no doubt that indemnity be fairly due to these claimant under our treaty with spain of october 27 1795 and whilst demand justice we ought to do justice an appropriation promptly make for this purpose could not fail to exert a favorable influence on our negotiation with spain our position in relation to the independent states south of we on this continent and especially those within the limit of north america be of a peculiar character the northern boundary of mexico be coincident with our own southern boundary from ocean to ocean and we must necessarily feel a deep interest in all that concern the well being and the fate of so near a neighbor we have always cherish the kind wish for the success of that republic and have indulge the hope that it might at last after all its trial enjoy peace and prosperity under a free and stable government we have never hitherto interfere directly or indirectly with its internal affair and it be a duty which we owe to ourselves to protect the integrity of its territory against the hostile interference of any other power our geographical position our direct interest in all that concern mexico and our well settle policy in regard to the north american continent render this an indispensable duty mexico have be in a state of constant revolution almost ever since it achieve its independence one military leader after another have usurp the government in rapid succession and the various constitution from time to time adopt have be set at naught almost as soon as they be proclaim the successive government have afford no adequate protection either to mexican citizen or foreign resident against lawless violence heretofore a seizure of the capital by a military chieftain have be generally follow by at least the nominal submission of the country to his rule for a brief period but not so at the present crisis of mexican affair a civil war have be rage for some time throughout the republic between the central government at the city of mexico which have endeavor to subvert the constitution last frame by military power and those who maintain the authority of that constitution the antagonist party each hold possession of different states of the republic and the fortune of the war be constantly change meanwhile the most reprehensible mean have be employ by both party to extort money from foreigner as well as native to carry on this ruinous contest the truth be that this fine country bless with a productive soil and a benign climate have be reduce by civil dissension to a condition of almost hopeless anarchy and imbecility it would be vain for this government to attempt to enforce payment in money of the claim of american citizen now amount to more than $ 10,000,000 against mexico because she be destitute of all pecuniary mean to satisfy these demand our late minister be furnish with ample power and instruction for the adjustment of all pende question with the central government of mexico and he perform his duty with zeal and ability the claim of our citizen some of they arise out of the violation of an express provision of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo and other from gross injury to person as well as property have remain unredressed and even unnoticed remonstrance against these grievance have be address without effect to that government meantime in various part of the republic instance have be numerous of the murder imprisonment and plunder of our citizen by different party claim and exercise a local jurisdiction but the central government although repeatedly urge thereto have make no effort either to punish the author of these outrage or to prevent their recurrence no american citizen can now visit mexico on lawful business without imminent danger to his person and property there be no adequate protection to either and in this respect our treaty with that republic be almost a dead letter this state of affair be bring to a crisis in may last by the promulgation of a decree levy a contribution pro rata upon all the capital in the republic between certain specified amount whether hold by mexicans or foreigner mr. forsyth regard this decree in the light of a force loan formally protest against its application to his countryman and advise they not to pay the contribution but to suffer it to be forcibly exact act upon this advice an american citizen refuse to pay the contribution and his property be seize by armed man to satisfy the amount not content with this the government proceed still far and issue a decree banish he from the country our minister immediately notify they that if this decree should be carry into execution he would feel it to be his duty to adopt the most decide measure that belong to the power and obligation of the representative office notwithstanding this warning the banishment be enforce and mr. forsyth promptly announce to the government the suspension of the political relation of his legation with they until the pleasure of his own government should be ascertain this government do not regard the contribution impose by the decree of the 15th may last to be in strictness a force loan and as such prohibit by the tenth article of the treaty of 1826 between great britain and mexico to the benefit of which american citizen be entitle by treaty yet the imposition of the contribution upon foreigner be consider an unjust and oppressive measure besides internal faction in other part of the republic be at the same time levy similar exaction upon the property of our citizen and interrupt their commerce there have be an entire failure on the part of our minister to secure redress for the wrong which our citizen have endure notwithstanding his persevere effort and from the temper manifest by the mexican government he have repeatedly assure we that no favorable change could be expect until the united states should give strike evidence of their will and power to protect their citizen and that severe chastening be the only earthly remedy for our grievance from this statement of fact it would have be bad than idle to direct mr. forsyth to retrace his step and resume diplomatic relation with that government and it be therefore deem proper to sanction his withdrawal of the legation from the city of mexico abundant cause now undoubtedly exist for a resort to hostility against the government still hold possession of the capital should they succeed in subdue the constitutional force all reasonable hope will then have expire of a peaceful settlement of our difficulty on the other hand should the constitutional party prevail and their authority be establish over the republic there be reason to hope that they will be animate by a less unfriendly spirit and may grant that redress to american citizen which justice require so far as they may possess the mean but for this expectation i should at once have recommend to congress to grant the necessary power to the president to take possession of a sufficient portion of the remote and unsettled territory of mexico to be hold in pledge until our injury shall be redress and our just demand be satisfied we have already exhaust every milder mean of obtain justice in such a case this remedy of reprisal be recognize by the law of nation not only as just in itself but as a means of prevent actual war but there be another view of our relation with mexico arise from the unhappy condition of affair along our southwestern frontier which demand immediate action in that remote region where there be but few white inhabitant large band of hostile and predatory indians roam promiscuously over the mexican states of chihuahua and sonora and our adjoining territories the local government of these states be perfectly helpless and be keep in a state of constant alarm by the indians they have not the power if they possess the will even to restrain lawless mexicans from pass the border and commit depredation on our remote settler a state of anarchy and violence prevail throughout that distant frontier the law be a dead letter and life and property wholly insecure for this reason the settlement of arizona be arrest whilst it be of great importance that a chain of inhabitant should extend all along its southern border sufficient for their own protection and that of the united states mail pass to and from california well found apprehension be now entertain that the indians and wander mexicans equally lawless may break up the important stage and postal communication recently establish between our atlantic and pacific possession this pass very near to the mexican boundary throughout the whole length of arizona i can imagine no possible remedy for these evil and no mode of restore law and order on that remote and unsettled frontier but for the government of the united states to assume a temporary protectorate over the northern portion of chihuahua and sonora and to establish military post within the same and this i earnestly recommend to congress this protection may be withdraw as soon as local government shall be establish in these mexican states capable of perform their duty to the united states restrain the lawless and preserve peace along the border i do not doubt that this measure will be view in a friendly spirit by the government and people of chihuahua and sonora as it will prove equally effectual for the protection of their citizen on that remote and lawless frontier as for citizen of the united states and in this connection permit i to recall your attention to the condition of arizona the population of that territory numbering as be allege more than 10,000 soul be practically without a government without law and without any regular administration of justice murder and other crime be commit with impunity this state of thing call loudly for redress and i therefore repeat my recommendation for the establishment of a territorial government over arizona the political condition of the narrow isthmus of central america through which transit route pass between the atlantic and pacific ocean present a subject of deep interest to all commercial nation it be over these transit that a large proportion of the trade and travel between the european and asiatic continent be destine to pass to the united states these route be of incalculable importance as a means of communication between their atlantic and pacific possession the latter now extend throughout seventeen degree of latitude on the pacific coast embrace the important state of california and the flourish territory of oregon and washington all commercial nation therefore have a deep and direct interest that these communication shall be render secure from interruption if an arm of the sea connect the two ocean penetrate through nicaragua and costa rica it could not be pretend that these states would have the right to arrest or retard its navigation to the injury of other nation the transit by land over this narrow isthmus occupy nearly the same position it be a highway in which they themselves have little interest when compare with the vast interest of the rest of the world whilst their right of sovereignty ought to be respect it be the duty of other nation to require that this important passage shall not be interrupt by the civil war and revolutionary outbreak which have so frequently occur in that region the stake be too important to be leave at the mercy of rival company claim to hold conflicting contract with nicaragua the commerce of other nation be not to stand still and await the adjustment of such petty controversy the government of the united states expect no more than this and they will not be satisfied with less they would not if they could derive any advantage from the nicaragua transit not common to the rest of the world its neutrality and protection for the common use of all nation be their only object they have no objection that nicaragua shall demand and receive a fair compensation from the company and individual who may traverse the route but they insist that it shall never hereafter be close by an arbitrary decree of that government if dispute arise between it and those with whom they may have enter into contract these must be adjust by some fair tribunal provide for the purpose and the route must not be close pende the controversy this be our whole policy and it can not fail to be acceptable to other nation all these difficulty might be avoid if consistently with the good faith of nicaragua the use of this transit could be throw open to general competition provide at the same time for the payment of a reasonable rate to the nicaraguan government on passenger and freight in august 1852 the accessory transit company make its first interoceanic trip over the nicaraguan route and continue in successful operation with great advantage to the public until the 18th february 1856 when it be close and the grant to this company as well as its charter be summarily and arbitrarily revoke by the government of president rivas previous to this date however in 1854 serious dispute concern the settlement of their account have arise between the company and the government threaten the interruption of the route at any moment these the united states in vain endeavor to compose it would be useless to narrate the various proceeding which take place between the party up till the time when the transit be discontinue suffice it to say that since february 1856 it have remain closed greatly to the prejudice of citizen of the united states since that time the competition have cease between the rival route of panama and nicaragua and in consequence thereof an unjust and unreasonable amount have be exact from our citizen for their passage to and from californiaa treaty be sign on the 16th day of november 1857 by the secretary of state and minister of nicaragua under the stipulation of which the use and protection of the transit route would have be secure not only to the united states but equally to all other nation how and on what pretext this treaty have fail to receive the ratification of the nicaraguan government will appear by the paper herewith communicate from the state department the principal objection seem to have be to the provision authorize the united states to employ force to keep the route open in case nicaragua should fail to perform her duty in this respect from the feebleness of that republic its frequent change of government and its constant internal dissension this have become a most important stipulation and one essentially necessary not only for the security of the route but for the safety of american citizen pass and repasse to and from our pacific possession be such a stipulation embrace in a treaty between the united states and nicaragua the knowledge of this fact would of itself most probably prevent hostile party from commit aggression on the route and render our actual interference for its protection unnecessary the executive government of this country in its intercourse with foreign nation be limit to the employment of diplomacy alone when this fail it can proceed no far it can not legitimately resort to force without the direct authority of congress except in resist and repel hostile attack it would have no authority to enter the territory of nicaragua even to prevent the destruction of the transit and protect the life and property of our own citizen on their passage it be true that on a sudden emergency of this character the president would direct any armed force in the vicinity to march to their relief but in do this he would act upon his own responsibility under these circumstance i earnestly recommend to congress the passage of an act authorize the president under such restriction as they may deem proper to employ the land and naval force of the united states in prevent the transit from be obstruct or close by lawless violence and in protect the life and property of american citizen travel thereupon require at the same time that these force shall be withdraw the moment the danger shall have pass away without such a provision our citizen will be constantly expose to interruption in their progress and to lawless violence a similar necessity exist for the passage of such an act for the protection of the panama and tehuantepec route in reference to the panama route the united states by their exist treaty with new granada expressly guarantee the neutrality of the isthmus with the view that the free transit from the one to the other sea may not be interrupt or embarrass in any future time while this treaty exist "in regard to the tehuantepec route which have be recently open under the most favorable auspex our treaty with mexico of the 30th december 1853 secure to the citizen of the united states a right of transit over it for their person and merchandise and stipulate that neither government shall interpose any obstacle thereto it also concede to the united states the right to transport across the isthmus in closed bag the mail of the united states not intend for distribution along the line of the communication also the effect of the united states government and its citizen which may be intend for transit and not for distribution on the isthmus free of custom house or other charge by the mexican government "these treaty stipulation with new granada and mexico in addition to the consideration applicable to the nicaragua route seem to require legislation for the purpose of carry they into effect the injury which have be inflict upon our citizen in costa rica and nicaragua during the last two or three year have receive the prompt attention of this government some of these injury be of the most aggravated character the transaction at virgin bay in april 1856 when a company of unarmed americans who be in no way connect with any belligerent conduct or party be fire upon by the troop of costa rica and number of they kill and wound be bring to the knowledge of congress by my predecessor soon after its occurrence and be also present to the government of costa rica for that immediate investigation and redress which the nature of the case demand a similar course be pursue with reference to other outrage in these country some of which be hardly less aggravate in their character than the transaction at virgin bay at the time however when our present minister to nicaragua be appoint in december 1857 no redress have be obtain for any of these wrong and no reply even have be receive to the demand which have be make by this government upon that of costa rica more than a year before our minister be instruct therefore to lose no time in express to those government the deep regret with which the president have witness this inattention to the just claim of the united states and in demand their prompt and satisfactory adjustment unless this demand shall be comply with at an early day it will only remain for this government to adopt such other measure as may be necessary in order to obtain for itself that justice which it have in vain attempt to secure by peaceful mean from the government of nicaragua and costa rica while it have show and will continue to show the most sincere regard for the right and honor of these republic it can not permit this regard to be meet by an utter neglect on their part of what be due to the government and citizen of the united states against new granada we have long stand cause of complaint arise out of the unsatisfied claim of our citizen upon that republic and to these have be more recently add the outrage commit upon our citizen at panama in april 1856 a treaty for the adjustment of these difficulty be conclude by the secretary of state and the minister of new granada in september 1857 which contain just and acceptable provision for that purpose this treaty be transmit to bogota and be ratify by the government of new granada but with certain amendment it be not however return to this city until after the close of the last session of the senate it will be immediately transmit to that body for their advice and consent and should this be obtain it will remove all our exist cause of complaint against new granada on the subject of claim question have arise between the two government as to the right of new granada to levy a tonnage duty upon the vessel of the united states in its port of the isthmus and to levy a passenger tax upon our citizen arrive in that country whether with a design to remain there or to pass from ocean to ocean by the transit route and also a tax upon the mail of the united states transport over the panama railroad the government of new granada have be inform that the united states would consider the collection of either of these taxis as an act in violation of the treaty between the two country and as such would be resist by the united states at the same time we be prepared to discuss these question in a spirit of amity and justice and with a sincere desire to adjust they in a satisfactory manner a negotiation for that purpose have already be commence no effort have recently be make to collect these taxis nor be any anticipate under present circumstance with the empire of brazil our relation be of the most friendly character the production of the two country and especially those of an agricultural nature be such as to invite extensive mutual exchange a large quantity of american flour be consume in brazil whilst more than treble the amount in value of brazilian coffee be consume in the united states whilst this be the case a heavy duty have be levy until very recently upon the importation of american flour into brazil i be gratify however to be able to inform you that in september last this have be reduce from $ 1.32 to about 49 cent per barrel and the duty on other article of our production have be diminish in nearly the same proportion i regret to state that the government of brazil still continue to levy an export duty of about 11 per cent on coffee notwithstanding this article be admit free from duty in the united states this be a heavy charge upon the consumer of coffee in our country as we purchase half of the entire surplus crop of that article raise in brazil our minister under instruction will reiterate his effort to have this export duty remove and it be hope that the enlightened government of the emperor will adopt this wise just and equal policy in that event there be good reason to believe that the commerce between the two country will greatly increase much to the advantage of both the claim of our citizen against the government of brazil be not in the aggregate of very large amount but some of these rest upon plain principle of justice and their settlement ought not to be long delay a renewed and earnest and i trust a successful effort will be make by our minister to procure their final adjustment on the 2d of june last congress pass a joint resolution authorize the president to adopt such measure and use such force as in his judgment may be necessary and advisable for the the purpose of the difference between the united states and the republic of paraguay in connection with the attack on the united states steamer water witch and with other measure refer to in his annual message and on the 12th of july follow they make an appropriation to defray the expense and compensation of a commissioner to that republic should the president deem it proper to make such all appointment in compliance with these enactment i have appoint a commissioner who have proceed to paraguay with full power and instruction to settle these difference in an amicable and peaceful manner if this be practicable his experience and discretion justify the hope that he may prove successful in convince the paraguayan government that it be due both to honor and justice that they should voluntarily and promptly make atonement for the wrong which they have commit against the united states and indemnify our injured citizen whom they have forcibly despoiled of their property should our commissioner prove unsuccessful after a sincere and earnest effort to accomplish the object of his mission then no alternative will remain but the employment of force to obtain just satisfaction from paraguay in view of this contingency the secretary of the navy under my direction have fit out and dispatch a naval force to rendezvous near buenos ayres which it be believe will prove sufficient for the occasion it be my earnest desire however that it may not be find necessary to resort to this last alternative when congress meet in december last the business of the country have just be crush by one of those periodical revulsion which be the inevitable consequence of our unsound and extravagant system of bank credit and inflated currency with all the element of national wealth in abundance our manufacture be suspend our useful public and private enterprise be arrest and thousand of laborer be deprive of employment and reduce to want universal distress prevail among the commercial manufacturing and mechanical class this revulsion be feel the more severely in the united states because similar cause have produce the like deplorable effect throughout the commercial nation of europe all be experience sad reverse at the same moment our manufacturer everywhere suffer severely not because of the recent reduction in the tariff of duty on import but because there be no demand at any price for their production the people be oblige to restrict themselves in their purchase to article of prime necessity in the general prostration of business the iron manufacturer in different states probably suffer more than any other class and much destitution be the inevitable consequence among the great number of workman who have be employ in this useful branch of industry there could be no supply where there be no demand to present an example there could be no demand for railroad iron after our magnificent system of railroad extend its benefit to every portion of the union have be bring to a dead pause the same consequence have result from similar cause to many other branch of useful manufacture it be self evident that where there be no ability to purchase manufacture article these can not be sell and consequently must cease to be produce no government and especially a government of such limited power as that of the united states could have prevent the late revulsion the whole commercial world seem for year to have be rush to this catastrophe the same ruinous consequence would have follow in the united states whether the duty upon foreign import have remain as they be under the tariff of 1846 or have be raise to a much high standard the tariff of 1857 have no agency in the result the general cause exist throughout the world could not have be control by the legislation of any particular country the periodical revulsion which have exist in our past history must continue to return at interval so long as our present unbounded system of bank credit shall prevail they will however probably be the less severe in future because it be not to be expect at least for many year to come that the commercial nation of europe with whose interest our own be so materially involved will expose themselves to similar calamity but this subject be treat so much at large in my last annual message that i shall not now pursue it far still i respectfully renew the recommendation in favor of the passage of a uniform bankrupt law applicable to banking institution this be all the direct power over the subject which i believe the federal government possess such a law would mitigate though it might not prevent the evil the instinct of self preservation might produce a wholesome restraint upon their banking business if they know in advance that a suspension of specie payment would inevitably produce their civil death but the effect of the revulsion be now slowly but surely pass away the energy and enterprise of our citizen with our unbounded resource will within the period of another year restore a state of wholesome industry and trade capital have again accumulate in our large city the rate of interest be there very low confidence be gradually revive and so soon as it be discover that this capital can be profitably employ in commercial and manufacturing enterprise and in the construction of railroad and other work of public and private improvement prosperity will again smile throughout the land it be vain however to disguise the fact from ourselves that a speculative inflation of our currency without a corresponding inflation in other country whose manufacture come into competition with our own must ever produce disastrous result to our domestic manufacture no tariff short of absolute prohibition can prevent these evil consequence in connection with this subject it be proper to refer to our financial condition the same cause which have produce pecuniary distress throughout the country have so reduce the amount of import from foreign country that the revenue have prove inadequate to meet the necessary expense of the government to supply the deficiency congress by the act of december 23 1857 authorize the issue of $ 20,000,000 of treasury note and this prove inadequate they authorize by the act of june 14 1858 a loan of $ 20,000,000 to be apply to the payment of appropriation make by law "no statesman would advise that we should go on increase the national debt to meet the ordinary expense of the government this would be a most ruinous policy in case of war our credit must be our chief resource at least for the first year and this would be greatly impair by having contract a large debt in time of peace it be our true policy to increase our revenue so as to equal our expenditure it would be ruinous to continue to borrow besides it may be proper to observe that the incidental protection thus afford by a revenue tariff would at the present moment to some extent increase the confidence of the manufacture interest and give a fresh impulse to our reviving business to this surely no person will object in regard to the mode of assess and collect duty under a strictly revenue tariff i have long entertain and often express the opinion that sound policy require this should be do by specific duty in case to which these can be properly apply they be well adapt to commodity which be usually sell by weight or by measure and which from their nature be of equal or of nearly equal value such for example be the article of iron of different class raw sugar and foreign wine and spirit in my deliberate judgment specific duty be the good if not the only mean of secure the revenue against false and fraudulent invoice and such have be the practice adopt for this purpose by other commercial nation besides specific duty would afford to the american manufacturer the incidental advantage to which he be fairly entitle under a revenue tariff the present system be a slide scale to his disadvantage under it when price be high and business prosperous the duty rise in amount when he least require their aid on the contrary when price fall and he be struggle against adversity the duty be diminish in the same proportion greatly to his injury neither would there be danger that a high rate of duty than that intend by congress could be levy in the form of specific duty it would be easy to ascertain the average value of any import article for a series of year and instead of subject it to an ad valorem duty at a certain rate per centum to substitute in its place an equivalent specific duty by such an arrangement the consumer would not be injure it be true he might have to pay a little more duty on a give article in one year but if so he would pay a little less in another and in a series of year these would counterbalance each other and amount to the same thing so far as his interest be concern this inconvenience would be trifle when contrast with the additional security thus afford against fraud upon the revenue in which every consumer be directly interested i have throw out these suggestion as the fruit of my own observation to which congress in their well judgment will give such weight as they may justly deserve the report of the secretary of the treasury will explain in detail the operation of that department of the government the receipt into the treasury from all source during the fiscal year end june 30 1858 include the treasury note authorize by the act of december 23 1857 be $ 70,273,869.59 which amount with the balance of $ 17,710,114.27 remain in the treasury at the commencement of the year make an aggregate for the service of the year of $ 87,983,983.86.the public expenditure during the fiscal year end june 30 1858 amount to $ 81,585,667.76 of which $ 9,684,537.99 be apply to the payment of the public debt and the redemption of treasury note with the interest thereon leave in the treasury on july 1 1858 be the commencement of the present fiscal year $ 6,398,316.10.the receipt into the treasury during the first quarter of the present fiscal year commence the 1st of july 1858 include one half of the loan of $ 20,000,000 with the premium upon it authorize by the act of june 14 1858 be $ 25,230,879.46 and the estimate receipt for the remain three quarter to the 30th of june 1859 from ordinary source be $ 38,500,000 make with the balance before state an aggregate of $ 70,129,195.56.the expenditure during the first quarter of the present fiscal year be $ 21,708,198.51 of which $ 1,010,142.37 be apply to the payment of the public debt and the redemption of treasury note and the interest thereon the estimated expenditure during the remain three quarter to june 30 1859 be $ 52,357,698.48 make an aggregate of $ 74,065,896.99 be an excess of expenditure beyond the estimate receipt into the treasury from ordinary source during the fiscal year to the 30th of june 1859 of $ 3,936,701.43 extraordinary mean be place by law within the command of the secretary of the treasury by the reissue of treasury note redeem and by negotiate the balance of the loan authorize by the act of june 14 1858 to the extent of $ 11,000,000 which if realize during the present fiscal year will leave a balance in the treasury on the 1st day of july 1859 of $ 7,063,298.57.the estimate receipt during the next fiscal year end june 30 1860 be $ 62,000,000 which with the above estimate balance of $ 7,063,298.57 make an aggregate for the service of the next fiscal year of $ 69,063,298.57 the estimated expenditure during the next fiscal year end june 30 1860 be $ 73,139,147.46 which leave a deficit of estimate mean compare with the estimated expenditure for that year commence on july 1 1859 of $ 4,075,848.89.in addition to this sum the postmaster general will require from the treasury for the service of the post office department $ 3,838,728 as explain in the report of the secretary of the treasury which will increase the estimate deficit on june 30 1860 to $ 7,914,576.89 to provide for the payment of this estimate deficiency which will be increase by such appropriation as may be make by congress not estimate for in the report of the treasury department as well as to provide for the gradual redemption from year to year of the outstanding treasury note the secretary of the treasury recommend such a revision of the present tariff as will raise the require amount after what i have already say i need scarcely add that i concur in the opinion express in his report that the public debt should not be increase by an additional loan and would therefore strongly urge upon congress the duty of make at their present session the necessary provision for meet these liability the public debt on july 1 1858 the commencement of the present fiscal year be $ 25,155,977.66.dure the first quarter of the present year the sum of $ 10,000,000 have be negotiate of the loan authorize by the act of june 14 1858 make the present outstanding public debt exclusive of treasury note $ 35,155,977.66 there be on the 1st of july 1858 of treasury note issue by authority of the act of december 23 1857 unredeemed the sum of $ 19,754,800 make the amount of actual indebtedness at that date $ 54,910,777.66 to this will be add $ 10,000,000 during the present fiscal year this be the remain half of the loan of $ 20,000,000 not yet negotiate the rapid increase of the public debt and the necessity which exist for a modification of the tariff to meet even the ordinary expense of the government ought to admonish we all in our respective sphere of duty to the practice of rigid economy the object of expenditure should be limit in number as far as this may be practicable and the appropriation necessary to carry they into effect ought to be disburse under the strict accountability enlightened economy do not consist in the refusal to appropriate money for constitutional purpose essential to the defense progress and prosperity of the republic but in take care that none of this money shall be waste by mismanagement in its application to the object designate by law comparison between the annual expenditure at the present time and what it be ten or twenty year ago be altogether fallacious the rapid increase of our country in extent and population render a corresponding increase of expenditure to some extent unavoidable this be constantly create new object of expenditure and augment the amount require for the old the true question then be have these object be unnecessarily multiply or have the amount expend upon any or all of they be large than comport with due economy in accordance with these principle the head of the different executive departments of the government have be instruct to reduce their estimate for the next fiscal year to the low standard consistent with the efficiency of the service and this duty they have perform in a spirit of just economy the estimate of the treasury war navy and interior departments have each be in some degree reduce and unless a sudden and unforeseen emergency should arise it be not anticipate that a deficiency will exist in either within the present or the next fiscal year the post office department be place in a peculiar position different from the other departments and to this i shall hereafter refer i invite congress to institute a rigid scrutiny to ascertain whether the expense in all the departments can not be still far reduce and i promise they all the aid in my power in pursue the investigation i transmit herewith the report make to i by the secretaries of war of the navy of the interior and of the postmaster general they each contain valuable information and important recommendation to which i invite the attention of congress in my last annual message i take occasion to recommend the immediate construction of ten small steamer of light draft for the purpose of increase the efficiency of the navy congress respond to the recommendation by authorize the construction of eight of they the progress which have be make in execute this authority be state in the report of the secretary of the navy i concur with he in the opinion that a great number of this class of vessel be necessary for the purpose of protect in a more efficient manner the person and property of american citizen on the high sea and in foreign country as well as in guard more effectually our own coast i accordingly recommend the passage of an act for this purpose the suggestion contain in the report of the secretary of the interior especially those in regard to the disposition of the public domain the pension and bounty land system the policy toward the indians and the amendment of our patent law be worthy of the serious consideration of congress the post office department occupy a position very different from that of the other departments for many year it be the policy of the government to render this a self sustain department and if this can not now be accomplish in the present condition of the country we ought to make as near an approach to it as may be practicable the postmaster general be place in a most embarrassing position by the exist law he be oblige to carry these into effect he have no other alternative he find however that this can not be do without heavy demand upon the treasury over and above what be receive for postage and these have be progressively increase from year to year until they amount for the last fiscal year end on the 30th of june 1858 to more than $ 4,500,000 whilst it be estimate that for the present fiscal year they will amount to $ 6,290,000 these sum be exclusive of the annual appropriation of $ 700,000 for compensation for the mail service perform for the two houses of congress and the other departments and officer of the government in the transmission of free matter "the cause of these large deficit be mainly attributable to the increase expense of transport the mail in 1852 the sum pay for this service be but a fraction above four million and a quarter since that year it have annually increase until in 1858 it have reach more than eight million and a quarter and for the service of 1859 it be estimate that it will amount to more than $ 10,000,000.the receipt of the post office department can be make to approach or to equal its expenditure only by mean of the legislation of congress in apply any remedy care should be take that the people shall not be deprive of the advantage which they be fairly entitle to enjoy from the post office department the principal remedy recommend to the consideration of congress by the postmaster general be to restore the former rate of postage upon single letter to 5 cent to substitute for the franking privilege the delivery to those now entitle to enjoy it of post office stamp for their correspondence and to direct the department in make contract for the transportation of the mail to confine itself to the payment of the sum necessary for this single purpose without require it to be transport in post coach or carriage of any particular description under the present system the expense to the government be greatly increase by require that the mail shall be carry in such vehicle as will accommodate passenger this will be do without pay from the department over all road where the travel will remunerate the contractor these recommendation deserve the grave consideration of congress i would again call your attention to the construction of a pacific railroad time and reflection have but serve to confirm i in the truth and justice of the observation which i make on this subject in my last annual message to which i beg leave respectfully to refer it be freely admit that it would be inexpedient for this government to exercise the power of construct the pacific railroad by its own immediate agent such a policy would increase the patronage of the executive to a dangerous extent and introduce a system of jobbing and corruption which no vigilance on the part of federal official could either prevent or detect this can only be do by the keen eye and active and careful supervision of individual and private interest the construction of this road ought therefore to be commit to company incorporate by the states or other agency whose pecuniary interest would be directly involve congress might then assist they in the work by grant of land or of money or both under such condition and restriction as would secure the transportation of troop and munition of war free from any charge and that of the united states mail at a fair and reasonable price the progress of event since the commencement of your last session have show how soon difficulty disappear before a firm and determined resolution at that time such a road be deem by wise and patriotic man to be a visionary project the great distance to be overcome and the intervene mountain and desert in the way be obstacle which in the opinion of many could not be surmount now after the lapse of but a single year these obstacle it have be discover be far less formidable than they be suppose to be and mail stage with passenger now pass and repass regularly twice in each week by a common wagon road between san francisco and st. louis and memphis in less than twenty five day the service have be as regularly perform as it be in former year between new york and this city whilst disclaim all authority to appropriate money for the construction of this road except that derive from the war make power of the constitution there be important collateral consideration urge we to undertake the work as speedily as possible the first and most momentous of these be that such a road would be a powerful bond of union between the states east and west of the rocky mountains this be so self evident as to require no illustration but again in a commercial point of view i consider this the great question of the day with the eastern front of our republic stretch along the atlantic and its western front along the pacific if all the part should be unite by a safe easy and rapid intercommunication we must necessarily command a very large proportion of the trade both of europe and asia our recent treaty with china and japan will open these rich and populous empire to our commerce and the history of the world prove that the nation which have gain possession of the trade with eastern asia have always become wealthy and powerful the peculiar geographical position of california and our pacific possession invite american capital and enterprise into this fruitful field to reap the rich harvest however it be an indispensable prerequisite that we shall first have a railroad to convey and circulate its product throughout every portion of the union besides such a railroad through our temperate latitude which would not be impede by the frost and snow of winter nor by the tropical heat of summer would attract to itself much of the travel and the trade of all nation pass between europe and asia on the 21st of august last lieutenant j. n. maffit of the united states brig dolphin capture the slaver echo formerly the putnam of new orleans near kay verde on the coast of cuba with more than 300 african negro on board the prize under the command of lieutenant bradford of the united states navy arrive at charleston on the 27th august when the negro 306 in number be deliver into the custody of the united states marshal for the district of south carolina they be first place in castle pinckney and afterwards in fort sumter for safe keeping and be detain there until the 19th september when the survivor 271 in number be deliver on board the united states steam niagara to be transport to the coast of africa under the charge of the agent of the united states pursuant to the provision of the act of the 3d march 1819 in addition to the act prohibit the slave trade under the second section of this act the president be authorize to make such regulation and arrangement as he may deem expedient for the safe keeping support and removal beyond the limit of the united states of all such negro mulattoe or person of color capture by vessel of the united states as may be deliver to the marshal of the district into which they be bring and to appoint a proper person or person reside upon the coast of africa as agent or agent for receive the negro mulattoe or person of color deliver from on board vessel seize in the prosecution of the slave trade by commander of united states armed vessel "a doubt immediately arise as to the true construction of this act it be quite clear from its term that the president be authorize to provide for the safe keeping support and removal of these negro up till the time of their delivery to the agent on the coast of africa but no express provision be make for their protection and support after they have reach the place of their destination still an agent be to be point to receive they in africa and it could not have be suppose that congress intend he should desert they at the moment they be receive and turn they loose on that inhospitable coast to perish for want of food or to become again the victim of the slave trade have this be the intention of congress the employment of an agent to receive they who be require to reside on the coast be unnecessary and they might have be land by our vessel anywhere in africa and leave expose to the suffering and the fate which would certainly await they mr. monroe in his special message of december 17 1819 at the first session after the act be pass announce to congress what in his opinion be its true construction he believe it to be his duty under it to follow these unfortunate into africa and make provision for they there until they should be able to provide for themselves in communicate this interpretation of the act to congress he state that some doubt have be entertain as to its true intent and meaning and he submit the question to they so that they might should it be deem advisable amend the same before further proceeding be have under it nothing be do by congress to explain the act and mr. monroe proceed to carry it into execution accord to his own interpretation this then become the practical construction when the africans from on board the echo be deliver to the marshal at charleston it become my duty to consider what disposition ought to be make of they under the law for many reason it be expedient to remove they from that locality as speedily as possible although the conduct of the authority and citizen of charleston in give countenance to the execution of the law be just what might have be expect from their high character yet a prolong continuance of 300 africans in the immediate vicinity of that city could not have fail to become a source of inconvenience and anxiety to its inhabitant where to send they be the question there be no portion of the coast of africa to which they could be remove with any regard to humanity except to liberia under these circumstance an agreement be enter into with the colonization society on the 7th of september last a copy of which be herewith transmit under which the society engage for the consideration of $ 45,000 to receive these africans in liberia from the agent of the united states and furnish they during the period of one year thereafter with comfortable shelter clothing provision and medical attendance cause the child to receive schooling and all whether child or adult to be instruct in the art of civilized life suitable to their condition this aggregate of $ 45,000 be base upon an allowance of $ 150 for each individual and as there have be considerable mortality among they and may be more before they reach africa the society have agree in an equitable spirit to make such a deduction from the amount as under the circumstance may appear just and reasonable this can not be fix until we shall ascertain the actual number which may become a charge to the society it be also distinctly agree that under no circumstance shall this government be call upon for any additional expense the agent of the society manifest a laudable desire to conform to the wish of the government throughout the transaction they assure i that after a careful calculation they would be require to expend the sum of $ 150 on each individual in comply with the agreement and they would have nothing leave to remunerate they for their care trouble and responsibility at all event i could make no well arrangement and there be no other alternative during the period when the government itself through its own agent undertake the task of provide for capture negro in africa the cost per head be very much great there having be no outstanding appropriation applicable to this purpose i could not advance any money on the agreement i therefore recommend that an appropriation may be make of the amount necessary to carry it into effect other capture of a similar character may and probably will be make by our naval force and i earnestly recommend that congress may amend the second section of the act of march 3 1819 so as to free its construction from the ambiguity which have so long exist and render the duty of the president plain in execute its provision i recommend to your favorable regard the local interest of the district of columbia as the residence of congress and the executive departments of the government we can not fail to feel a deep concern in its welfare this be heighten by the high character and the peaceful and orderly conduct of its resident inhabitant i can not conclude without perform the agreeable duty of express my gratification that congress so kindly respond to the recommendation of my last annual message by afford i sufficient time before the close of their late session for the examination of all the bill present to i for approval this change in the practice of congress have prove to be a wholesome reform it exert a beneficial influence on the transaction of legislative business and elicit the general approbation of the country it enable congress to adjourn with that dignity and deliberation so become to the representative of this great republic without having crowd into general appropriation bill provision foreign to their nature and of doubtful constitutionality and expediency let i warmly and strongly commend this precedent establish by themselves as a guide to their proceeding during the present session
to the senate and house of representatives
 the brief period which remain of your present session and the great urgency and importance of legislative action before its termination for the protection of american citizen and their property whilst in transit across the isthmus route between our atlantic and pacific possession render it my duty again to recall this subject to your notice i have heretofore present it in my annual message both in december 1857 and 1858 to which i beg leave to refer in the latter i state that--
 the executive government of this country in its intercourse with foreign nation be limit to the employment of diplomacy alone when this fail it can proceed no far it can not legitimately resort to force without the direct authority of congress except in resist and repel hostile attack it would have no authority to enter the territory of nicaragua even to prevent the destruction of the transit and protect the life and property of our own citizen on their passage it be true that on a sudden emergency of this character the president would direct any armed force in the vicinity to march to their relief but in do this he would act upon his own responsibility
 under these circumstance i earnestly recommend to congress the passage of an act authorize the president under such restriction as they may deem proper to employ the land and naval force of the united states in prevent the transit from be obstruct or close by lawless violence and in protect the life and property of american citizen travel thereupon require at the same time that these force shall be withdraw the moment the danger shall have pass away without such a provision our citizen will be constantly expose to interruption in their progress and to lawless violence
 a similar necessity exist for the passage of such an act for the protection of the panama and tehuantepec route
 another subject equally important command the attention of the senate at the last session of congress
 the republic south of the united states on this continent have unfortunately be frequently in a state of revolution and civil war ever since they achieve their independence as one or the other party have prevail and obtain possession of the port open to foreign commerce they have seize and confiscate american vessel and their cargo in an arbitrary and lawless manner and exact money from american citizen by force loan and other violent proceeding to enable they to carry on hostility the executive government of great britain france and other country possess the war make power can promptly employ the necessary mean to enforce immediate redress for similar outrage upon their subject not so the executive government of the united states
 if the president order a vessel of war to any of these port to demand prompt redress for outrage commit the offend party be well aware that in case of refusal the commander can do no more than remonstrate he can resort to no hostile act the question must then be refer to diplomacy and in many case adequate redress can never be obtain thus american citizen be deprive of the same protection under the flag of their country which the subject of other nation enjoy the remedy for this state of thing can only be supply by congress since the constitution have confide to that body alone the power to make war without the authority of congress the executive can not lawfully direct any force however near it may be to the scene of difficulty to enter the territory of mexico nicaragua or new granada for the purpose of defend the person and property of american citizen even though they may be violently assail whilst pass in peaceful transit over the tehuantepec nicaragua or panama route he can not without transcend his constitutional power direct a gun to be fire into a port or land a seaman or marine to protect the life of our countryman on shore or to obtain redress for a recent outrage on their property the banditti which inf our neighboring republic of mexico always claim to belong to one or other of the hostile party might make a sudden descent on vera cruz or on the tehuantepec route and he would have no power to employ the force on shipboard in the vicinity for their relief either to prevent the plunder of our merchant or the destruction of the transit
 in reference to country where the local authority be strong enough to enforce the law the difficulty here indicate can seldom happen but where this be not the case and the local authority do not possess the physical power even if they possess the will to protect our citizen within their limit recent experience have show that the american executive should itself be authorize to render this protection such a grant of authority thus limit in its extent could in no just sense be regard as a transfer of the war make power to the executive but only as an appropriate exercise of that power by the body to whom it exclusively belong the riot at panama in 1856 in which a great number of our citizen lose their life furnish a pointed illustration of the necessity which may arise for the exertion of this authority
 i therefore earnestly recommend to congress on whom the responsibility exclusively rest to pass a law before their adjournment confer on the president the power to protect the life and property of american citizen in the case which i have indicate under such restriction and condition as they may deem advisable the knowledge that such a law exist would of itself go far to prevent the outrage which it be intend to redress and to render the employment of force unnecessary
 without this the president may be place in a painful position before the meeting of the next congress in the present disturb condition of mexico and one or more of the other republics south of we no person can foresee what occurrence may take place before that period in case of emergency our citizen see that they do not enjoy the same protection with subject of european governments will have just cause to complain on the other hand should the executive interpose and especially should the result prove disastrous and valuable life be lose he might subject himself to severe censure for having assume a power not confide to he by the constitution it be to guard against this contingency that i now appeal to congress
 having thus recommend to congress a measure which i deem necessary and expedient for the interest and honor of the country i leave the whole subject to their wisdom and discretion

to the house of representatives of the united states
 i return with my objection to the house of representatives in which it originate the bill entitle an act donate public land to the several states and territories which may provide college for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic art present to i on the 18th instant
 this bill make a donation to the several states of 20,000 acre of the public land for each senator and representative in the present congress and also an additional donation of 20,000 acre for each additional representative to which any state may be entitle under the census of 1860
 accord to a report from the interior department base upon the present number of senators and representatives the land give to the states amount to 6,060,000 acre and their value at the minimum government price of $ 1.25 per acre to $ 7,575,000
 the object of this gift as state by the bill be the endowment support and maintenance of at least one college in each state where the lead object shall be without exclude other scientific or classical study to teach such branch of learn as be relate to agriculture and the mechanic art as the legislature of the states may respectively prescribe in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial class in the several pursuit and profession in life
 as there do not appear from the bill to be any beneficiary in existence to which this endowment can be apply each state be require to provide within five year at least not less than one college or the grant to say state shall cease in that event the say state shall be bind to pay the united states the amount receive of any land previously sell and that the title to purchaser under the state shall be valid
 the grant in land itself be confine to such states as have public land within their limit worth $ 1.25 per acre in the opinion of the governor for the remain states the secretary of the interior be direct to issue land scrip to the amount of their distributive share in acre under the provision of this act say scrip to be sell by say states and the proceed thereof apply to the use and purpose prescribe in this act and for no other use or purpose whatsoever the land be grant and the scrip be to be issue in section or subdivision of section of not less than one quarter of a section
 accord to an estimate from the interior department the number of acre which will probably be accept by state have public land within their own limit will not exceed 580,000 acre and it may be much less leave a balance of 5,480,000 acre to be provide for by scrip these grant of land and land scrip to each of the thirty three states be make upon certain condition the principal of which be that if the fund shall be lose or diminish on account of unfortunate investment or otherwise the deficiency shall be replace and make good by the respective states
 i shall now proceed to state my objection to this bill i deem it to be both inexpedient and unconstitutional
 1 this bill have be pass at a period when we can with great difficulty raise sufficient revenue to sustain the expense of the government should it become a law the treasury will be deprive of the whole or nearly the whole of our income from the sale of public land which for the next fiscal year have be estimate at $ 5,000,000
 a bare statement of the case will make this evident the minimum price at which we dispose of our land be $ 1.25 per acre at the present moment however the price have be reduce to those who purchase the bounty land warrant of the old soldier to 85 cent per acre and of these warrant there be still outstanding and unlocated as appear by a report february 12 1859 from the general land office the amount of 11,990,391 acre this have already greatly reduce the current sale by the government and diminish the revenue from this source if in addition thirty three states shall enter the market with their land scrip the price must be greatly reduce below even 85 cent per acre as much to the prejudice of the old soldier who have not already part with their land warrant as to government it be easy to perceive that with this glut of the market government can sell little or no land at $ 1.25 per acre when the price of bounty land warrant and scrip shall be reduce to half this sum this source of revenue will be almost entirely dry up under the bill the states may sell their land scrip at any price it may bring there be no limitation whatever in this respect indeed they must sell for what the scrip will bring for without this fund they can not proceed to establish their college within the five year to which they be limited it be manif therefore that to the extent to which this bill will prevent the sale of public land at $ 1.25 per acre to that amount it will have precisely the same effect upon the treasury as if we should impose a tax to create a loan to endow these state college
 surely the present be the most unpropitious moment which could have be select for the passage of this bill
 2 waive for the present the question of constitutional power what effect will this bill have on the relation establish between the federal and state government the constitution be a grant to congress of a few enumerate but most important power relate chiefly to war peace foreign and domestic commerce negotiation and other subject which can be good or alone exercise beneficially by the common government all other power be reserve to the states and to the people for the efficient and harmonious working of both it be necessary that their several sphere of action should be keep distinct from each other this alone can prevent conflict and mutual injury should the time ever arrive when the state government shall look to the federal treasury for the mean of support themselves and maintain their system of education and internal policy the character of both government will be greatly deteriorate the representative of the states and of the people feel a more immediate interest in obtain money to lighten the burden of their constituent than for the promotion of the more distant object intrust to the federal government will naturally incline to obtain mean from the federal government for state purpose if a question shall arise between an appropriation of land or money to carry into effect the object of the federal government and those of the states their feeling will be enlist in favor of the latter this be human nature and hence the necessity of keep the two government entirely distinct the preponderance of this home feeling have be manifest by the passage of the present bill the establishment of these college have prevail over the press want of the common treasury no nation ever have such an inheritance as we possess in the public land these ought to be manage with the utmost care but at the same time with a liberal spirit toward actual settler
 in the first year of a war with a powerful naval nation the revenue from custom must in a great degree cease a resort to loan will then become necessary and these can always be obtain as our father obtain they on advantageous term by pledge the public land as security in this view of the subject it would be wise to grant money to the states for domestic purpose than to squander away the public land and transfer they in large body into the hand of speculator
 a successful struggle on the part of the state government with the general government for the public land would deprive the latter of the mean of perform its high duty especially at critical and dangerous period besides it would operate with equal detriment to the good interest of the states it would remove the most wholesome of all restraint on legislative body that of be oblige to raise money by taxation from their constituent and would lead to extravagance if not to corruption what be obtain easily and without responsibility will be lavishly expend
 3 this bill should it become a law will operate greatly to the injury of the new states the progress of settlement and the increase of an industrious population own an interest in the soil they cultivate be the cause which will build they up into great and flourish commonwealth nothing could be more prejudicial to their interest than for wealthy individual to acquire large tract of the public land and hold they for speculative purpose the low price to which this land scrip will probably be reduce will tempt speculator to buy it in large amount and locate it on the good land belong to the government the eventual consequence must be that the man who desire to cultivate the soil will be compel to purchase these very land at rate much high than the price at which they could be obtain from the government
 4 it be extremely doubtful to say the least whether this bill would contribute to the advancement of agriculture and the mechanic art object the dignity and value of which can not be too highly appreciated
 the federal government which make the donation have confessedly no constitutional power to follow it into the states and enforce the application of the fund to the intended object as donor we shall possess no control over our own gift after it shall have pass from our hand it be true that the state legislature be require to stipulate that they will faithfully execute the trust in the manner prescribe by the bill but should they fail to do this what would be the consequence the federal government have no power and ought to have no power to compel the execution of the trust it would be in as helpless a condition as if even in this the time of great need we be to demand any portion of the many million of surplus revenue deposit with the states for safekeepe under the act of 1836
 5 this bill will injuriously interfere with exist college in the different states in many of which agriculture be teach as a science and in all of which it ought to be so taught these institution of learn have grow up with the growth of the country under the foster care of the states and the munificence of individual to meet the advance demand for education they have prove great blessing to the people many indeed most of they be poor and sustain themselves with difficulty what the effect will be on these institution of create an indefinite number of rival college sustain by the endowment of the federal government it be not difficult to determine
 under this bill it be provide that scientific and classical study shall not be exclude from they indeed it would be almost impossible to sustain they without such a provision for no father would incur the expense of send a son to one of these institution for the sole purpose of make he a scientific farmer or mechanic the bill itself negative this idea and declare that their object be to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial class in the several pursuit and profession of life this certainly ought to be the case in this view of the subject it would be far well if such an appropriation of land must be make to institution of learn in the several states to apply it directly to the establishment of professorship of agriculture and the mechanic art in exist college without the intervention of the state legislature it would be difficult to foresee how these legislature will manage this fund each representative in congress for whose district the proportion of 20,000 acre have be grant will probably insist that the proceed shall be expend within its limit there will undoubtedly be a struggle between different locality in each state concern the division of the gift which may end in disappoint the hope of the true friend of agriculture for this state of thing we be without remedy not so in regard to state college we might grant land to these corporation to establish agricultural and mechanical professorship and should they fail to comply with the condition on which they accept the grant we might enforce specific performance of these before the ordinary court of justice
 6 but do congress possess the power under the constitution to make a donation of public land to the different states of the union to provide college for the purpose of educate their own people
 i presume the general proposition be undeniable that congress do not possess the power to appropriate money in the treasury raise by taxis on the people of the united states for the purpose of educate the people of the respective states it will not be pretend that any such power be to be find among the specific power grant to congress nor that it be necessary and proper for carry into execution any one of these power should congress exercise such a power this would be to break down the barrier which have be so carefully construct in the constitution to separate federal from state authority we should then not only lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise for federal purpose but for every state purpose which congress might deem expedient or useful this would be an actual consolidation of the federal and state government so far as the great taxing and money power be concern and constitute a sort of partnership between the two in the treasury of the united states equally ruinous to both
 but it be contend that the public land be place upon a different footing from money raise by taxation and that the proceed arise from their sale be not subject to the limitation of the constitution but may be appropriate or give away by congress at its own discretion to states corporation or individual for any purpose they may deem expedient
 the advocate of this bill attempt to sustain their position upon the language of the second clause of the third section of the fourth article of the constitution which declare that the congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rule and regulation respect the territory or other property belong to the united states they contend that by a fair interpretation of the word dispose of in this clause congress possess the power to make this gift of public land to the states for purpose of education
 it would require clear and strong evidence to induce the belief that the framer of the constitution after having limit the power of congress to certain precise and specific object intend by employ the word dispose of to give that body unlimited power over the vast public domain it would be a strange anomaly indeed to have create two fund the one by taxation confine to the execution of the enumerate power delegate to congress and the other from the public land applicable to all subject foreign and domestic which congress might designate that this fund should be dispose of not to pay the debt of the united states nor to raise and support army nor to provide and maintain a navy nor to accomplish any one of the other great object enumerate in the constitution but be divert from they to pay the debt of the states to educate their people and to carry into effect any other measure of their domestic policy this would be to confer upon congress a vast and irresponsible authority utterly at war with the well know jealousy of federal power which prevail at the formation of the constitution the natural intendment would be that as the constitution confine congress to well define specific power the fund place at their command whether in land or money should be appropriate to the performance of the duty correspond with these power if not a government have be create with all its other power carefully limited but without any limitation in respect to the public land
 but i can not so read the word dispose of as to make they embrace the idea of give away the true meaning of word be always to be ascertain by the subject to which they be apply and the know general intent of the lawgiver congress be a trustee under the constitution for the people of the united states to dispose of their public land and i think i may venture to assert with confidence that no case can be find in which a trustee in the position of congress have be authorize to dispose of property by its owner where it have be hold that these word authorize such trustee to give away the fund intrust to his care no trustee when call upon to account for the disposition of the property place under his management before any judicial tribunal would venture to present such a plea in his defense the true meaning of these word be clearly state by chief justice taney in deliver the opinion of the court 19 howard p. 436 he say in reference to this clause of the constitution
 it begin its enumeration of power by that of dispose in other word make sale of the land or raise money from they which as we have already say be the main object of the cession from the states and which be the first thing provide for in the article
 it be unnecessary to refer to the history of the time to establish the known fact that this statement of the chief justice be perfectly well rounded that it never be intend by the framer of the constitution that these land should be give away by congress be manifest from the conclude portion of the same clause by it congress have power not only to dispose of the territory but of the other property of the united states in the language of the chief justice p. 437
 and the same power of make needful rule respect the territory be in precisely the same language apply to the other property of the united states associate the power over the territory in this respect with the power over movable or personal property that is the ship arm or munition of war which then belong in common to the state sovereignty
 the question be still clear in regard to the public land in the states and territories within the louisiana and florida purchase these land be pay for out of the public treasury from money raise by taxation now if congress have no power to appropriate the money with which these land be purchase be it not clear that the power over the land be equally limited the mere conversion of this money into land could not confer upon congress new power over the disposition of land which they have not possess over money if it could then a trustee by change the character of the fund intrust to his care for special object from money into land might give the land away or devote it to any purpose he think proper however foreign from the trust the inference be irresistible that this land partake of the very same character with the money pay for it and can be devoted to no object different from those to which the money could have be devote if this be not the case then by the purchase of a new territory from a foreign government out of the public treasury congress could enlarge their own power and appropriate the proceed of the sale of the land thus purchase at their own discretion to other and far different object from what they could have apply the purchase money which have be raise by taxation
 it have be assert truly that congress in numerous instance have grant land for the purpose of education these grant have be chiefly if not exclusively make to the new states as they successively enter the union and consist at the first of one section and afterwards of two section of the public land in each township for the use of school as well as of additional section for a state university such grant be not in my opinion a violation of the constitution the united states be a great landed proprietor and from the very nature of this relation it be both the right and the duty of congress as their trustee to manage these land as any other prudent proprietor would manage they for his own good advantage now no consideration could be present of a strong character to induce the american people to brave the difficulty and hardship of frontier life and to settle upon these land and to purchase they at a fair price than to give to they and to their child an assurance of the mean of education if any prudent individual have hold these land he could not have adopt a wise course to bring they into market and enhance their value than to give a portion of they for purpose of education as a mere speculation he would pursue this course no person will contend that donation of land to all the states of the union for the erection of college within the limit of each can be embrace by this principle it can not be pretend that an agricultural college in new york or virginia would aid the settlement or facilitate the sale of public land in minnesota or california this can not possibly be embrace within the authority which a prudent proprietor of land would exercise over his own possession i purposely avoid any attempt to define what portion of land may be grant and for what purpose to improve the value and promote the settlement and sale of the remainder without violate the constitution in this case i adopt the rule that sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof

fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives our deep and heartfelt gratitude be due to that almighty power which have bestow upon we such varied and numerous blessing throughout the past year the general health of the country have be excellent our harvest have be unusually plentiful and prosperity smile throughout the land indeed notwithstanding our demerit we have much reason to believe from the past event in our history that we have enjoy the special protection of divine providence ever since our origin as a nation we have be expose to many threatening and alarm difficulty in our progress but on each successive occasion the impending cloud have be dissipate at the moment it appear ready to burst upon our head and the danger to our institution have pass away may we ever be under the divine guidance and protection whilst it be the duty of the president from time to time to give to congress information of the state of the union i shall not refer in detail to the recent sad and bloody occurrence at harpers ferry still it be proper to observe that these event however bad and cruel in themselves derive their chief importance from the apprehension that they be but symptom of an incurable disease in the public mind which may break out in still more dangerous outrage and terminate at last in an open war by the north to abolish slavery in the south whilst for myself i entertain no such apprehension they ought to afford a solemn warning to we all to beware of the approach of danger our union be a stake of such inestimable value as to demand our constant and watchful vigilance for its preservation in this view let i implore my countryman north and south to cultivate the ancient feeling of mutual forbearance and good will toward each other and strive to allay the demon spirit of sectional hatred and strife now alive in the land this advice proceed from the heart of an old public functionary whose service commence in the last generation among the wise and conservative statesman of that day now nearly all pass away and whose first and dear earthly wish be to leave his country tranquil prosperous united and powerful we ought to reflect that in this age and especially in this country there be an incessant flux and reflux of public opinion question which in their day assume a most threatening aspect have now nearly go from the memory of man they be volcano burn out and on the lava and ashe and squalid scoria of old eruption grow the peaceful olive the cheer vine and the sustain corn such in my opinion will prove to be the fate of the present sectional excitement should those who wisely seek to apply the remedy continue always to confine their effort within the pale of the constitution if this course be pursue the exist agitation on the subject of domestic slavery like everything human will have its day and give place to other and less threatening controversy public opinion in this country be all powerful and when it reach a dangerous excess upon any question the good sense of the people will furnish the corrective and bring it back within safe limit still to hasten this auspicious result at the present crisis we ought to remember that every rational creature must be presume to intend the natural consequence of his own teaching those who announce abstract doctrine subversive of the constitution and the union must not be surprised should their heated partisan advance one step far and attempt by violence to carry these doctrine into practical effect in this view of the subject it ought never to be forget that however great may have be the political advantage result from the union to every portion of our common country these would all prove to be as nothing should the time ever arrive when they can not be enjoy without serious danger to the personal safety of the people of fifteen member of the confederacy if the peace of the domestic fireside throughout these states should ever be invade if the mother of family within this extensive region should not be able to retire to rest at night without suffer dreadful apprehension of what may be their own fate and that of their child before the morning it would be vain to recount to such a people the political benefit which result to they from the union self preservation be the first instinct of nature and therefore any state of society in which the sword be all the time suspend over the head of the people must at last become intolerable but i indulge in no such gloomy foreboding on the contrary i firmly believe that the event at harpers ferry by cause the people to pause and reflect upon the possible peril to their cherished institution will be the mean under providence of allay the exist excitement and prevent further outbreak of a similar character they will resolve that the constitution and the union shall not be endanger by rash counsel know that should the silver cord be loose or the golden bowl be break at the fountain human power could never reunite the scattered and hostile fragment i cordially congratulate you upon the final settlement by the supreme court of the united states of the question of slavery in the territories which have present an aspect so truly formidable at the commencement of my administration the right have be establish of every citizen to take his property of any kind include slave into the common territories belong equally to all the states of the confederacy and to have it protect there under the federal constitution neither congress nor a territorial legislature nor any human power have any authority to annul or impair this vest right the supreme judicial tribunal of the country which be a coordinate branch of the government have sanction and affirm these principle of constitutional law so manifestly just in themselves and so well calculate to promote peace and harmony among the states it be a striking proof of the sense of justice which be inherent in our people that the property in slave have never be disturb to my knowledge in any of the territories even throughout the late trouble in kansas there have not be any attempt as i be credibly inform to interfere in a single instance with the right of the master have any such attempt be make the judiciary would doubtless have afford an adequate remedy should they fail to do this hereafter it will then be time enough to strengthen their hand by further legislation have it be decide that either congress or the territorial legislature possess the power to annul or impair the right to property in slave the evil would be intolerable in the latter event there would be a struggle for a majority of the member of the legislature at each successive election and the sacred right of property hold under the federal constitution would depend for the time be on the result the agitation would thus be render incessant whilst the territorial condition remain and its baneful influence would keep alive a dangerous excitement among the people of the several state thus have the status of a territory during the intermediate period from its first settlement until it shall become a state be irrevocably fix by the final decision of the supreme court fortunate have this be for the prosperity of the territories as well as the tranquillity of the states now emigrant from the north and the south the east and the west will meet in the territories on a common platform having bring with they that specie of property well adapt in their own opinion to promote their welfare from natural cause the slavery question will in each case soon virtually settle itself and before the territory be prepare for admission as a state into the union this decision one way or the other will have be a foregone conclusion meanwhile the settlement of the new territory will proceed without serious interruption and its progress and prosperity will not be endanger or retard by violent political struggle when in the progress of event the inhabitant of any territory shall have reach the number require to form a state they will then proceed in a regular manner and in the exercise of the right of popular sovereignty to form a constitution preparatory to admission into the union after this have be do to employ the language of the kansas and nebraska act they shall be receive into the union with or without slavery as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission this sound principle have happily be recognize in some form or other by an almost unanimous vote of both houses of the last congress all lawful mean at my command have be employ and shall continue to be employ to execute the law against the african slave trade after a most careful and rigorous examination of our coast and a thorough investigation of the subject we have not be able to discover that any slave have be import into the united states except the cargo by the wanderer number between three and four hundred those engage in this unlawful enterprise have be rigorously prosecute but not with as much success as their crime have deserve a number of they be still under prosecution our history prove that the father of the republic in advance of all other nation condemn the african slave trade it be notwithstanding deem expedient by the framer of the constitution to deprive congress of the power to prohibit the migration or importation of such person as any of the states now exist shall think proper to admit prior to the year 1808 it will be see that this restriction on the power of congress be confine to such state only as might think proper to admit the importation of slave it do not extend to other states or to the trade carry on abroad accordingly we find that so early as the 22d march 1794 congress pass an act impose severe penalty and punishment upon citizen and resident of the united states who should engage in this trade between foreign nation the provision of this act be extend and enforce by the act of 10th may 1800.again the states themselves have a clear right to waive the constitutional privilege intend for their benefit and to prohibit by their own law this trade at any time they think proper previous to 1808 several of they exercise this right before that period and among they some contain the great number of slave this give to congress the immediate power to act in regard to all such state because they themselves have remove the constitutional barrier congress accordingly pass an act on 28th february 1803 to prevent the importation of certain person into certain states where by the law thereof their admission be prohibit in this manner the importation of african slave into the united states be to a great extent prohibit some year in advance of 1808.as the year 1808 approach congress determine not to suffer this trade to exist even for a single day after they have the power to abolish it on the 2d of march 1807 they pass an act to take effect from and after the 1st day of january 1808 prohibit the importation of african slave into the united states this be follow by subsequent act of a similar character to which i need not specially refer such be the principle and such the practice of our ancestor more than fifty year ago in regard to the african slave trade it do not occur to the revered patriot who have be delegate to the convention and afterwards become member of congress that in pass these law they have violate the constitution which they have frame with so much care and deliberation they suppose that to prohibit congress in express term from exercise a specify power before an appoint day necessarily involve the right to exercise this power after that day have arrive if this be not the case the framer of the constitution have expend much labor in vain have they imagine that congress would possess no power to prohibit the trade either before or after 1808 they would not have take so much care to protect the states against the exercise of this power before that period nay more they would not have attach such vast importance to this provision as to have exclude it from the possibility of future repeal or amendment to which other portion of the constitution be expose it would then have be wholly unnecessary to ingraft on the fifth article of the constitution prescribe the mode of its own future amendment the proviso that no amendment which may be make prior to the year 1808 shall in any manner affect the provision in the constitution secure to the states the right to admit the importation of african slave previous to that period accord to the adverse construction the clause itself on which so much care and discussion have be employ by the member of the convention be an absolute nullity from the beginning and all that have since be do under it a mere usurpation it be well and wise to confer this power on congress because have it be leave to the states its efficient exercise would have be impossible in that event any one state could have effectually continue the trade not only for itself but for all the other slave states though never so much against their will and why because african slave when once bring within the limit of any one state in accordance with its law can not practically be exclude from any state where slavery exist and even if all the states have separately pass law prohibit the importation of slave these law would have fail of effect for want of a naval force to capture the slaver and to guard the coast such a force no state can employ in time of peace without the consent of congress these act of congress it be believe have with very rare and insignificant exception accomplish their purpose for a period of more than half a century there have be no perceptible addition to the number of our domestic slave during this period their advancement in civilization have far surpass that of any other portion of the african race the light and the blessing of christianity have be extend to they and both their moral and physical condition have be greatly improve reopen the trade and it would be difficult to determine whether the effect would be more deleterious on the interest of the master or on those of the native bear slave of the evil to the master the one most to be dread would be the introduction of wild heathen and ignorant barbarian among the sober orderly and quiet slave whose ancestor have be on the soil for several generation this might tend to barbarize demoralize and exasperate the whole mass and produce most deplorable consequence the effect upon the exist slave would if possible be still more deplorable at present he be treat with kindness and humanity he be well feed well clothe and not overwork his condition be incomparably well than that of the coolie which modern nation of high civilization have employ as a substitute for african slave both the philanthropy and the self interest of the master have combine to produce this humane result but let this trade be reopen and what will be the effect the same to a considerable extent as on a neighboring island the only spot now on earth where the african slave trade be openly tolerate and this in defiance of solemn treaty with a power abundantly able at any moment to enforce their execution there the master intent upon present gain extort from the slave as much labor as his physical power be capable of endure know that when death come to his relief his place can be supply at a price reduce to the low point by the competition of rival african slave trader should this ever be the case in our country which i do not deem possible the present useful character of the domestic institution wherein those too old and too young to work be provide for with care and humanity and those capable of labor be not overtaske would undergo an unfortunate change the feeling of reciprocal dependence and attachment which now exist between master and slave would be convert into mutual distrust and hostility but we be oblige as a christian and moral nation to consider what would be the effect upon unhappy africa itself if we should reopen the slave trade this would give the trade an impulse and extension which it have never have even in its palmy day the numerous victim require to supply it would convert the whole slave coast into a perfect pandemonium for which this country would be hold responsible in the eye both of god and man its petty tribe would then be constantly engage in predatory war against each other for the purpose of seize slave to supply the american market all hope of african civilization would thus be end on the other hand when a market for african slave shall no long be furnish in cuba and thus all the world be close against this trade we may then indulge a reasonable hope for the gradual improvement of africa the chief motive of war among the tribe will cease whenever there be no long any demand for slave the resource of that fertile but miserable country might then be develop by the hand of industry and afford subject for legitimate foreign and domestic commerce in this manner christianity and civilization may gradually penetrate the exist gloom the wisdom of the course pursue by this government toward china have be vindicate by the event whilst we sustain a neutral position in the war wage by great britain and france against the chinese empire our late minister in obedience to his instruction judiciously cooperate with the minister of these power in all peaceful measure to secure by treaty the just concession demand by the interest of foreign commerce the result be that satisfactory treaty have be conclude with china by the respective minister of the united states great britain france and russia our treaty or general convention of peace amity and commerce with that empire be conclude at tien tsin on the 18th june 1858 and be ratify by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate on the 21st december follow on the 15th december 1858 john e. ward a distinguished citizen of georgia be duly commission as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to china he leave the united states for the place of his destination on the 5th of february 1859 bear with he the ratified copy of this treaty and arrive at shanghai on the 28th may from thence he proceed to peking on the 16th june but do not arrive in that city until the 27th july accord to the term of the treaty the ratification be to be exchange on or before the 18th june 1859 this be render impossible by reason and event beyond his control not necessary to detail but still it be due to the chinese authority at shanghai to state that they always assure he no advantage should be take of the delay and this pledge have be faithfully redeem on the arrival of mr. ward at peking he request an audience of the emperor to present his letter of credence this he do not obtain in consequence of his very proper refusal to submit to the humiliating ceremony require by the etiquette of this strange people in approach their sovereign nevertheless the interview on this question be conduct in the most friendly spirit and with all due regard to his personal feeling and the honor of his country when a presentation to his majesty be find to be impossible the letter of credence from the president be receive with peculiar honor by kweiliang the emperor 's prime minister and the second man in the empire to the emperor himself the ratification of the treaty be afterwards on the 16th of august exchange in proper form at peit sang as the exchange do not take place until after the day prescribe by the treaty it be deem proper before its publication again to submit it to the senate it be but simple justice to the chinese authority to observe that throughout the whole transaction they appear to have act in good faith and in a friendly spirit toward the united states it be true this have be do after their own peculiar fashion but we ought to regard with a lenient eye the ancient custom of an empire date back for thousand of year so far as this may be consistent with our own national honor the conduct of our minister on the occasion have receive my entire approbation in order to carry out the spirit of this treaty and to give it full effect it become necessary to conclude two supplemental convention the one for the adjustment and satisfaction of the claim of our citizen and the other to fix the tariff on import and export and to regulate the transit duty and trade of our merchant with china this duty be satisfactorily perform by our late minister these convention bear date at shanghai on the 8th november 1858 having be consider in the light of bind agreement subsidiary to the principal treaty and to be carry into execution without delay they do not provide for any formal ratification or exchange of ratification by the contracting party this be not deem necessary by the chinese who be already proceed in good faith to satisfy the claim of our citizen and it be hope to carry out the other provision of the convention still i think it be proper to submit they to the senate by which they be ratify on the 3d of march 1859 the ratified copy however do not reach shanghai until after the departure of our minister to peking and these convention could not therefore be exchange at the same time with the principal treaty no doubt be entertain that they will be ratify and exchange by the chinese government should this be think advisable but under the circumstance present i shall consider they bind engagement from their date on both party and cause they to be publish as such for the information and guidance of our merchant trade with the chinese empire it afford i much satisfaction to inform you that all our difficulty with the republic of paraguay have be satisfactorily adjust it happily do not become necessary to employ the force for this purpose which congress have place at my command under the joint resolution of 2d june 1858 on the contrary the president of that republic in a friendly spirit accede promptly to the just and reasonable demand of the government of the united states our commissioner arrive at assumption the capital of the republic on the 25th of january 1859 and leave it on the 17th of february have in three week ably and successfully accomplish all the object of his mission the treaty which he have conclude will be immediately submit to the senate in the view that the employment of other than peaceful mean might become necessary to obtain just satisfaction from paraguay a strong naval force be concentrate in the water of the la plata to await contingency whilst our commissioner ascend the river to assumption the navy department be entitle to great credit for the promptness efficiency and economy with which this expedition be fit out and conduct it consist of 19 armed vessel great and small carry 200 gun and 2,500 man all under the command of the veteran and gallant shubrick the entire expense of the expedition have be defray out of the ordinary appropriation for the naval service except the sum of $ 289,000 apply to the purchase of seven of the steamer constitute a part of it under the authority of the naval appropriation act of the 3d march last it be believe that these steamer be worth more than their cost and they be all now usefully and actively employ in the naval service the appearance of so large a force fit out in such a prompt manner in the far distant water of the la plata and the admirable conduct of the officer and man employ in it have have a happy effect in favor of our country throughout all that remote portion of the world our relation with the great empires of france and russia as well as with all other government on the continent of europe unless we may except that of spain happily continue to be of the most friendly character in my last annual message i present a statement of the unsatisfactory condition of our relation with spain and i regret to say that this have not materially improve without special reference to other claim even the cuban claim the payment of which have be ably urge by our minister and in which more than a hundred of our citizen be directly interested remain unsatisfied notwithstanding both their justice and their amount $ 128,635.54 have be recognize and ascertain by the spanish government itself i again recommend that an appropriation be make to be pay to the spanish government for the purpose of distribution among the claimant in the amistad case in common with two of my predecessor i entertain no doubt that this be require by our treaty with spain of the 27th october 1795 the failure to discharge this obligation have be employ by the cabinet of madrid as a reason against the settlement of our claim i need not repeat the argument which i urge in my last annual message in favor of the acquisition of cuba by fair purchase my opinion on that measure remain unchanged i therefore again invite the serious attention of congress to this important subject without a recognition of this policy on their part it will be almost impossible to institute negotiation with any reasonable prospect of success until a recent period there be good reason to believe that i should be able to announce to you on the present occasion that our difficulty with great britain arise out of the clayton and bulwer treaty have be finally adjust in a manner alike honorable and satisfactory to both party from cause however which the british government have not anticipate they have not yet complete treaty arrangement with the republics of honduras and nicaragua in pursuance of the understanding between the two government it be nevertheless confidently expect that this good work will ere long be accomplish whilst indulge the hope that no other subject remain which could disturb the good understanding between the two country the question arise out of the adverse claim of the party to the island of san juan under the oregon treaty of the 15th june 1846 suddenly assume a threatening prominence in order to prevent unfortunate collision on that remote frontier the late secretary of state on the 17th july 1855 address a note to mr. crampton then british minister at washington communicate to he a copy of the instruction which he mr. marcy have give on the 14th july to governor stevens of washington territory have a special reference to an apprehend conflict between our citizen and the british subject on the island of san juan to prevent this the governor be instruct that the officer of the territory should abstain from all act on the dispute ground which be calculate to provoke any conflict so far as it can be do without imply the concession to the authority of great britain of an exclusive right over the premise the title ought to be settle before either party should attempt to exclude the other by force or exercise complete and exclusive sovereign right within the fairly dispute limit in acknowledge the receipt on the next day of mr. marcy 's note the british minister express his entire concurrence in the propriety of the course recommend to the governor of washington territory by your mr. marcy 's instruction to that officer and state that he have lose no time in transmit a copy of that document to the governor general of british north america and have earnestly recommend to his excellency to take such measure as to he may appear well calculate to secure on the part of the british local authority and the inhabitant of the neighborhood of the line in question the exercise of the same spirit of forbearance which be inculcate by you mr. marcy on the authority and citizen of the united states "thus matter remain upon the faith of this arrangement until the 9th july last when general harney pay a visit to the island he find upon it twenty five american resident with their family and also an establishment of the hudsons bay company for the purpose of raise sheep a short time before his arrival one of these resident have shoot an animal belong to the company whilst trespass upon his premise for which however he offer to pay twice its value but that be refuse soon after the chief factor of the company at victoria mr. dalles son in law of governor douglas come to the island in the british sloop of war satellite and threaten to take this american mr. cutler by force to victoria to answer for the trespass he have commit the american seize his rifle and tell mr. dalles if any such attempt be make he would kill he upon the spot the affair then end "under these circumstance the american settler present a petition to the general through the united states inspector of custom mr. hubbs to place a force upon the island to protect they from the indians as well as the oppressive interference of the authority of the hudsons bay company at victoria with their right as american citizen the general immediately respond to this petition and order captain george e. pickett ninth infantry to establish his company on bellevue or san juan island on some suitable position near the harbor at the southeastern extremity this order be promptly obey and a military post be establish at the place designate the force be afterwards increase so that by the last return the whole number of troop then on the island amount in the aggregate to 691 man whilst i do not deem it proper on the present occasion to go far into the subject and discuss the weight which ought to be attach to the statement of the british colonial authority contest the accuracy of the information on which the gallant general act it be due to he that i should thus present his own reason for issue the order to captain pickett from these it be quite clear his object be to prevent the british authority on vancouvers island from exercise jurisdiction over american resident on the island of san juan as well as to protect they against the incursion of the indians much excitement prevail for some time throughout that region and serious danger of collision between the party be apprehend the british have a large naval force in the vicinity and it be but an act of simple justice to the admiral on that station to state that he wisely and discreetly forbore to commit any hostile act but determine to refer the whole affair to his government and await their instruction this aspect of the matter in my opinion demand serious attention it would have be a great calamity for both nation have they be precipitate into act of hostility not on the question of title to the island but merely concern what should be its condition during the intervene period whilst the two government might be employ in settle the question to which of they it belong for this reason lieutenant general scott be dispatch on the 17th of september last to washington territory to take immediate command of the united states force on the pacific coast should he deem this necessary the main object of his mission be to carry out the spirit of the precautionary arrangement between the late secretary of state and the british minister and thus to preserve the peace and prevent collision between the british and american authority pende the negotiation between the two government entertain no doubt of the validity of our title i need scarcely add that in any event american citizen be to be place on a footing at least as favorable as that of british subject it be understand that captain pickett 's company should remain on the island it be proper to observe that consider the distance from the scene of action and in ignorance of what might have transpire on the spot before the general 's arrival it be necessary to leave much to his discretion and i be happy to state the event have prove that this discretion could not have be intrust to more competent hand general scott have recently return from his mission having successfully accomplish its object and there be no long any good reason to apprehend a collision between the force of the two country during the pendency of the exist negotiation i regret to inform you that there have be no improvement in the affair of mexico since my last annual message and i be again oblige to ask the earnest attention of congress to the unhappy condition of that republic the constituent congress of mexico which adjourn on the 17th february 1857 adopt a constitution and provide for a popular election this take place in the following july 1857 and general comonfort be choose president almost without opposition at the same election a new congress be choose whose first session commence on the 16th of september 1857 by the constitution of 1857 the presidential term be to begin on the 1st of december 1857 and continue for four year on that day general comonfort appear before the assemble congress in the city of mexico take the oath to support the new constitution and be duly inaugurate as president within a month afterwards he have be drive from the capital and a military rebellion have assign the supreme power of the republic to general zuloaga the constitution provide that in the absence of the president his office should devolve upon the chief justice of the supreme court and general comonfort having leave the country this functionary general juarez proceed to form at guanajuato a constitutional government before this be officially know however at the capital the government of zuloaga have be recognize by the entire diplomatic corps include the minister of the united states as the de facto government of mexico the constitutional president nevertheless maintain his position with firmness and be soon establish with his cabinet at vera cruz meanwhile the government of zuloaga be earnestly resist in many part of the republic and even in the capital a portion of the army having pronounce against it its function be declare terminate and an assembly of citizen be invite for the choice of a new president this assembly elect general miramort but that officer repudiate the plan under which he be choose and zuloaga be thus restore to his previous position he assume it however only to withdraw from it and miramon having become by his appointment president substitute continue with that title at the head of the insurgent party in my last annual message i communicate to congress the circumstance under which the late minister of the united states suspend his official relation with the central government and withdraw from the country it be impossible to maintain friendly intercourse with a government like that at the capital under whose usurped authority wrong be constantly commit but never redress have this be an established government with its power extend by the consent of the people over the whole of mexico a resort to hostility against it would have be quite justifiable and indeed necessary but the country be a prey to civil war and it be hope that the success of the constitutional president might lead to a condition of thing less injurious to the united states this success become so probable that in january last i employ a reliable agent to visit mexico and report to i the actual condition and prospect of the contend party in consequence of his report and from information which reach i from other source favorable to the prospect of the constitutional cause i feel justified in appoint a new minister to mexico who might embrace the early suitable opportunity of restore our diplomatic relation with that republic for this purpose a distinguished citizen of maryland be select who proceed on his mission on the 8th of march last with discretionary authority to recognize the government of president juarez if on his arrival in mexico he should find it entitle to such recognition accord to the established practice of the united states on the 7th of april follow mr. mclane present his credential to president juarez have no hesitation in pronounce the government of juarez to be the only exist government of the republic he be cordially receive by the authority at vera cruz and they have ever since manifest the most friendly disposition toward the united states unhappily however the constitutional government have not be able to establish its power over the whole republic it be support by a large majority of the people and the states but there be important part of the country where it can enforce no obedience general miramon maintain himself at the capital and in some of the distant provinces there be military governor who pay little respect to the decree of either government in the meantime the excess which always attend upon civil war especially in mexico be constantly recur outrage of the bad description be commit both upon person and property there be scarcely any form of injury which have not be suffer by our citizen in mexico during the last few year we have be nominally at peace with that republic but so far as the interest of our commerce or of our citizen who have visit the country as merchant shipmaster or in other capacity be concern we might as well have be at war life have be insecure property unprotected and trade impossible except at a risk of loss which prudent man can not be expect to incur important contract involve large expenditure enter into by the central government have be set at defiance by the local government peaceful american resident occupy their rightful possession have be suddenly expel the country in defiance of treaty and by the mere force of arbitrary power even the course of justice have not be safe from control and a recent decree of miramort permit the intervention of government in all suit where either party be a foreigner vessel of the united states have be seize without law and a consular officer who protest against such seizure have be fine and imprison for disrespect to the authority military contribution have be levy in violation of every principle of right and the american who resist the lawless demand have have his property forcibly take away and have be himself banish from a conflict of authority in different part of the country tariff duty which have be pay in one place have be exact over again in another place large number of our citizen have be arrest and imprison without any form of examination or any opportunity for a hearing and even when release have only obtain their liberty after much suffering and injury and without any hope of redress the wholesale massacre of crabbe and his associate without trial in sonora as well as the seizure and murder of four sick americans who have take shelter in the house of an american upon the soil of the united states be communicate to congress at its last session murder of a still more atrocious character have be commit in the very heart of mexico under the authority of miramon 's government during the present year some of these be only worthy of a barbarous age and if they have not be dearly prove would have seem impossible in a country which claim to be civilized of this description be the brutal massacre in april last by order of general marquez of three american physician who be seize in the hospital at tacubaya while attend upon the sick and the dying of both party and without trial as without crime be hurry away to speedy execution little less shocking be the recent fate of ormond chase who be shoot in tepic on the 7th of august by order of the same mexican general not only without a trial but without any conjecture by his friend of the cause of his arrest he be represent as a young man of good character and intelligence who have make numerous friend in tepic by the courage and humanity which he have display on several try occasion and his death be as unexpected as it be shocking to the whole community other outrage might be enumerate but these be sufficient to illustrate the wretched state of the country and the unprotected condition of the person and property of our citizen in mexico in all these case our minister have be constant and faithful in their demand for redress but both they and this government which they have successively represent have be wholly powerless to make their demand effective their testimony in this respect and in reference to the only remedy which in their judgment would meet the exigency have be both uniform and emphatic nothing but a manifestation of the power of the government of the united states write our late minister in 1856 and of its purpose to punish these wrong will avail i assure you that the universal belief here be that there be nothing to be apprehend from the government of the united states and that local mexican official can commit these outrage upon american citizen with absolute impunity i hope the president write our present minister in august last will feel authorize to ask from congress the power to enter mexico with the military force of the united states at the call of the constitutional authority in order to protect the citizen and the treaty right of the united states unless such a power be confer upon he neither the one nor the other will be respect in the exist state of anarchy and disorder and the outrage already perpetrate will never be chastise and as i assure you in my no 23 all these evil must increase until every vestige of order and government disappear from the country i have be reluctantly lead to the same opinion and in justice to my countryman who have suffer wrong from mexico and who may still suffer they i feel bound to announce this conclusion to congress the case present however be not merely a case of individual claim although our just claim against mexico have reach a very large amount nor be it merely the case of protection to the life and property of the few americans who may still remain in mexico although the life and property of every american citizen ought to be sacredly protect in every quarter of the world but it be a question which relate to the future as well as to the present and the past and which involve indirectly at least the whole subject of our duty to mexico as a neighboring state the exercise of the power of the united states in that country to redress the wrong and protect the right of our own citizen be none the less to be desire because efficient and necessary aid may thus be render at the same time to restore peace and order to mexico itself in the accomplishment of this result the people of the united states must necessarily feel a deep and earnest interest mexico ought to be a rich and prosperous and powerful republic she possess an extensive territory a fertile soil and an incalculable store of mineral wealth she occupy an important position between the gulf and the ocean for transit route and for commerce be it possible that such a country as this can be give up to anarchy and ruin without an effort from any quarter for its rescue and its safety will the commercial nation of the world which have so many interest connect with it remain wholly indifferent to such a result can the united states especially which ought to share most largely in its commercial intercourse allow their immediate neighbor thus to destroy itself and injure they yet without support from some quarter it be impossible to perceive how mexico can resume her position among nation and enter upon a career which promise any good result the aid which she require and which the interest of all commercial country require that she should have it belong to this government to render not only by virtue of our neighborhood to mexico along whose territory we have a continuous frontier of nearly a thousand mile but by virtue also of our establish policy which be inconsistent with the intervention of any european power in the domestic concern of that republic the wrong which we have suffer from mexico be before the world and must deeply impress every american citizen a government which be either unable or unwilling to redress such wrong be derelict to its high duty the difficulty consist in select and enforce the remedy we may in vain apply to the constitutional government at vera cruz although it be well disposed to do we justice for adequate redress whilst its authority be acknowledge in all the important port and throughout the seacoast of the republic its power do not extend to the city of mexico and the states in its vicinity where nearly all the recent outrage have be commit on american citizen we must penetrate into the interior before we can reach the offender and this can only be do by pass through the territory in the occupation of the constitutional government the most acceptable and least difficult mode of accomplish the object will be to act in concert with that government their consent and their aid might i believe be obtain but if not our obligation to protect our own citizen in their just right secure by treaty would not be the less imperative for these reason i recommend to congress to pass a law authorize the president under such condition as they may deem expedient to employ a sufficient military force to enter mexico for the purpose of obtain indemnity for the past and security for the future i purposely refrain from any suggestion as to whether this force shall consist of regular troop or volunteer or both this question may be most appropriately leave to the decision of congress i would merely observe that should volunteer be select such a force could be easily raise in this country among those who sympathize with the suffering of our unfortunate fellow citizen in mexico and with the unhappy condition of that republic such an accession to the force of the constitutional government would enable it soon to reach the city of mexico and extend its power over the whole republic in that event there be no reason to doubt that the just claim of our citizen would be satisfied and adequate redress obtain for the injury inflict upon they the constitutional government have ever evince a strong desire to do justice and this might be secure in advance by a preliminary treaty it may be say that these measure will at least indirectly be inconsistent with our wise and settle policy not to interfere in the domestic concern of foreign nation but do not the present case fairly constitute an exception an adjoining republic be in a state of anarchy and confusion from which she have prove wholly unable to extricate herself she be entirely destitute of the power to maintain peace upon her border or to prevent the incursion of banditti into our territory in her fate and in her fortune in her power to establish and maintain a settle government we have a far deep interest socially commercially and politically than any other nation she be now a wreck upon the ocean drift about as she be impel by different faction as a good neighbor shall we not extend to she a help hand to save she if we do not it would not be surprising should some other nation undertake the task and thus force we to interfere at last under circumstance of increase difficulty for the maintenance of our establish policy i repeat the recommendation contain in my last annual message that authority may be give to the president to establish one or more temporary military post across the mexican line in sonora and chihuahua where these may be necessary to protect the life and property of american and mexican citizen against the incursion and depredation of the indians as well as of lawless rover on that remote region the establishment of one such post at a point call arispe in sonora in a country now almost depopulated by the hostile inroad of the indians from our side of the line would it be believe have prevent much injury and many cruelty during the past season a state of lawlessness and violence prevail on that distant frontier life and property be there wholly insecure the population of arizona now number more than 10,000 soul be practically destitute of government of law or of any regular administration of justice murder rapine and other crime be commit with impunity i therefore again call the attention of congress to the necessity for establish a territorial government over arizona the treaty with nicaragua of the 16th of february 1857 to which i refer in my last annual message fail to receive the ratification of the government of that republic for reason which i need not enumerate a similar treaty have be since conclude between the party bear date on the 16th march 1859 which have already be ratify by the nicaraguan congress this will be immediately submit to the senate for their ratification its provision can not i think fail to be acceptable to the people of both country our claim against the government of costa rica and nicaragua remain unredressed though they be press in an earnest manner and not without hope of success i deem it to be my duty once more earnestly to recommend to congress the passage of a law authorize the president to employ the naval force at his command for the purpose of protect the life and property of american citizen pass in transit across the panama nicaragua and tehuantepec route against sudden and lawless outbreak and depredation i shall not repeat the argument employ in former message in support of this measure suffice it to say that the life of many of our people and the security of vast amount of treasure pass and repasse over one or more of these route between the atlantic and pacific may be deeply involve in the action of congress on this subject i would also again recommend to congress that authority be give to the president to employ the naval force to protect american merchant vessel their crew and cargo against violent and lawless seizure and confiscation in the port of mexico and the spanish american states when these country may be in a disturbed and revolutionary condition the mere knowledge that such an authority have be confer as i have already state would of itself in a great degree prevent the evil neither would this require any additional appropriation for the naval service the chief objection urge against the grant of this authority be that congress by confer it would violate the constitution that it would be a transfer of the war making or strictly speak the war declare power to the executive if this be well rounded it would of course be conclusive a very brief examination however will place this objection at rest congress possess the sole and exclusive power under the constitution to declare war they alone can"raise and support army and provide and maintain a navy but after congress shall have declare war and provide the force necessary to carry it on the president as commander in chief of the army and navy can alone employ this force in make war against the enemy this be the plain language and history prove that it be the well know intention of the framer of the constitution it will not be deny that the general power to declare war be without limitation and embrace within itself not only what writer on the law of nation term a public or perfect war but also an imperfect war and in short every specie of hostility however confine or limited without the authority of congress the president can not fire a hostile gun in any case except to repel the attack of an enemy it will not be doubt that under this power congress could if they think proper authorize the president to employ the force at his command to seize a vessel belong to an american citizen which have be illegally and unjustly capture in a foreign port and restore it to its owner but can congress only act after the fact after the mischief have be do have they no power to confer upon the president the authority in advance to furnish instant redress should such a case afterwards occur must they wait until the mischief have be do and can they apply the remedy only when it be too late to confer this authority to meet future case under circumstance strictly specify be as clearly within the war declare power as such an authority confer upon the president by act of congress after the deed have be do in the progress of a great nation many exigency must arise imperatively require that congress should authorize the president to act promptly on certain condition which may or may not afterwards arise our history have already present a number of such case i shall refer only to the late under the resolution of june 2 1858 for the adjustment of difficulty with the republic of paraguay the president be authorize to adopt such measure and use such force as in his judgment may be necessary and advisable in the event of a refusal of just satisfaction by the government of paraguay just satisfaction for what for the attack on the united states steamer water witch and other matter refer to in the annual message of the president here the power be expressly grant upon the condition that the government of paraguay shall refuse to render this just satisfaction in this and other similar case congress have confer upon the president power in advance to employ the army and navy upon the happening of contingent future event and this most certainly be embrace within the power to declare war now if this conditional and contingent power could be constitutionally confer upon the president in the case of paraguay why may it not be confer for the purpose of protect the life and property of american citizen in the event that they may be violently and unlawfully attack in pass over the transit route to and from california or assail by the seizure of their vessel in a foreign port to deny this power be to render the navy in a great degree useless for the protection of the life and property of american citizen in country where neither protection nor redress can be otherwise obtain the thirty fifth congress terminate on the 3d of march 1859 without having pass the act make appropriation for the service of the post office department during the fiscal year end the 30th of june 1860 this act also contain an appropriation to supply deficiency in the revenue of the post office department for the year end 30th june 1859 i believe this be the first instance since the origin of the federal government now more than seventy year ago when any congress go out of existence without having pass all the general appropriation bill necessary to carry on the government until the regular period for the meeting of a new congress this event impose on the executive a grave responsibility it present a choice of evil have this omission of duty occur at the first session of the last congress the remedy would have be plain i might then have instantly recall they to complete their work and this without expense to the government but on the 4th of march last there be fifteen of the thirty three states which have not elect any representatives to the present congress have congress be call together immediately these states would have be virtually disfranchise if an intermediate period have be select several of the states would have be compel to hold extra session of their legislature at great inconvenience and expense to provide for election at an early day than that previously fix by law in the regular course ten of these states would not elect until after the beginning of august and five of these ten not until october and november on the other hand when i come to examine carefully the condition of the post office department i do not meet as many or as great difficulty as i have apprehend have the bill which fail be confine to appropriation for the fiscal year end on the 30th june next there would have be no reason of press importance for the call of an extra session nothing would become due on contract those with railroad company only except for carry the mail for the first quarter of the present fiscal year commence on the 1st of july until the 1st of december less than one week before the meeting of the present congress the reason be that the mail contractor for this and the current year do not complete their first quarter 's service until the 30th september last and by the term of their contract sixty day more be allow for the settlement of their account before the department could be call upon for payment the great difficulty and the great hardship consist in the failure to provide for the payment of the deficiency in the fiscal year end the 30th june 1859 the department have enter into contract in obedience to exist law for the service of that fiscal year and the contractor be fairly entitle to their compensation as it become due the deficiency as state in the bill amount to $ 3,838,728 but after a careful settlement of all these account it have be ascertain that it amount to $ 4,296,009 with the scanty mean at his command the postmaster general have manage to pay that portion of this deficiency which occur in the first two quarter of the past fiscal year end on the 31st december last in the meantime the contractor themselves under these try circumstance have behave in a manner worthy of all commendation they have one resource in the midst of their embarrassment after the amount due to each of they have be ascertain and finally settle accord to law this become a specific debt of record against the united states which enable they to borrow money on this unquestionable security still they be oblige to pay interest in consequence of the default of congress and on every principle of justice ought to receive interest from the government this interest should commence from the date when a warrant would have issue for the payment of the principal have an appropriation be make for this purpose calculate up to the 1st december it will not exceed $ 96,660 -a sum not to be take into account when contrast with the great difficulty and embarrassment of a public and private character both to the people and the states which would have result from convene and hold a special session of congress for these reason i recommend the passage of a bill at as early a day as may be practicable to provide for the payment of the amount with interest due to these last mention contractor as well as to make the necessary appropriation for the service of the post office department for the current fiscal year the failure to pass the post office bill necessarily give birth to serious reflection congress by refuse to pass the general appropriation bill necessary to carry on the government may not only arrest its action but might even destroy its existence the army the navy the judiciary in short every department of the government can no long perform their function if congress refuse the money necessary for their support if this failure should teach the country the necessity of elect a full congress in sufficient time to enable the president to convene they in any emergency even immediately after the old congress have expire it will have be productive of great good in a time of sudden and alarming danger foreign or domestic which all nation must expect to encounter in their progress the very salvation of our institution may be stake upon the assembling of congress without delay if under such circumstance the president should find himself in the condition in which he be place at the close of the last congress with nearly half the states of the union destitute of representative the consequence might he disastrous i therefore recommend to congress to carry into effect the provision of the constitution on this subject and to pass a law appoint some day previous to the 4th march in each year of odd number for the election of representatives throughout all the states they have already appoint a day for the election of elector for president and vice president and this measure have be approve by the country i would again express a most decide opinion in favor of the construction of a pacific railroad for the reason state in my two last annual message when i reflect upon what would be the defenseless condition of our states and territories west of the rocky mountains in case of a war with a naval power sufficiently strong to interrupt all intercourse with they by the route across the isthmus i be still more convinced than ever of the vast importance of this railroad i have never doubt the constitutional competency of congress to provide for its construction but this exclusively under the war make power besides the constitution expressly require as an imperative duty that the united states shall protect each of they the states against invasion i be at a loss to conceive how this protection can be afford to california and oregon against such a naval power by any other mean i repeat the opinion contain in my last annual message that it would be inexpedient for the government to undertake this great work by agent of its own appointment and under its direct and exclusive control this would increase the patronage of the executive to a dangerous extent and would foster a system of jobbing and corruption which no vigilance on the part of federal official could prevent the construction of this road ought therefore to be intrust to incorporate company or other agency who would exercise that active and vigilant supervision over it which can be inspire alone by a sense of corporate and individual interest i venture to assert that the additional cost of transport troop munition of war and necessary supply for the army across the vast intervene plain to our possession on the pacific coast would be great in such a war than the whole amount require to construct the road and yet this resort would after all be inadequate for their defense and protection we have yet scarcely recover from the habit of extravagant expenditure produce by our overflowing treasury during several year prior to the commencement of my administration the financial reverse which we have since experience ought to teach we all to scrutinize our expenditure with the great vigilance and to reduce they to the low possible point the executive departments of the government have devote themselves to the accomplishment of this object with considerable success as will appear from their different report and estimate to these i invite the scrutiny of congress for the purpose of reduce they still low if this be practicable consistent with the great public interest of the country in aid of the policy of retrenchment i pledge myself to examine closely the bill appropriating land or money so that if any of these should inadvertently pass both house as must sometimes be the case i may afford they an opportunity for reconsideration at the same time we ought never to forget that true public economy consist not in withhold the mean necessary to accomplish important national object confide to we by the constitution but in take care that the money appropriate for these purpose shall be faithfully and frugally expend it will appear from the report of the secretary of the treasury that it be extremely doubtful to say the least whether we shall be able to pass through the present and the next fiscal year without provide additional revenue this can only be accomplish by strictly confine the appropriation within the estimate of the different department without make an allowance for any additional expenditure which congress may think proper in their discretion to authorize and without provide for the redemption of any portion of the $ 20,000,000 of treasury note which have be already issue in the event of a deficiency which i consider probable this ought never to be supply by a resort to additional loan it would be a ruinous practice in the day of peace and prosperity to go on increase the national debt to meet the ordinary expense of the government this policy would cripple our resource and impair our credit in case the existence of war should render it necessary to borrow money should such a deficiency occur as i apprehend i would recommend that the necessary revenue be raise by an increase of our present duty on import i need not repeat the opinion express in my last annual message as to the good mode and manner of accomplish this object and shall now merely observe that these have since undergo no change the report of the secretary of the treasury will explain in detail the operation of that department of the government the receipt into the treasury from all source during the fiscal year end june 30 1859 include the loan authorize by the act of june 14 1858 and the issue of treasury note authorize by exist law be $ 81,692,471.01 which sum with the balance of $ 6,398,316.10 remain in the treasury at the commencement of that fiscal year make an aggregate

june 1859 amount to $ 4,296,009 together with the further estimate of that officer for the service of the present fiscal year end 30th june 1860 be $ 5,526,324 make an aggregate of $ 10,361,683.should these appropriation be make as request by the proper departments the balance in the treasury on the 30th june 1861 will not it be estimate exceed $ 3,530,196.61.i transmit herewith the report of the secretaries of war of the navy of the interior and of the postmaster general they each contain valuable information and important recommendation well worthy of the serious consideration of congress it will appear from the report of the secretary of war that the army expenditure have be materially reduce by a system of rigid economy which in his opinion offer every guaranty that the reduction will be permanent the estimate of the department for the next have be reduce nearly $ 2,000,000 below the estimate for the present fiscal year and $ 500,000 below the amount grant for this year at the last session of congress the expenditure of the post office department during the past fiscal year end on the 30th june 1859 exclusive of payment for mail service specially provide for by congress out of the general treasury amount to $ 14,964,493.33 and its receipt to $ 7,968,484.07 show a deficiency to be supply from the treasury of $ 6,996,009.26 against $ 5,235,677.15 for the year end 30th june 1858 the increase cost of transportation grow out of the expansion of the service require by congress explain this rapid augmentation of the expenditure it be gratify however to observe an increase of receipt for the year end on the 30th of june 1859 equal to $ 481,691.21 compare with those in the year end on the 30th june 1858.it be estimate that the deficiency for the current fiscal year will be $ 5,988,424.04 but that for the year end 30th june 1861 it will not exceed $ 1,342,473.90 should congress adopt the measure of reform propose and urge by the postmaster general since the month of march retrenchment have be make in the expenditure amount to $ 1,826,471 annually which however do not take effect until after the commencement of the present fiscal year the period seem to have arrive for determine the question whether this department shall become a permanent and ever increase charge upon the treasury or shall be permit to resume the self sustain policy which have so long control its administration the course of legislation recommend by the postmaster general for the relief of the department from its present embarrassment and for restore it to its original independence be deserve of your early and earnest consideration in conclusion i would again commend to the just liberality of congress the local interest of the district of columbia surely the city bear the name of washington and destine i trust for age to be the capital of our united free and prosperous confederacy have strong claim on our favorable regard
mr. president and fellow citizen of new york

 the fact with which i shall deal this evening be mainly old and familiar nor be there anything new in the general use i shall make of they if there shall be any novelty it will be in the mode of present the fact and the inference and observation follow that presentation

 in his speech last autumn at columbus ohio as report in the new york times senator douglas say

 our father when they frame the government under which we live understand this question just as well and even well than we do now

 i fully indorse this and i adopt it as a text for this discourse i so adopt it because it furnish a precise and an agree starting point for a discussion between republicans and that wing of the democracy head by senator douglas it simply leave the inquiry what be the understanding those father have of the question mention

 what be the frame of government under which we live

 the answer must be the constitution of the united states that constitution consist of the original frame in 1787 and under which the present government first go into operation and twelve subsequently frame amendment the first ten of which be frame in 1789

 who be our father that frame the constitution i suppose the thirty nine who sign the original instrument may be fairly call our father who frame that part of the present government it be almost exactly true to say they frame it and it be altogether true to say they fairly represent the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that time their name be familiar to nearly all and accessible to quite all need not now be repeat

 i take these thirty nine for the present as be our father who frame the government under which we live

 what be the question which accord to the text those father understand just as well and even well than we do now

 it be this do the proper division of local from federal authority or anything in the constitution forbid our federal government to control as to slavery in our federal territories

 upon this senator douglas hold the affirmative and republicans the negative this affirmation and denial form an issue and this issue this question be precisely what the text declare our father understand well than we

 let we now inquire whether the thirty nine or any of they ever act upon this question and if they do how they act upon it how they express that well understanding

 in 1784 three year before the constitution the united states then own the northwestern territory and no other the congress of the confederation have before they the question of prohibit slavery in that territory and four of the thirty nine who afterward frame the constitution be in that congress and vote on that question of these roger sherman thomas mifflin and hugh williamson vote for the prohibition thus show that in their understanding no line divide local from federal authority nor anything else properly forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory the other of the four james m'henry vote against the prohibition show that for some cause he think it improper to vote for it

 in 1787 still before the constitution but while the convention be in session frame it and while the northwestern territory still be the only territory own by the united states the same question of prohibit slavery in the territory again come before the congress of the confederation and two more of the thirty nine who afterward sign the constitution be in that congress and vote on the question they be william blount and william few and they both vote for the prohibition thus show that in their understanding no line divide local from federal authority nor anything else properly forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory this time the prohibition become a law be part of what be now well know as the ordinance of 87

 the question of federal control of slavery in the territory seem not to have be directly before the convention which frame the original constitution and hence it be not record that the thirty nine or any of they while engage on that instrument express any opinion on that precise question

 in 1789 by the first congress which sit under the constitution an act be pass to enforce the ordinance of 87 include the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory the bill for this act be report by one of the thirty nine thomas fitzsimmons then a member of the house of representatives from pennsylvania it go through all its stage without a word of opposition and finally pass both branch without yea and nay which be equivalent to a unanimous passage in this congress there be sixteen of the thirty nine father who frame the original constitution they be john langdon nicholas gilman wm s. johnson roger sherman robert morris thos fitzsimmon william few abraham baldwin rufus king william paterson george clymer richard bassett george read pierce butler daniel carroll james madison

 this show that in their understanding no line divide local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution properly forbid congress to prohibit slavery in the federal territory else both their fidelity to correct principle and their oath to support the constitution would have constrain they to oppose the prohibition

 again george washington another of the thirty nine be then president of the united states and as such approve and sign the bill thus complete its validity as a law and thus show that in his understanding no line divide local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory

 no great while after the adoption of the original constitution north carolina cede to the federal government the country now constitute the state of tennessee and a few year later georgia cede that which now constitute the states of mississippi and alabama in both deed of cession it be make a condition by the cede states that the federal government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded territory besides this slavery be then actually in the ceded country under these circumstance congress on take charge of these country do not absolutely prohibit slavery within they but they do interfere with it take control of it even there to a certain extent in 1798 congress organize the territory of mississippi in the act of organization they prohibit the bringing of slave into the territory from any place without the united states by fine and give freedom to slave so buy this act pass both branch of congress without yea and nay in that congress be three of the thirty nine who frame the original constitution they be john langdon george read and abraham baldwin they all probably vote for it certainly they would have place their opposition to it upon record if in their understanding any line divide local from federal authority or anything in the constitution properly forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory

 in 1803 the federal government purchase the louisiana country our former territorial acquisition come from certain of our own states but this louisiana country be acquire from a foreign nation in 1804 congress give a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitute the state of louisiana new orleans lie within that part be an old and comparatively large city there be other considerable town and settlement and slavery be extensively and thoroughly intermingle with the people congress do not in the territorial act prohibit slavery but they do interfere with it take control of it in a more marked and extensive way than they do in the case of mississippi the substance of the provision therein make in relation to slave be

 first that no slave should be import into the territory from foreign part

 second that no slave should be carry into it who have be import into the united states since the first day of may 1798

 third that no slave should be carry into it except by the owner and for his own use as a settler the penalty in all the case be a fine upon the violator of the law and freedom to the slave

 this act also be pass without yea and nay in the congress which pass it there be two of the thirty nine they be abraham baldwin and jonathan dayton as state in the case of mississippi it be probable they both vote for it they would not have allow it to pass without record their opposition to it if in their understanding it violate either the line properly divide local from federal authority or any provision of the constitution

 in 1819 20 come and pass the missouri question many vote be take by yea and nay in both branch of congress upon the various phase of the general question two of the thirty nine rufus king and charles pinckney be member of that congress mr. king steadily vote for slavery prohibition and against all compromise while mr. pinckney as steadily vote against slavery prohibition and against all compromise by this mr. king show that in his understanding no line divide local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution be violate by congress prohibit slavery in federal territory while mr. pinckney by his vote show that in his understanding there be some sufficient reason for oppose such prohibition in that case

 the case i have mention be the only act of the thirty nine or of any of they upon the direct issue which i have be able to discover

 to enumerate the person who thus act as be four in 1784 two in 1787 seventeen in 1789 three in 1798 two in 1804 and two in 1819 20 there would be thirty of they but this would be count john langdon roger sherman william few rufus king and george read each twice and abraham baldwin three time the true number of those of the thirty nine whom i have show to have act upon the question which by the text they understand well than we be twenty three leave sixteen not show to have act upon it in any way

 here then we have twenty three out of our thirty nine father who frame the government under which we live who have upon their official responsibility and their corporal oath act upon the very question which the text affirm they understand just as well and even well than we do now and twenty one of they a clear majority of the whole thirty nine so act upon it as to make they guilty of gross political impropriety and willful perjury if in their understanding any proper division between local and federal authority or anything in the constitution they have make themselves and swear to support forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territory thus the twenty one act and as action speak louder than word so action under such responsibility speak still louder

 two of the twenty three vote against congressional prohibition of slavery in the federal territory in the instance in which they act upon the question but for what reason they so vote be not know they may have do so because they think a proper division of local from federal authority or some provision or principle of the constitution stand in the way or they may without any such question have vote against the prohibition on what appear to they to be sufficient ground of expediency no one who have swear to support the constitution can conscientiously vote for what he understand to be an unconstitutional measure however expedient he may think it but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deem constitutional if at the same time he deem it inexpedient it therefore would be unsafe to set down even the two who vote against the prohibition as having do so because in their understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or anything in the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory

 the remain sixteen of the thirty nine so far as i have discover have leave no record of their understanding upon the direct question of federal control of slavery in the federal territory but there be much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appear different from that of their twenty three compeer have it be manifest at all

 for the purpose of adhere rigidly to the text i have purposely omit whatever understanding may have be manifest by any person however distinguish other than the thirty nine father who frame the original constitution and for the same reason i have also omit whatever understanding may have be manifest by any of the thirty nine even on any other phase of the general question of slavery if we should look into their act and declaration on those other phase as the foreign slave trade and the morality and policy of slavery generally it would appear to we that on the direct question of federal control of slavery in federal territory the sixteen if they have act at all would probably have act just as the twenty three do among that sixteen be several of the most noted anti slavery man of those time as dr. franklin alexander hamilton and gouverneur morris while there be not one now know to have be otherwise unless it may be john rutledge of south carolina

 the sum of the whole be that of our thirty nine father who frame the original constitution twenty one a clear majority of the whole certainly understand that no proper division of local from federal authority nor any part of the constitution forbid the federal government to control slavery in the federal territory while all the rest probably have the same understanding such unquestionably be the understanding of our father who frame the original constitution and the text affirm that they understand the question well than we

 but so far i have be consider the understanding of the question manifest by the framer of the original constitution in and by the original instrument a mode be provide for amend it and as i have already state the present frame of the government under which we live consist of that original and twelve amendatory article frame and adopt since those who now insist that federal control of slavery in federal territory violate the constitution point we to the provision which they suppose it thus violate and as i understand that all fix upon provision in these amendatory article and not in the original instrument the supreme court in the dred scott case plant themselves upon the fifth amendment which provide that no person shall be deprive of life liberty or property without due process of law while senator douglas and his peculiar adherent plant themselves upon the tenth amendment provide that the power not delegate to the united states by the constitution be reserve to the states respectively or to the people

 now it so happen that these amendment be frame by the first congress which sit under the constitution the identical congress which pass the act already mention enforce the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory not only be it the same congress but they be the identical same individual man who at the same session and at the same time within the session have under consideration and in progress toward maturity these constitutional amendment and this act prohibit slavery in all the territory the nation then own the constitutional amendment be introduce before and pass after the act enforce the ordinance of 87 so that during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the ordinance the constitutional amendment be also pende

 the seventy six member of that congress include sixteen of the framer of the original constitution as before state be pre- eminently our father who frame that part of the government under which we live which be now claim as forbid the federal government to control slavery in the federal territory

 be it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the two thing which that congress deliberately frame and carry to maturity at the same time be absolutely inconsistent with each other and do not such affirmation become impudently absurd when couple with the other affirmation from the same mouth that those who do the two thing allege to be inconsistent understand whether they really be inconsistent well than we well than he who affirm that they be inconsistent

 it be surely safe to assume that the thirty nine framer of the original constitution and the seventy six member of the congress which frame the amendment thereto take together do certainly include those who may be fairly call our father who frame the government under which we live and so assume i defy any man to show that any one of they ever in his whole life declare that in his understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territory i go a step far i defy any one to show that any live man in the whole world ever do prior to the beginning of the present century and i might almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century declare that in his understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territory to those who now so declare i give not only our father who frame the government under which we live but with they all other live man within the century in which it be frame among whom to search and they shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agree with they

 now and here let i guard a little against be misunderstood i do not mean to say we be bind to follow implicitly in whatever our father do to do so would be to discard all the light of current experience to reject all progress all improvement what i do say be that if we would supplant the opinion and policy of our father in any case we should do so upon evidence so conclusive and argument so clear that even their great authority fairly consider and weigh can not stand and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understand the question well than we

 if any man at this day sincerely believe that a proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territory he be right to say so and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can but he have no right to mislead other who have less access to history and less leisure to study it into the false belief that our father who frame the government under which we live be of the same opinion thus substitute falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument if any man at this day sincerely believe our father who frame the government under which we live use and apply principle in other case which ought to have lead they to understand that a proper division of local from federal authority or some part of the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territory he be right to say so but he should at the same time brave the responsibility of declare that in his opinion he understand their principle well than they do themselves and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by assert that they understand the question just as well and even well than we do now

 but enough let all who believe that our father who frame the government under which we live understand this question just as well and even well than we do now speak as they speak and act as they act upon it this be all republicans ask all republicans desire in relation to slavery as those father mark it so let it be again mark as an evil not to be extend but to be tolerate and protect only because of and so far as its actual presence among we make that toleration and protection a necessity let all the guarantee those father give it be not grudgingly but fully and fairly maintain for this republicans contend and with this so far as i know or believe they will be content

 and now if they would listen as i suppose they will not i would address a few word to the southern people

 i would say to they you consider yourself a reasonable and a just people and i consider that in the general quality of reason and justice you be not inferior to any other people still when you speak of we republicans you do so only to denounce we a reptile or at the good as no well than outlaw you will grant a hearing to pirate or murderer but nothing like it to black republicans in all your contention with one another each of you deem an unconditional condemnation of black republicanism as the first thing to be attend to indeed such condemnation of we seem to be an indispensable prerequisite license so to speak among you to be admit or permit to speak at all now can you or not be prevail upon to pause and to consider whether this be quite just to we or even to yourself bring forward your charge and specification and then be patient long enough to hear we deny or justify

 you say we be sectional we deny it that make an issue and the burden of proof be upon you you produce your proof and what be it why that our party have no existence in your section get no vote in your section the fact be substantially true but do it prove the issue if it do then in case we should without change of principle begin to get vote in your section we should thereby cease to be sectional you can not escape this conclusion and yet be you willing to abide by it if you be you will probably soon find that we have cease to be sectional for we shall get vote in your section this very year you will then begin to discover as the truth plainly be that your proof do not touch the issue the fact that we get no vote in your section be a fact of your making and not of our and if there be fault in that fact that fault be primarily your and remain until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice if we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice the fault be ours but this bring you to where you ought to have start to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle if our principle put in practice would wrong your section for the benefit of our or for any other object then our principle and we with it be sectional and be justly oppose and denounce as such meet we then on the question of whether our principle put in practice would wrong your section and so meet it as if it be possible that something may be say on our side do you accept the challenge no then you really believe that the principle which our father who frame the government under which we live think so clearly right as to adopt it and indorse it again and again upon their official oath be in fact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moment 's consideration

 some of you delight to flaunt in our face the warning against sectional party give by washington in his farewell address less than eight year before washington give that warning he have as president of the united states approve and sign an act of congress enforce the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory which act embody the policy of the government upon that subject up to and at the very moment he pen that warning and about one year after he pen it he write lafayette that he consider that prohibition a wise measure express in the same connection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free states

 bear this in mind and see that sectionalism have since arise upon this same subject be that warn a weapon in your hand against we or in our hand against you could washington himself speak would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon we who sustain his policy or upon you who repudiate it we respect that warning of washington and we commend it to you together with his example pointing to the right application of it

 but you say you be conservative eminently conservative while we be revolutionary destructive or something of the sort what be conservatism be it not adherence to the old and try against the new and untried we stick to contend for the identical old policy on the point in controversy which be adopt by our father who frame the government under which we live while you with one accord reject and scout and spit upon that old policy and insist upon substitute something new true you disagree among yourself as to what that substitute shall be you be divide on new proposition and plan but you be unanimous in reject and denounce the old policy of the father some of you be for revive the foreign slave trade some for a congressional slave code for the territories some for congress forbid the territories to prohibit slavery within their limit some for maintain slavery in the territories through the judiciary some for the gur reat pur rinciple that if one man would enslave another no third man should object fantastically call popular sovereignty but never a man among you be in favor of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territory accord to the practice of our father who frame the government under which we live not one of all your various plan can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our government originate consider then whether your claim of conservatism for yourself and your charge or destructiveness against we be base on the most clear and stable foundation

 again you say we have make the slavery question more prominent than it formerly be we deny it we admit that it be more prominent but we deny that we make it so it be not we but you who discard the old policy of the father we resist and still resist your innovation and thence come the great prominence of the question would you have that question reduce to its former proportion go back to that old policy what have be will be again under the same condition if you would have the peace of the old time readopt the precept and policy of the old time

 you charge that we stir up insurrection among your slave we deny it and what be your proof harper 's ferry john brown john brown be no republican and you have fail to implicate a single republican in his harper 's ferry enterprise if any member of our party be guilty in that matter you know it or you do not know it if you do know it you be inexcusable for not designate the man and prove the fact if you do not know it you be inexcusable for assert it and especially for persist in the assertion after you have try and fail to make the proof you need to be tell that persist in a charge which one do not know to be true be simply malicious slander

 some of you admit that no republican designedly aid or encourage the harper 's ferry affair but still insist that our doctrine and declaration necessarily lead to such result we do not believe it we know we hold to no doctrine and make no declaration which be not hold to and make by our father who frame the government under which we live you never deal fairly by we in relation to this affair when it occur some important state election be near at hand and you be in evident glee with the belief that by charge the blame upon we you could get an advantage of we in those election the election come and your expectation be not quite fulfil every republican man know that as to himself at least your charge be a slander and he be not much incline by it to cast his vote in your favor republican doctrine and declaration be accompany with a continual protest against any interference whatever with your slave or with you about your slave surely this do not encourage they to revolt true we do in common with our father who frame the government under which we live declare our belief that slavery be wrong but the slave do not hear we declare even this for anything we say or do the slave would scarcely know there be a republican party i believe they would not in fact generally know it but for your misrepresentation of we in their hearing in your political contest among yourself each faction charge the other with sympathy with black republicanism and then to give point to the charge define black republicanism to simply be insurrection blood and thunder among the slave

 slave insurrection be no more common now than they be before the republican party be organize what induce the southampton insurrection twenty eight year ago in which at least three time as many life be lose as at harper 's ferry you can scarcely stretch your very elastic fancy to the conclusion that southampton be get up by black republicanism in the present state of thing in the united states i do not think a general or even a very extensive slave insurrection be possible the indispensable concert of action can not be attain the slave have no mean of rapid communication nor can incendiary freeman black or white supply it the explosive material be everywhere in parcel but there neither be nor can be supply the indispensable connect train

 much be say by southern people about the affection of slave for their master and mistress and a part of it at least be true a plot for an uprising could scarcely be devise and communicate to twenty individual before some one of they to save the life of a favorite master or mistress would divulge it this be the rule and the slave revolution in hayti be not an exception to it but a case occur under peculiar circumstance the gunpowder plot of british history though not connect with slave be more in point in that case only about twenty be admit to the secret and yet one of they in his anxiety to save a friend betray the plot to that friend and by consequence avert the calamity occasional poisoning from the kitchen and open or stealthy assassination in the field and local revolt extend to a score or so will continue to occur as the natural result of slavery but no general insurrection of slave as i think can happen in this country for a long time whoever much fear or much hope for such an event will be alike disappointed

 in the language of mr. jefferson utter many year ago it be still in our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably and in such slow degree as that the evil will wear off insensibly and their place be pari passu fill up by free white laborer if on the contrary it be leave to force itself on human nature must shudder at the prospect hold up

 mr. jefferson do not mean to say nor do i that the power of emancipation be in the federal government he speak of virginia and as to the power of emancipation i speak of the slaveholde states only the federal government however as we insist have the power of restrain the extension of the institution the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any american soil which be now free from slavery

 john brown 's effort be peculiar it be not a slave insurrection it be an attempt by white man to get up a revolt among slave in which the slave refuse to participate in fact it be so absurd that the slave with all their ignorance see plainly enough it could not succeed that affair in its philosophy correspond with the many attempt relate in history at the assassination of king and emperor an enthusiast brood over the oppression of a people till he fancy himself commission by heaven to liberate they he venture the attempt which end in little else than his own execution orsini 's attempt on louis napoleon and john brown 's attempt at harper 's ferry be in their philosophy precisely the same the eagerness to cast blame on old england in the one case and on new england in the other do not disprove the sameness of the two thing

 and how much would it avail you if you could by the use of john brown helper 's book and the like break up the republican organization human action can be modify to some extent but human nature can not be change there be a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation which cast at least a million and a half of vote you can not destroy that judgment and feel that sentiment by break up the political organization which rally around it you can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which have be form into order in the face of your heavy fire but if you could how much would you gain by force the sentiment which create it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot box into some other channel what would that other channel probably be would the number of john browns be lessen or enlarge by the operation

 but you will break up the union rather than submit to a denial of your constitutional right

 that have a somewhat reckless sound but it would be palliate if not fully justify be we propose by the mere force of number to deprive you of some right plainly write down in the constitution but we be propose no such thing

 when you make these declaration you have a specific and well understand allusion to an assume constitutional right of your to take slave into the federal territory and to hold they there as property but no such right be specifically write in the constitution that instrument be literally silent about any such right we on the contrary deny that such a right have any existence in the constitution even by implication

 your purpose then plainly state be that you will destroy the government unless you be allow to construe and enforce the constitution as you please on all point in dispute between you and we you will rule or ruin in all event

 this plainly state be your language perhaps you will say the supreme court have decide the dispute constitutional question in your favor not quite so but waive the lawyer 's distinction between dictum and decision the court have decide the question for you in a sort of way the court have substantially say it be your constitutional right to take slave into the federal territory and to hold they there as property when i say the decision be make in a sort of way i mean it be make in a divided court by a bare majority of the judges and they not quite agree with one another in the reason for make it that it be so make as that its avow supporter disagree with one another about its meaning and that it be mainly base upon a mistaken statement of fact the statement in the opinion that the right of property in a slave be distinctly and expressly affirm in the constitution

 an inspection of the constitution will show that the right of property in a slave be not distinctly and expressly affirm in it bear in mind the judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right be impliedly affirm in the constitution but they pledge their veracity that it be distinctly and expressly affirm there distinctly that be not mingle with anything else expressly that be in word mean just that without the aid of any inference and susceptible of no other meaning

 if they have only pledge their judicial opinion that such right be affirm in the instrument by implication it would be open to other to show that neither the word slave nor slavery be to be find in the constitution nor the word property even in any connection with language allude to the thing slave or slavery and that wherever in that instrument the slave be allude to he be call a person and wherever his master 's legal right in relation to he be allude to it be speak of as service or labor which may be due as a debt payable in service or labor also it would be open to show by contemporaneous history that this mode of allude to slave and slavery instead of speak of they be employ on purpose to exclude from the constitution the idea that there could be property in man

 to show all this be easy and certain

 when this obvious mistake of the judges shall be bring to their notice be it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement and reconsider the conclusion base upon it

 and then it be to be remember that our father who frame the government under which we live the man who make the constitution decide this same constitutional question in our favor long ago decide it without division among themselves when make the decision without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it be make and so far as any evidence be leave without base it upon any mistaken statement of fact

 under all these circumstance do you really feel yourself justify to break up this government unless such a court decision as yours be shall be at once submit to as a conclusive and final rule of political action but you will not abide the election of a republican president in that suppose event you say you will destroy the union and then you say the great crime of having destroy it will be upon we that be cool a highwayman hold a pistol to my ear and mutter through his tooth stand and deliver or i shall kill you and then you will be a murderer

 to be sure what the robber demand of i my money be my own and i have a clear right to keep it but it be no more my own than my vote be my own and the threat of death to i to extort my money and the threat of destruction to the union to extort my vote can scarcely be distinguish in principle

 a few word now to republicans it be exceedingly desirable that all part of this great confederacy shall be at peace and in harmony one with another let we republicans do our part to have it so even though much provoke let we do nothing through passion and ill temper even though the southern people will not so much as listen to we let we calmly consider their demand and yield to they if in our deliberate view of our duty we possibly can judge by all they say and do and by the subject and nature of their controversy with we let we determine if we can what will satisfy they

 will they be satisfied if the territories be unconditionally surrender to they we know they will not in all their present complaint against we the territories be scarcely mention invasion and insurrection be the rage now will it satisfy they if in the future we have nothing to do with invasion and insurrection we know it will not we so know because we know we never have anything to do with invasion and insurrection and yet this total abstaining do not exempt we from the charge and the denunciation

 the question recur what will satisfy they simply this we must not only let they alone but we must somehow convince they that we do let they alone this we know by experience be no easy task we have be so try to convince they from the very beginning of our organization but with no success in all our platform and speech we have constantly protest our purpose to let they alone but this have have no tendency to convince they alike unavaile to convince they be the fact that they have never detect a man of we in any attempt to disturb they

 these natural and apparently adequate mean all fail what will convince they this and this only cease to call slavery wrong and join they in call it right and this must be do thoroughly do in act as well as in word silence will not be tolerate we must place ourselves avowedly with they senator douglas new sedition law must be enact and enforce suppress all declaration that slavery be wrong whether make in politic in press in pulpit or in private we must arrest and return their fugitive slave with greedy pleasure we must pull down our free state constitution the whole atmosphere must be disinfect from all taint of opposition to slavery before they will cease to believe that all their trouble proceed from we

 i be quite aware they do not state their case precisely in this way most of they would probably say to we let we alone do nothing to we and say what you please about slavery but we do let they alone have never disturb they so that after all it be what we say which dissatisfy they they will continue to accuse we of do until we cease say

 i be also aware they have not as yet in term demand the overthrow of our free state constitutions yet those constitution declare the wrong of slavery with more solemn emphasis than do all other saying against it and when all these other saying shall have be silence the overthrow of these constitution will be demand and nothing be leave to resist the demand it be nothing to the contrary that they do not demand the whole of this just now demand what they do and for the reason they do they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation hold as they do that slavery be morally right and socially elevating they can not cease to demand a full national recognition of it as a legal right and a social blessing

 nor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction that slavery be wrong if slavery be right all word act law and constitution against it be themselves wrong and should be silence and sweep away if it be right we can not justly object to its nationality its universality if it be wrong they can not justly insist upon its extension its enlargement all they ask we could readily grant if we think slavery right all we ask they could as readily grant if they think it wrong their thinking it right and our think it wrong be the precise fact upon which depend the whole controversy think it right as they do they be not to blame for desire its full recognition as be right but think it wrong as we do can we yield to they can we cast our vote with their view and against our own in view of our moral social and political responsibility can we do this

 wrong as we think slavery be we can yet afford to let it alone where it be because that much be due to the necessity arise from its actual presence in the nation but can we while our vote will prevent it allow it to spread into the national territories and to overrun we here in these free states if our sense of duty forbid this then let we stand by our duty fearlessly and effectively let we be divert by none of those sophistical contrivance wherewith we be so industriously ply and belabor contrivance such as grope for some middle ground between the right and the wrong vain as the search for a man who should be neither a live man nor a dead man such as a policy of do not care on a question about which all true man do care such as union appeal beseech true union man to yield to disunionists reverse the divine rule and call not the sinner but the righteous to repentance such as invocation to washington implore man to unsay what washington say and undo what washington do

 neither let we be slander from our duty by false accusation against we nor frighten from it by menace of destruction to the government nor of dungeon to ourselves let us have faith that right make might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it

 our father when they frame the government under which we live understand this question just as well and even well than we do now


 i fully indorse this and i adopt it as a text for this discourse i so adopt it because it furnish a precise and an agree starting point for a discussion between republicans and that wing of the democracy head by senator douglas it simply leave the inquiry what be the understanding those father have of the question mention


 our father when they frame the government under which we live understand this question just as well and even well than we do now

 i fully indorse this and i adopt it as a text for this discourse i so adopt it because it furnish a precise and an agree starting point for a discussion between republicans and that wing of the democracy head by senator douglas it simply leave the inquiry what be the understanding those father have of the question mention

 what be the frame of government under which we live

 the answer must be the constitution of the united states that constitution consist of the original frame in 1787 and under which the present government first go into operation and 12 subsequently frame amendment the first 10 of which be frame in 1789

 who be our father that frame the constitution i suppose the 39 who sign the original instrument may be fairly call our father who frame that part of the present government it be almost exactly true to say they frame it and it be altogether true to say they fairly represent the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that time their name be familiar to nearly all and accessible to quite all need not now be repeat

 i take these 39 for the present as be our father who frame the government under which we live

 what be the question which accord to the text those father understand just as well and even well than we do now

 upon this senator douglas hold the affirmative and republicans the negative this affirmation and denial form an issue and this issue this question be precisely what the text declare our father understand well than we

 let we now inquire whether the 39 or any of they ever act upon this question and if they do how they act upon it how they express that well understanding

 in 1784 three year before the constitution the united states then own the northwestern territory and no other the congress of the confederation have before they the question of prohibit slavery in that territory and four of the 39 who afterward frame the constitution be in that congress and vote on that question of these roger sherman thomas mifflin and hugh williamson vote for the prohibition thus show that in their understanding no line divide local from federal authority nor anything else properly forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory the other of the four james m. henry vote against the prohibition show that for some cause he think it improper to vote for it

 in 1787 still before the constitution but while the convention be in session frame it and while the northwestern territory still be the only territory own by the united states the same question of prohibit slavery in the territory again come before the congress of the confederation and two more of the 39 who afterward sign the constitution be in that congress and vote on the question they be william blount and william few and they both vote for the prohibition thus show that in their understanding no line divide local from federal authority nor anything else properly forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory this time the prohibition become a law be part of what be now well know as the ordinance of 87

 the question of federal control of slavery in the territory seem not to have be directly before the convention which frame the original constitution and hence it be not record that the 39 or any of they while engage on that instrument express any opinion of that precise question

 this show that in their understanding no line divide local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution properly forbid congress to prohibit slavery in the federal territory else both their fidelity to correct principle and their oath to support the constitution would have constrain they to oppose the prohibition

 again george washington another of the 39 be then president of the united states and as such approve and sign the bill thus complete its validity as a law and thus show that in his understanding no line divide local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory

 no great while after the adoption of the original constitution north carolina cede to the federal government the country now constitute the state of tennessee and a few year later georgia cede that which now constitute the states of mississippi and alabama in both deed of cession it be make a condition by the ceding state that the federal government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country besides this slavery be then actually in the ceded country under these circumstance congress on take charge of these country do not absolutely prohibit slavery within they but they do interfere with it take control of it even there to a certain extent in 1798 congress organize the territory of mississippi in the act of organization they prohibit the bringing of slave into the territory from any place without the united states by fine and give freedom to slave so brought this act pass both branch of congress without yea and nay in that congress be three of the 39 who frame the original constitution they be john langdon george read and abraham baldwin they all probably vote for it certainly they would have place their opposition to it upon record if in their understanding any line divide local from federal authority or anything in the constitution properly forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory

 in 1803 the federal government purchase the louisiana country our former territorial acquisition come from certain of our own state but this louisiana country be acquire from a foreign nation in 1804 congress give a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitute the state of louisiana new orleans lie within that part be an old and comparatively large city there be other considerable town and settlement and slavery be extensively and thoroughly intermingle with the people congress do not in the territorial act prohibit slavery but they do interfere with it take control of it in a more marked and extensive way than they do in the case of mississippi the substance of the provision therein make in relation to slave be

 this act also be pass without yea and nay in the congress which pass it there be two of the 39 they be abraham baldwin and jonathan dayton as state in the case of mississippi it be probable they both vote for it they would not have allow it to pass without record their opposition to it if in their understanding it violate either the line properly divide local from federal authority or any provision of the constitution

 in 1819–20 come and pass the missouri question many vote be take by yea and nay in both branch of congress upon the various phase of the general question two of the 39"—rufus king and charles pinckney be member of that congress mr. king steadily vote for slavery prohibition and against all compromise while mr. pinckney as steadily vote against slavery prohibition and against all compromise by this mr. king show that in his understanding no line divide local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution be violate by congress prohibit slavery in federal territory while mr. pinckney by his vote show that in his understanding there be some sufficient reason for oppose such prohibition in that case

 the case i have mention be the only act of the 39 or of any of they upon the direct issue which i have be able to discover

 to enumerate the person who thus act as be four in 1784 two in 1787 17 in 1789 three in 1798 two in 1804 and two in 1819–20 there would be 30 of they but this would be count john langdon roger sherman william few rufus king and george read each twice and abraham baldwin three time the true number of those of the 39 whom i have show to have act upon the question which by the text they understand well than we be 23 leave 16 not show to have act upon it in any way

 here then we have 23 out of our 39 father who frame the government under which we live who have upon their official responsibility and their corporal oath act upon the very question which the text affirm they understand just as well and even well than we do now and 21 of they a clear majority of the whole 39"—so act upon it as to make they guilty of gross political impropriety and wilful perjury if in their understanding any proper division between local and federal authority or anything in the constitution they have make themselves and swear to support forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territory thus the 21 act and as action speak louder than word so action under such responsibility speak still louder

 two of the 23 vote against congressional prohibition of slavery in the federal territory in the instance in which they act upon the question but for what reason they so vote be not know they may have do so because they think a proper division of local from federal authority or some provision or principle of the constitution stand in the way or they may without any such question have vote against the prohibition on what appear to they to be sufficient ground of expediency no one who have swear to support the constitution can conscientiously vote for what he understand to be an unconstitutional measure however expedient he may think it but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deem constitutional if at the same time he deem it inexpedient it therefore would be unsafe to set down even the two who vote against the prohibition as having do so because in their understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or anything in the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory

 the remain 16 of the 39 so far as i have discover have leave no record of their understanding upon the direct question of federal control of slavery in the federal territory but there be much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appear different from that of their 23 compeer have it be manifest at all

 for the purpose of adhere rigidly to the text i have purposely omit whatever understanding may have be manifest by any person however distinguish other than the 39 father who frame the original constitution and for the same reason i have also omit whatever understanding may have be manifest by any of the 39 even on any other phase of the general question of slavery if we should look into their act and declaration on those other phase as the foreign slave trade and the morality and policy of slavery generally it would appear to we that on the direct question of federal control of slavery in federal territory the 16 if they have act at all would probably have act just as the 23 do among that 16 be several of the most noted anti slavery man of those time as dr. franklin alexander hamilton and gouverneur morris while there be not one now know to have be otherwise unless it may be john rutledge of south carolina

 the sum of the whole be that of our 39 father who frame the original constitution 21 a clear majority of the whole certainly understand that no proper division of local from federal authority nor any part of the constitution forbid the federal government to control slavery in the federal territory while all the rest probably have the same understanding such unquestionably be the understanding of our father who frame the original constitution and the text affirm that they understand the question well than we

 but so far i have be consider the understanding of the question manifest by the framer of the original constitution in and by the original instrument a mode be provide for amend it and as i have already state the present frame of the government under which we live consist of that original and 12 amendatory article frame and adopt since those who now insist that federal control of slavery in federal territory violate the constitution point we to the provision which they suppose it thus violate and as i understand they all fix upon provision in these amendatory article and not in the original instrument the supreme court in the dred scott case plant themselves upon the fifth amendment which provide that no person shall be deprive of life liberty or property without due process of law while senator douglas and his peculiar adherent plant themselves upon the tenth amendment provide that the power not delegate to the united states by the constitution be reserve to the states respectively or to the people

 now it so happen that these amendment be frame by the first congress which sit under the constitution the identical congress which pass the act already mention enforce the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory not only be it the same congress but they be the identical same individual man who at the same session and at the same time within the session have under consideration and in progress toward maturity these constitutional amendment and this act prohibit slavery in all the territory the nation then own the constitutional amendment be introduce before and pass after the act enforce the ordinance of 87 so that during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the ordinance the constitutional amendment be also pende

 the 76 member of that congress include 16 of the framer of the original constitution as before state be preeminently our father who frame that part of the government under which we live which be now claim as forbid the federal government to control slavery in the federal territory

 be it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the two thing which that congress deliberately frame and carry to maturity at the same time be absolutely inconsistent with each other and do not such affirmation become impudently absurd when couple with the other affirmation from the same mouth that those who do the two thing allege to be inconsistent understand whether they really be inconsistent well than we well than he who affirm that they be inconsistent

 it be surely safe to assume that the 39 framer of the original constitution and the 76 member of the congress which frame the amendment thereto take together do certainly include those who may be fairly call our father who frame the government under which we live and so assume i defy any man to show that any one of they ever in his whole life declare that in his understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territory i go a step far i defy any one to show that any live man in the whole world ever do prior to the beginning of the present century and i might almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century declare that in his understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territory to those who now so declare i give not only our father who frame the government under which we live but with they all other live man within the century in which it be frame among whom to search and they shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agree with they

 now and here let i guard a little against be misunderstood i do not mean to say we be bind to follow implicitly in whatever our father do to do so would be to discard all the light of current experience to reject all progress all improvement what i do say be that if we would supplant the opinion and policy of our father in any case we should do so upon evidence so conclusive and argument so clear that even their great authority fairly consider and weigh can not stand and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understand the question well than we

 if any man at this day sincerely believe that a proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territory he be right to say so and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can but he have no right to mislead other who have less access to history and less leisure to study it into the false belief that our father who frame the government under which we live be of the same opinion thus substitute falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument if any man at this day sincerely believe our father who frame the government under which we live use and apply principle in other case which ought to have lead they to understand that a proper division of local from federal authority or some part of the constitution forbid the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territory he be right to say so but he should at the same time brave the responsibility of declare that in his opinion he understand their principle well than they do themselves and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by assert that they understand the question just as well and even well than we do now

 and now if they would listen as i suppose they will not i would address a few word to the southern people

 i would say to they you consider yourself a reasonable and a just people and i consider that in the general quality of reason and justice you be not inferior to any other people still when you speak of we republicans you do so only to denounce we as reptile or at the good as no well than outlaw you will grant a hearing to pirate or murderer but nothing like it to black republicans in all your contention with one another each of you deem an unconditional condemnation of black republicanism as the first thing to be attend to indeed such condemnation of we seem to be an indispensable prerequisite license so to speak among you to be admit or permit to speak at all now can you or not be prevail upon to pause and to consider whether this be quite just to we or even to yourself bring forward your charge and specification and then be patient long enough to hear we deny or justify

 you say we be sectional we deny it that make an issue and the burden of proof be upon you you produce your proof and what be it why that our party have no existence in your section get no vote in your section the fact be substantially true but do it prove the issue if it do then in case we should without change of principle begin to get vote in your section we should thereby cease to be sectional you can not escape this conclusion and yet be you willing to abide by it if you be you will probably soon find that we have cease to be sectional for we shall get vote in your section this very year you will then begin to discover as the truth plainly be that your proof do not touch the issue the fact that we get no vote in your section be a fact of your making and not of our and if there be fault in that fact that fault be primarily your and remain so until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice if we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice the fault be ours but this bring you to where you ought to have start to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle if our principle put in practice would wrong your section for the benefit of our or for any other object then our principle and we with it be sectional and be justly oppose and denounce as such meet we then on the question of whether our principle put in practice would wrong your section and so meet we as if it be possible that something may be say on our side do you accept the challenge no then you really believe that the principle which our father who frame the government under which we live think so clearly right as to adopt it and indorse it again and again upon their official oath be in fact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moment 's consideration

 some of you delight to flaunt in our face the warning against sectional party give by washington in his farewell address less than eight year before washington give that warning he have as president of the united states approve and sign an act of congress enforce the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory which act embody the policy of the government upon that subject up to and at the very moment he pen that warning and about one year after he pen it he write la fayette that he consider that prohibition a wise measure express in the same connection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free state

 bear this in mind and see that sectionalism have since arise upon this same subject be that warn a weapon in your hand against we or in our hand against you could washington himself speak would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon we who sustain his policy or upon you who repudiate it we respect that warning of washington and we commend it to you together with his example pointing to the right application of it

 but you say you be conservative eminently conservative while we be revolutionary destructive or something of the sort what be conservatism be it not adherence to the old and try against the new and untried we stick to contend for the identical old policy on the point in controversy which be adopt by our father who frame the government under which we live while you with one accord reject and scout and spit upon that old policy and insist upon substitute something new true you disagree among yourself as to what that substitute shall be you be divide on new proposition and plan but you be unanimous in reject and denounce the old policy of the father some of you be for revive the foreign slave trade some for a congressional slave code for the territories some for congress forbid the territories to prohibit slavery within their limit some for maintain slavery in the territories through the judiciary some for the gur reat pur rinciple that if one man would enslave another no third man should object fantastically call popular sovereignty but never a man among you in favor of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territory accord to the practice of our father who frame the government under which we live not one of all your various plan can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our government originate consider then whether your claim of conservatism for yourself and your charge of destructiveness against we be base on the most clear and stable foundation

 again you say we have make the slavery question more prominent than it formerly be we deny it we admit that it be more prominent but we deny that we make it so it be not we but you who discard the old policy of the father we resist and still resist your innovation and thence come the great prominence of the question would you have that question reduce to its former proportion go back to that old policy what have be will be again under the same condition if you would have the peace of the old time readopt the precept and policy of the old time

 you charge that we stir up insurrection among your slave we deny it and what be your proof harper 's ferry john brown john brown be no republican and you have fail to implicate a single republican in his harper 's ferry enterprise if any member of our party be guilty in that matter you know it or you do not know it if you do know it you be inexcusable for not designate the man and prove the fact if you do not know it you be inexcusable for assert it and especially for persist in the assertion after you have try and fail to make the proof you need not be tell that persist in a charge which one do not know to be true be simply malicious slander

 some of you admit that no republican designedly aid or encourage the harper 's ferry affair but still insist that our doctrine and declaration necessarily lead to such result we do not believe it we know we hold to no doctrine and make no declaration which be not hold to and make by our father who frame the government under which we live you never deal fairly by we in relation to this affair when it occur some important state election be near at hand and you be in evident glee with the belief that by charge the blame upon we you could get an advantage of we in those election the election come and your expectation be not quite fulfil every republican man know that as to himself at least your charge be a slander and he be not much incline by it to cast his vote in your favor republican doctrine and declaration be accompany with a continual protest against any interference whatever with your slave or with you about your slave surely this do not encourage they to revolt true we do in common with our father who frame the government under which we live declare our belief that slavery be wrong but the slave do not hear we declare even this for anything we say or do the slave would scarcely know there be a republican party i believe they would not in fact generally know it but for your misrepresentation of we in their hearing in your political contest among yourself each faction charge the other with sympathy with black republicanism and then to give point to the charge define black republicanism to simply be insurrection blood and thunder among the slave

 mr. jefferson do not mean to say nor do i that the power of emancipation be in the federal government he speak of virginia and as to the power of emancipation i speak of the slaveholding state only the federal government however as we insist have the power of restrain the extension of the institution the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any american soil which be now free from slavery

 john brown 's effort be peculiar it be not a slave insurrection it be an attempt by white man to get up a revolt among slave in which the slave refuse to participate in fact it be so absurd that the slave with all their ignorance see plainly enough it could not succeed that affair in its philosophy correspond with the many attempt relate in history at the assassination of king and emperor an enthusiast brood over the oppression of a people till he fancy himself commission by heaven to liberate they he venture the attempt which end in little else than his own execution orsini 's attempt on louis napoleon and john brown 's attempt at harper 's ferry be in their philosophy precisely the same the eagerness to cast blame on old england in the one case and on new england in the other do not disprove the sameness of the two thing

 and how much would it avail you if you could by the use of john brown helper 's book and the like break up the republican organization human action can be modify to some extent but human nature can not be change there be a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation which cast at least a million and a half of vote you can not destroy that judgment and feeling that sentiment by break up the political organization which rally around it you can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which have be form into order in the face of your heavy fire but if you could how much would you gain by force the sentiment which create it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot box into some other channel what would that other channel probably be would the number of john browns be lessen or enlarge by the operation

 but you will break up the union rather than submit to a denial of your constitutional right

 that have a somewhat reckless sound but it would be palliate if not fully justify be we propose by the mere force of number to deprive you of some right plainly write down in the constitution but we be propose no such thing

 when you make these declaration you have a specific and well understand allusion to an assume constitutional right of your to take slave into the federal territory and to hold they there as property but no such right be specifically write in the constitution that instrument be literally silent about any such right we on the contrary deny that such a right have any existence in the constitution even by implication

 your purpose then plainly state be that you will destroy the government unless you be allow to construe and enforce the constitution as you please on all point in dispute between you and we you will rule or ruin in all event

 this plainly state be your language perhaps you will say the supreme court have decide the dispute constitutional question in your favor not quite so but waive the lawyer 's distinction between dictum and decision the court have decide the question for you in a sort of way the court have substantially say it be your constitutional right to take slave into the federal territory and to hold they there as property when i say the decision be make in a sort of way i mean it be make in a divided court by a bare majority of the judge and they not quite agree with one another in the reason for make it that it be so make as that its avow supporter disagree with one another about its meaning and that it be mainly base upon a mistaken statement of fact the statement in the opinion that the right of property in a slave be distinctly and expressly affirm in the constitution

 to show all this be easy and certain when this obvious mistake of the judge shall be bring to their notice be it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement and reconsider the conclusion base upon it

 and then it be to be remember that our father who frame the government under which we live"—the man who make the constitution decide this same constitutional question in our favor long ago decide it without division among themselves when make the decision without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it be make and so far as any evidence be leave without base it upon any mistaken statement of fact

 under all these circumstance do you really feel yourself justify to break up this government unless such a court decision as yours be shall be at once submit to as a conclusive and final rule of political action but you will not abide the election of a republican president in that suppose event you say you will destroy the union and then you say the great crime of having destroy it will be upon we that be cool a highwayman hold a pistol to my ear and mutter through his tooth stand and deliver or i shall kill you and then you will be a murderer

 to be sure what the robber demand of i my money be my own and i have a clear right to keep it but it be no more my own than my vote be my own and the threat of death to i to extort my money and the threat of destruction to the union to extort my vote can scarcely be distinguish in principle

 will they be satisfied if the territories be unconditionally surrender to they we know they will not in all their present complaint against we the territories be scarcely mention invasion and insurrection be the rage now will it satisfy they if in the future we have nothing to do with invasion and insurrection we know it will not we so know because we know we never have anything to do with invasion and insurrection and yet this total abstaining do not exempt we from the charge and the denunciation

 the question recur what will satisfy they simply this we must not only let they alone but we must somehow convince they that we do let they alone this we know by experience be no easy task we have be so try to convince they from the very beginning of our organization but with no success in all our platform and speech we have constantly protest our purpose to let they alone but this have have no tendency to convince they alike unavaile to convince they be the fact that they have never detect a man of we in any attempt to disturb they

 wrong as we think slavery be we can yet afford to let it alone where it be because that much be due to the necessity arise from its actual presence in the nation but can we while our vote will prevent it allow it to spread into the national territories and to overrun we here in these free states if our sense of duty forbid this then let we stand by our duty fearlessly and effectively let we be divert by none of those sophistical contrivance wherewith we be so industriously ply and belabor contrivance such as grope for some middle ground between the right and the wrong vain as the search for a man who should be neither a live man nor a dead man such as a policy of do not care on a question about which all true man do care such as union appeal beseech true union man to yield to disunionists reverse the divine rule and call not the sinner but the righteous to repentance such as invocation to washington implore man to unsay what washington say and undo what washington do

 neither let we be slander from our duty by false accusation against we nor frighten from it by menace of destruction to the government nor of dungeon to ourselves let us have faith that right make might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it





after a delay which have afford i ample time for reflection and after much and careful deliberation i find myself constrain by an imperious sense of duty as a coordinate branch of the federal government to protest against the first two clause of the first resolution adopt by the house of representatives on the 5th instant and publish in the congressional globe on the succeed day these clause be in the following word
 resolve that a committee of five member be appoint by the speaker for the purpose first of investigate whether the president of the united states or any other officer of the government have by money patronage or other improper mean seek to influence the action of congress or any committee thereof for or against the passage of any law appertain to the right of any state or territory and second also to inquire into and investigate whether any officer or officer of the government have by combination or otherwise prevent or defeat or attempt to prevent or defeat the execution of any law or law now upon the statute book and whether the president have fail or refuse to compel the execution of any law thereof
 i confine myself exclusively to these two branch of the resolution because the portion of it which follow relate to allege abuse in post office navy yard public building and other public work of the united states in such case inquiry be highly proper in themselves and belong equally to the senate and the house as incident to their legislative duty and be necessary to enable they to discover and to provide the appropriate legislative remedy for any abuse which may be ascertain although the term of the latter portion of the resolution be extremely vague and general yet my sole purpose in advert to they at present be to mark the broad line of distinction between the accusatory and the remedial clause of this resolution the house of representatives possess no power under the constitution over the first or accusatory portion of the resolution except as an impeach body whilst over the last in common with the senate their authority as a legislative body be fully and cheerfully admit
 it be solely in reference to the first or impeach power that i propose to make a few observation except in this single case the constitution have invest the house of representatives with no power no jurisdiction no supremacy whatever over the president in all other respect he be quite as independent of they as they be of he as a coordinate branch of the government he be their equal indeed he be the only direct representative on earth of the people of all and each of the sovereign states to they and to they alone be he responsible whilst act within the sphere of his constitutional duty and not in any manner to the house of representatives the people have think proper to invest he with the most honorable responsible and dignified office in the world and the individual however unworthy now hold this exalt position will take care so far as in he lie that their right and prerogative shall never be violate in his person but shall pass to his successor unimpaire by the adoption of a dangerous precedent he will defend they to the last extremity against any unconstitutional attempt come from what quarter it may to abridge the constitutional right of the executive and render he subservient to any human power except themselves
 the people have not confine the president to the exercise of executive duty they have also confer upon he a large measure of legislative discretion no bill can become a law without his approval as represent the people of the united states unless it shall pass after his veto by a majority of two third of both houses in his legislative capacity he might in common with the senate and the house institute an inquiry to ascertain any fact which ought to influence his judgment in approve or veto any bill
 this participation in the performance of legislative duty between the coordinate branch of the government ought to inspire the conduct of all of they in their relation toward each other with mutual forbearance and respect at least each have a right to demand justice from the other the cause of complaint be that the constitutional right and immunity of the executive have be violate in the person of the president
 the trial of an impeachment of the president before the senate on charge prefer and prosecute against he by the house of representatives would be an impose spectacle for the world in the result not only his removal from the presidential office would be involve but what be of infinitely great importance to himself his character both in the eye of the present and of future generation might possibly be tarnish the disgrace cast upon he would in some degree be reflect upon the character of the american people who elect he hence the precaution adopt by the constitution to secure a fair trial on such a trial it declare that the chief justice shall preside this be doubtless because the framer of the constitution believe it to be possible that the vice president might be bias by the fact that in case of the removal of the president from office the same shall devolve on the vice president
 the preliminary proceeding in the house in the case of charge which may involve impeachment have be well and wisely settle by long practice upon principle of equal justice both to the accuse and to the people the precedent establish in the case of judge peck of missouri in 1831 after a careful review of all former precedent will i venture to predict stand the test of time
 in that case luke edward lawless the accuser present a petition to the house in which he set forth minutely and specifically his cause of complaint he pray that the conduct and proceeding in this behalf of say judge peck may be inquire into by your honorable body and such decision make thereon as to your wisdom and justice shall seem proper this petition be refer to the judiciary committee such have ever be deem the appropriate committee to make similar investigation it be a stand committee suppose to be appoint without reference to any special case and at all time be presume to be compose of the most eminent lawyer in the house from different portion of the union whose acquaintance with judicial proceeding and whose habit of investigation qualify they peculiarly for the task no tribunal from their position and character could in the nature of thing be more impartial in the case of judge peck the witness be select by the committee itself with a view to ascertain the truth of the charge they be cross examine by he and everything be conduct in such a manner as to afford he no reasonable cause of complaint in view of this precedent and what be of far great importance in view of the constitution and the principle of eternal justice in what manner have the president of the united states be treat by the house of representatives mr. john covode a representative from pennsylvania be the accuser of the president instead of follow the wise precedent of former time and especially that in the case of judge peck and refer the accusation to the committee on the judiciary the house have make my accuser one of my judge
 to make the accuser the judge be a violation of the principle of universal justice and be condemn by the practice of all civilized nation every freeman must revolt at such a spectacle i be to appear before mr. covode either personally or by a substitute to cross examine the witness which he may produce before himself to sustain his own accusation against i and perhaps even this poor boon may be deny to the president
 and what be the nature of the investigation which his resolution propose to institute it be as vague and general as the english language afford word in which to make it the committee be to inquire not into any specific charge or charge but whether the president have by money patronage or other improper mean seek to influence not the action of any individual member or member of congress but the action of the entire body of congress itself or any committee thereof the president might have have some glimmering of the nature of the offense to be investigate have his accuser point to the act or act of congress which he seek to pass or to defeat by the employment of money patronage or other improper mean but the accusation be bound by no such limit it extend to the whole circle of legislation to interference for or against the passage of any law appertain to the right of any state or territory and what law do not appertain to the right of some state or territory and what law or law have the president fail to execute these might easily have be point out have any such existed
 have mr. lawless ask an inquiry to be make by the house whether judge peck in general term have not violate his judicial duty without the specification of any particular act i do not believe there would have be a single vote in that body in favor of the inquiry
 since the time of the star chamber and of general warrant there have be no such proceeding in england
 the house of representatives the high impeach power of the country without consent to hear a word of explanation have indorse this accusation against the president and make it their own act they even refuse to permit a member to inquire of the president&#39;s accuser what be the specific charge against he thus in this preliminary accusation of high crime and misdemeanor against a coordinate branch of the government under the impeach power the house refuse to hear a single suggestion even in regard to the correct mode of proceeding but without a moment&#39;s delay pass the accusatory resolution under the pressure of the previous question
 in the institution of a prosecution for any offense against the most humble citizen and i claim for myself no great right than he enjoy the constitution of the united states and of the several states require that he shall be inform in the very beginning of the nature and cause of the accusation against he in order to enable he to prepare for his defense there be other principle which i might enumerate not less sacred present an impenetrable shield to protect every citizen falsely charge with a criminal offense these have be violate in the prosecution institute by the house of representatives against the executive branch of the government shall the president alone be deprive of the protection of these great principle which prevail in every land where a ray of liberty penetrate the gloom of despotism shall the executive alone be deprive of right which all his fellow citizen enjoy the whole proceeding against he justify the fear of those wise and great man who before the constitution be adopt by the states apprehend that the tendency of the government be to the aggrandizement of the legislative at the expense of the executive and judicial department
 i again declare emphatically that i make this protest for no reason personal to myself and i do it with perfect respect for the house of representatives in which i have the honor of serve as a member for five successive term i have live long in this goodly land and have enjoy all the office and honor which my country could bestow amid all the political storm through which i have pass the present be the first attempt which have ever be make to my knowledge to assail my personal or official integrity and this as the time be approach when i shall voluntarily retire from the service of my country i feel proudly conscious that there be no public act of my life which will not bear the strict scrutiny i defy all investigation nothing but the basest perjury can sully my good name i do not fear even this because i cherish an humble confidence that the gracious being who have hitherto defend and protect i against the shaft of falsehood and malice will not desert i now when i have become old and gray head i can declare before god and my country that no human being with an exception scarcely worthy of notice have at any period of my life dare to approach i with a corrupt or dishonorable proposition and until recent development it have never enter into my imagination that any person even in the storm of exasperate political excitement would charge i in the most remote degree with having make such a proposition to any human being i may now however exclaim in the language of complaint employ by my first and great predecessor that i have be abuse in such exaggerated and indecent term as could scarcely be apply to a nero to a notorious defaulter or even to a common pickpocket
 i do therefore for the reason state and in the name of the people of the several states solemnly protest against these proceeding of the house of representatives because they be in violation of the right of the coordinate executive branch of the government and subversive of its constitutional independence because they be calculate to foster a band of interested parasite and informer ever ready for their own advantage to swear before ex parte committee to pretend private conversation between the president and themselves incapable from their nature of be disprove thus furnish material for harass he degrade he in the eye of the country and eventually should he be a weak or a timid man render he subservient to improper influence in order to avoid such persecution and annoyance because they tend to destroy that harmonious action for the common good which ought to be maintain and which i sincerely desire to cherish between coordinate branch of the government and finally because if unresisted they would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successor to whatever political party they might be attach

on the 26th day of april last lieutenant craven of the united states steamer mohawk capture the slaver wildfire on the coast of cuba with 507 african negro on board the prize be bring into key west on the 31st april and the negro be deliver into the custody of fernando j. moreno marshal of the southern district of florida
 the question which now demand immediate decision be what disposition shall be make of these africans in the annual message to congress of december 6 1858 i express my opinion in regard to the construction of the act of the 3d march 1819 in addition to the act prohibit the slave trade so far as the same be applicable to the present case from this i make the following extract
 under the second section of this act the president be authorize to make such regulation and arrangement as he may deem expedient for the safe keeping support and removal beyond the limit of the united states of all such negro mulattoe or person of color capture by vessel of the united states as may be deliver to the marshal of the district into which they be bring and to appoint a proper person or person reside upon the coast of africa as agent or agent for receive the negro mulattoe or person of color deliver from on board vessel seize in the prosecution of the slave trade by commander of united states armed vessel
 a doubt immediately arise as to the true construction of this act it be quite clear from its term that the president be authorize to provide for the safe keeping support and removal of these negro up till the time of their delivery to the agent on the coast of africa but no express provision be make for their protection and support after they have reach the place of their destination still an agent be to be appoint to receive they in africa and it could not have be suppose that congress intend he should desert they at the moment they be receive and turn they loose on that inhospitable coast to perish for want of food or to become again the victim of the slave trade have this be the intention of congress the employment of an agent to receive they who be require to reside on the coast be unnecessary and they might have be land by our vessel anywhere in africa and leave expose to the suffering and the fate which would certainly await they
 mr. monroe in his special message of december 17 1819 at the first session after the act be pass announce to congress what in his opinion be its true construction he believe it to be his duty under it to follow these unfortunate into africa and make provision for they there until they should be able to provide for themselves in communicate this interpretation of the act to congress he state that some doubt have be entertain as to its true intent and meaning and he submit the question to they so that they might should it be deem advisable amend the same before further proceeding be have under it nothing be do by congress to explain the act and mr. monroe proceed to carry it into execution accord to his own interpretation this then become the practical construction
 adopt this construction of president monroe i enter into an agreement with the colonization society date 7th september 1858 to receive the africans which have be capture on the slaver echo from the agent of the united states in liberia to furnish they during the period of one year thereafter with comfortable shelter clothing and provision and to cause they to be instruct in the art of civilized life suitable to their condition at the rate of $ 150 for each individual it be believe that within that period they would be prepare to become citizen of liberia and to take care of themselves
 as congress be not then in session and as there be no outstanding appropriation applicable to this purpose the society be oblige to depend for payment on the future action of that body i recommend this appropriation and $ 75,000 be grant by the act of 3d march 1859 the consular and diplomatic bill to enable the president of the united states to carry into effect the act of congress of 3d march 1819 and any subsequent act now in force for the suppression of the slave trade of this appropriation there remain unexpended the sum of $ 24,350.90 after deduct from it an advance make by the secretary of the interior out of the judiciary fund of $ 11,348.10
 i regret to say that under the mode adopt in regard to the africans capture on board the echo the expense will be large but this seem to a great extent to be inevitable without a violation of the law of humanity the expenditure upon this scale for those capture on board the wildfire will not be less than $ 100,000 and may considerably exceed that sum still it ought to be observe that during the period when the government itself through its own agent undertake the task of provide for capture negro in africa the cost per head be much great than that which i agree to pay the colonization society
 but it will not be sufficient for congress to limit the amount appropriate to the case of the wildfire it be probable judge from the increase activity of the slave trade and the vigilance of our cruiser that several similar capture may be make before the end of the year an appropriation ought therefore to be grant large enough to cover such contingency
 the period have arrive when it be indispensable to provide some specific legislation for the guidance of the executive on this subject with this view i would suggest that congress might authorize the president to enter into a general agreement with the colonization society bind they to receive on the coast of africa from an agent there all the capture africans which may be deliver to he and to maintain they for a limited period upon such term and condition as may combine humanity toward these unfortunate with a just economy this would obviate the necessity of make a new bargain with every new capture and would prevent delay and avoid expense in the disposition of the capture the law might then provide that in all case where this may be practicable the captor should carry the negro directly to africa and deliver they to the american agent there afterwards bring the capture vessel to the united states for adjudication
 the capture officer in case he should bring his prize directly to the united states ought to be require to land the negro in some one or more port to be designate by congress where the prevail health throughout the year be good at these port cheap but permanent accommodation might be provide for the negro until they could be send away without incur the expense of erect such accommodation at every port where the capture officer may think proper to enter on the present occasion these negro have be bring to key west and accord to the estimate present by the marshal of the southern district of florida to the secretary of the interior the cost of provide temporary quarter for they will be $ 2,500 and the aggregate expense for the single month of may will amount to $ 12,000 but this be far from be the bad evil within a few week the yellow fever will most probably prevail at key west and hence the marshal urge their removal from their present quarter at an early day which must be do in any event as soon as practicable for these reason i earnestly commend this subject to the immediate attention of congress i transmit herewith a copy of the letter and estimate of fernando j. moreno marshal of the southern district of florida to the secretary of the interior date 10th may 1860 together with a copy of the letter of the secretary of the interior to myself date 16th may
 it be truly lamentable that great britain and the united states should be oblige to expend such a vast amount of blood and treasure for the suppression of the african slave trade and this when the only portion of the civilized world where it be tolerate and encourage be the spanish island of cuba and porto rico

in my message to the house of representatives of the 28th march last i solemnly protest against the creation of a committee at the head of which be place my accuser for the purpose of investigate whether the president have by money patronage or other improper mean seek to influence the action of congress or any committee thereof for or against the passage of any law appertain to the right of any state or territory i protest against this because it be destitute of any specification because it refer to no particular act to enable the president to prepare for his defense because it deprive he of the constitutional guard which in common with every citizen of the united states he possess for his protection and because it assail his constitutional independence as a coordinate branch of the government
 there be an enlightened justice as well as a beautiful symmetry in every part of the constitution this be conspicuously manifest in regard to impeachment the house of representatives possess the sole power of impeachment the senate the sole power to try all impeachment and the impeachable offense be treason bribery or other high crime or misdemeanor the practice of the house from the early time have be in accordance with its own dignity the right of the accuse and the demand of justice at the commencement of each judicial investigation which might lead to an impeachment specific charge be always prefer the accuse have an opportunity of cross examine the witness and he be place in full possession of the precise nature of the offense which he have to meet an impartial and elevated standing committee be charge with this investigation upon which no member inspire with the ancient sense of honor and justice would have serve have he ever express an opinion against the accuse until the present occasion it be never deem proper to transform the accuser into the judge and to confer upon he the selection of his own committee
 the charge make against i in vague and general term be of such a false and atrocious character that i do not entertain a moment&#39;s apprehension for the result they be abhorrent to every principle instill into i from my youth and every practice of my life and i do not believe it possible that the man exist who would so basely perjure himself as to swear to the truth of any such accusation in this conviction i be inform i have not be mistaken
 in my former protest therefore i truly and emphatically declare that it be make for no reason personal to myself but because the proceeding of the house be in violation of the right of the coordinate executive branch of the government subversive of its constitutional independence and if unresisted would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successor notwithstanding all this if the committee have not transcend the authority confer upon it by the resolution of the house of representatives broad and general as this be i should have remain silent upon the subject what i now charge be that they have act as though they possess unlimited power and without any warrant whatever in the resolution under which they be appoint have pursue a course not merely at war with the constitutional right of the executive but tend to degrade the presidential office itself to such a degree as to render it unworthy of the acceptance of any man of honor or principle
 the resolution of the house so far as it be accusatory of the president be confine to an inquiry whether he have use corrupt or improper mean to influence the action of congress or any of its committee on legislative measure pende before they nothing more nothing less i have not learn through the newspaper or in any other mode that the committee have touch the other accusatory branch of the resolution charge the president with a violation of duty in fail to execute some law or law this branch of the resolution be therefore out of the question by what authority then have the committee undertake to investigate the course of the president in regard to the convention which frame the lecompton constitution by what authority have they undertake to pry into our foreign relation for the purpose of assail he on account of the instruction give by the secretary of state to our minister in mexico relative to the tehuantepec route by what authority have they inquire into the cause of removal from office and this from the party themselves remove with a view to prejudice his character notwithstanding this power of removal belong exclusively to the president under the constitution be so decide by the first congress in the year 1789 and have accordingly ever since be exercise there be in the resolution no pretext of authority for the committee to investigate the question of the printing of the post office blank nor be it to be suppose that the house if ask would have grant such an authority because this question have be previously commit to two other committee one in the senate and the other in the house notwithstanding this absolute want of power the committee rush into this investigation in advance of all other subject
 the committee proceed for month from march 22 1860 to examine ex parte and without any notice to myself into every subject which could possibly affect my character interested and vindictive witness be summon and examine before they and the first and only information of their testimony which in almost every instance i receive be obtain from the publication of such portion of it as could injuriously affect myself in the new york journal it matter not that these statement be so far as i have learn disprove by the most respectable witness who happen to be on the spot the telegraph be silent respect these contradiction it be a secret committee in regard to the testimony in my defense but it be public in regard to all the testimony which could by possibility reflect on my character the poison be leave to produce its effect upon the public mind whilst the antidote be carefully withhold
 in their examination the committee violate the most sacred and honorable confidence exist among man private correspondence which a truly honorable man would never even entertain a distant thought of divulge be drag to light different person in official and confidential relation with myself and with whom it be suppose i might have hold conversation the revelation of which would do i injury be examine even member of the senate and member of my own cabinet both my constitutional adviser be call upon to testify for the purpose of discover something if possible to my discredit
 the distribution of the patronage of the government be by far the most disagreeable duty of the president applicant be so numerous and their application be press with such eagerness by their friend both in and out of congress that the selection of one for any desirable office give offense to many disappointed applicant removed officer and those who for any cause real or imaginary have become hostile to the administration present themselves or be invite by a summon to appear before the committee these be the most dangerous witness even with the good intention they be so influence by prejudice and disappointment that they almost inevitably discolor truth they swear to their own version of private conversation with the president without the possibility of contradiction his lip be seal and he be leave at their mercy he can not as a coordinate branch of the government appear before a committee of investigation to contradict the oath of such witness every coward know that he can employ insult language against the president with impunity and every false or prejudiced witness can attempt to swear away his character before such a committee without the fear of contradiction
 thus for month whilst do my good at one end of the avenue to perform my high and responsible duty to the country have there be a committee of the house of representatives in session at the other end of the avenue spread a drag net without the shadow of authority from the house over the whole union to catch any disappointed man willing to malign my character and all this in secret conclave the lion&#39; mouth at venice into which secret denunciation be drop be an apt illustration of the covode committee the star chamber tyrannical and odious as it be never proceed in such a manner for century there have be nothing like it in any civilized country except the revolutionary tribunal of france in the day of robespierre now i undertake to state and to prove that should the proceeding of the committee be sanction by the house and become a precedent for future time the balance of the constitution will be entirely upset and there will no long remain the three coordinate and independent branch of the government legislative executive and judicial the bad fear of the patriot and statesman who frame the constitution in regard to the usurpation of the legislative on the executive and judicial branch will then be realize in the language of mr. madison speak on this very subject in the forty eighth number of the federalist
 in a representative republic where the executive magistracy be carefully limited both in the extent and duration of its power and where the legislative power be exercise by an assembly which be inspire by a suppose influence over the people with an intrepid confidence in its own strength which be sufficiently numerous to feel all the passion which actuate a multitude yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursue the object of its passion by mean which reason prescribe it be against the enterprising ambition of this department that the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precaution
 and in the expressive and pointed language of mr. jefferson when speak of the tendency of the legislative branch of government to usurp the right of the weak branch
 the concentrate these in the same hand be precisely the definition of despotic government it will be no alleviation that these power will be exercise by a plurality of hand and not by a single one one hundred and seventy three despot would surely be as oppressive as one let those who doubt it turn their eye on the republic of venice as little will it avail we that they be choose by ourselves an elective despotism be not the government we fight for but one which should not only be round on free principle but in which the power of government should be so divided and balance among several body of magistracy as that no one could transcend their legal limit without be effectually check and control by the other
 should the proceeding of the covode committee become a precedent both the letter and spirit of the constitution will be violate one of the three massive column on which the whole superstructure rest will be break down instead of the executive be a coordinate it will become a subordinate branch of the government the presidential office will be drag into the dust the house of representatives will then have render the executive almost necessarily subservient to its wish instead of be independent how be it possible that two power in the state can be coordinate and independent of each other if the one claim and exercise the power to reprove and to censure all the official act and all the private conversation of the other and this upon ex parte testimony before a secret inquisitorial committee in short to assume a general censorship over the other the idea be as absurd in public as it would be in private life should the president attempt to assert and maintain his own independence future covode committee may dragoon he into submission by collect the host of disappointed office hunter removed officer and those who desire to live upon the public treasury which must follow in the wake of every administration and they in secret conclave will swear away his reputation under such circumstance he must be a very bold man should he not surrender at discretion and consent to exercise his authority accord to the will of those invest with this terrific power the sovereign people of the several states have elect he to the high and most honorable office in the world he be their only direct representative in the government by their constitution they have make he commander in chief of their army and navy he represent they in their intercourse with foreign nation clothe with their dignity and authority he occupy a proud position before all nation civilized and savage with the consent of the senate he appoint all the important officer of the government he exercise the veto power and to that extent control the legislation of congress for the performance of these high duty he be responsible to the people of the several states and not in any degree to the house of representatives
 shall he surrender these high power confer upon he as the representative of the american people for their benefit to the house to be exercise under their overshadow influence and control shall he alone of all the citizen of the united states be deny a fair trial shall he alone not be inform of the nature and cause of the accusation against he shall he alone not be confront with the witness against he shall the house of representatives usurp the power of the senate proceed to try the president through the agency of a secret committee of the body where it be impossible he can make any defense and then without afford he an opportunity of be hear pronounce a judgment of censure against he the very same rule might be apply for the very same reason to every judge of every court of the united states from what part of the constitution be this terrible secret inquisitorial power derive no such express power exist from which of the enumerate power can it be infer it be true the house can not pronounce the formal judgment against he of removal from office but they can by their judgment of censure asperse his reputation and thus to the extent of their influence render the office contemptible an example be at hand of the reckless manner in which this power of censure can be employ in high party time the house on a recent occasion have attempt to degrade the president by adopt the resolution of mr. john sherman declare that he in conjunction with the secretary of the navy by receive and consider the party relation of bidder for contract and the effect of award contract upon pende election have set an example dangerous to the public safety and deserve the reproof of this house
 it will scarcely be credit that the sole pretext for this vote of censure be the simple fact that in dispose of the numerous letter of every imaginable character which i daily receive i have in the usual course of business refer a letter from colonel patterson of philadelphia in relation to a contract to the attention of the secretary of the navy the head of the appropriate department without express or intimate any opinion whatever on the subject and to make the matter if possible still plainer the secretary have inform the committee that the president do not in any manner interfere in this case nor have he in any other case of contract since i have be in the department the absence of all proof to sustain this attempt to degrade the president whilst it manifest the venom of the shaft aim at he have destroy the vigor of the bow
 to return after this digression should the house by the institution of covode committee vote of censure and other device to harass the president reduce he to subservience to their will and render he their creature then the well balanced government which our father frame will be annihilate this conflict have already be commence in earnest by the house against the executive a bad precedent rarely if ever die it will i fear be pursue in the time of my successor no matter what may be their political character should secret committee be appoint with unlimited authority to range over all the word and action and if possible the very thought of the president with a view to discover something in his past life prejudicial to his character from parasite and informer this would be an ordeal which scarcely any mere man since the fall could endure it would be to subject he to a reign of terror from which the stout and pure heart might shrink i have pass triumphantly through this ordeal my vindication be complete the committee have report no resolution look to an impeachment against i no resolution of censure not even a resolution point out any abuse in any of the executive departments of the government to be correct by legislation this be the high commendation which could be bestow on the head of these departments the sovereign people of the states will however i trust save my successor whoever they may be from any such ordeal they be frank bold and honest they det delator and informer i therefore in the name and as the representative of this great people and stand upon the rampart of the constitution which they have ordain and establish do solemnly protest against these unprecedented and unconstitutional proceeding
 there be still another committee raise by the house on the 6th march last on motion of mr. hoard to which i have not the slight objection the resolution create it be confine to specific charge which i have ever since be ready and willing to meet i have at all time invite and defy fair investigation upon constitutional principle i have receive no notice that this committee have ever proceed to the investigation
 why should the house of representatives desire to encroach on the other department of the government their rightful power be ample for every legitimate purpose they be the impeach body in their legislative capacity it be their most wise and wholesome prerogative to institute rigid examination into the manner in which all department of the government be conduct with a view to reform abuse to promote economy and to improve every branch of administration should they find reason to believe in the course of their examination that any grave offense have be commit by the president or any officer of the government render it proper in their judgment to resort to impeachment their course would be plain they would then transfer the question from their legislative to their accusatory jurisdiction and take care that in all the preliminary judicial proceeding preparatory to the vote of article of impeachment the accuse should enjoy the benefit of cross examine the witness and all the other safeguard with which the constitution surround every american citizen
 if in a legislative investigation it should appear that the public interest require the removal of any officer of the government no president have ever exist who after give he a fair hearing would hesitate to apply the remedy
 this i take to be the ancient and well establish practice an adherence to it will well promote the harmony and the dignity of the intercourse between the coordinate branch of the government and render we all more respectable both in the eye of our own countryman and of foreign nation

fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives throughout the year since our last meeting the country have be eminently prosperous in all its material interest the general health have be excellent our harvest have be abundant and plenty smile throughout the laud our commerce and manufacture have be prosecute with energy and industry and have yield fair and ample return in short no nation in the tide of time have ever present a spectacle of great material prosperity than we have do until within a very recent period why be it then that discontent now so extensively prevail and the union of the states which be the source of all these blessing be threaten with destruction?the long continue and intemperate interference of the northern people with the question of slavery in the southern states have at length produce its natural effect the different section of the union be now array against each other and the time have arrive so much dread by the father of his country when hostile geographical party have be form i have long foresee and often forewarn my countryman of the now impend danger this do not proceed solely from the claim on the part of congress or the territorial legislature to exclude slavery from the territories nor from the effort of different states to defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law all or any of these evil might have be endure by the south without danger to the union as other have be in the hope that time and reflection might apply the remedy the immediate peril arise not so much from these cause as from the fact that the incessant and violent agitation of the slavery question throughout the north for the last quarter of a century have at length produce its malign influence on the slave and inspire they with vague notion of freedom hence a sense of security no long exist around the family altar this feeling of peace at home have give place to apprehension of servile insurrection many a matron throughout the south retire at night in dread of what may befall herself and child before the morning should this apprehension of domestic danger whether real or imaginary extend and intensify itself until it shall pervade the masse of the southern people then disunion will become inevitable self preservation be the first law of nature and have be implant in the heart of man by his creator for the wise purpose and no political union however fraught with blessing and benefit in all other respect can long continue if the necessary consequence be to render the home and the fireside of nearly half the party to it habitually and hopelessly insecure soon or later the bond of such a union must be sever it be my conviction that this fatal period have not yet arrive and my prayer to god be that he would preserve the constitution and the union throughout all generation but let we take warning in time and remove the cause of danger it can not be deny that for five and twenty year the agitation at the north against slavery have be incessant in 1835 pictorial handbill and inflammatory appeal be circulate extensively throughout the south of a character to excite the passion of the slave and in the language of general jackson to stimulate they to insurrection and produce all the horror of a servile war this agitation have ever since be continue by the public press by the proceeding of state and county convention and by abolition sermon and lecture the time of congress have be occupy in violent speech on this never end subject and appeal in pamphlet and other form indorse by distinguished name have be send forth from this central point and spread broadcast over the union how easy would it be for the american people to settle the slavery question forever and to restore peace and harmony to this distracted country they and they alone can do it all that be necessary to accomplish the object and all for which the slave states have ever contend be to be let alone and permit to manage their domestic institution in their own way as sovereign state they and they alone be responsible before god and the world for the slavery exist among they for this the people of the north be not more responsible and have no more fight to interfere than with similar institution in russia or in brazil upon their good sense and patriotic forbearance i confess i still greatly rely without their aid it be beyond the power of any president no matter what may be his own political proclivity to restore peace and harmony among the states wisely limited and restrain as be his power under our constitution and law he alone can accomplish but little for good or for evil on such a momentous question and this bring i to observe that the election of any one of our fellow citizen to the office of president do not of itself afford just cause for dissolve the union this be more especially true if his election have be effect by a mere plurality and not a majority of the people and have result from transient and temporary cause which may probably never again occur in order to justify a resort to revolutionary resistance the federal government must be guilty of a deliberate palpable and dangerous exercise of power not grant by the constitution the late presidential election however have be hold in strict conformity with its express provision how then can the result justify a revolution to destroy this very constitution reason justice a regard for the constitution all require that we shall wait for some overt and dangerous act on the part of the president elect before resort to such a remedy it be say however that the antecedent of the president elect have be sufficient to justify the fear of the south that he will attempt to invade their constitutional right but be such apprehension of contingent danger in the future sufficient to justify the immediate destruction of the noble system of government ever devise by mortal from the very nature of his office and its high responsibility he must necessarily be conservative the stern duty of administer the vast and complicated concern of this government afford in itself a guaranty that he will not attempt any violation of a clear constitutional right after all he be no more than the chief executive officer of the government his province be not to make but to execute the law and it be a remarkable fact in our history that notwithstanding the repeat effort of the antislavery party no single act have ever pass congress unless we may possibly except the missouri compromise impair in the slight degree the right of the south to their property in slave and it may also be observe judge from present indication that no probability exist of the passage of such an act by a majority of both houses either in the present or the next congress surely under these circumstance we ought to be restrain from present action by the precept of he who spake as man never speak that sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof the day of evil may never come unless we shall rashly bring it upon ourselves it be allege as one cause for immediate secession that the southern states be deny equal right with the other states in the common territories but by what authority be these deny not by congress which have never pass and i believe never will pass any act to exclude slavery from these territories and certainly not by the supreme court which have solemnly decide that slave be property and like all other property their owner have a right to take they into the common territories and hold they there under the protection of the constitution so far then as congress be concern the objection be not to anything they have already do but to what they may do hereafter it will surely be admit that this apprehension of future danger be no good reason for an immediate dissolution of the union it be true that the territorial legislature of kansas on the 23d february 1860 pass in great haste an act over the veto of the governor declare that slavery be and shall be forever prohibit in this territory such an act however plainly violate the right of property secure by the constitution will surely be declare void by the judiciary whenever it shall be present in a legal form only three day after my inauguration the supreme court of the united states solemnly adjudge that this power do not exist in a territorial legislature yet such have be the factious temper of the time that the correctness of this decision have be extensively impugn before the people and the question have give rise to angry political conflict throughout the country those who have appeal from this judgment of our high constitutional tribunal to popular assembly would if they could invest a territorial legislature with power to annul the sacred right of property this power congress be expressly forbid by the federal constitution to exercise every state legislature in the union be forbid by its own constitution to exercise it it can not be exercise in any state except by the people in their high sovereign capacity when frame or amend their state constitution in like manner it can only be exercise by the people of a territory represent in a convention of delegate for the purpose of frame a constitution preparatory to admission as a state into the union then and not until then be they invest with power to decide the question whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their limit this be an act of sovereign authority and not of subordinate territorial legislation be it otherwise then indeed would the equality of the states in the territories be destroy and the right of property in slave would depend not upon the guaranty of the constitution but upon the shift majority of an irresponsible territorial legislature such a doctrine from its intrinsic unsoundness can not long influence any considerable portion of our people much less can it afford a good reason for a dissolution of the union the most palpable violation of constitutional duty which have yet be commit consist in the act of different state legislature to defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law it ought to be remember however that for these act neither congress nor any president can justly be hold responsible having be pass in violation of the federal constitution they be therefore null and void all the court both state and national before whom the question have arise have from the beginning declare the fugitive slave law to be constitutional the single exception be that of a state court in wisconsin and this have not only be reverse by the proper appellate tribunal but have meet with such universal reprobation that there can be no danger from it as a precedent the validity of this law have be establish over and over again by the supreme court of the united states with perfect unanimity it be round upon an express provision of the constitution require that fugitive slave who escape from service in one state to another shall be deliver up to their master without this provision it be a well know historical fact that the constitution itself could never have be adopt by the convention in one form or other under the act of 1793 and 1850 both be substantially the same the fugitive slave law have be the law of the land from the day of washington until the present moment here then a clear case be present in which it will be the duty of the next president as it have be my own to act with vigor in execute this supreme law against the conflict enactment of state legislature should he fail in the performance of this high duty he will then have manifest a disregard of the constitution and law to the great injury of the people of nearly one half of the states of the union but be we to presume in advance that he will thus violate his duty this would be at war with every principle of justice and of christian charity let we wait for the overt act the fugitive slave law have be carry into execution in every contest case since the commencement of the present administration though often it be to be regret with great loss and inconvenience to the master and with considerable expense to the government let we trust that the state legislature will repeal their unconstitutional and obnoxious enactment unless this shall be do without unnecessary delay it be impossible for any human power to save the union the southern states stand on the basis of the constitution have right to demand this act of justice from the states of the north should it be refuse then the constitution to which all the states be party will have be willfully violate by one portion of they in a provision essential to the domestic security and happiness of the remainder in that event the injure states after having first use all peaceful and constitutional mean to obtain redress would be justify in revolutionary resistance to the government of the union i have purposely confine my remark to revolutionary resistance because it have be claim within the last few year that any state whenever this shall be its sovereign will and pleasure may secede from the union in accordance with the constitution and without any violation of the constitutional right of the other member of the confederacy that as each become party to the union by the vote of its own people assemble in convention so any one of they may retire from the union in a similar manner by the vote of such a convention in order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy it must be on the principle that the federal government be a mere voluntary association of states to be dissolve at pleasure by any one of the contracting party if this be so the confederacy be a rope of sand to be penetrate and dissolve by the first adverse wave of public opinion in any of the states in this manner our thirty three states may resolve themselves into as many petty jarring and hostile republic each one retire from the union without responsibility whenever any sudden excitement might impel they to such a course by this process a union might be entirely break into fragment in a few week which cost our forefather many year of toil privation and blood to establish such a principle be wholly inconsistent with the history as well as the character of the federal constitution after it be frame with the great deliberation and care it be submit to convention of the people of the several states for ratification its provision be discuss at length in these body compose of the first man of the country its opponent contend that it confer power upon the federal government dangerous to the right of the states whilst its advocate maintain that under a fair construction of the instrument there be no foundation for such apprehension in that mighty struggle between the first intellect of this or any other country it never occur to any individual either among its opponent or advocate to assert or even to intimate that their effort be all vain labor because the moment that any state feel herself aggrieve she might secede from the union what a crush argument would this have prove against those who dread that the right of the states would be endanger by the constitution the truth be that it be not until many year after the origin of the federal government that such a proposition be first advanced it be then meet and refute by the conclusive argument of general jackson who in his message of the 16th of january 1833 transmit the nullify ordinance of south carolina to congress employ the following language the right of the people of a single state to absolve themselves at will and without the consent of the other states from their most solemn obligation and hazard the liberty and happiness of the million compose this union can not be acknowledge such authority be believe to be utterly repugnant both to the principle upon which the general government be constitute and to the object which it be expressly form to attain it be not pretend that any clause in the constitution give countenance to such a theory it be altogether round upon inference not from any language contain in the instrument itself but from the sovereign character of the several states by which it be ratify but be it beyond the power of a state like an individual to yield a portion of its sovereign right to secure the remainder in the language of mr. madison who have be call the father of the constitution it be form by the states that be by the people in each of the states act in their high sovereign capacity and form consequently by the same authority which form the state constitution nor be the government of the united states create by the constitution less a government in the strict sense of the term within the sphere of its power than the government create by the constitution of the states be within their several sphere it be like they organize into legislative executive and judiciary department it operate like they directly on person and thing and like they it have at command a physical force for execute the power commit to it it be intend to be perpetual and not to be annul at the pleasure of any one of the contracting party the old articles of confederation be entitle articles of confederation and perpetual union between the states and by the thirteenth article it be expressly declare that the article of this confederation shall be inviolably observe by every state and the union shall be perpetual the preamble to the constitution of the united states have express reference to the articles of confederation recite that it be establish in order to form a more perfect union and yet it be contend that this more perfect union do not include the essential attribute of perpetuity but that the union be design to be perpetual appear conclusively from the nature and extent of the power confer by the constitution on the federal government these power embrace the very high attribute of national sovereignty they place both the sword and the purse under its control congress have power to make war and to make peace to raise and support army and navy and to conclude treaty with foreign government it be invest with the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and to regulate commerce with foreign nation and among the several states it be not necessary to enumerate the other high power which have be confer upon the federal government in order to carry the enumerate power into effect congress possess the exclusive right to lay and collect duty on import and in common with the states to lay and collect all other taxis but the constitution have not only confer these high power upon congress but it have adopt effectual mean to restrain the states from interfere with their exercise for that purpose it have in strong prohibitory language expressly declare that no state shall enter into any treaty alliance or confederation grant letter of marque and reprisal coin money emit bill of credit make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debt pass any bill of attainder ex post facto law or law impair the obligation of contract moreover no state shall without the consent of the congress lie any impost or duty on import or export except what may be absolutely necessary for execute its inspection law and if they exceed this amount the excess shall belong to the united states and no state shall without the consent of congress lie any duty of tonnage keep troop or ship of war in time of peace enter into any agreement or compact with another state or with a foreign power or engage in war unless actually invade or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay in order still far to secure the uninterrupted exercise of these high power against state interposition it be provide that this constitution and the law of the united states which shall be make in pursuance thereof and all treaty make or which shall be make under the authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judge in every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding the solemn sanction of religion have be superadde to the obligation of official duty and all senators and representatives of the united states all member of state legislature and all executive and judicial officer both of the united states and of the several states shall be bind by oath or affirmation to support this constitution "in order to carry into effect these power the constitution have establish a perfect government in all its form legislative executive and judicial and this government to the extent of its power act directly upon the individual citizen of every state and execute its own decree by the agency of its own officer in this respect it differ entirely from the government under the old confederation which be confine to make requisition on the states in their sovereign character this leave it in the discretion of each whether to obey or to refuse and they often decline to comply with such requisition it thus become necessary for the purpose of remove this barrier and in order to form a more perfect union to establish a government which could act directly upon the people and execute its own law without the intermediate agency of the states this have be accomplish by the constitution of the united states in short the government create by the constitution and derive its authority from the sovereign people of each of the several states have precisely the same right to exercise its power over the people of all these states in in the enumerate case that each one of they possess over subject not delegate to the united states but reserve to the states respectively or to the people "to the extent of the delegate power the constitution of the united states be as much a part of the constitution of each state and be as bind upon its people as though it have be textually insert therein this government therefore be a great and powerful government invest with all the attribute of sovereignty over the special subject to which its authority extend its framer never intend to implant in its bosom the seed of its own destruction nor be they at its creation guilty of the absurdity of provide for its own dissolution it be not intend by its framer to be the baseless fabric of a vision which at the touch of the enchanter would vanish into thin air but a substantial and mighty fabric capable of resist the slow decay of time and of defy the storm of age indeed well may the jealous patriot of that day have indulge fear that a government of such high power might violate the reserved right of the states and wisely do they adopt the rule of a strict construction of these power to prevent the danger but they do not fear nor have they any reason to imagine that the constitution would ever be so interpret as to enable any state by her own act and without the consent of her sister states to discharge her people from all or any of their federal obligation it may be ask then be the people of the states without redress against the tyranny and oppression of the federal government by no mean the right of resistance on the part of the govern against the oppression of their government can not be deny it exist independently of all constitution and have be exercise at all period of the world 's history under it old government have be destroy and new one have take their place it be embody in strong and express language in our own declaration of independence but the distinction must ever be observe that this be revolution against an establish government and not a voluntary secession from it by virtue of an inherent constitutional right in short let we look the danger fairly in the face secession be neither more nor less than revolution it may or it may not be a justifiable revolution but still it be revolution what in the meantime be the responsibility and true position of the executive he be bind by solemn oath before god and the country to take care that the law be faithfully execute and from this obligation he can not be absolve by any human power but what if the performance of this duty in whole or in part have be render impracticable by event over which he could have exercise no control such at the present moment be the case throughout the state of south carolina so far as the law of the united states to secure the administration of justice by mean of the federal judiciary be concern all the federal officer within its limit through whose agency alone these law can be carry into execution have already resign we no long have a district judge a district attorney or a marshal in south carolina in fact the whole machinery of the federal government necessary for the distribution of remedial justice among the people have be demolish and it would be difficult if not impossible to replace it the only act of congress on the statute book bear upon this subject be those of february 28 1795 and march 3 1807 these authorize the president after he shall have ascertain that the marshal with his posse comitatus be unable to execute civil or criminal process in any particular case to call forth the militia and employ the army and navy to aid he in perform this service having first by proclamation command the insurgent to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abode within a limited time this duty can not by possibility be perform in a state where no judicial authority exist to issue process and where there be no marshal to execute it and where even if there be such an officer the entire population would constitute one solid combination to resist he the bare enumeration of these provision prove how inadequate they be without further legislation to overcome a united opposition in a single state not to speak of other state who may place themselves in a similar attitude congress alone have power to decide whether the present law can or can not be amend so as to carry out more effectually the object of the constitution the same insuperable obstacle do not lie in the way of execute the law for the collection of the custom the revenue still continue to be collect as heretofore at the custom house in charleston and should the collector unfortunately resign a successor may be appoint to perform this duty then in regard to the property of the united states in south carolina this have be purchase for a fair equivalent by the consent of the legislature of the state for the erection of fort magazine arsenal etc and over these the authority to exercise exclusive legislation have be expressly grant by the constitution to congress it be not believe that any attempt will be make to expel the united states from this property by force but if in this i should prove to be mistake the officer in command of the fort have receive order to act strictly on the defensive in such a contingency the responsibility for consequence would rightfully rest upon the head of the assailant apart from the execution of the law so far as this may be practicable the executive have no authority to decide what shall be the relation between the federal government and south carolina he have be invest with no such discretion he possess no power to change the relation heretofore exist between they much less to acknowledge the independence of that state this would be to invest a mere executive officer with the power of recognize the dissolution of the confederacy among our thirty three sovereign state it bear no resemblance to the recognition of a foreign de facto government involve no such responsibility any attempt to do this would on his part be a naked act of usurpation it be therefore my duty to submit to congress the whole question in all its beating the course of event be so rapidly hasten forward that the emergency may soon arise when you may be call upon to decide the momentous question whether you possess the power by force of arm to compel a state to remain in the union i should feel myself recreant to my duty be i not to express an opinion on this important subject the question fairly state be have the constitution delegate to congress the power to coerce a state into submission which be attempt to withdraw or have actually withdraw from the confederacy if answer in the affirmative it must be on the principle that the power have be confer upon congress to declare and to make war against a state after much serious reflection i have arrive at the conclusion that no such power have be delegate to congress or to any other department of the federal government it be manif upon an inspection of the constitution that this be not among the specific and enumerate power grant to congress and it be equally apparent that its exercise be not necessary and proper for carry into execution any one of these power so far from this power having be delegate to congress it be expressly refuse by the convention which frame the constitution it appear from the proceeding of that body that on the 31st may 1787 the clause authorize an exertion of the force of the whole against a delinquent state come up for consideration mr. madison oppose it in a brief but powerful speech from which i shall extract but a single sentence he observe the use of force against a state would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment and would probably be consider by the party attack as a dissolution of all previous compact by which it might be bind upon his motion the clause be unanimously postpone and be never i believe again present soon afterwards on the 8th june 1787 when incidentally advert to the subject he say any government for the united states form on the suppose practicability of use force against the unconstitutional proceeding of the states would prove as visionary and fallacious as the government of congress evidently mean the then exist congress of the old confederation without descend to particular it may be safely assert that the power to make war against a state be at variance with the whole spirit and intent of the constitution suppose such a war should result in the conquest of a state how be we to govern it afterwards shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power in the nature of thing we could not by physical force control the will of the people and compel they to elect senators and representatives to congress and to perform all the other duty depend upon their own volition and require from the free citizen of a free state as a constituent member of the confederacy but if we possess this power would it be wise to exercise it under exist circumstance the object would doubtless be to preserve the union war would not only present the most effectual mean of destroy it but would vanish all hope of its peaceable reconstruction besides in the fraternal conflict a vast amount of blood and treasure would be expend render future reconciliation between the states impossible in the meantime who can foretell what would be the suffering and privation of the people during its existence?the fact be that our union rest upon public opinion and can never be cement by the blood of its citizen shed in civil war if it can not live in the affection of the people it must one day perish congress possess many mean of preserve it by conciliation but the sword be not place in their hand to preserve it by force but may i be permit solemnly to invoke my countryman to pause and deliberate before they determine to destroy this the grand temple which have ever be dedicate to human freedom since the world begin it have be consecrate by the blood of our father by the glory of the past and by the hope of the future the union have already make we the most prosperous and ere long will if preserve render we the most powerful nation on the face of the earth in every foreign region of the globe the title of american citizen be hold in the high respect and when pronounce in a foreign land it cause the heart of our countryman to swell with honest pride surely when we reach the brink of the yawning abyss we shall recoil with horror from the last fatal plunge by such a dread catastrophe the hope of the friend of freedom throughout the world would be destroy and a long night of leaden despotism would enshroud the nation our example for more than eighty year would not only be lose but it would be quote as a conclusive proof that man be unfit for self government it be not every wrong nay it be not every grievous wrong which can justify a resort to such a fearful alternative this ought to be the last desperate remedy of a despairing people after every other constitutional mean of conciliation have be exhaust we should reflect that under this free government there be an incessant ebb and flow in public opinion the slavery question like everything human will have its day i firmly believe that it have reach and pass the culminating point but if in the midst of the exist excitement the union shall perish the evil may then become irreparable congress can contribute much to avert it by propose and recommend to the legislature of the several states the remedy for exist evil which the constitution have itself provide for its own preservation this have be try at different critical period of our history and always with eminent success it be to be find in the fifth article provide for its own amendment under this article amendment have be propose by two third of both houses of congress and have be ratify by the legislature of three fourth of the several states and have consequently become part of the constitution to this process the country be indebted for the clause prohibit congress from pass any law respect an establishment of religion or abridge the freedom of speech or of the press or of the right of petition to this we be also indebted for the bill of right which secure the people against any abuse of power by the federal government such be the apprehension justly entertain by the friend of state right at that period as to have render it extremely doubtful whether the constitution could have long survive without those amendment again the constitution be amend by the same process after the election of president jefferson by the house of representatives in february 1803 this amendment be render necessary to prevent a recurrence of the danger which have seriously threaten the existence of the government during the pendency of that election the article for its own amendment be intend to secure the amicable adjustment of conflict constitutional question like the present which might arise between the government of the states and that of the united states this appear from contemporaneous history in this connection i shall merely call attention to a few sentence in mr. madison 's justly celebrate report in 1799 to the legislature of virginia in this he ably and conclusively defend the resolution of the precede legislature against the stricture of several other state legislature these be mainly round upon the protest of the virginia legislature against the alien and sedition act as palpable and alarming infraction of the constitution in point out the peaceful and constitutional remedy and he refer to none other to which the states be authorize to resort on such occasion he conclude by say that the legislature of the states might have make a direct representation to congress with a view to obtain a rescinding of the two offensive act or they might have represent to their respective senators in congress their wish that two third thereof would propose an explanatory amendment to the constitution or two third of themselves if such have be their option might by an application to congress have obtain a convention for the same object this be the very course which i earnestly recommend in order to obtain an explanatory amendment of the constitution on the subject of slavery this might originate with congress or the state legislature as may be deem most advisable to attain the object the explanatory amendment might be confine to the final settlement of the true construction of the constitution on three special points:1 an express recognition of the right of property in slave in the states where it now exist or may hereafter exist.2 the duty of protect this right in all the common territories throughout their territorial existence and until they shall be admit as states into the union with or without slavery as their constitution may prescribe.3 a like recognition of the right of the master to have his slave who have escape from one state to another restore and deliver up to he and of the validity of the fugitive slave law enact for this purpose together with a declaration that all state law impair or defeat this right be violation of the constitution and be consequently null and void it may be object that this construction of the constitution have already be settle by the supreme court of the united states and what more ought to be require the answer be that a very large proportion of the people of the united states still contest the correctness of this decision and never will cease from agitation and admit its bind force until clearly establish by the people of the several states in their sovereign character such an explanatory amendment would it be believe forever terminate the exist dissension and restore peace and harmony among the states it ought not to be doubt that such an appeal to the arbitrament establish by the constitution itself would be receive with favor by all the states of the confederacy in any event it ought to be try in a spirit of conciliation before any of these state shall separate themselves from the union when i enter upon the duty of the presidential office the aspect neither of our foreign nor domestic affair be at all satisfactory we be involve in dangerous complication with several nation and two of our territories be in a state of revolution against the government a restoration of the african slave trade have numerous and powerful advocate unlawful military expedition be countenance by many of our citizen and be suffer in defiance of the effort of the government to escape from our shore for the purpose of make war upon the offend people of neighboring republic with whom we be at peace in addition to these and other difficulty we experience a revulsion in monetary affair soon after my advent to power of unexampled severity and of ruinous consequence to all the great interest of the country when we take a retrospect of what be then our condition and contrast this with its material prosperity at the time of the late presidential election we have abundant reason to return our grateful thank to that merciful providence which have never forsake we as a nation in all our past trial our relation with great britain be of the most friendly character since the commencement of my administration the two dangerous question arise from the clayton and bulwer treaty and from the right of search claim by the british government have be amicably and honorably adjust the discordant construction of the clayton and bulwer treaty between the two government which at different period of the discussion bear a threatening aspect have result in a final settlement entirely satisfactory to this government in my last annual message i inform congress that the british government have not then complete treaty arrangement with the republics of honduras and nicaragua in pursuance of the understanding between the two government it be nevertheless confidently expect that this good work will ere long be accomplish this confident expectation have since be fulfil her britannic majesty conclude a treaty with honduras on the 28th november 1859 and with nicaragua on the 28th august 1860 relinquish the mosquito protectorate besides by the former the bay islands be recognize as a part of the republic of honduras it may be observe that the stipulation of these treaty conform in every important particular to the amendment adopt by the senate of the united states to the treaty conclude at london on the 17th october 1856 between the two government it will be recollect that this treaty be reject by the british government because of its objection to the just and important amendment of the senate to the article relate to ruatan and the other island in the bay of honduras it must be a source of sincere satisfaction to all class of our fellow citizen and especially to those engage in foreign commerce that the claim on the part of great britain forcibly to visit and search american merchant vessel on the high sea in time of peace have be abandon this be by far the most dangerous question to the peace of the two country which have exist since the war of 1812 whilst it remain open they might at any moment have be precipitate into a war this be render manifest by the exasperated state of public feeling throughout our entire country produce by the forcible search of american merchant vessel by british cruiser on the coast of cuba in the spring of 1858 the american people hail with general acclaim the order of the secretary of the navy to our naval force in the gulf of mexico to protect all vessel of the united states on the high sea from search or detention by the vessel of war of any other nation these order might have produce an immediate collision between the naval force of the two country this be most fortunately prevent by an appeal to the justice of great britain and to the law of nation as expound by her own most eminent jurist the only question of any importance which still remain open be the dispute title between the two government to the island of san juan in the vicinity of washington territory as this question be still under negotiation it be not deem advisable at the present moment to make any other allusion to the subject the recent visit of the prince of wales in a private character to the people of this country have prove to be a most auspicious event in its consequence it can not fail to increase the kindre and kindly feeling which i trust may ever actuate the government and people of both country in their political and social intercourse with each other with france our ancient and powerful ally our relation continue to be of the most friendly character a decision have recently be make by a french judicial tribunal with the approbation of the imperial government which can not fail to foster the sentiment of mutual regard that have so long exist between the two country under the french law no person can serve in the army of france unless he be a french citizen the law of france recognize the natural right of expatriation it follow as a necessary consequence that a frenchman by the fact of having become a citizen of the united states have change his allegiance and have lose his native character he can not therefore be compel to serve in the french army in case he should return to his native country these principle be announce in 1852 by the french minister of war and in two late case have be confirm by the french judiciary in these two native of france have be discharge from the french army because they have become american citizen to employ the language of our present minister to france who have render good service on this occasion i do not think our french naturalize fellow citizen will hereafter experience much annoyance on this subject "i venture to predict that the time be not far distant when the other continental power will adopt the same wise and just policy which have do so much honor to the enlightened government of the emperor in any event our government be bind to protect the right of our naturalized citizen everywhere to the same extent as though they have draw their first breath in this country we can recognize no distinction between our native and naturalized citizen between the great empire of russia and the united states the mutual friendship and regard which have so long exist still continue to prevail and if possible to increase indeed our relation with that empire be all that we could desire our relation with spain be now of a more complicated though less dangerous character than they have be for many year our citizen have long hold and continue to hold numerous claim against the spanish government these have be ably urge for a series of year by our successive diplomatic representative at madrid but without obtain redress the spanish government finally agree to institute a joint commission for the adjustment of these claim and on the 5th day of march 1860 conclude a convention for this purpose with our present minister at madrid under this convention what have be denominate the cuban claim amount to $ 128,635.54 in which more than 100 of our fellow citizen be interested be recognize and the spanish government agree to pay $ 100,000 of this amount within three month follow the exchange of ratification the payment of the remain $ 28,635.54 be to await the decision of the commissioner for or against the amistad claim but in any event the balance be to be pay to the claimant either by spain or the united states these term i have every reason to know be highly satisfactory to the holder of the cuban claim indeed they have make a formal offer authorize the state department to settle these claim and to deduct the amount of the amistad claim from the sum which they be entitle to receive from spain this offer of course can not be accept all other claim of citizen of the united states against spain or the subject of the queen of spain against the united states include the amistad claim be by this convention refer to a board of commissioner in the usual form neither the validity of the amistad claim nor of any other claim against either party with the single exception of the cuban claim be recognize by the convention indeed the spanish government do not insist that the validity of the amistad claim should be thus recognize notwithstanding its payment have be recommend to congress by two of my predecessor as well as by myself and an appropriation for that purpose have pass the senate of the united states they be content that it should be submit to the board for examination and decision like the other claim both governments be bind respectively to pay the amount award to the several claimant at such time and place as may be fix by and accord to the tenor of say award "i transmit this convention to the senate for their constitutional action on the 3d of may 1860 and on the 27th of the succeed june they determine that they would not advise and consent to its ratification these proceeding place our relation with spain in an awkward and embarrassing position it be more than probable that the final adjustment of these claim will devolve upon my successor i reiterate the recommendation contain in my annual message of december 1858 and repeat in that of december 1859 in favor of the acquisition of cuba from spain by fair purchase i firmly believe that such an acquisition would contribute essentially to the well being and prosperity of both country in all future time as well as prove the certain mean of immediately abolish the african slave trade throughout the world i would not repeat this recommendation upon the present occasion if i believe that the transfer of cuba to the united states upon condition highly favorable to spain could justly tarnish the national honor of the proud and ancient spanish monarchy surely no person ever attribute to the first napoleon a disregard of the national honor of france for transfer louisiana to the united states for a fair equivalent both in money and commercial advantage with the emperor of austria and the remain continental power of europe include that of the sultan our relation continue to be of the most friendly character the friendly and peaceful policy pursue by the government of the united states toward the empire of china have produce the most satisfactory result the treaty of tien tsin of the 18th june 1858 have be faithfully observe by the chinese authority the convention of the 8th november 1858 supplementary to this treaty for the adjustment and satisfaction of the claim of our citizen on china refer to in my last annual message have be already carry into effect so far as this be practicable under this convention the sum of 500,000 tael equal to about $ 700,000 be stipulate to be pay in satisfaction of the claim of american citizen out of the one fifth of the receipt for tonnage import and export duty on american vessel at the port of canton shanghai and fuchau and it be agree that this amount shall be in full liquidation of all claim of american citizen at the various port to this date debenture for this amount to wit 300,000 tael for canton 100,000 for shanghai and 100,000 for fuchau be deliver accord to the term of the convention by the respective chinese collector of the custom of these port to the agent select by our minister to receive the same since that time the claim of our citizen have be adjust by the board of commissioner appoint for that purpose under the act of march 3 1859 and their award which prove satisfactory to the claimant have be approve by our minister in the aggregate they amount to the sum of $ 498,694.78 the claimant have already receive a large proportion of the sum award to they out of the fund provide and it be confidently expect that the remainder will ere long be entirely pay after the award shall have be satisfied there will remain a surplus of more than $ 200,000 at the disposition of congress as this will in equity belong to the chinese government would not justice require its appropriation to some benevolent object in which the chinese may be specially interested?our minister to china in obedience to his instruction have remain perfectly neutral in the war between great britain and france and the chinese empire although in conjunction with the russian minister he be ever ready and willing have the opportunity offer to employ his good office in restore peace between the party it be but an act of simple justice both to our present minister and his predecessor to state that they have prove fully equal to the delicate try and responsible position in which they have on different occasion be place the ratification of the treaty with japan conclude at yeddo on the 29th july 1858 be exchange at washington on the 22d may last and the treaty itself be proclaim on the succeed day there be good reason to expect that under its protection and influence our trade and intercourse with that distant and interesting people will rapidly increase the ratification of the treaty be exchange with unusual solemnity for this purpose the tycoon have accredit three of his most distinguished subject as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary who be receive and treat with mark distinction and kindness both by the government and people of the united states there be every reason to believe that they have return to their native land entirely satisfied with their visit and inspire by the most friendly feeling for our country let we ardently hope in the language of the treaty itself that there shall henceforward be perpetual peace and friendship between the united states of america and his majesty the tycoon of japan and his successor "with the wise conservative and liberal government of the empire of brazil our relation continue to be of the most amicable character the exchange of the ratification of the convention with the republic of new granada sign at washington on the 10th of september 1857 have be long delay from accidental cause for which neither party be censurable these ratification be duly exchange in this city on the 5th of november last thus have a controversy be amicably terminate which have become so serious at the period of my inauguration as to require i on the 17th of april 1857 to direct our minister to demand his passport and return to the united states under this convention the government of new granada have specially acknowledge itself to be responsible to our citizen for damage which be cause by the riot at panama on the 15th april 1856 these claim together with other claim of our citizen which have be long urge in vain be refer for adjustment to a board of commissioner i submit a copy of the convention to congress and recommend the legislation necessary to carry it into effect persevere effort have be make for the adjustment of the claim of american citizen against the government of costa rica and i be happy to inform you that these have finally prevail a convention be sign at the city of san jose on the 2d july last between the minister resident of the united states in costa rica and the plenipotentiary of that republic refer these claim to a board of commissioner and provide for the payment of their award this convention will be submit immediately to the senate for their constitutional action the claim of our citizen upon the republic of nicaragua have not yet be provide for by treaty although diligent effort for this purpose have be make by our minister resident to that republic these be still continue with a fair prospect of success our relation with mexico remain in a most unsatisfactory condition in my last two annual message i discuss extensively the subject of these relation and do not now propose to repeat at length the fact and argument then present they prove conclusively that our citizen reside in mexico and our merchant trade thereto have suffer a series of wrong and outrage such as we have never patiently bear from any other nation for these our successive minister invoke the faith of treaty have in the name of their country persistently demand redress and indemnification but without the slight effect indeed so confident have the mexican authority become of our patient endurance that they universally believe they might commit these outrage upon american citizen with absolute impunity thus write our minister in 1856 and express the opinion that nothing but a manifestation of the power of the government and of its purpose to punish these wrong will avail "afterward in 1857 come the adoption of a new constitution for mexico the election of a president and congress under its provision and the inauguration of the president within one short month however this president be expel from the capital by a rebellion in the army and the supreme power of the republic be assign to general zuloaga this usurper be in his turn soon compel to retire and give place to general miramon under the constitution which have thus be adopt senor juarez as chief justice of the supreme court become the lawful president of the republic and it be for the maintenance of the constitution and his authority derive from it that the civil war commence and still continue to be prosecute throughout the year 1858 the constitutional party grow strong and strong in the previous history of mexico a successful military revolution at the capital have almost universally be the signal for submission throughout the republic not so on the present occasion a majority of the citizen persistently sustain the constitutional government when this be recognize in april 1859 by the government of the united states its authority extend over a large majority of the mexican states and people include vera cruz and all the other important seaport of the republic from that period our commerce with mexico begin to revive and the constitutional government have afford it all the protection in its power meanwhile the government of miramon still hold sway at the capital and over the surround country and continue its outrage against the few american citizen who still have the courage to remain within its power to cap the climax after the battle of tacubaya in april 1859 general marquez order three citizen of the united states two of they physician to be seize in the hospital at that place take out and shoot without crime and without trial this be do notwithstanding our unfortunate countryman be at the moment engage in the holy cause of afford relief to the soldier of both party who have be wound in the battle without make any distinction between they the time have arrive in my opinion when this government be bind to exert its power to avenge and redress the wrong of our citizen and to afford they protection in mexico the interpose obstacle be that the portion of the country under the sway of miramon could not be reach without pass over territory under the jurisdiction of the constitutional government under these circumstance i deem it my duty to recommend to congress in my last annual message the employment of a sufficient military force to penetrate into the interior where the government of miramon be to be find with or if need be without the consent of the juarez government though it be not doubted that this consent could be obtain never have i have a clear conviction on any subject than of the justice as well as wisdom of such a policy no other alternative be leave except the entire abandonment of our fellow citizen who have go to mexico under the faith of treaty to the systematic injustice cruelty and oppression of miramon 's government besides it be almost certain that the simple authority to employ this force would of itself have accomplish all our object without strike a single blow the constitutional government would then ere this have be establish at the city of mexico and would have be ready and willing to the extent of its ability to do we justice in addition and i deem this a most important consideration european government would have be deprive of all pretext to interfere in the territorial and domestic concern of mexico we should thus have be relieve from the obligation of resist even by force should this become necessary any attempt by these government to deprive our neighboring republic of portion of her territory a duty from which we could not shrink without abandon the traditional and established policy of the american people i be happy to observe that firmly rely upon the justice and good faith of these government there be no present danger that such a contingency will happen having discover that my recommendation would not be sustain by congress the next alternative be to accomplish in some degree if possible the same object by treaty stipulation with the constitutional government such treaty be accordingly conclude by our late able and excellent minister to mexico and on the 4th of january last be submit to the senate for ratification as these have not yet receive the final action of that body it would be improper for i to present a detailed statement of their provision still i may be permit to express the opinion in advance that they be calculate to promote the agricultural manufacturing and commercial interest of the country and to secure our just influence with an adjoining republic as to whose fortune and fate we can never feel indifferent whilst at the same time they provide for the payment of a considerable amount toward the satisfaction of the claim of our injure fellow citizen at the period of my inauguration i be confront in kansas by a revolutionary government exist under what be call the topeka constitution its avowed object be to subdue the territorial government by force and to inaugurate what be call the topeka government in its stead to accomplish this object an extensive military organization be form and its command intrust to the most violent revolutionary leader under these circumstance it become my imperative duty to exert the whole constitutional power of the executive to prevent the flame of civil war from again rage in kansas which in the excited state of the public mind both north and south might have extend into the neighboring state the hostile party in kansas have be inflame against each other by emissary both from the north and the south to a degree of malignity without parallel in our history to prevent actual collision and to assist the civil magistrate in enforce the law a strong detachment of the army be station in the territory ready to aid the marshal and his deputy when lawfully call upon as a posse comitatus in the execution of civil and criminal process still the trouble in kansas could not have be permanently settle without an election by the people the ballot box be the sure arbiter of dispute among freeman under this conviction every proper effort be employ to induce the hostile party to vote at the election of delegate to frame a state constitution and afterwards at the election to decide whether kansas should be a slave or free state the insurgent party refuse to vote at either lest this might be consider a recognition on their part of the territorial government establish by congress a well spirit however seem soon after to prevail and the two party meet face to face at the third election hold on the first monday of january 1858 for member of the legislature and state officer under the lecompton constitution the result be the triumph of the antislavery party at the poll this decision of the ballot box prove clearly that this party be in the majority and remove the danger of civil war from that time we have hear little or nothing of the topeka government and all serious danger of revolutionary trouble in kansas be then at an end the lecompton constitution which have be thus recognize at this state election by the vote of both political party in kansas be transmit to i with the request that i should present it to congress this i could not have refuse to do without violate my clear and strong conviction of duty the constitution and all the proceeding which precede and follow its formation be fair and regular on their face i then believe and experience have prove that the interest of the people of kansas would have be well consult by its admission as a state into the union especially as the majority within a brief period could have amend the constitution accord to their will and pleasure if fraud exist in all or any of these proceeding it be not for the president but for congress to investigate and determine the question of fraud and what ought to be its consequence if at the first two election the majority refuse to vote it can not be pretend that this refusal to exercise the elective franchise could invalidate an election fairly hold under lawful authority even if they have not subsequently vote at the third election it be true that the whole constitution have not be submit to the people as i always desire but the precedent be numerous of the admission of states into the union without such submission it would not comport with my present purpose to review the proceeding of congress upon the lecompton constitution it be sufficient to observe that their final action have remove the last vestige of serious revolutionary trouble the desperate hand recently assemble under a notorious outlaw in the southern portion of the territory to resist the execution of the law and to plunder peaceful citizen will i doubt not be speedily subdue and bring to justice have i treat the lecompton constitution as a nullity and refuse to transmit it to congress it be not difficult to imagine whilst recall the position of the country at that moment what would have be the disastrous consequence both in and out of the territory from such a dereliction of duty on the part of the executive peace have also be restore within the territory of utah which at the commencement of my administration be in a state of open rebellion this be the more dangerous as the people animate by a fanatical spirit and intrench within their distant mountain fastness might have make a long and formidable resistance cost what it might it be necessary to bring they into subjection to the constitution and the law sound policy therefore as well as humanity require that this object should if possible be accomplish without the effusion of blood this could only be effect by send a military force into the territory sufficiently strong to convince the people that resistance would be hopeless and at the same time to offer they a pardon for past offense on condition of immediate submission to the government this policy be pursue with eminent success and the only cause for regret be the heavy expenditure require to march a large detachment of the army to that remote region and to furnish it subsistence utah be now comparatively peaceful and quiet and the military force have be withdraw except that portion of it necessary to keep the indians in check and to protect the emigrant train on their way to our pacific possession in my first annual message i promise to employ my good exertion in cooperation with congress to reduce the expenditure of the government within the limit of a wise and judicious economy an overflowing treasury have produce habit of prodigality and extravagance which could only be gradually correct the work require both time and patience i apply myself diligently to this task from the beginning and be aid by the able and energetic effort of the head of the different executive departments the result of our labor in this good cause do not appear in the sum total of our expenditure for the first two year mainly in consequence of the extraordinary expenditure necessarily incur in the utah expedition and the very large amount of the contingent expense of congress during this period these greatly exceed the pay and mileage of the member for the year end june 30 1858 whilst the pay and mileage amount to $ 1,490,214 the contingent expense rise to $ 2,093,309.79 and for the year end june 30 1859 whilst the pay and mileage amount to $ 859,093.66 the contingent expense amount to $ 1,431,565.78 i be happy however to be able to inform you that during the last fiscal year end june 30 1860 the total expenditure of the government in all its branch legislative executive and judicial exclusive of the public debt be reduce to the sum of $ 55,402,465.46 this conclusively appear from the book of the treasury in the year end june 30 1858 the total expenditure exclusive of the public debt amount to $ 71,901,129.77 and that for the year end june 30 1859 to $ 66,346,226.13 whilst the book of the treasury show an actual expenditure of $ 59,848,474.72 for the year end june 30 1860 include $ 1,040,667.71 for the contingent expense of congress there must be deduct from this amount the sum of $ 4,296,009.26 with the interest upon it of $ 150,000 appropriate by the act of february 15 1860 for the purpose of supply the deficiency in the revenue and defray the expense of the post office department for the year end june 30 1859 this sum therefore justly chargeable to the year 1859 must be deduct from the sum of $ 59,848,474.72 in order to ascertain the expenditure for the year end june 30 1860 which leave a balance for the expenditure of that year of $ 55,402,465.46 the interest on the public debt include treasury note for the same fiscal year end june 30 1860 amount to $ 3,177,314.62 which add to the above sum of $ 55,402,465.46 make the aggregate of $ 58,579,780.08.it ought in justice to be observe that several of the estimate from the departments for the year end june 30 1860 be reduce by congress below what be and still be deem compatible with the public interest allow a liberal margin of $ 2,500,000 for this reduction and for other cause it may be safely assert that the sum of $ 61,000,000 or at the most $ 62,000,000 be amply sufficient to administer the government and to pay the interest on the public debt unless contingent event should hereafter render extraordinary expenditure necessary this result have be attain in a considerable degree by the care exercise by the appropriate departments in enter into public contract i have myself never interfere with the award of any such contract except in a single case with the colonization society deem it advisable to cast the whole responsibility in each case on the proper head of the department with the general instruction that these contract should always be give to the low and good bidder it have ever be my opinion that public contract be not a legitimate source of patronage to be confer upon personal or political favorite but that in all such case a public officer be bind to act for the government as a prudent individual would act for himself it be with great satisfaction i communicate the fact that since the date of my last annual message not a single slave have be import into the united states in violation of the law prohibit the african slave trade this statement be round upon a thorough examination and investigation of the subject indeed the spirit which prevail some time since among a portion of our fellow citizen in favor of this trade seem to have entirely subside i also congratulate you upon the public sentiment which now exist against the crime of set on foot military expedition within the limit of the united states to proceed from thence and make war upon the people of unoffending states with whom we be at peace in this respect a happy change have be effect since the commencement of my administration it surely ought to be the prayer of every christian and patriot that such expedition may never again receive countenance in our country or depart from our shore it would be a useless repetition to do more than refer with earnest commendation to my former recommendation in favor of the pacific railroad of the grant of power to the president to employ the naval force in the vicinity for the protection of the life and property of our fellow citizen pass in transit over the different central american route against sudden and lawless outbreak and depredation and also to protect american merchant vessel their crew and cargo against violent and unlawful seizure and confiscation in the port of mexico and the south american republics when these may be in a disturbed and revolutionary condition it be my settle conviction that without such a power we do not afford that protection to those engage in the commerce of the country which they have a right to demand i again recommend to congress the passage of a law in pursuance of the provision of the constitution appoint a day certain previous to the 4th march in each year of an odd number for the election of representatives throughout all the states a similar power have already be exercise with general approbation in the appointment of the same day throughout the union for hold the election of elector for president and vice president of the united states my attention be earnestly direct to this subject from the fact that the thirty fifth congress terminate on the 3d march 1859 without make the necessary appropriation for the service of the post office department i be then force to consider the good remedy for this omission and an immediate call of the present congress be the natural resort upon inquiry however i ascertain that fifteen out of the thirty three states compose the confederacy be without representatives and that consequently these fifteen state would be disfranchise by such a call these fifteen states will be in the same condition on the 4th march next ten of they can not elect representatives accord to exist state law until different period extend from the beginning of august next until the month of october and november in my last message i gave warn that in a time of sudden and alarming danger the salvation of our institution might depend upon the power of the president immediately to assemble a full congress to meet the emergency it be now quite evident that the financial necessity of the government will require a modification of the tariff during your present session for the purpose of increase the revenue in this aspect i desire to reiterate the recommendation contain in my last two annual message in favor of impose specific instead of ad valorem duty on all import article to which these can be properly apply from long observation and experience i be convinced that specific duty be necessary both to protect the revenue and to secure to our manufacturing interest that amount of incidental encouragement which unavoidably result from a revenue tariff as an abstract proposition it may be admit that ad valorem duty would in theory be the most just and equal but if the experience of this and of all other commercial nation have demonstrate that such duty can not be assess and collect without great fraud upon the revenue then it be the part of wisdom to resort to specific duty indeed from the very nature of an ad valorem duty this must be the result under it the inevitable consequence be that foreign good will be enter at less than their true value the treasury will therefore lose the duty on the difference between their real and fictitious value and to this extent we be defraud the temptation which ad valorem duty present to a dishonest importer be irresistible his object be to pass his good through the custom house at the very low valuation necessary to save they from confiscation in this he too often succeed in spite of the vigilance of the revenue officer hence the resort to false invoice one for the purchaser and another for the custom house and to other expedient to defraud the government the honest importer produce his invoice to the collector state the actual price at which he purchase the article abroad not so the dishonest importer and the agent of the foreign manufacturer and here it may be observe that a very large proportion of the manufacture import from abroad be consign for sale to commission merchant who be mere agent employ by the manufacturer in such case no actual sale have be make to fix their value the foreign manufacturer if he be dishonest prepare an invoice of the good not at their actual value but at the very low rate necessary to escape detection in this manner the dishonest importer and the foreign manufacturer enjoy a decide advantage over the honest merchant they be thus enable to undersell the fair trader and drive he from the market in fact the operation of this system have already drive from the pursuit of honorable commerce many of that class of regular and conscientious merchant whose character throughout the world be the pride of our country the remedy for these evil be to be find in specific duty so far as this may be practicable they dispense with any inquiry at the custom house into the actual cost or value of the article and it pay the precise amount of duty previously fix by law they present no temptation to the appraiser of foreign good who receive but small salary and might by undervaluation in a few case render themselves independent besides specific duty well conform to the requisition in the constitution that no preference shall be give by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the port of one state over those of another under our ad valorem system such preference be to some extent inevitable and complaint have often be make that the spirit of this provision have p.3183 be violate by a low appraisement of the same article at one port than at another an impression strangely enough prevail to some extent that specific duty be necessarily protective duty nothing can be more fallacious great britain glory in free trade and yet her whole revenue from import be at the present moment collect under a system of specific duty it be a striking fact in this connection that in the commercial treaty of january 23 1860 between france and england one of the article provide that the ad valorem duty which it impose shall be convert into specific duty within six month from its date and these be to be ascertain by make an average of the price for six month previous to that time the reverse of the proposition would be near to the truth because a much large amount of revenue would be collect by merely convert the ad valorem duty of a tariff into equivalent specific duty to this extent the revenue would be increase and in the same proportion the specific duty might be diminish specific duty would secure to the american manufacturer the incidental protection to which he be fairly entitle under a revenue tariff and to this surely no person would object the framer of the exist tariff have go far and in a liberal spirit have discriminate in favor of large and useful branch of our manufacture not by raise the rate of duty upon the importation of similar article from abroad but what be the same in effect by admit article free of duty which enter into the composition of their fabric under the present system it have be often truly remark that this incidental protection decrease when the manufacturer need it most and increase when he need it least and constitute a slide scale which always operate against he the revenue of the country be subject to similar fluctuation instead of approach a steady standard as would be the case under a system of specific duty they sink and rise with the sinking and rise price of article in foreign country it would not be difficult for congress to arrange a system of specific duty which would afford additional stability both to our revenue and our manufacture and without injury or injustice to any interest of the country this might be accomplish by ascertain the average value of any give article for a series of year at the place of exportation and by simply convert the rate of ad valorem duty upon it which might be deem necessary for revenue purpose into the form of a specific duty such an arrangement could not injure the consumer if he should pay a great amount of duty one year this would be counterbalance by a less amount the next and in the end the aggregate would be the same i desire to call your immediate attention to the present condition of the treasury so ably and clearly present by the secretary in his report to p.3184 congress and to recommend that measure be promptly adopt to enable it to discharge its press obligation the other recommendation of the report be well worthy of your favorable consideration i herewith transmit to congress the report of the secretaries of war of the navy of the interior and of the postmaster general the recommendation and suggestion which they contain be highly valuable and deserve your careful attention the report of the postmaster general detail the circumstance under which cornelius vanderbilt on my request agree in the month of july last to carry the ocean mail between our atlantic and pacific coast have he not thus act this important intercommunication must have be suspend at least for a season the postmaster general have no power to make he any other compensation than the postage on the mail matter which he might carry it be know at the time that these postage would fall far short of an adequate compensation as well as of the sum which the same service have previously cost the government mr. vanderbilt in a commendable spirit be willing to rely upon the justice of congress to make up the deficiency and i therefore recommend that an appropriation may be grant for this purpose i should do great injustice to the attorney general be i to omit the mention of his distinguished service in the measure adopt and prosecute by he for the defense of the government against numerous and unfounded claim to land in california purport to have be make by the mexican government previous to the treaty of cession the successful opposition to these claim have save the united states public property worth many million of dollar and to individual hold title under they to at least an equal amount it have be represent to i from source which i deem reliable that the inhabitant in several portion of kansas have be reduce nearly to a state of starvation on account of the almost total failure of their crop whilst the harvest in every other portion of the country have be abundant the prospect before they for the approach winter be well calculate to enlist the sympathy of every heart the destitution appear to be so general that it can not be relieve by private contribution and they be in such indigent circumstance as to be unable to purchase the necessary of life for themselves i refer the subject to congress if any constitutional measure for their relief can be devise i would recommend its adoption i cordially commend to your favorable regard the interest of the people of this district they be eminently entitle to your consideration especially since unlike the people of the states they can appeal to no government except that of the union
at the opening of your present session i call your attention to the danger which threaten the existence of the union i express my opinion freely concern the original cause of those danger and recommend such measure as i believe would have the effect of tranquilize the country and save it from the peril in which it have be needlessly and most unfortunately involve those opinion and recommendation i do not propose now to repeat my own conviction upon the whole subject remain unchanged
 the fact that a great calamity be impend over the nation be even at that time acknowledge by every intelligent citizen it have already make itself feel throughout the length and breadth of the land the necessary consequence of the alarm thus produce be most deplorable the import fall off with a rapidity never know before except in time of war in the history of our foreign commerce the treasury be unexpectedly leave without the mean which it have reasonably count upon to meet the public engagement trade be paralyze manufacture be stop the good public security suddenly sink in the market every specie of property depreciate more or less and thousand of poor man who depend upon their daily labor for their daily bread be turn out of employment
 i deeply regret that i be not able to give you any information upon the state of the union which be more satisfactory than what i be then oblige to communicate on the contrary matter be still bad at present than they then be when congress meet a stronge hope pervade the whole public mind that some amicable adjustment of the subject would speedily be make by the representative of the states and of the people which might restore peace between the conflict section of the country that hope have be diminish by every hour of delay and as the prospect of a bloodless settlement fade away the public distress become more and more aggravate as evidence of this it be only necessary to say that the treasury note authorize by the act of 17th of december last be advertise accord to the law and that no responsible bidder offer to take any considerable sum at par at a low rate of interest than 12 per cent from these fact it appear that in a government organize like ours domestic strife or even a well ground fear of civil hostility be more destructive to our public and private interest than the most formidable foreign war
 in my annual message i express the conviction which i have long deliberately hold and which recent reflection have only tend to deepen and confirm that no state have a right by its own act to secede from the union or throw off its federal obligation at pleasure i also declare my opinion to be that even if that right exist and should be exercise by any state of the confederacy the executive department of this government have no authority under the constitution to recognize its validity by acknowledge the independence of such state this leave i no alternative as the chief executive officer under the constitution of the united states but to collect the public revenue and to protect the public property so far as this might be practicable under exist law this be still my purpose my province be to execute and not to make the law it belong to congress exclusively to repeal to modify or to enlarge their provision to meet exigency as they may occur i possess no dispense power
 i certainly have no right to make aggressive war upon any state and i be perfectly satisfied that the constitution have wisely withhold that power even from congress but the right and the duty to use military force defensively against those who resist the federal officer in the execution of their legal function and against those who assail the property of the federal government be clear and undeniable
 but the dangerous and hostile attitude of the states toward each other have already far transcend and cast in the shade the ordinary executive duty already provide for by law and have assume such vast and alarming proportion as to place the subject entirely above and beyond executive control the fact can not be disguise that we be in the midst of a great revolution in all its various bearing therefore i commend the question to congress as the only human tribunal under providence possess the power to meet the exist emergency to they exclusively belong the power to declare war or to authorize the employment of military force in all case contemplate by the constitution and they alone possess the power to remove grievance which might lead to war and to secure peace and union to this distracted country on they and on they alone rest the responsibility
 the union be a sacred trust leave by our revolutionary father to their descendant and never do any other people inherit so rich a legacy it have render we prosperous in peace and triumphant in war the national flag have float in glory over every sea under its shadow american citizen have find protection and respect in all land beneath the sun if we descend to consideration of purely material interest when in the history of all time have a confederacy be bind together by such strong tie of mutual interest each portion of it be dependent on all and all upon each portion for prosperity and domestic security free trade throughout the whole supply the want of one portion from the production of another and scatter wealth everywhere the great planting and farming states require the aid of the commercial and navigate states to send their production to domestic and foreign market and to furnish the naval power to render their transportation secure against all hostile attack
 should the union perish in the midst of the present excitement we have already have a sad foretaste of the universal suffering which would result from its destruction the calamity would be severe in every portion of the union and would be quite as great to say the least in the southern as in the northern states the great aggravation of the evil and that which would place we in the most unfavorable light both before the world and posterity be as i be firmly convinced that the secession movement have be chiefly base upon a misapprehension at the south of the sentiment of the majority in several of the northern states let the question be transfer from political assembly to the ballot box and the people themselves would speedily redress the serious grievance which the south have suffer but in heaven&#39;s name let the trial be make before we plunge into armed conflict upon the mere assumption that there be no other alternative time be a great conservative power let we pause at this momentous point and afford the people both north and south an opportunity for reflection would that south carolina have be convince of this truth before her precipitate action i therefore appeal through you to the people of the country to declare in their might that the union must and shall be preserve by all constitutional mean i most earnestly recommend that you devote yourself exclusively to the question how this can be accomplish in peace all other question when compare to this sink into insignificance the present be no time for palliation action prompt action be require a delay in congress to prescribe or to recommend a distinct and practical proposition for conciliation may drive we to a point from which it will be almost impossible to recede
 a common ground on which conciliation and harmony can be produce be surely not unattainable the proposition to compromise by let the north have exclusive control of the territory above a certain line and to give southern institution protection below that line ought to receive universal approbation in itself indeed it may not be entirely satisfactory but when the alternative be between a reasonable concession on both side and a destruction of the union it be an imputation upon the patriotism of congress to assert that its member will hesitate for a moment
 even now the danger be upon we in several of the states which have not yet secede the fort arsenal and magazine of the united states have be seize this be by far the most serious step which have be take since the commencement of the trouble this public property have long be leave without garrison and troop for its protection because no person doubt its security under the flag of the country in any state of the union besides our small army have scarcely be sufficient to guard our remote frontier against indian incursion the seizure of this property from all appearance have be purely aggressive and not in resistance to any attempt to coerce a state or states to remain in the union
 at the beginning of these unhappy trouble i determine that no act of mine should increase the excitement in either section of the country if the political conflict be to end in a civil war it be my determined purpose not to commence it nor even to furnish an excuse for it by any act of this government my opinion remain unchanged that justice as well as sound policy require we still to seek a peaceful solution of the question at issue between the north and the south entertain this conviction i refrain even from send reenforcement to major anderson who command the fort in charleston harbor until an absolute necessity for do so should make itself apparent lest it might unjustly be regard as a menace of military coercion and thus furnish if not a provocation at least a pretext for an outbreak on the part of south carolina no necessity for these reenforcement seem to exist i be assure by distinguished and upright gentleman of south carolina that no attack upon major anderson be intend but that on the contrary it be the desire of the state authority as much as it be my own to avoid the fatal consequence which must eventually follow a military collision
 and here i deem it proper to submit for your information copy of a communication date december 28 1860 address to i by r.w. barnwell j. h. adams and james l. orr commissioner from south carolina with the accompany document and copy of my answer thereto date december 31
 in further explanation of major anderson&#39;s removal from fort moultrie to fort sumter it be proper to state that after my answer to the south carolina commissioner the war department receive a letter from that gallant officer date on the 27th of december 1860 the day after this movement from which the following be an extract
 i will add as my opinion that many thing convince i that the authority of the state design to proceed to a hostile act
 evidently refer to the order date december 11 of the late secretary of war
 under this impression i could not hesitate that it be my solemn duty to move my command from a fort which we could not probably have hold long than forty eight or sixty hour to this one where my power of resistance be increase to a very great degree
 it will be recollect that the conclude part of these order be in the following term
 the smallness of your force will not permit you perhaps to occupy more than one of the three fort but an attack on or attempt to take possession of either one of they will be regard as an act of hostility and you may then put your command into either of they which you may deem most proper to increase its power of resistance you be also authorize to take similar defensive step whenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 i deem it my duty to submit to congress a series of resolution adopt by the legislature of virginia on the 19th instant have in view a peaceful settlement of the exciting question which now threaten the union they be deliver to i on thursday the 24th instant by ex president tyler who have leave his dignified and honor retirement in the hope that he may render service to his country in this its hour of peril these resolution it will be perceive extend an invitation to all such states whether slaveholde or nonslaveholde as be willing to unite with virginia in an earnest effort to adjust the present unhappy controversy in the spirit in which the constitution be originally form and consistently with its principle so as to afford to the people of the slaveholde states adequate guaranty for the security of their right to appoint commissioner to meet on the 4th day of february next in the city of washington similar commissioner appoint by virginia to consider and if practicable agree upon some suitable adjustment
 i confess i hail this movement on the part of virginia with great satisfaction from the past history of this ancient and renowned commonwealth we have the full assurance that what she have undertake she will accomplish if it can be do by able enlighten and persevere effort it be highly gratifying to know that other patriotic states have appoint and be appoint commissioner to meet those of virginia in council when assemble they will constitute a body entitle in an eminent degree to the confidence of the country
 the general assembly of virginia have also resolved--
 that ex president john tyler be hereby appoint by the concurrent vote of each branch of the general assembly a commissioner to the president of the united states and judge john robertson be hereby appoint by a like vote a commissioner to the state of south carolina and the other states that have secede or shall secede with instruction respectfully to request the president of the united states and the authority of such state to agree to abstain pende the proceeding contemplate by the action of this general assembly from any and all act calculate to produce a collision of arm between the states and the government of the united states
 however strong may be my desire to enter into such an agreement i be convinced that i do not possess the power congress and congress alone under the war make power can exercise the discretion of agree to abstain from any and all act calculate to produce a collision of arm between this and any other government it would therefore be a usurpation for the executive to attempt to restrain their hand by an agreement in regard to matter over which he have no constitutional control if he be thus to act they might pass law which he should be bind to obey though in conflict with his agreement
 under exist circumstance my present actual power be confine within narrow limit it be my duty at all time to defend and protect the public property within the secede states so far as this may be practicable and especially to employ all constitutional mean to protect the property of the united states and to preserve the public peace at this the seat of the federal government if the secede state abstain from any and all act calculate to produce a collision of arm then the danger so much to be deprecate will no long exist defense and not aggression have be the policy of the administration from the beginning
 but whilst i can enter into no engagement such as that propose i cordially commend to congress with much confidence that it will meet their approbation to abstain from pass any law calculate to produce a collision of arm pende the proceeding contemplate by the action of the general assembly of virginia i be one of those who will never despair of the republic i yet cherish the belief that the american people will perpetuate the union of the states on some term just and honorable for all section of the country i trust that the mediation of virginia may be the destine mean under providence of accomplish this inestimable benefit glorious as be the memory of her past history such an achievement both in relation to her own fame and the welfare of the whole country would surpass they all

my friend no one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting to this place and the kindness of these people i owe every thing here i have live a quarter of a century and have pass from a young to an old man here my child have be bear and one be bury i now leave not know when or whether ever i may return with a task before i great than that which rest upon washington without the assistance of that divine being who ever attend he i can not succeed with that assistance i can not fail trust in him who can go with i and remain with you and be every where for good let we confidently hope that all will yet be well to his care commend you as i hope in your prayer you will commend i i bid you an affectionate farewell
in answer to their resolution of the 11th instant ultimo that the president of the united states furnish to the house if not incompatible with the public service the reason that have induce he to assemble so large a number of troop in this city and why they be keep here and whether he have any information of a conspiracy upon the part of any portion of the citizen of this country to seize upon the capital and prevent the inauguration of the president elect the president submit that the number of troop assemble in this city be not large as the resolution presuppose its total amount be 653 man exclusive of the marine who be of course at the navy yard as their appropriate station these troop be order here to act as a posse comitatus in strict subordination to the civil authority for the purpose of present peace and order in the city of washington should this be necessary before or at the period of the inauguration of the president elect
 since the date of the resolution hon mr. howard from the select committee have make a report to the house on this subject it be thoroughly investigate by the committee and although they have express the opinion that the evidence before they do not prove the existence of a secret organization here or elsewhere hostile to the government that have for its object upon its own responsibility an attack upon the capital or any of the public property here or an interruption of any of the function of the government yet the house lay upon the table by a very large majority a resolution express the opinion that the regular troop now in this city ought to be forthwith remove therefrom this of itself be a sufficient reason for not withdraw the troop
 but what be the duty of the president at the time the troop be order to this city ought he to have wait before this precautionary measure be adopt until he could obtain proof that a secret organization exist to seize the capital in the language of the select committee this be in a time of high excitement consequent upon revolutionary event transpire all around we the very air fill with rumor and individual indulge in the most extravagant expression of fear and threat under these and other circumstance which i need not detail but which appear in the testimony before the select committee i be convince that i ought to act the safety of the immense amount of public property in this city and that of the archive of the government in which all the states and especially the new states in which the public land be situate have a deep interest the peace and order of the city itself and the security of the inauguration of the president elect be object of such vast importance to the whole country that i could not hesitate to adopt precautionary defensive measure at the present moment when all be quiet it be difficult to realize the state of alarm which prevail when the troop be first order to this city this almost instantly subside after the arrival of the first company and a feeling of comparative peace and security have since exist both in washington and throughout the country have i refuse to adopt this precautionary measure and evil consequence which many good man at the time apprehend have follow i should never have forgive myself

  fellow citizen of the united states in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself i appear before you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath prescribe by the constitution of the united states to be take by the president before he enter on the execution of his office "i do not consider it necessary at present for i to discuss those matter of administration about which there be no special anxiety or excitement apprehension seem to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security be to be endanger there have never be any reasonable cause for such apprehension indeed the most ample evidence to the contrary have all the while exist and be open to their inspection it be find in nearly all the publish speech of he who now address you i do but quote from one of those speech when i declare that i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exist i beheve i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so those who nominate and elect i do so with full knowledge that i have make this and many similar declaration and have never recant they and more than this they place in the platform for my acceptance and as a law to themselves and to i the clear and emphatic resolution which i now read resolved that the maintenance inviolate of the right of the states and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institution accord to its own judgment exclusively be essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory no matter under what pretext as among the gravest of crime i now reiterate these sentiment and in do so i only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case be susceptible that the property peace and security of no section be to be in any wise endanger by the now incoming administration i add too that all the protection which consistently with the constitution and the law can be give will be cheerfully give to all the states when lawfully demand for whatever cause&mdash;as cheerfully to one section as to another there be much controversy about the delivering up of fugitive from service or labor the clause i now read be as plainly write in the constitution as any other of its provision no person hold to service or labor in one state under the law thereof escape into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharge from such service or labor but shall be deliver up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due it be scarcely question that this provision be intend by those who make it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slave and the intention of the lawgiver be the law all member of congress swear their support to the whole constitution&mdash;to this provision as much as to any other to the proposition then that slave whose case come within the term of this clause shall be deliver up their oath be unanimous now if they would make the effort in good temper could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by mean of which to keep good that unanimous oath?there be some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforce by national or by state authority but surely that difference be not a very material one if the slave be to be surrender it can be of but little consequence to he or to other by which authority it be do and should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?again in any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguard of liberty know in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduce so that a free man be not in any case surrender as a slave and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantee that the citizen of each state shall be entitle to all privilege and immunity of citizen in the several states "i take the official oath to day with no mental reservation and with no purpose to construe the constitution or law by any hypercritical rule and while i do not choose now to specify particular act of congress as proper to be enforce i do suggest that it will be much safe for all both in official and private station to conform to and abide by all those act which stand unrepealed than to violate any of they trust to find impunity in have they hold to be unconstitutional it be seventy two year since the first inauguration of a president under our national constitution during that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizen have in succession administer the executive branch of the government they have conduct it through many peril and generally with great success yet with all this scope of precedent i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four year under great and peculiar difficulty a disruption of the federal union heretofore only menace be now formidably attempt i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states be perpetual perpetuity be imply if not express in the fundamental law of all national government it be safe to assert that no government proper ever have a provision in its organic law for its own termination continue to execute all the express provision of our national constitution and the union will endure forever&mdash;it be impossible to destroy it except by some action not provide for in the instrument itself again if the united states be not a government proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the party who make it one party to a contract may violate it&mdash;break it so to speak but do it not require all to lawfully rescind it?descende from these general principle we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union be perpetual confirm by the history of the union itself the union be much old than the constitution it be form in fact by the articles of association in 1774 it be mature and continue by the declaration of independence in 1776 it be far mature and the faith of all the then thirteen state expressly plight and engage that it should be perpetual by the articles of confederation in 1778 and finally in 1787 one of the declare object for ordain and establish the constitution be to form a more perfect union "but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible the union be less perfect than before the constitution having lose the vital element of perpetuity it follow from these view that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolve and ordinance to that effect be legally void and that act of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states be insurrectionary or revolutionary accord to circumstance i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the law the union be unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoin upon i that the law of the union be faithfully execute in all the states do this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful master the american people shall withhold the requisite mean or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary i trust this will not be regard as a menace but only as the declare purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself in do this there need to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be force upon the national authority the power confide to i will be use to hold occupy and possess the property and place belong to the government and to collect the duty and impost but beyond what may be necessary for these object there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizen from hold the federal office there will be no attempt to force obnoxious stranger among the people for that object while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these office the attempt to do so would be so irritate and so nearly impracticable withal that i deem it well to forego for the time the use of such office the mail unless repel will continue to be furnish in all part of the union so far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which be most favorable to calm thought and reflection the course here indicate will be follow unless current event and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper and in every case and exigency my good discretion will be exercise accord to circumstance actually exist and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national trouble and the restoration of fraternal sympathy and affection that there be person in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all event and be glad of any pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such i need address no word to they to those however who really love the union may i not speak?before enter upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric with all its benefit its memory and its hope would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it will you hazard so desperate a step while there be any possibility that any portion of the ill you fly from have no real existence will you while the certain ill you fly to be great than all the real one you fly from&mdash;will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional right can be maintain be it true then that any right plainly write in the constitution have be deny i think not happily the human mind be so constitute that no party can reach to the audacity of do this think if you can of a single instance in which a plainly write provision of the constitution have ever be deny if by the mere force of number a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly write constitutional right it might in a moral point of view justify revolution&mdash;certainly would if such a right be a vital one but such be not our case all the vital right of minority and of individual be so plainly assure to they by affirmation and negation guarantee and prohibition in the constitution that controversy never arise concern they but no organic law can ever be frame with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration no foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provision for all possible question shall fugitive from labor be surrender by national or by state authority the constitution do not expressly say may congress prohibit slavery in the territories the constitution do not expressly say must congress protect slavery in the territories the constitution do not expressly say from question of this class spring all our constitutional controversy and we divide upon they into majority and minority if the minority will not acquiesce the majority must or the government must cease there be no other alternative for continue the government be acquiescence on one side or the other if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin they for a minority of their own will secede from they whenever a majority refuse to be control by such minority for instance why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again precisely as portion of the present union now claim to secede from it all who cherish disunion sentiment be now be educate to the exact temper of do this be there such perfect identity of interest among the states to compose a new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renew secession?plainly the central idea of secession be the essence of anarchy a majority hold in restraint by constitutional check and limitation and always change easily with deliberate change of popular opinion and sentiment be the only true sovereign of a free people whoever reject it do of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism unanimity be impossible the rule of a minority as a permanent arrangement be wholly inadmissible so that reject the majority principle anarchy or despotism in some form be all that be leave i do not forget the position assume by some that constitutional question be to be decide by the supreme court nor do i deny that such decision must be bind in any case upon the party to a suit as to the object of that suit while they be also entitle to very high respect and consideration in all parallel case by all other department of the government and while it be obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any give case still the evil effect follow it be limit to that particular case with the chance that it may be overrule and never become a precedent for other case can well be bear than could the evil of a different practice at the same time the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital question affect the whole people be to be irrevocably fix by decision of the supreme court the instant they be make in ordinary litigation between party in personal action the people will have cease to be their own ruler have to that extent practically resign their government into the hand of that eminent tribunal nor be there in this view any assault upon the court or the judge it be a duty from which they may not shrink to decide case properly bring before they and it be no fault of theirs if other seek to turn their decision to political purpose one section of our country believe slavery be right and ought to be extend while the other believe it be wrong and ought not to be extend this be the only substantial dispute the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade be each as well enforce perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly support the law itself the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both case and a few break over in each this i think can not be perfectly cure and it would be bad in both case after the separation of the section than before the foreign slave trade now imperfectly suppress would be ultimately revive without restriction in one section while fugitive slave now only partially surrender would not be surrender at all by the other physically speak we can not separate we can not remove our respective section from each other nor build an impassable wall between they a husband and wife may be divorce and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different part of our country can not do this they can not but remain face to face and intercourse either amicable or hostile must continue between they be it possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before can alien make treaty easy than friend can make law can treaty be more faithfully enforce between alien than law can among friend suppose you go to war you can not fight always and when after much loss on both side and no gain on either you cease fighting the identical old question as to term of intercourse be again upon you this country with its institution belong to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the exist government they can exercise their constitutional right of amend it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it i can not be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizen be desirous of have the national constitution amend while i make no recommendation of amendment i fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject to be exercise in either of the mode prescribe in the instrument itself and i should under exist circumstance favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity be afford the people to act upon it i will venture to add that to i the convention mode seem preferable in that it allow amendment to originate with the people themselves instead of only permit they to take or reject proposition originate by other not especially choose for the purpose and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse i understand a propose amendment to the constitution&mdash;which amendment however i have not seen&mdash;ha pass congress to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institution of the states include that of person hold to service to avoid misconstruction of what i have say i depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendment so far as to say that hold such a provision to now be imply constitutional law i have no objection to its be make express and irrevocable the chief magistrate derive all his authority from the people and they have confer none upon he to fix term for the separation of the states the people themselves can do this also if they choose but the executive as such have nothing to do with it his duty be to administer the present government as it come to his hand and to transmit it unimpaire by he to his successor why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people be there any well or equal hope in the world in our present difference be either party without faith of be in the right if the almighty ruler of nations with his eternal truth and justice be on your side of the north or on yours of the south that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the american people by the frame of the government under which we live this same people have wisely give their public servant but little power for mischief and have with equal wisdom provide for the return of that little to their own hand at very short interval while the people retain their virtue and vigilance no administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four year my countryman one and all think calmly and well upon this whole subject nothing valuable can be lose by take time if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately that object will be frustrate by take time but no good object can be frustrate by it such of you as be now dissatisfied still have the old constitution unimpaire and on the sensitive point the law of your own framing under it while the new administration will have no immediate power if it would to change either if it be admit that you who be dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute there still be no single good reason for precipitate action intelligence patriotism christianity and a firm reliance on he who have never yet forsake this favor land be still competent to adjust in the good way all our present difficulty in your hand my dissatisfied fellow countryman and not in mine be the momentous issue of civil war the government will not assail you you can have no conflict without be yourselves the aggressor you have no oath register in heaven to destroy the government while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve protect and defend it "i be loath to close we be not enemy but friend we must not be enemy though passion may have strain it must not break our bond of affection the mystic chord of memory stretch from every battle field and patriot grave to every live heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touch as surely they will be by the well angel of our nature
fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives

 having be convene on an extraordinary occasion as authorize by the constitution your attention be not call to any ordinary subject of legislation

 at the beginning of the present presidential term four month ago the function of the federal government be find to be generally suspend within the several states of south carolina georgia alabama mississippi louisiana and florida except only those of the post office department

 within these states all the fort arsenal dockyard custom house and the like include the movable and stationary property in and about they have be seize and be hold in open hostility to this government except only forts pickens taylor and jefferson on and near the florida coast and fort sumter in charleston harbor south carolina the fort thus seize have be put in improved condition new one have be build and armed force have be organize and be organize all avowedly with the same hostile purpose

 the fort remain in the possession of the federal government in and near these states be either besiege or menace by warlike preparation and especially fort sumter be nearly surround by well protect hostile battery with gun equal in quality to the good of its own and outnumber the latter as perhaps ten to one a disproportionate share of the federal musket and rifle have somehow find their way into these states and have be seize to be use against the government accumulation of the public revenue lie within they have be seize for the same object the navy be scatter in distant sea leave but a very small part of it within the immediate reach of the government officer of the federal army and navy have resign in great number and of those resign a large proportion have take up arm against the government simultaneously and in connection with all this the purpose to sever the federal union be openly avow in accordance with this purpose an ordinance have be adopt in each of these states declare the states respectively to be separate from the national union a formula for institute a combined government of these states have be promulgate and this illegal organization in the character of confederate states be already invoke recognition aid and intervention from foreign power

 find this condition of thing and believe it to be an imperative duty upon the incoming executive to prevent if possible the consummation of such attempt to destroy the federal union a choice of mean to that end become indispensable this choice be make and be declare in the inaugural address the policy choose look to the exhaustion of all peaceful measure before a resort to any strong one it seek only to hold the public place and property not already wrest from the government and to collect the revenue rely for the rest on time discussion and the ballot box it promise a continuance of the mail at government expense to the very people who be resist the government and it give repeat pledge against any disturbance to any of the people or any of their right of all that which a president might constitutionally and justifiably do in such a case everything be forborne without which it be believe possible to keep the government on foot

 on the 5th of march the present incumbent&#39; first full day in office a letter of major anderson command at fort sumter write on the 28th of february and receive at the war department on the 4th of march be by that department place in his hand this letter express the professional opinion of the writer that reenforcement could not be throw into that fort within the time for his relief render necessary by the limited supply of provision and with a view of hold possession of the same with a force of less than 20,000 good and well discipline man this opinion be concur in by all the officer of his command and their memoranda on the subject be make inclosure of major anderson&#39;s letter the whole be immediately lay before lieutenant general scott who at once concur with major anderson in opinion on reflection however he take full time consult with other officer both of the army and the navy and at the end of four day come reluctantly but decidedly to the same conclusion as before he also state at the same time that no such sufficient force be then at the control of the government or could be raise and bring to the ground within the time when the provision in the fort would be exhaust in a purely military point of view this reduce the duty of the administration in the case to the mere matter of get the garrison safely out of the fort

 it be believe however that to so abandon that position under the circumstance would be utterly ruinous that the necessity under which it be to be do would not be fully understand that by many it would be construe as a part of a voluntary policy that at home it would discourage the friend of the union embolden its adversary and go far to insure to the latter a recognition abroad that in fact it would be our national destruction consummate this could not be allow starvation be not yet upon the garrison and ere it would be reach fort pickens might be reenforce this last would be a clear indication of policy and would well enable the country to accept the evacuation of fort sumter as a military necessity an order be at once direct to be send for the landing of the troop from the steamship brooklyn into fort pickens this order could not go by land but must take the long and slow route by sea the first return news from the order be receive just one week before the fall of fort sumter the news itself be that the officer command the sabine to which vessel the troop have be transfer from the brooklyn act upon some quasi armistice of the late administration and of the existence of which the present administration up to the time the order be dispatch have only too vague and uncertain rumor to fix attention have refuse to land the troop to now reenforce fort pickens before a crisis would be reach at fort sumter be impossible render so by the near exhaustion of provision in the latter name fort in precaution against such a conjuncture the government have a few day before commence prepare an expedition as well adapt as might be to relieve fort sumter which expedition be intend to be ultimately use or not accord to circumstance the strong anticipated case for use it be now present and it be resolve to send it forward as have be intend in this contingency it be also resolve to notify the governor of south carolina that he might expect an attempt would be make to provision the fort and that if the attempt should not be resist there would be no effort to throw in man arm or ammunition without further notice or in case of an attack upon the fort this notice be accordingly give whereupon the fort be attack and bombard to its fall without even await the arrival of the provision expedition

 it be thus see that the assault upon and reduction of fort sumter be in no sense a matter of self defense on the part of the assailant they well know that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit aggression upon they they know they be expressly notify that the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry man of the garrison be all which would on that occasion be attempt unless themselves by resist so much should provoke more they know that this government desire to keep the garrison in the fort not to assail they but merely to maintain visible possession and thus to preserve the union from actual and immediate dissolution trusting as hereinbefore state to time discussion and the ballot box for final adjustment and they assail and reduce the fort for precisely the reverse object to drive out the visible authority of the federal union and thus force it to immediate dissolution that this be their object the executive well understand and having say to they in the inaugural address you can have no conflict without be yourselves the aggressor he take pain not only to keep this declaration good but also to keep the case so free from the power of ingenious sophistry as that the world should not be able to misunderstand it by the affair at fort sumter with its surround circumstance that point be reach then and thereby the assailant of the government begin the conflict of arm without a gun in sight or in expectancy to return their fire save only the few in the fort send to that harbor year before for their own protection and still ready to give that protection in whatever be lawful in this act discard all else they have force upon the country the distinct issue immediate dissolution or blood

 and this issue embrace more than the fate of these united states it present to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or democracy a government of the people by the same people can or can not maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foe it present the question whether discontent individual too few in number to control administration accord to organic law in any case can always upon the pretense make in this case or on any other pretense or arbitrarily without any pretense break up their government and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth it force we to ask be there in all republic this inherent and fatal weakness must a government of necessity be too strong for the liberty of its own people or too weak to maintain its own existence

 so view the issue no choice be leave but to call out the war power of the government and so to resist force employ for its destruction by force for its preservation

 the call be make and the response of the country be most gratifying surpass in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation yet none of the states commonly call slave states except delaware give a regiment through regular state organization a few regiment have be organize within some other of those states by individual enterprise and receive into the government service of course the seceded states so call and to which texas have be join about the time of the inauguration give no troop to the cause of the union the border state so call be not uniform in their action some of they be almost for the union while in other as virginia north carolina tennessee and arkansas the union sentiment be nearly repress and silence the course take in virginia be the most remarkable perhaps the most important a convention elect by the people of that state to consider this very question of disrupt the federal union be in session at the capital of virginia when fort sumter fall to this body the people have choose a large majority of profess union man almost immediately after the fall of sumter many member of that majority go over to the original disunion minority and with they adopt an ordinance for withdraw the state from the union whether this change be work by their great approval of the assault upon sumter or their great resentment at the government&#39;s resistance to that assault be not definitely know although they submit the ordinance for ratification to a vote of the people to be take on a day then somewhat more than a month distant the convention and the legislature which be also in session at the same time and place with lead man of the state not member of either immediately commence act as if the state be already out of the union they push military preparation vigorously forward all over the state they seize the united states armory at harpers ferry and the navy yard at gosport near norfolk they receive perhaps invite into their state large body of troop with their warlike appointment from the so call secede states they formally enter into a treaty of temporary alliance and cooperation with the so call confederate states and send member to their congress at montgomery and finally they permit the insurrectionary government to be transfer to their capital at richmond

 the people of virginia have thus allow this giant insurrection to make its nest within her border and this government have no choice leave but to deal with it where it find it and it have the less regret as the loyal citizen have in due form claim its protection those loyal citizen this government be bind to recognize and protect as be virginia

 in the border state so call in fact the middle states there be those who favor a policy which they call armed neutrality that be an arming of those states to prevent the union force pass one way or the disunion the other over their soil this would be disunion complete figuratively speak it would be the building of an impassable wall along the line of separation and yet not quite an impassable one for under the guise of neutrality it would tie the hand of the union man and freely pass supply from among they to the insurrectionist which it could not do as an open enemy at a stroke it would take all the trouble off the hand of secession except only what proceed from the external blockade it would do for the disunionist that which of all thing they most desire feed they well and give they disunion without a struggle of their own it recognize no fidelity to the constitution no obligation to maintain the union and while very many who have favor it be doubtless loyal citizen it be nevertheless very injurious in effect

 recur to the action of the government it may be state that at first a call be make for 75,000 militia and rapidly follow this a proclamation be issue for close the port of the insurrectionary district by proceeding in the nature of blockade so far all be believe to be strictly legal at this point the insurrectionist announce their purpose to enter upon the practice of privateering

 other call be make for volunteer to serve three year unless soon discharge and also for large addition to the regular army and navy these measure whether strictly legal or not be venture upon under what appear to be a popular demand and a public necessity trust then as now that congress would readily ratify they it be believe that nothing have be do beyond the constitutional competency of congress

 soon after the first call for militia it be consider a duty to authorize the commanding general in proper case accord to his discretion to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or in other word to arrest and detain without resort to the ordinary process and form of law such individual as he might deem dangerous to the public safety this authority have purposely be exercise but very sparingly nevertheless the legality and propriety of what have be do under it be question and the attention of the country have be call to the proposition that one who be swear to take care that the law be faithfully execute should not himself violate they of course some consideration be give to the question of power and propriety before this matter be act upon the whole of the law which be require to be faithfully execute be be resist and fail of execution in nearly one third of the states must they be allow to finally fail of execution even have it be perfectly clear that by the use of the mean necessary to their execution some single law make in such extreme tenderness of the citizen&#39;s liberty that practically it relieve more of the guilty than of the innocent should to a very limited extent be violate to state the question more directly be all the law but one to go unexecuted and the government itself go to piece lest that one be violate even in such a case would not the official oath be break if the government should be overthrow when it be believe that disregard the single law would tend to preserve it but it be not believe that this question be present it be not believe that any law be violate the provision of the constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspend unless when in case of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it be equivalent to a provision be a provision that such privilege may be suspend when in case of rebellion or invasion the public safety do require it it be decide that we have a case of rebellion and that the public safety do require the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which be authorize to be make now it be insist that congress and not the executive be vest with this power but the constitution itself be silent as to which or who be to exercise the power and as the provision be plainly make for a dangerous emergency it can not be believe the framer of the instrument intend that in every case the danger should run its course until congress could be call together the very assembling of which might be prevent as be intend in this case by the rebellion

 no more extended argument be now offer as an opinion at some length will probably be present by the attorney general whether there shall be any legislation upon the subject and if any what be submit entirely to the well judgment of congress

 the forbearance of this government have be so extraordinary and so long continue as to lead some foreign nation to shape their action as if they suppose the early destruction of our national union be probable while this on discovery give the executive some concern he be now happy to say that the sovereignty and right of the united states be now everywhere practically respect by foreign power and a general sympathy with the country be manifest throughout the world

 the report of the secretary of the treasury war and the navy will give the information in detail deem necessary and convenient for your deliberation and action while the executive and all the departments will stand ready to supply omission or to communicate new fact consider important for you to know

 it be now recommend that you give the legal mean for make this contest a short and a decisive one that you place at the control of the government for the work at least 400,000 man and $ 400,000,000 that number of man be about one tenth of those of proper age within the region where apparently all be willing to engage and the sum be less than a twenty third part of the money value own by the man who seem ready to devote the whole a debt of $ 600,000,000 now be a less sum per head than be the debt of our revolution when we come out of that struggle and the money value in the country now bear even a great proportion to what it be then than do the population surely each man have as strong a motive now to preserve our liberty as each have then to establish they

 a right result at this time will be worth more to the world than ten time the man and ten time the money the evidence reach we from the country leave no doubt that the material for the work be abundant and that it need only the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction and the hand of the executive to give it practical shape and efficiency one of the great perplexity of the government be to avoid receive troop fast than it can provide for they in a word the people will save their government if the government itself will do its part only indifferently well

 it might seem at first think to be of little difference whether the present movement at the south be call secession or rebellion the mover however well understand the difference at the beginning they know they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude by any name which imply violation of law they know their people possess as much of moral sense as much of devotion to law and order and as much pride in and reverence for the history and government of their common country as any other civilized and patriotic people they know they could make no advancement directly in the tooth of these strong and noble sentiment accordingly they commence by an insidious debauching of the public mind they invent an ingenious sophism which if concede be follow by perfectly logical step through all the incident to the complete destruction of the union the sophism itself be that any state of the union may consistently with the national constitution and therefore lawfully and peacefully withdraw from the union without the consent of the union or of any other state the little disguise that the suppose right be to be exercise only for just cause themselves to be the sole judge of its justice be too thin to merit any notice

 with rebellion thus sugar coat they have be drug the public mind of their section for more than thirty year and until at length they have bring many good man to a willingness to take up arm against the government the day after some assemblage of man have enact the farcical pretense of take their state out of the union who could have be bring to no such thing the day before

 this sophism derive much perhaps the whole of its currency from the assumption that there be some omnipotent and sacred supremacy pertain to a state to each state of our federal union our states have neither more nor less power than that reserve to they in the union by the constitution no one of they ever having be a state out of the union the original one pass into the union even before they cast off their british colonial dependence and the new one each come into the union directly from a condition of dependence except texas and even texas in its temporary independence be never designate a state the new one only take the designation of states on come into the union while that name be first adopt for the old one in and by the declaration of independence therein the united colonies be declare to be free and independent states but even then the object plainly be not to declare their independence of one another or of the union but directly the contrary as their mutual pledge and their mutual action before at the time and afterwards abundantly show the express plighting of faith by each and all of the original thirteen in the articles of confederation two year later that the union shall be perpetual be most conclusive having never be states either in substance or in name outside of the union whence this magical omnipotence of state right assert a claim of power to lawfully destroy the union itself much be say about the sovereignty of the states but the word even be not in the national constitution nor as be believe in any of the state constitution what be a sovereignty in the political sense of the term would it be far wrong to define it a political community without a political superior test by this no one of our states except texas ever be a sovereignty and even texas give up the character on come into the union by which act she acknowledge the constitution of the united states and the law and treaty of the united states make in pursuance of the constitution to be for she the supreme law of the land the states have their status in the union and they have no other legal status if they break from this they can only do so against law and by revolution the union and not themselves separately procure their independence and their liberty by conquest or purchase the union give each of they whatever of independence and liberty it have the union be old than any of the states and in fact it create they as states originally some dependent colony make the union and in turn the union throw off their old dependence for they and make they states such as they be not one of they ever have a state constitution independent of the union of course it be not forget that all the new states frame their constitution before they enter the union nevertheless dependent upon and preparatory to come into the union

 unquestionably the states have the power and right reserve to they in and by the national constitution but among these surely be not include all conceivable power however mischievous or destructive but at most such only as be know in the world at the time as governmental power and certainly a power to destroy the government itself have never be know as a governmental as a merely administrative power this relative matter of national power and state right as a principle be no other than the principle of generality and locality whatever concern the whole should be confide to the whole to the general government while whatever concern only the state should be leave exclusively to the state this be all there be of original principle about it whether the national constitution in define boundary between the two have apply the principle with exact accuracy be not to be question we be all bind by that defining without question

 what be now combat be the position that secession be consistent with the constitution be lawful and peaceful it be not contend that there be any express law for it and nothing should ever be imply as law which lead to unjust or absurd consequence the nation purchase with money the country out of which several of these states be form be it just that they shall go off without leave and without refund the nation pay very large sum in the aggregate i believe nearly a hundred million to relieve florida of the aboriginal tribe be it just that she shall now be off without consent or without make any return the nation be now in debt for money apply to the benefit of these so call secede states in common with the rest be it just either that creditor shall go unpaid or the remain states pay the whole a part of the present national debt be contract to pay the old debt of texas be it just that she shall leave and pay no part of this herself

 again if one state may secede so may another and when all shall have secede none be leave to pay the debt be this quite just to creditor do we notify they of this sage view of ours when we borrow their money if we now recognize this doctrine by allow the seceder to go in peace it be difficult to see what we can do if other choose to go or to extort term upon which they will promise to remain

 the seceder insist that our constitution admit of secession they have assume to make a national constitution of their own in which of necessity they have either discard or retain the right of secession as they insist it exist in our if they have discard it they thereby admit that on principle it ought not to be in ours if they have retain it by their own construction of ours they show that to be consistent they must secede from one another whenever they shall find it the easy way of settle their debt or effect any other selfish or unjust object the principle itself be one of disintegration and upon which no government can possibly endure

 if all the states save one should assert the power to drive that one out of the union it be presume the whole class of seceder politician would at once deny the power and denounce the act as the great outrage upon state right but suppose that precisely the same act instead of be call drive the one out should be call the seceding of the other from that one it would be exactly what the seceder claim to do unless indeed they make the point that the one because it be a minority may rightfully do what the other because they be a majority may not rightfully do these politician be subtle and profound on the right of minority they be not partial to that power which make the constitution and speak from the preamble call itself we the people

 it may well be question whether there be to day a majority of the legally qualified voter of any state except perhaps south carolina in favor of disunion there be much reason to believe that the union man be the majority in many if not in every other one of the so call secede states the contrary have not be demonstrate in any one of they it be venture to affirm this even of virginia and tennessee for the result of an election hold in military camp where the bayonet be all on one side of the question vote upon can scarcely be consider as demonstrate popular sentiment at such an election all that large class who be at once for the union and against coercion would be coerce to vote against the union

 it may be affirm without extravagance that the free institution we enjoy have develop the power and improve the condition of our whole people beyond any example in the world of this we now have a striking and an impressive illustration so large an army as the government have now on foot be never before know without a soldier in it but who have take his place there of his own free choice but more than this there be many single regiment whose member one and another possess full practical knowledge of all the art science profession and whatever else whether useful or elegant be know in the world and there be scarcely one from which there could not be select a president a cabinet a congress and perhaps a court abundantly competent to administer the government itself nor do i say this be not true also in the army of our late friend now adversary in this contest but if it be so much well the reason why the government which have confer such benefit on both they and we should not be break up whoever in any section propose to abandon such a government would do well to consider in deference to what principle it be that he do it what well he be likely to get in its stead whether the substitute will give or be intend to give so much of good to the people there be some foreshadowing on this subject our adversary have adopt some declaration of independence in which unlike the good old one pen by jefferson they omit the word all man be create equal why they have adopt a temporary national constitution in the preamble of which unlike our good old one sign by washington they omit we the people and substitute we the deputy of the sovereign and independent states why why this deliberate press out of view the right of man and the authority of the people

 this be essentially a people&#39; contest on the side of the union it be a struggle for maintain in the world that form and substance of government whose lead object be to elevate the condition of man to lift artificial weight from all shoulder to clear the path of laudable pursuit for all to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life yield to partial and temporary departure from necessity this be the lead object of the government for whose existence we contend

 i be most happy to believe that the plain people understand and appreciate this it be worthy of note that while in this the government&#39;s hour of trial large number of those in the army and navy who have be favor with the office have resign and prove false to the hand which have pamper they not one common soldier or common sailor be know to have desert his flag

 great honor be due to those officer who remain true despite the example of their treacherous associate but the great honor and most important fact of all be the unanimous firmness of the common soldier and common sailor to the last man so far as know they have successfully resist the traitorous effort of those whose command but an hour before they obey as absolute law this be the patriotic instinct of plain people they understand without an argument that the destroy the government which be make by washington mean no good to they

 our popular government have often be call an experiment two point in it our people have already settle the successful establishing and the successful administering of it one still remain its successful maintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it it be now for they to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry an election can also suppress a rebellion that ballot be the rightful and peaceful successor of bullet and that when ballot have fairly and constitutionally decide there can be no successful appeal back to bullet that there can be no successful appeal except to ballot themselves at succeed election such will be a great lesson of peace teach man that what they can not take by an election neither can they take it by a war teach all the folly of be the beginner of a war

 lest there be some uneasiness in the mind of candid man as to what be to be the course of the government toward the southern states after the rebellion shall have be suppress the executive deem it proper to say it will be his purpose then as ever to be guide by the constitution and the law and that he probably will have no different understanding of the power and duty of the federal government relatively to the right of the states and the people under the constitution than that express in the inaugural address

 he desire to preserve the government that it may be administer for all as it be administer by the man who make it loyal citizen everywhere have the right to claim this of their government and the government have no right to withhold or neglect it it be not perceive that in give it there be any coercion any conquest or any subjugation in any just sense of those term

 the constitution provide and all the states have accept the provision that the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government but if a state may lawfully go out of the union having do so it may also discard the republican form of government so that to prevent its go out be an indispensable mean to the end of maintain the guaranty mention and when an end be lawful and obligatory the indispensable mean to it be also lawful and obligatory

 it be with the deep regret that the executive find the duty of employ the war power in defense of the government force upon he he could but perform this duty or surrender the existence of the government no compromise by public servant could in this case be a cure not that compromise be not often proper but that no popular government can long survive a marked precedent that those who carry an election can only save the government from immediate destruction by give up the main point upon which the people give the election the people themselves and not their servant can safely reverse their own deliberate decision

 as a private citizen the executive could not have consent that these institution shall perish much less could he in betrayal of so vast and so sacred a trust as these free people have confide to he he feel that he have no moral right to shrink nor even to count the chance of his own life in what might follow in full view of his great responsibility he have so far do what he have deem his duty you will now accord to your own judgment perform your he sincerely hope that your view and your action may so accord with his as to assure all faithful citizen who have be disturb in their right of a certain and speedy restoration to they under the constitution and the law

 and having thus choose our course without guile and with pure purpose let we renew our trust in god and go forward without fear and with manly heart
fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives in the midst of unprecedented political trouble we have cause of great gratitude to god for unusual good health and most abundant harvest you will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigency of the time our intercourse with foreign nation have be attend with profound solicitude chiefly turn upon our own domestic affair a disloyal portion of the american people have during the whole year be engage in an attempt to divide and destroy the union a nation which endure factious domestic division be expose to disrespect abroad and one party if not both be sure soon or later to invoke foreign intervention nation thus tempt to interfere be not always able to resist the counsel of seem expediency and ungenerous ambition although measure adopt under such influence seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopt they the disloyal citizen of the united states who have offer the ruin of our country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoke abroad have receive less patronage and encouragement than they probably expect if it be just to suppose as the insurgent have seem to assume that foreign nation in this case discard all moral social and treaty obligation would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce include especially the acquisition of cotton those nation appear as yet not to have see their way to their object more directly or clearly through the destruction than through the preservation of the union if we could dare to believe that foreign nation be actuate by no high principle than this i be quite sure a sound argument could be make to show they that they can reach their aim more readily and easily by aid to crush this rebellion than by give encouragement to it the principal lever rely on by the insurgent for exciting foreign nation to hostility against we as already intimate be the embarrassment of commerce those nation however not improbably see from the first that it be the union which make as well our foreign as our domestic commerce they can scarcely have fail to perceive that the effort for disunion produce the exist difficulty and that one strong nation promise more durable peace and a more extensive valuable and reliable commerce than can the same nation break into hostile fragment it be not my purpose to review our discussion with foreign state because whatever might be their wish or disposition the integrity of our country and the stability of our government mainly depend not upon they but on the loyalty virtue patriotism and intelligence of the american people the correspondence itself with the usual reservation be herewith submit i venture to hope it will appear that we have practice prudence and liberality toward foreign power avert cause of irritation and with firmness maintain our own right and honor since however it be apparent that here as in every other state foreign danger necessarily attend domestic difficulty i recommend that adequate and ample measure be adopt for maintain the public defense on every side while under this general recommendation provision for defend our seacoast line readily occur to the mind i also in the same connection ask the attention of congress to our great lake and river it be believe that some fortification and depot of arm and munition with harbor and navigation improvement all at well select point upon these would be of great importance to the national defense and preservation i ask attention to the view of the secretary of war express in his report upon the same general subject i deem it of importance that the loyal region of east tennessee and western north carolina should be connect with kentucky and other faithful part of the union by railroad i therefore recommend as a military measure that congress provide for the construction of such road as speedily as possible kentucky no doubt will cooperate and through her legislature make the most judicious selection of a line the northern terminus must connect with some exist railroad and whether the route shall be from lexington or nicholasville to the cumberland gap or from lebanon to the tennessee line in the direction of knoxville or on some still different line can easily be determine kentucky and the general government cooperating the work can be complete in a very short time and when do it will be not only of vast present usefulness but also a valuable permanent improvement worth its cost in all the future some treaty design chiefly for the interest of commerce and have no grave political importance have be negotiate and will be submit to the senate for their consideration although we have fail to induce some of the commercial power to adopt a desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war we have remove all obstruction from the way of this humane reform except such as be merely of temporary and accidental occurrence i invite your attention to the correspondence between her britannic majesty 's minister accredit to this government and the secretary of state relative to the detention of the british ship perthshire in june last by the united states steamer massachusetts for a suppose breach of the blockade as this detention be occasion by an obvious misapprehension of the fact and as justice require that we should commit no belligerent act not round in strict right as sanction by public law i recommend that an appropriation be make to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owner of the vessel for her detention i repeat the recommendation of my predecessor in his annual message to congress in december last in regard to the disposition of the surplus which will probably remain after satisfy the claim of american citizen against china pursuant to the award of the commissioner under the act of the 3d of march 1859 if however it should not be deem advisable to carry that recommendation into effect i would suggest that authority be give for invest the principal over the proceed of the surplus refer to in good security with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claim of our citizen against china as be not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that empire by the act of the 5th of august last congress authorize the president to instruct the commander of suitable vessel to defend themselves against and to capture pirate this authority have be exercise in a single instance only for the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce in the eastern sea especially it seem to i that it would also be advisable to authorize the commander of sailing vessel to recapture any prize which pirate may make of united states vessel and their cargo and the consular court now establish by law in eastern country to adjudicate the case in the event that this should not be object to by the local authority if any good reason exist why we should persevere long in withhold our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of hayti and liberia i be unable to discern it unwilling however to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to they without the approbation of congress i submit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for maintain a charge d'affaire near each of those new states it do not admit of doubt that important commercial advantage might be secure by favorable treaty with they the operation of the treasury during the period which have elapse since your adjournment have be conduct with signal success the patriotism of the people have place at the disposal of the government the large mean demand by the public exigency much of the national loan have be take by citizen of the industrial class whose confidence in their country 's faith and zeal for their country 's deliverance from present peril have induce they to contribute to the support of the government the whole of their limited acquisition this fact impose peculiar obligation to economy in disbursement and energy in action the revenue from all source include loan for the financial year end on the 30th of june 1861 be $ 86,835,900.27 and the expenditure for the same period include payment on account of the public debt be $ 84,578,834.47 leave a balance in the treasury on the 1st of july of 52,257,065.80 for the first quarter of the financial year end on the 30th of september 1861 the receipt from all source include the balance of the 1st of july be $ 102,532,509.27 and the expense $ 98,239,733.09 leave a balance on the 1st of october 1861 of $ 4,292,776.18.estimates for the remain three quarter of the year and for the financial year 1863 together with his view of way and mean for meet the demand contemplate by they will be submit to congress by the secretary of the treasury it be gratify to know that the expenditure make necessary by the rebellion be not beyond the resource of the loyal people and to believe that the same patriotism which have thus far sustain the government will continue to sustain it till peace and union shall again bless the land i respectfully refer to the report of the secretary of war for information respect the numerical strength of the army and for recommendation have in view an increase of its efficiency and the well being of the various branch of the service intrust to his care it be gratify to know that the patriotism of the people have prove equal to the occasion and that the number of troop tender greatly exceed the force which congress authorize i to call into the field i refer with pleasure to those portion of his report which make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attain by our troop and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army the recommendation of the secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis be a subject of vital importance to the future safety of the country and be commend to the serious attention of congress the large addition to the regular army in connection with the defection that have so considerably diminish the number of its officer give peculiar importance to his recommendation for increase the corp of cadet to the great capacity of the military academy by mere omission i presume congress have fail to provide chaplain for hospital occupy by volunteer this subject be bring to my notice and i be induce to draw up the form of a letter one copy of which properly address have be deliver to each of the person and at the date respectively name and state in a schedule contain also the form of the letter mark a and herewith transmit these gentleman i understand enter upon the duty designate at the time respectively state in the schedule and have labor faithfully therein ever since i therefore recommend that they be compensate at the same rate as chaplain in the army i far suggest that general provision be make for chaplain to serve at hospital as well as with regiment the report of the secretary of the navy present in detail the operation of that branch of the service the activity and energy which have characterize its administration and the result of measure to increase its efficiency and power such have be the addition by construction and purchase that it may almost be say a navy have be create and bring into service since our difficulty commence besides blockade our extensive coast squadron large than ever before assemble under our flag have be put afloat and perform deed which have increase our naval renown i would invite special attention to the recommendation of the secretary for a more perfect organization of the navy by introduce additional grade in the service the present organization be defective and unsatisfactory and the suggestion submit by the department will it be believe if adopt obviate the difficulty allude to promote harmony and increase the efficiency of the navy there be three vacancy on the bench of the supreme court two by the decease of justices daniel and mclean and one by the resignation of justice campbell i have so far forborne make nomination to fill these vacancy for reason which i will now state two of the outgoing judge reside within the states now overrun by revolt so that if successor be appoint in the same locality they could not now serve upon their circuit and many of the most competent man there probably would not take the personal hazard of accept to serve even here upon the supreme bench i have be unwilling to throw all the appointment northward thus disable myself from do justice to the south on the return of peace although i may remark that to transfer to the north one which have heretofore be in the south would not with reference to territory and population be unjust during the long and brilliant judicial career of judge mclean his circuit grow into an empire altogether too large for any one judge to give the court therein more than a nominal attendance rise in population from 1,470,018 in 1830 to 6,151,405 in 1860.beside this the country generally have outgrow our present judicial system if uniformity be at all intend the system require that all the states shall be accommodate with circuit court attend by supreme judge while in fact wisconsin minnesota iowa kansas florida texas california and oregon have never have any such court nor can this well be remedie without a change in the system because the adding of judge to the supreme court enough for the accommodation of all part of the country with circuit court would create a court altogether too numerous for a judicial body of any sort and the evil if it be one will increase as new states come into the union circuit court be useful or they be not useful if useful no state should be deny they if not useful no state should have they let they be provide for all or abolish as to all three modification occur to i either of which i think would be an improvement upon our present system let the supreme court be of convenient number in every event then first let the whole country be divide into circuit of convenient size the supreme judge to serve in a number of they correspond to their own number and independent circuit judge be provide for all the rest or secondly let the supreme judge be relieve from circuit duty and circuit judge provide for all the circuit or thirdly dispense with circuit court altogether leave the judicial function wholly to the district court and an independent supreme court i respectfully recommend to the consideration of congress the present condition of the statute law with the hope that congress will be able to find an easy remedy for many of the inconvenience and evil which constantly embarrass those engage in the practical administration of they since the organization of the government congress have enact some 5,000 act and joint resolution which fill more than 6,000 closely print page and be scatter through many volume many of these act have be draw in haste and without sufficient caution so that their provision be often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the well inform person to ascertain precisely what the statute law really be it seem to i very important that the statute law should be make as plain and intelligible as possible and be reduce to as small a compass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the legislature and the perspicuity of its language this well do would i think greatly facilitate the labor of those whose duty it be to assist in the administration of the law and would be a lasting benefit to the people by place before they in a more accessible and intelligible form the law which so deeply concern their interest and their duty i be inform by some whose opinion i respect that all the act of congress now in force and of a permanent and general nature might be revise and rewrite so as to be embrace in one volume or at most two volume of ordinary and convenient size and i respectfully recommend to congress to consider of the subject and if my suggestion be approve to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment of the end propose one of the unavoidable consequence of the present insurrection be the entire suppression in many place of all the ordinary mean of administer civil justice by the officer and in the form of exist law this be the case in whole or in part in all the insurgent states and as our army advance upon and take possession of part of those states the practical evil become more apparent there be no court nor officer to whom the citizen of other states may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claim against citizen of the insurgent states and there be a vast amount of debt constitute such claim some have estimate it as high as $ 200,000,000 due in large part from insurgent in open rebellion to loyal citizen who be even now make great sacrifice in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the government under these circumstance i have be urgently solicit to establish by military power court to administer summary justice in such case i have thus far decline to do it not because i have any doubt that the end propose the collection of the debt be just and right in itself but because i have be unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise of power but the power of congress i suppose be equal to the anomalous occasion and therefore i refer the whole matter to congress with the hope that a plan may be devise for the administration of justice in all such part of the insurgent states and territories as may be under the control of this government whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by the power of our arm this however not to be a permanent institution but a temporary substitute and to cease as soon as the ordinay court can be reestablish in peace it be important that some more convenient mean should be provide if possible for the adjustment of claim against the government especially in view of their increase number by reason of the war it be as much the duty of government to render prompt justice against itself in favor of citizen as it be to administer the same between private individual the investigation and adjudication of claim in their nature belong to the judicial department besides it be apparent that the attention of congress will be more than usually engage for some time to come with great national question it be intend by the organization of the court of claims mainly to remove this branch of business from the hall of congress but while the court have prove to be an effective and valuable mean of investigation it in great degree fail to effect the object of its creation for want of power to make its judgment final fully aware of the delicacy not to say the danger of the subject i commend to your careful consideration whether this power of make judgment final may not properly be give to the court reserve the right of appeal on question of law to the supreme court with such other provision as experience may have show to be necessary i ask attention to the report of the postmaster general the following be a summary statement of the condition of the department the revenue from all source during the fiscal year end june 30 1861 include the annual permanent appropriation of $ 700,000 for the transportation of free mail matter be $ 9,049,296.40 be about 2 per cent less than the revenue for 1860.the expenditure be $ 13,606,759.11 show a decrease of more than 8 per cent as compare with those of the previous year and leave an excess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of $ 4,557,462.71.the gross revenue for the year end june 30 1863 be estimate at an increase of 4 per cent on that of 1861 make $ 8,683,000 to which should be add the earning of the department in carry free matter viz $ 700,000 make $ 9,383,000.the total expenditure for 1863 be estimate at $ 12,528,000 leave an estimate deficiency of $ 3,145,000 to be supply from the treasury in addition to the permanent appropriation the present insurrection show i think that the extension of this district across the potomac river at the time of establish the capital here be eminently wise and consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of it which lie within the state of virginia be unwise and dangerous i submit for your consideration the expediency of regain that part of the district and the restoration of the original boundary thereof through negotiation with the state of virginia the report of the secretary of the interior with the accompany document exhibit the condition of the several branch of the public business pertain to that department the depressing influence of the insurrection have be specially feel in the operation of the patent and general land offices the cash receipt from the sale of public land during the past year have exceed the expense of our land system only about $ 200,000 the sale have be entirely suspend in the southern states while the interruption to the business of the country and the diversion of large number of man from labor to military service have obstruct settlement in the new states and territories of the northwest the receipt of the patent office have decline in nine month about $ 100,000 render a large reduction of the force employ necessary to make it self sustaining the demand upon the pension office will be largely increase by the insurrection numerous application for pension base upon the casualty of the exist war have already be make there be reason to believe that many who be now upon the pension roll and in receipt of the bounty of the government be in the rank of the insurgent army or give they aid and comfort the secretary of the interior have direct a suspension of the payment of the pension of such person upon proof of their disloyalty i recommend that congress authorize that officer to cause the name of such person to be stricken from the pension roll the relation of the government with the indian tribe have be greatly disturb by the insurrection especially in the southern superintendency and in that of new mexico the indian country south of kansas be in the possession of insurgent from texas and arkansas the agent of the united states appoint since the 4th of march for this superintendency have be unable to reach their post while the most of those who be in office before that time have espouse the insurrectionary cause and assume to exercise the power of agent by virtue of commission from the insurrectionist it have be state in the public press that a portion of those indians have be organize as a military force and be attach to the army of the insurgent although the government have no official information upon this subject letter have be write to the commissioner of indian affairs by several prominent chief give assurance of their loyalty to the united states and express a wish for the presence of federal troop to protect they it be believe that upon the repossession of the country by the federal force the indians will readily cease all hostile demonstration and resume their former relation to the government agriculture confessedly the large interest of the nation have not a department nor a bureau but a clerkship only assign to it in the government while it be fortunate that this great interest be so independent in its nature as to not have demand and extort more from the government i respectfully ask congress to consider whether something more can not be give voluntarily with general advantage annual report exhibit the condition of our agriculture commerce and manufacture would present a fund of information of great practical value to the country while i make no suggestion as to detail i venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be organize the execution of the law for the suppression of the african slave trade have be confide to the department of the interior it be a subject of gratulation that the effort which have be make for the suppression of this inhuman traffic have be recently attend with unusual success five vessel be fit out for the slave trade have be seize and condemn two mate of vessel engage in the trade and one person in equip a vessel as a slaver have be convict and subject to the penalty of fine and imprisonment and one captain take with a cargo of africans on board his vessel have be convict of the high grade of offense under our law the punishment of which be death the territories of colorado dakota and nevada create by the last congress have be organize and civil administration have be inaugurate therein under auspex especially gratifying when it be consider that the leaven of treason be find exist in some of these new country when the federal officer arrive there the abundant natural resource of these territories with the security and protection afford by organized government will doubtless invite to they a large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country to its accustomed channel i submit the resolution of the legislature of colorado which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the territory so far the authority of the united states have be uphold in all the territories as it be hope it will be in the future i commend their interest and defense to the enlightened and generous care of congress i recommend to the favorable consideration of congress the interest of the district of columbia the insurrection have be the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to its inhabitant and as they have no representative in congress that body should not overlook their just claim upon the government at your late session a joint resolution be adopt authorize the president to take measure for facilitate a proper representation of the industrial interest of the united states at the exhibition of the industry of all nation to be holden at london in the year 1862 i regret to say i have be unable to give personal attention to this subject a subject at once so interesting in itself and so extensively and intimately connect with the material prosperity of the world through the secretaries of state and of the interior a plan or system have be devise and partly mature and which will be lay before you under and by virtue of the act of congress entitle an act to confiscate property use for insurrectionary purpose approve august 6 1861 the legal claim of certain person to the labor and service of certain other person have become forfeited and number of the latter thus liberate be already dependent on the united states and must be provide for in some way besides this it be not impossible that some of the states will pass similar enactment for their own benefit respectively and by operation of which person of the same class will be throw upon they for disposal in such case i recommend that congress provide for accept such person from such state accord to some mode of valuation in lieu pro tanto of direct taxis or upon some other plan to be agree on with such states respectively that such person on such acceptance by the general government be at once deem free and that in any event step be take for colonize both class or the one first mention if the other shall not be bring into existence at some place or place in a climate congenial to they it might be well to consider too whether the free colored people already in the united states could not so far as individual may desire be include in such colonization to carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expend in the territorial acquisition having practice the acquisition of territory for nearly sixty year the question of constitutional power to do so be no long an open one with we the power be question at first by mr. jefferson who however in the purchase of louisiana yield his scruple on the plea of great expediency if it be say that the only legitimate object of acquire territory be to furnish home for white man this measure effect that object for the emigration of colored man leave additional room for white man remain or come here mr. jefferson however place the importance of procure louisiana more on political and commercial ground than on provide room for population on this whole proposition include the appropriation of money with the acquisition of territory do not the expediency amount to absolute necessity that without which the government itself can not be perpetuate the war continue in consider the policy to be adopt for suppress the insurrection i have be anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle i have therefore in every case think it proper to keep the integrity of the union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our pan leave all question which be not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the legislature in the exercise of my good discretion i have adhere to the blockade of the port hold by the insurgent instead of put in force by proclamation the law of congress enact .at the late session for close those port so also obey the dictate of prudence as well as the obligation of law instead of transcend i have adhere to the act of congress to confiscate property use for insurrectionary purpose if a new law upon the same subject shall be propose its propriety will be duly consider the union must be preserve and hence all indispensable mean must be employ we should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measure which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal be indispensable the inaugural address at the beginning of the administration and the message to congress at the late special session be both mainly devoted to the domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and consequent war have spring nothing now occur to add or subtract to or from the principle or general purpose state and express in those document the last ray of hope for preserve the union peaceably expire at the assault upon fort sumter and a general review of what have occur since may not be unprofitable what be painfully uncertain then be much well define and more distinct now and the progress of event be plainly in the right direction the insurgent confidently claim a strong support from north of mason and dixon 's line and the friend of the union be not free from apprehension on the point this however be soon settle definitely and on the right side south of the line noble little delaware lead off right from the first maryland be make to seem against the union our soldier be assault bridge be burn and railroad tear up within her limit and we be many day at one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to the capital now her bridge and railroad be repair and open to the government she already give seven regiment to the cause of the union and none to the enemy and her people at a regular election have sustain the union by a large majority and a large aggregate vote than they ever before give to any candidate or any question kentucky too for some time in doubt be now decidedly and i think unchangeably range on the side of the union missouri be comparatively quiet and i believe can not again be overrun by the insurrectionist these three states of maryland kentucky and missouri neither of which would promise a single soldier at first have now an aggregate of not less than 40,000 in the field for the union while of their citizen certainly not more than a third of that number and they of doubtful whereabout and doubtful existence be in arm against we after a somewhat bloody struggle of month winter close on the union people of western virginia leave they master of their own country an insurgent force of about 1,500 for month dominate the narrow peninsular region constitute the county of accomac and northampton and know as eastern shore of virginia together with some contiguous part of maryland have lay down their arm and the people there have renew their allegiance to and accept the protection of the old flag this leave no armed insurrectionist north of the potomac or east of the chesapeake also we have obtain a footing at each of the isolated point on the southern coast of hatteras port royal tybee island near savannah and ship island and we likewise have some general account of popular movement in behalf of the union in north carolina and tennessee these thing demonstrate that the cause of the union be advance steadily and certainly southward since your last adjournment lieutenant general scott have retire from the head of the army during his long life the nation have not be unmindful of his merit yet on call to mind how faithfully ably and brilliantly he have serve the country from a time far back in our history when few of the now live have be bear and thenceforward continually i can not but think we be still his debtor i submit therefore for your consideration what further mark of recognition be due to he and to ourselves as a grateful people with the retirement of general scott come the executive duty of appoint in his stead a general in chief of the army it be a fortunate circumstance that neither in council nor country be there so far as i know any difference of opinion as to the proper person to be select the retire chief repeatedly express his judgment in favor of general mcclellan for the position and in this the nation seem to give a unanimous concurrence the designation of general mcclellan be therefore in considerable degree the selection of the country as well as of the executive and hence there be well reason to hope there will be give he the confidence and cordial support thus by fair implication promise and without which he can not with so full efficiency serve the country it have be say that one bad general be well than two good one and the saying be true if take to mean no more than that an army be well direct by a single mind though inferior than by two superior one at variance and cross purpose with each other and the same be true in all joint operation wherein those engage can have none but a common end in view and can differ only as to the choice of mean in a storm at sea no one on board can wish the ship to sink and yet not unfrequently all go down together because too many will direct and no single mind can be allow to control it continue to develop that the insurrection be largely if not exclusively a war upon the first principle of popular government the right of the people conclusive evidence of this be find in the most grave and maturely consider public document as well as in the general tone of the insurgent in those document we find the abridgment of the exist right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officer except the legislative boldly advocate with labored argument to prove that large control of the people in government be the source of all political evil monarchy itself be sometimes hint at as a possible refuge from the power of the people in my present position i could scarcely be justify be i to omit raise a warning voice against this approach of return despotism it be not need nor fitting here that a general argument should be make in favor of popular institution but there be one point with its connection not so hackneyed as most other to which i ask a brief attention it be the effort to place capital on an equal footing with if not above labor in the structure of government it be assume that labor be available only in connection with capital that nobody labor unless somebody else own capital somehow by the use of it induce he to labor this assume it be next consider whether it be good that capital shall hire laborer and thus induce they to work by their own consent or buy they and drive they to it without their consent having proceed so far it be naturally conclude that all laborer be either hire laborer or what we call slave and far it be assume that whoever be once a hire laborer be fix in that condition for life now there be no such relation between capital and labor as assume nor be there any such thing as a free man be fix for life in the condition of a hire laborer both these assumption be false and all inference from they be groundless labor be prior to and independent of capital capital be only the fruit of labor and could never have exist if labor have not first exist labor be the superior of capital and deserve much the high consideration capital have its right which be as worthy of protection as any other right nor be it deny that there be and probably always will be a relation between labor and capital produce mutual benefit the error be in assume that the whole labor of community exist within that relation a few man own capital and that few avoid labor themselves and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for they a large majority belong to neither class neither work for other nor have other work for they in most of the southern states a majority of the whole people of all color be neither slave nor master while in the northern a large majority be neither hirer nor hire man with their family wife son and daughter work for themselves on their farm in their house and in their shop take the whole product to themselves and ask no favor of capital on the one hand nor of hire laborer or slave on the other it be not forget that a considerable number of person mingle their own labor with capital that is they labor with their own hand and also buy or hire other to labor for they but this be only a mixed and not a distinct class no principle state be disturb by the existence of this mixed class again as have already be say there be not of necessity any such thing as the free hire laborer be fix to that condition for life many independent man everywhere in these state a few year back in their life be hire laborer the prudent penniless beginner in the world labor for wage awhile save a surplus with which to buy tool or land for himself then labor on his own account another while and at length hire another new beginner to help he this be the just and generous and prosperous system which open the way to all give hope to all and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all no man live be more worthy to be trust than those who toil up from poverty none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly earn let they beware of surrender a political power which they already possess and which if surrender will surely be use to close the door of advancement against such as they and to fix new disability and burden upon they till all of liberty shall be lose from the first taking of our national census to the last be seventy year and we find our population at the end of the period eight time as great as it be at the beginning the increase of those other thing which man deem desirable have be even great we thus have at one view what the popular principle apply to government through the machiney of the states and the union have produce in a give time and also what if firmly maintain it promise for the future there be already among we those who if the union be preserve will live to see it contain 250,000,000 the struggle of to day be not altogether for to day it be for a vast future also with a reliance on providence all the more firm and earnest let we proceed in the great task which event have devolve upon we
fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives

 since your last annual assemble another year of health and bountiful harvest have pass and while it have not please the almighty to bless we with a return of peace we can but press on guide by the good light he give we trust that in his own good time and wise way all will yet be well

 the correspondence touch foreign affair which have take place during the last year be herewith submit in virtual compliance with a request to that effect make by the house of representatives near the close of the last session of congress if the condition of our relation with other nation be less gratifying than it have usually be at former period it be certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distract as we be might reasonably have apprehend in the month of june last there be some ground to expect that the maritime power which at the beginning of our domestic difficulty so unwisely and unnecessarily as we think recognize the insurgent as a belligerent would soon recede from that position which have prove only less injurious to themselves than to our own country but the temporary reverse which afterwards befell the national arm and which be exaggerate by our own disloyal citizen abroad have hitherto delay that act of simple justice

 the civil war which have so radically change for the moment the occupation and habit of the american people have necessarily disturb the social condition and affect very deeply the prosperity of the nation with which we have carry on a commerce that have be steadily increase throughout a period of half a century it have at the same time excite political ambition and apprehension which have produce a profound agitation throughout the civilized world in this unusual agitation we have forbear from take part in any controversy between foreign state and between party or faction in such state we have attempt no propagandism and acknowledge no revolution but we have leave to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affair our struggle have be of course contemplate by foreign nation with reference less to its own merit than to its suppose and often exaggerated effect and consequence result to those nation themselves nevertheless complaint on the part of this government even if it be just would certainly be unwise the treaty with great britain for the suppression of the slave trade have be put into operation with a good prospect of complete success it be an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of her majesty&#39;s government have be mark with a jealous respect for the authority of the united states and the right of their moral and loyal citizen

 the convention with hanover for the abolition of the stade due have be carry into full effect under the act of congress for that purpose a blockade of 3,000 mile of seacoast could not be establish and vigorously enforce in a season of great commercial activity like the present without commit occasional mistake and inflict unintentional injury upon foreign nation and their subject a civil war occur in a country where foreigner reside and carry on trade under treaty stipulation be necessarily fruitful of complaint of the violation of neutral right all such collision tend to excite misapprehension and possibly to produce mutual reclamation between nation which have a common interest in preserve peace and friendship in clear case of these kind i have so far as possible heard and redress complaint which have be present by friendly power there be still however a large and an augment number of doubtful case upon which the government be unable to agree with the government whose protection be demand by the claimant there be moreover many case in which the united states or their citizen suffer wrong from the naval or military authority of foreign nation which the government of those state be not at once prepared to redress i have propose to some of the foreign state thus interested mutual convention to examine and adjust such complaint this proposition have be make especially to great britain to france to spain and to prussia in each case it have be kindly receive but have not yet be formally adopt

 i deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owner of the norwegian bark admiral p. tordenskiold which vessel be in may 1861 prevent by the commander of the blockade force off charleston from leave that port with cargo notwithstanding a similar privilege have shortly before be grant to an english vessel i have direct the secretary of state to cause the paper in the case to be communicate to the proper committee

 application have be make to i by many free americans of african descent to favor their emigration with a view to such colonization as be contemplate in recent act of congress other party at home and abroad some from interested motive other upon patriotic consideration and still other influence by philanthropic sentiment have suggest similar measure while on the other hand several of the spanish american republics have protest against the sending of such colony to their respective territory under these circumstance i have decline to move any such colony to any state without first obtain the consent of its government with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrant in all the right of freeman and i have at the same time offer to the several states situate within the tropics or have colony there to negotiate with they subject to the advice and consent of the senate to favor the voluntary emigration of person of that class to their respective territory upon condition which shall be equal just and humane liberia and hayti be as yet the only country to which colonist of african descent from here could go with certainty of be receive and adopt as citizen and i regret to say such person contemplate colonization do not seem so willing to migrate to those country as to some other nor so willing as i think their interest demand i believe however opinion among they in this respect be improve and that ere long there will be an augmented and considerable migration to both these country from the united states

 the new commercial treaty between the united states and the sultan of turkey have be carry into execution

 a commercial and consular treaty have be negotiate subject to the senate&#39;s consent with liberia and a similar negotiation be now pende with the republic of hayti a considerable improvement of the national commerce be expect to result from these measure our relation with great britain france spain portugal russia prussia denmark sweden austria the netherlands italy rome and the other european states remain undisturbed very favorable relation also continue to be maintain with turkey morocco china and japan

 during the last year there have not only be no change of our previous relation with the independent states of our own continent but more friendly sentiment than have heretofore exist be believe to be entertain by these neighbor whose safety and progress be so intimately connect with our own this statement especially apply to mexico nicaragua costa rica honduras peru and chile the commission under the convention with the republic of new granada close its session without having audit and pass upon all the claim which be submit to it a proposition be pende to revive the convention that it may be able to do more complete justice the joint commission between the united states and the republic of costa rica have complete its labor and submit its report i have favor the project for connect the united states with europe by an atlantic telegraph and a similar project to extend the telegraph from san francisco to connect by a pacific telegraph with the line which be be extend across the russian empire the territories of the united states with unimportant exception have remain undisturbed by the civil war and they be exhibit such evidence of prosperity as justifie an expectation that some of they will soon be in a condition to be organize as states and be constitutionally admit into the federal union

 the immense mineral resource of some of those territories ought to be develop as rapidly as possible every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenue of the government and diminish the burden of the people it be worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measure to promote that end can not be adopt the mean which suggest itself as most likely to be effective be a scientific exploration of the mineral region in those territories with a view to the publication of its result at home and in foreign country result which can not fail to be auspicious

 the condition of the finance will claim your most diligent consideration the vast expenditure incident to the military and naval operation require for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto be meet with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstance and the public credit have be fully maintain the continuance of the war however and the increase disbursement make necessary by the augment force now in the field demand your good reflection as to the good mode of provide the necessary revenue without injury to business and with the least possible burden upon labor

 the suspension of specie payment by the bank soon after the commencement of your last session make large issue of united states note unavoidable in no other way could the payment of the troop and the satisfaction of other just demand be so economically or so well provide for the judicious legislation of congress secure the receivability of these note for loan and internal duty and make they a legal tender for other debt have make they an universal currency and have satisfy partially at least and for the time the long feel want of an uniform circulate medium save thereby to the people immense sum in discount and exchange

 a return to specie payment however at the early period compatible with due regard to all interest concern should ever be keep in view fluctuation in the value of currency be always injurious and to reduce these fluctuation to the low possible point will always be a lead purpose in wise legislation convertibility prompt and certain convertibility into coin be generally acknowledge to be the good and sure safeguard against they and it be extremely doubtful whether a circulation of united states note payable in coin and sufficiently large for the want of the people can be permanently usefully and safely maintain

 be there then any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public want can be make and the great advantage of a safe and uniform currency secure

 i know of none which promise so certain result and be at the same time so unobjectionable as the organization of banking association under a general act of congress well guard in its provision to such association the government might furnish circulate note on the security of united states bond deposit in the treasury these note prepare under the supervision of proper officer be uniform in appearance and security and convertible always into coin would at once protect labor against the evil of a vicious currency and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchange

 a moderate reservation from the interest on the bond would compensate the united states for the preparation and distribution of the note and a general supervision of the system and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employ as security the public credit moreover would be greatly improve and the negotiation of new loan greatly facilitate by the steady market demand for government bond which the adoption of the propose system would create it be an additional recommendation of the measure of considerable weight in my judgment that it would reconcile as far as possible all exist interest by the opportunity offer to exist institution to reorganize under the act substitute only the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various circulation secure and unsecured now issue by they

 the report of the secretaries of war and of the navy be herewith transmit these report though lengthy be scarcely more than brief abstract of the very numerous and extensive transaction and operation conduct through those department nor could i give a summary of they here upon any principle which would admit of its be much short than the report themselves i therefore content myself with lay the report before you and ask your attention to they

 it give i pleasure to report a decide improvement in the financial condition of the post office department as compare with several precede year the receipt for the fiscal year 1861 amount to $ 8,349,296.40 which embrace the revenue from all the states of the union for three quarter of that year notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so call secede states during the last fiscal year the increase of the correspondence of the loyal states have be sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $ 8,299,820.90 be only $ 50,000 less than be derive from all the states of the union during the previous year the expenditure show a still more favorable result the amount expend in 1861 be $ 13,606,759.11 for the last year the amount have be reduce to $ 11,125,364.13 show a decrease of about $ 2,481,000 in the expenditure as compare with the precede year and about $ 3,750,000 as compare with the fiscal year 1860 the deficiency in the department for the previous year be $ 4,551,966.98 for the last fiscal year it be reduce to $ 2,112,814.57 these favorable result be in part owe to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary states and in part to a careful review of all expenditure in that department in the interest of economy the efficiency of the postal service it be believe have also be much improve the postmaster general have also open a correspondence through the department of state with foreign government propose a convention of postal representative for the purpose of simplify the rate of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mail this proposition equally important to our adopt citizen and to the commercial interest of this country have be favorably entertain and agree to by all the government from whom reply have be receive

 i ask the attention of congress to the suggestion of the postmaster general in his report respect the further legislation require in his opinion for the benefit of the postal service

 the secretary of the interior report as follow in regard to the public land

 the public land have cease to be a source of revenue from the 1st july 1861 to the 30th september 1862 the entire cash receipt from the sale of land be $ 137,476.26&mdash;a sum much less than the expense of our land system during the same period the homestead law which will take effect on the 1st of january next offer such inducement to settler that sale for cash can not be expect to an extent sufficient to meet the expense of the general land office and the cost of survey and bring the land into market the discrepancy between the sum here state as arise from the sale of the public land and the sum derive from the same source as report from the treasury department arise as i understand from the fact that the period of time though apparently be not really coincident at the beginning point the treasury report include a considerable sum now which have previously be report from the interior sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derive from the three month now report upon by the interior and not by the treasury

 the indian tribe upon our frontier have during the past year manifest a spirit of insubordination and at several point have engage in open hostility against the white settlement in their vicinity the tribe occupy the indian country south of kansas renounce their allegiance to the united states and enter into treaty with the insurgent those who remain loyal to the united states be drive from the country the chief of the cherokees have visit this city for the purpose of restore the former relation of the tribe with the united states he allege that they be constrain by superior force to enter into treaty with the insurgent and that the united states neglect to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulation require

 in the month of august last the sioux indians in minnesota attack the settlement in their vicinity with extreme ferocity kill indiscriminately man woman and child this attack be wholly unexpected and therefore no mean of defense have be prod it be estimate that not less than 800 person be kill by the indians and a large amount of property be destroy how this outbreak be induce be not definitely know and suspicion which may be unjust need not to be state information be receive by the indian bureau from different source about the time hostility be commence that a simultaneous attack be to be make upon the white settlement by all the tribe between the mississippi river and the rocky mountains the state of minnesota have suffer great injury from this indian war a large portion of her territory have be depopulate and a severe loss have be sustain by the destruction of property the people of that state manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribe beyond the limit of the state as a guaranty against future hostility the commissioner of indian affairs will furnish full detail i submit for your especial consideration whether our indian system shall not be remodel many wise and good man have impress i with the belief that this can be profitably do

 i submit a statement of the proceeding of commissioner which show the progress that have be make in the enterprise of construct the pacific railroad and this suggest the early completion of this road and also the favorable action of congress upon the project now pende before they for enlarge the capacity of the great canal in new york and illinois as be of vital and rapidly increase importance to the whole nation and especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be notice at some great length i purpose having prepare and lay before you at an early day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this subject the military and commercial importance of enlarge the illinois and michigan canal and improve the illinois river be present in the report of colonel webster to the secretary of war and now transmit to congress i respectfully ask attention to it

 to carry out the provision of the act of congress of the 15th of may last i have cause the department of agriculture of the united states to be organize

 the commissioner inform i that within the period of a few month this department have establish an extensive system of correspondence and exchange both at home and abroad which promise to effect highly beneficial result in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvement in agriculture in the introduction of new product and in the collection of the agricultural statistic of the different states

 also that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seed cereal plant and cutting and have already publish and liberally diffuse much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report which will in due time be furnish embrace some valuable test in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory

 the creation of this department be for the more immediate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizen and i trust that the liberal basis upon which it have be organize will not only meet your approbation but that it will realize at no distant day all the fond anticipation of its most sanguine friend and become the fruitful source of advantage to all our people

 on the 22d day of september last a proclamation be issue by the executive a copy of which be herewith submit in accordance with the purpose express in the second paragraph of that paper i now respectfully recall your attention to what may be call compensate emancipation

 a nation may be say to consist of its territory its people and its law the territory be the only part which be of certain durability one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth forever it be of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever endure part that portion of the earth&#39;s surface which be own and inhabit by the people of the united states be well adapt to be the home of one national family and it be not well adapt for two or more its vast extent and its variety of climate and production be of advantage in this age for one people whatever they might have be in former age steam telegraphs and intelligence have bring these to be an advantageous combination for one united people

 in the inaugural address i briefly point out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the difference between the people of the two section i do so in language which i can not improve and which therefore i beg to repeat

 one section of our country believe slavery be right and ought to be extend while the other believe it be wrong and ought not to be extend this be the only substantial dispute the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade be each as well enforce perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly support the law itself the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both case and a few break over in each this i think can not be perfectly cure and it would be bad in both case after the separation of the section than before the foreign slave trade now imperfectly suppress would be ultimately revive without restriction in one section while fugitive slave now only partially surrender would not be surrender at all by the other physically speak we can not separate we can not remove our respective section from each other nor build an impassable wall between they a husband and wife may be divorce and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different part of our country can not do this they can not but remain face to face and intercourse either amicable or hostile must continue between they be it possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before can alien make treaty easy than friend can make law can treaty be more faithfully enforce between alien than law can among friend suppose you go to war you can not fight always and when after much loss on both side and no gain on either you cease fighting the identical old question as to term of intercourse be again upon you

 there be no line straight or crooked suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide trace through from east to west upon the line between the free and slave country and we shall find a little more than one third of its length be river easy to be cross and populate or soon to be populate thickly upon both side while nearly all its remain length be merely surveyors&#39 line over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence no part of this line can be make any more difficult to pass by write it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary the fact of separation if it come give up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive slave clause along with all other constitutional obligation upon the section secede from while i should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be make to take its place

 but there be another difficulty the great interior region bound east by the alleghanies north by the british dominion west by the rocky mountains and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meet and which include part of virginia part of tennessee all of kentucky ohio indiana michigan wisconsin illinois missouri kansas iowa minnesota and the territories of dakota nebraska and part of colorado already have above 10,000,000 people and will have 50,000,000 within fifty year if not prevent by any political folly or mistake it contain more than one third of the country own by the united states certainly more than 1,000,000 square mile once half as populous as massachusetts already be it would have more than 75,000,000 people a glance at the map show that territorially speak it be the great body of the republic the other part be but marginal border to it the magnificent region slope west from the rocky mountains to the pacific be the deep and also the rich in undeveloped resource in the production of provision grain grass and all which proceed from they this great interior region be naturally one of the most important in the world ascertain from the statistic the small proportion of the region which have as yet be bring into cultivation and also the large and rapidly increase amount of its product and we shall be overwhelm with the magnitude of the prospect present and yet this region have no seacoast touch no ocean anywhere as part of one nation its people now find and may forever find their way to europe by new york to south america and africa by new orleans and to asia by san francisco but separate our common country into two nation as design by the present rebellion and every man of this great interior region be thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlet not perhaps by a physical barrier but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulation

 and this be true wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fix place it between the now free and slave country or place it south of kentucky or north of ohio and still the truth remain that none south of it can trade to any port or place north of it and none north of it can trade to any port or place south of it except upon term dictate by a government foreign to they these outlet east west and south be indispensable to the well being of the people inhabit and to inhabit this vast interior region which of the three may be the good be no proper question all be well than either and all of right belong to that people and to their successor forever true to themselves they will not ask where a line of separation shall be but will vow rather that there shall be no such line nor be the marginal region less interested in these communication to and through they to the great outside world they too and each of they must have access to this egypt of the west without pay toll at the crossing of any national boundary

 our national strife spring not from our permanent part not from the land we inhabit not from our national homestead there be no possible severing of this but would multiply and not mitigate evil among we in all its adaptation and aptitude it demand union and abhor separation in fact it would ere long force reunion however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost our strife pertain to ourselves&mdash;to the pass generation of men&mdash;and it can without convulsion be hush forever with the passing of one generation

 in this view i recommend the adoption of the follow resolution and article amendatory to the constitution of the united states

 resolve by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assemble two third of both houses
 concur that the follow article be propose to the legislature or convention of the several states as amendment to the
 constitution of the united states all or any of which article when ratify by three fourth of the say legislature or convention to be
 valid as part or part of the said constitution viz

 art.&mdash every state wherein slavery now exist which shall abolish the same therein at any time or time before the 1st day of january a.d. 1900 shall receive compensation from the united states as follow to wit

 the president of the united states shall deliver to every such state bond of the united states bear interest at the rate of per cent per annum to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of____for each slave show to have be therein by the eighth census of the united states say bond to be deliver to such state by installment or in one parcel at the completion of the abolishment accordingly as the same shall have be gradual or at one time within such state and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid any state having receive bond as aforesaid and afterwards reintroduce or tolerate slavery therein shall refund to the united states the bond so receive or the value thereof and all interest pay thereon

 art&mdash;all slave who shall have enjoy actual freedom by the chance of the war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever free but all owner of such who shall not have be disloyal shall be compensate for they at the same rate as be provide for states adopt abolishment of slavery but in such way that no slave shall be twice account for

 art.&mdash;congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for colonize free colored person with their own consent at any place or place without the united states

 i beg indulgence to discuss these propose article at some length without slavery the rebellion could never have exist without slavery it could not continue

 among the friend of the union there be great diversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the african race amongst we some would perpetuate slavery some would abolish it suddenly and without compensation some would abolish it gradually and with compensation some would remove the freed people from we and some would retain they with we and there be yet other minor diversity because of these diversity we waste much strength in struggle among ourselves by mutual concession we should harmonize and act together this would be compromise but it would be compromise among the friend and not with the enemy of the union these article be intend to embody a plan of such mutual concession if the plan shall be adopt it be assume that emancipation will follow at least in several of the states

 as to the first article the main point be first the emancipation secondly the length of time for consummate it thirty seven year and thirdly the compensation

 the emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocate of perpetual slavery but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction the time spare both race from the evil of sudden derangement&mdash;in fact from the necessity of any derangement&mdash;while most of those whose habitual course of thought will be disturb by the measure will have pass away before its consummation they will never see it another class will hail the prospect of emancipation but will deprecate the length of time they will feel that it give too little to the now live slave but it really give they much it save they from the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in locality where their number be very great and it give the inspire assurance that their posterity shall be free forever the plan leave to each state choose to act under it to abolish slavery now or at the end of the century or at any intermediate time or by degree extend over the whole or any part of the period and it oblige no two state to proceed alike it also provide for compensation and generally the mode of make it this it would seem must far mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery and especially of those who be to receive the compensation doubtless some of those who be to pay and not to receive will object yet the measure be both just and economical in a certain sense the liberation of slave be the destruction of property&mdash;property acquire by descent or by purchase the same as any other property it be no less true for having be often say that the people of the south be not more responsible for the original introduction of this property than be the people of the north and when it be remember how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar and share the profit of deal in they it may not be quite safe to say that the south have be more responsible than the north for its continuance if then for a common object this property be to be sacrifice be it not just that it be do at a common charge

 and if with less money or money more easily pay we can preserve the benefit of the union by this mean than we can by the war alone be it not also economical to do it let we consider it then let we ascertain the sum we have expend in the war since compensate emancipation be propose last march and consider whether if that measure have be promptly accept by even some of the slave states the same sum would not have do more to close the war than have be otherwise do if so the measure would save money and in that view would be a prudent and economical measure certainly it be not so easy to pay something as it be to pay nothing but it be easy to pay a large sum than it be to pay a large one and it be easy to pay any sum when we be able than it be to pay it before we be able the war require large sum and require they at once the aggregate sum necessary for compensate emancipation of course would be large but it would require no ready cash nor the bond even any fast than the emancipation progress this might not and probably would not close before the end of the thirty seven year at that time we shall probably have a hundred million of people to share the burden instead of thirty one million as now and not only so but the increase of our population may be expect to continue for a long time after that period as rapidly as before because our territory will not have become full i do not state this inconsiderately at the same ratio of increase which we have maintain on an average from our first national census in 1790 until that of 1860 we should in 1900 have a population of 103,208,415 and why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period our abundant room our broad national homestead be our ample resource be our territory as limit as be the british isles very certainly our population could not expand as state instead of receive the foreign bear as now we should be compel to send part of the native bear away but such be not our condition we have 2,963,000 square mile europe have 3,800,000 with a population average 73 1/3 person to the square mile why may not our country at some time average as many be it less fertile have it more waste surface by mountain river lake desert or other cause be it inferior to europe in any natural advantage if then we be at some time to be as populous as europe how soon as to when this may be we can judge by the past and the present as to when it will be if ever depend much on whether we maintain the union several of our states be already above the average of europe 73 1/3 to the square mile massachusetts have 157 rhode island 133 connecticut 99 new york and new jersey each 80 also two other great states pennsylvania and ohio be not far below the former have 63 and the latter 59 the state already above the european average except new york have increase in as rapid a ratio since pass that point as ever before while no one of they be equal to some other part of our country in natural capacity for sustain a dense population

 take the nation in the aggregate and we find its population and ratio of increase for the several decennial period to be as follow

 year population ratio of increase percent
 1790 3,929,827
 1800 5,304,937 35.02
 1810 7,239,814 36.45
 1820 9,638,131 36.45
 1830 12,866,020 33.49
 1840 17,069,453 32.67
 1850 23,191,876 35.87
 1860 31,443,790 35.58

 this show an average decennial increase of 34.60 per cent in population through the seventy year from our first to our last census vet take it be see that the ratio of increase at no one of these seven period be either 2 per cent below or 2 per cent above the average thus show how inflexible and consequently how reliable the law of increase in our case be assume that it will continue it give the follow result

 year population
 1870 42,323,341
 1880 56,967,216
 1890 76,677,872
 1900 103,208,415
 1910 138,918,526
 1920 186,984,335
 1930 251,680,914

 these figure show that our country may be as populous as europe now be at some point between 1920 and 1930&mdash;say about 1925&mdash;our territory at 73 1/3 person to the square mile be of capacity to contain 217,186,000

 and we will reach this too if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance by the folly and evil of disunion or by long and exhaust war spring from the only great element of national discord among we while it can not be foresee exactly how much one huge example of secession breed less one indefinitely would retard population civilization and prosperity no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious

 the propose emancipation would shorten the war perpetuate peace insure this increase of population and proportionately the wealth of the country with these we should pay all the emancipation would cost together with our other debt easy than we should pay our other debt without it if we have allow our old national debt to run at 6 per cent per annum simple interest from the end of our revolutionary struggle until to day without pay anything on either principal or interest each man of we would owe less upon that debt now than each man owe upon it then and this because our increase of man through the whole period have be great than 6 per cent&mdash;ha run fast than the interest upon the debt thus time alone relieve a debtor nation so long as its population increase fast than unpaid interest accumulate on its debt

 this fact would be no excuse for delay payment of what be justly due but it show the great importance of time in this connection&mdash;the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number 100,000,000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now when we number but 31,000,000 in a word it show that a dollar will be much hard to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the propose plan and then the latter will cost no blood no precious life it will be a saving of both

 as to the second article i think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of person therein contemplated some of they doubtless in the property sense belong to loyal owner and hence provision be make in this article for compensate such the third article relate to the future of the freed people it do not oblige but merely authorize congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent this ought not to be regard as objectionable on the one hand or on the other insomuch as it come to nothing unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deport and the american voter through their representative in congress

 i can not make it well know than it already be that i strongly favor colonization and yet i wish to say there be an objection urge against free colored person remain in the country which be largely imaginary if not sometimes malicious

 it be insist that their presence would injure and displace white labor and white laborer if there ever could be a proper time for mere catch argument that time surely be not now in time like the present man should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity be it true then that colored people can displace any more white labor by be free than by remain slave if they stay in their old place they jostle no white laborer if they leave their old place they leave they open to white laborer logically there be neither more nor less of it emancipation even without deportation would probably enhance the wage of white labor and very surely would not reduce they thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed&mdash;the freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it and very probably for a time would do less leave an increase part to white laborer bring their labor into great demand and consequently enhance the wage of it with deportation even to a limited extent enhance wage to white labor be mathematically certain labor be like any other commodity in the market&mdash;increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it reduce the supply of black labor by colonize the black laborer out of the country and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wage of white labor

 but it be dread that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the whole land be they not already in the land will liberation make they any more numerous equally distribute among the white of the whole country and there would be but one color to seven white could the one in any way greatly disturb the seven there be many community now have more than one free colored person to seven white and this without any apparent consciousness of evil from it the district of columbia and the states of maryland and delaware be all in this condition the district have more than one free color to six white and yet in its frequent petition to congress i believe it have never present the presence of free colored person as one of its grievance but why should emancipation south send the free people north people of any color seldom run unless there be something to run from hertofore color people to some extent have flee north from bondage and now perhaps from both bondage and destitution but if gradual emancipation and deportation be adopt they will have neither to flee from their old master will give they wage at least until new laborer can be procure and the freedman in turn will gladly give their labor for the wage till new home can be find for they in congenial clime and with people of their own blood and race this proposition can be trust on the mutual interest involve and in any event can not the north decide for itself whether to receive they

 again as practice prove more than theory in any case have there be any irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of slavery in this district last spring

 what i have say of the proportion of free colored person to the white in the district be from the census of 1860 have no reference to person call contraband nor to those make free by the act of congress abolish slavery here

 the plan consist of these article be recommend not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accept without its adoption

 nor will the war nor proceeding under the proclamation of september 22 1862 be stay because of the recommendation of this plan its timely adoption i doubt not would bring restoration and thereby stay both

 and notwithstanding this plan the recommendation that congress provide by law for compensate any state which may adopt emancipation before this plan shall have be act upon be hereby earnestly renew such would be only an advance part of the plan and the same argument apply to both

 this plan be recommend as a means not in exclusion of but additional to all other for restore and preserve the national authority throughout the union the subject be present exclusively in its economical aspect the plan would i be confident secure peace more speedily and maintain it more permanently than can be do by force alone while all it would cost consider amount and manner of payment and time of payment would be easier pay than will be the additional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force it be much very much that it would cost no blood at all

 the plan be propose as permanent constitutional law it can not become such without the concurrence of first two third of congress and afterwards three fourth of the states the requisite three fourth of the states will necessarily include seven of the slave states their concurrence if obtain will give assurance of their severally adopt emancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional term this assurance would end the struggle now and save the union forever

 i do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper address to the congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation nor do i forget that some of you be my senior nor that many of you have more experience than i in the conduct of public affair yet i trust that in view of the great responsibility rest upon i you will perceive no want of respect to yourself in any undue earnestness i may seem to display

compromise embrace the maintenance of the union be now possible all i learn lead to a directly opposite belief the strength of the rebellion be its military its army that army dominate all the country and all the people within its range any offer of term make by any man or man within that range in opposition to that army be simply nothing for the present because such man or man have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise if one be make with they to illustrate suppose refugee from the south and peace man of the north get together in convention and frame and proclaim a compromise embrace a restoration of the union in what way can that compromise be use to keep lee 's army out of pennsylvania meade 's army can keep lee 's army out of pennsylvania and i think can

tax to buy negro but i have not ask you to be tax to buy negro except in such way as to save you from great taxation to save the union exclusively by other mean you dislike the emancipation proclamation and perhaps would have it retract you say it be unconstitutional i think differently i think the constitution invest its commander in chief with the law of war in time of war the most

one hundred day of which pass under an explicit notice that it be come unless avert by those in revolt return to their allegiance the war have certainly progress as favorably for we since the issue of

whenever you shall have conquer all resistance to the union if i shall urge you to continue fight it will be an apt time then for you to declare you will not fight to free negro i think that in your struggle for the union to whatever extent the negro should cease help the enemy to that extent it weaken the enemy in his resistance to you do you think differently i think that whatever negro can be get to do as soldier leave just so much less for white soldier to do in save the union do it appear otherwise to you but negro like other people act upon motive why should they do any thing for we if

four score and seven year ago our father bring forth on this continent a new nation conceive in liberty and dedicate to the proposition that all man be create equal now we be engage in a great civil war test whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure we be meet on a great battle field of that war we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here give their life that that nation might live it be altogether fitting and proper that we should do this but in a large sense we can not dedicate&mdash;we can not consecrate&mdash;we can not hallow&mdash;this ground the brave man living and dead who struggle here have consecrate it far above our poor power to add or detract the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they do here it be for we the living rather to be dedicate here to the unfinished work which they who fight here have thus far so nobly advanced it be rather for we to be here dedicate to the great task remain before us&mdash;that from these honor dead we take increase devotion to that cause for which they give the last full measure of devotion&mdash;that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have die in vain&mdash;that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom&mdash;and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives another year of health and of sufficiently abundant harvest have pass for these and especially for the improved condition of our national affair our renew and profoundest gratitude to god be due we remain in peace and friendship with foreign power the effort of disloyal citizen of the united states to involve we in foreign war to aid an inexcusable insurrection have be unavaile her britannic majesty 's government as be justly expect have exercise their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expedition from british port the emperor of france have by a like proceeding promptly vindicate the neutrality which he proclaim at the beginning of the contest question of great intricacy and importance have arise out of the blockade and other belligerent operation between the government and several of the maritime power but they have be discuss and as far as be possible accommodate in a spirit of frankness justice and mutual good will it be especially gratify that our prize court by the impartiality of their adjudication have command the respect and confidence of maritime power the supplemental treaty between the united states and great britain for the suppression of the african slave trade make on the 17th day of february last have be duly ratify and carry into execution it be believe that so far as american port and american citizen be concerned that inhuman and odious traffic have be bring to an end i shall submit for the consideration of the senate a convention for the adjustment of possessory claim in washington territory arise out of the treaty of the 15th june 1846 between the united states and great britain and which have be the source of some disquiet among the citizen of that now rapidly improve part of the country a novel and important question involve the extent of the maritime jurisdiction of spain in the water which surround the island of cuba have be debate without reach an agreement and it be propose in an amicable spirit to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power a convention for that purpose will be submit to the senate i have think it proper subject to the approval of the senate to concur with the interested commercial power in an arrangement for the liquidation of the scheldt due upon the principle which have be heretofore adopt in regard to the impost upon navigation in the water of denmark the long pende controversy between this government and that of chile touch the seizure at sitana in peru by chilean officer of a large amount in treasure belong to citizen of the united states have be bring to a close by the award of his majesty the king of the belgians to whose arbitration the question be refer by the party the subject be thoroughly and patiently examine by that justly respected magistrate and although the sum award to the claimant may not have be as large as they expect there be no reason to distrust the wisdom of his majesty 's decision that decision be promptly comply with by chile when intelligence in regard to it reach that country the joint commission under the act of the last session for carry into effect the convention with peru on the subject of claim have be organize at lima and be engage in the business intrust to it difficulty concern interoceanic transit through nicaragua be in course of amicable adjustment in conformity with principle set forth in my last annual message i have receive a representative from the united states of colombia and have accredit a minister to that republic incident occur in the progress of our civil war have force upon my attention the uncertain state of international question touch the right of foreigner in this country and of united states citizen abroad in regard to some government these right be at least partially define by treaty in no instance however be it expressly stipulate that in the event of civil war a foreigner reside in this country within the line of the insurgent be to be exempt from the rule which class he as a belligerent in whose behalf the government or his country can not expect any privilege or immunitie distinct from that character i regret to say however that such claim have be put forward and in some instance in behalf of foreigner who have live in the united states the great part of their life there be reason to believe that many person bear in foreign country who have declare their intention to become citizen or who have be fully naturalize have evade the military duty require of they by deny the fact and thereby throw upon the government the burden of proof it have be find difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want of guide to the proper source of information these might be supply by require clerk of court where declaration of intention may be make or naturalization effect to send periodically list of the name of the person naturalize or declare their intention to become citizen to the secretary of the interior in whose department those name might be arrange and print for general information there be also reason to believe that foreigner frequently become citizen of the united states for the sole purpose of evade duty impose by the law of their native country to which on becoming naturalize here they at once repair and though never return to the united states they still claim the interposition of this government as citizen many altercation and great prejudice have heretofore arise out of this abuse it be therefore submit to your serious consideration it might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the united states reside abroad may claim the interposition of his government the right of suffrage have often be assume and exercise by alien under pretense of naturalization which they have disavow when draft into the military service i submit the expediency of such an amendment of the law as will make the fact of vote an estoppel against any plea of exemption from military service or other civil obligation on the ground of alienage in common with other western power our relation with japan have be bring into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of the empire to the enlightened and liberal policy of the tycoon design to bring the country into the society of nation it be hope although not with entire confidence that these difficulty may be peacefully overcome i ask your attention to the claim of the minister reside there for the damage he sustain in the destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at yedo satisfactory arrangement have be make with the emperor of russia which it be believe will result in effect a continuous line of telegraph through that empire from our pacific coast i recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an international telegraph across the atlantic ocean and also of a telegraph between this capital and the national fort along the atlantic seaboard and the gulf of mexico such communication establish with any reasonable outlay would be economical as well as effective aid to the diplomatic military and naval service the consular system of the united states under the enactment of the last congress begin to be self sustain and there be reason to hope that it may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue whenever peace be restore our minister abroad have be faithful in defend american right in protect commercial interest our consul have necessarily have to encounter increase labor and responsibility grow out of the war these they have for the most part meet and discharge with zeal and efficiency this acknowledgment justly include those consul who reside in morocco egypt turkey japan china and other oriental country be charge with complex function and extraordinary power the condition of the several organize territories be generally satisfactory although indian disturbance in new mexico have not be entirely suppress the mineral resource of colorado nevada idaho new mexico and arizona be prove far rich than have be heretofore understood i lie before you a communication on this subject from the governor of new mexico i again submit to your consideration the expediency of establish a system for the encouragement of immigration although this source of national wealth and strength be again flow with great freedom than for several year before the insurrection occur there be still a great deficiency of laborer in every field of industry especially in agriculture and in our mine as well of iron and coal as of the precious metal while the demand for labor be much increase here ten of thousand of person destitute of remunerative occupation be throng our foreign consulate and offer to emigrate to the united states if essential but very cheap assistance can be afford they it be easy to see that under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation be begin a new life this noble effort demand the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of the government injury unforeseen by the government and unintended may in some case have be inflict on the subject or citizen of foreign country both at sea and on land by person in the service of the united states as this government expect redress from other power when similar injury be inflict by person in their service upon citizen of the united states we must be prepare to do justice to foreigner if the exist judicial tribunal be inadequate to this purpose a special court may be authorize with power to hear and decide such claim of the character refer to as may have arise under treaty and the public law convention for adjust the claim by joint commission have be propose to some government but no definitive answer to the proposition have yet be receive from any in the course of the session i shall probably have occasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimant where decree of restitution have be render and damage award by admiralty court and in other case where this government may be acknowledge to be liable in principle and where the amount of that liability have be ascertain by an informal arbitration the proper officer of the treasury have deem themselves require by the law of the united states upon the subject to demand a tax upon the income of foreign consul in this country while such a demand may not in strictness be in derogation of public law or perhaps of any exist treaty between the united states and a foreign country the expediency of so far modify the act as to exempt from tax the income of such consul as be not citizen of the united states derive from the emolument of their office or from property not situate in the united states be submit to your serious consideration i make this suggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocate exempt our consul in all other country from taxation to the extent thus indicate the united states i think ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce the operation of the treasury during the last year have be successfully conduct the enactment by congress of a national banking law have prove a valuable support of the public credit and the general legislation in relation to loan have fully answer the expectation of its favorer some amendment may be require to perfect exist law but no change in their principle or general scope be believe to be need since these measure have be in operation all demand on the treasury include the pay of the army and navy have be promptly meet and fully satisfied no considerable body of troop it be believe be ever more amply provide and more liberally and punctually pay and it may be add that by no people be the burden incident to a great war ever more cheerfully bear the receipt during the year from all source include loan and balance in the treasury at its commencement be $ 901,125,674.86 and the aggregate disbursement $ 895,796,630.65 leave a balance on the 1st of july 1863 of $ 5,329,044.21 of the receipt there be derive from customs $ 69,059,642.40 from internal revenue $ 37,640,787.95 from direct tax $ 1,485,103.61 from land $ 167,617.17 from miscellaneous source $ 3,046,615.35 and from loan $ 776,682,361.57 make the aggregate $ 901,125,674.86 of the disbursement there be for the civil service $ 23,253,922.08 for pension and indians $ 4,216,520.79 for interest on public debt $ 24,729,846.51 for the war department $ 599,298,600.83 for the navy department $ 63,211,105.27 for payment of funded and temporary debt $ 181,086,635.07 make the aggregate $ 895,796,630.65 and leave the balance of $ 5,329,044.21 but the payment of funded and temporary debt having be make from money borrow during the year must be regard as merely nominal payment and the money borrow to make they as merely nominal receipt and their amount $ 181,086,635.07 should therefore be deduct both from receipt and disbursement this be do there remain as actual receipt $ 720,039,039.79 and the actual disbursement $ 714,709,995.58 leave the balance as already state the actual receipt and disbursement for the first quarter and the estimate receipt and disbursement for the remain three quarter of the current fiscal year 1864 will be show in detail by the report of the secretary of the treasury to which i invite your attention it be sufficient to say here that it be not believe that actual result will exhibit a state of the finance less favorable to the country than the estimate of that officer heretofore submit while it be confidently expect that at the close of the year both disbursement and debt will be find very considerably less than have be anticipate the report of the secretary of war be a document of great interest it consist of--1 the military operation of the year detail in the report of the general in chief 2 the organization of colored person into the war service 3 the exchange of prisoner fully set forth in the letter of general hitchcock 4 the operation under the act for enrol and call out the national force detail in the report of the provost marshal general 5 the organization of the invalid corps and 6 the operation of the several department of the quartermaster general commissary- general paymaster general chief of engineers chief of ordnance and surgeon general it have appear impossible to make a valuable summary of this report except such as would be too extended for this place and hence i content myself by ask your careful attention to the report itself the duty devolve on the naval branch of the service during the year and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have be discharge with fidelity and eminent success the extensive blockade have be constantly increase in efficiency as the navy have expand yet on so long a line it have so far be impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade from return receive at the navy department it appear that more than 1,000 vessel have be capture since the blockade be institute and that the value of prize already send in for adjudication amount to over $ 13,000,000.the naval force of the united states consist at this time of 588 vessel complete and in the course of completion and of these 75 be ironclad or armored steamer the event of the war give an increase interest and importance to the navy which will probably extend beyond the war itself the armored vessel in our navy complete and in service or which be under contract and approach completion be believe to exceed in number those of any other power but while these may be rely upon for harbor defense and coast service other of great strength and capacity will be necessary for cruise purpose and to maintain our rightful position on the ocean the change that have take place in naval vessel and naval warfare since the introduction of steam as a motive power for ship of war demand either a corresponding change in some of our exist navy yard or the establishment of new one for the construction and necessary repair of modern naval vessel no inconsiderable embarrassment delay and public injury have be experience from the want of such governmental establishment the necessity of such a navy yard so furnished at some suitable place upon the atlantic seaboard have on repeat occasion be bring to the attention of congress by the navy department and be again present in the report of the secretary which accompany this communication i think it my duty to invite your special attention to this subject and also to that of establish a yard and depot for naval purpose upon one of the western river a naval force have be create on those interior water and under many disadvantage within little more than two year exceed in number the whole naval force of the country at the commencement of the present administration satisfactory and important as have be the performance of the heroic man of the navy at this interesting period they be scarcely more wonderful than the success of our mechanic and artisan in the production of war vessel which have create a new form of naval power our country have advantage superior to any other nation in our resource of iron and timber with inexhaustible quantity of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both and all available and in close proximity to navigable water without the advantage of public work the resource of the nation have be develop and its power display in the construction of a navy of such magnitude which have at the very period of its creation render signal service to the union the increase of the number of seaman in the public service from 7,500 man in the spring of 1861 to about 34,000 at the present time have be accomplish without special legislation or extraordinary bounty to promote that increase it have be find however that the operation of the draft with the high bounty pay for army recruit be begin to affect injuriously the naval service and will if not correct be likely to impair its efficiency by detach seaman from their proper vocation and induce they to enter the army i therefore respectfully suggest that congress might aid both the army and naval service by a definite provision on this subject which would at the same time be equitable to the community more especially interested i commend to your consideration the suggestion of the secretary of the navy in regard to the policy of foster and train seaman and also the education of officer and engineer for the naval service the naval academy be render signal service in prepare midshipman for the highly responsible duty which in after life they will be require to perform in order that the country should not be deprive of the proper quota of educate officer for which legal provision have be make at the naval school the vacancy cause by the neglect or omission to make nomination from the states in insurrection have be fill by the secretary of the navy the school be now more full and complete than at any former period and in every respect entitle to the favorable consideration of congress during the past fiscal year the financial condition of the post office department have be one of increase prosperity and i be gratify in be able to state that the actual postal revenue have nearly equal the entire expenditure the latter amounting to $ 11,314,206.84 and the former to $ 11,163,789.59 leave a deficiency of but $ 150,417.25 in 1860 the year immediately precede the rebellion the deficiency amount to $ 5,656,705.49 the postal receipt of that year be $ 2,645,722.19 less than those of 1863 the decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of transportation have be only about 25 per cent but the annual expenditure on account of the same have be reduce 35 per cent it be manif therefore that the post office department may become self sustain in a few year even with the restoration of the whole service the international conference of postal delegate from the principal country of europe and america which be call at the suggestion of the postmaster general meet at paris on the 11th of may last and conclude its deliberation on the 8th of june the principle establish by the conference as well adapt to facilitate postal intercourse between nation and as the basis of future postal convention inaugurate a general system of uniform international charge at reduce rate of postage and can not fail to produce beneficial result i refer you to the report of the secretary of the interior which be herewith lay before you for useful and varied information in relation to the public land indian affair patent pension and other matter of public concern pertain to his department the quantity of land dispose of during the last and the first quarter of the present fiscal year be 3,841,549 acre of which 161,911 acre be sell for cash 1,456,514 acre be take up under the homestead law and the residue dispose of under law grant land for military bounty for railroad and other purpose it also appear that the sale of the public land be largely on the increase it have long be a cherished opinion of some of our wise statesman that the people of the united states have a high and more enduring interest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public land than in the amount of direct revenue to be derive from the sale of they this opinion have have a control influence in shape legislation upon the subject of our national domain i may cite as evidence of this the liberal measure adopt in reference to actual settler the grant to the states of the overflow land within their limit in order to their be reclaim and render fit for cultivation the grant to railway company of alternate section of land upon the contemplated issue of their road which when complete will so largely multiply the facility for reach our distant possession this policy have receive its most signal and beneficent illustration in the recent enactment grant homestead to actual settler since the 1st day of january last the before mention quantity of 1,456,514 acre of land have be take up under its provision this fact and the amount of sale furnish gratifying evidence of increase settlement upon the public land notwithstanding the great struggle in which the energy of the nation have be engage and which have require so large a withdrawal of our citizen from their accustomed pursuit i cordially concur in the recommendation of the secretary of the interior suggest a modification of the act in favor of those engage in the military and naval service of the united states i doubt not that congress will cheerfully adopt such measure as will without essentially change the general feature of the system secure to the great practicable extent its benefit to those who have leave their home in the defense of the country in this arduous crisis i invite your attention to the view of the secretary as to the propriety of raise by appropriate legislation a revenue from the mineral land of the united states the measure provide at your last session for the removal of certain indian tribe have be carry into effect sundry treaty have be negotiate which will in due time be submit for the constitutional action of the senate they contain stipulation for extinguish the possessory right of the indians to large and valuable tract of land it be hope that the effect of these treaty will result in the establishment of permanent friendly relation with such of these tribe as have be bring into frequent and bloody collision with our outlying settlement and emigrant sound policy and our imperative duty to these ward of the government demand our anxious and constant attention to their material well being to their progress in the art of civilization and above all to that moral training which under the blessing of divine providence will confer upon they the elevated and sanctifying influence the hope and consolation of the christian faith i suggest in my last annual message the propriety of remodel our indian system subsequent event have satisfy i of its necessity the detail set forth in the report of the secretary evince the urgent need for immediate legislative action i commend the benevolent institution establish or patronize by the government in this district to your generous and foster care the attention of congress during the last session be engage to some extent with a proposition for enlarge the water communication between the mississippi river and the northeastern seaboard which proposition however fail for the time since then upon a call of the great respectability a convention have be hold at chicago upon the same subject a summary of whose view be contain in a memorial address to the president and congress and which i now have the honor to lay before you that this interest be one which ere long will force its own way i do not entertain a doubt while it be submit entirely to your wisdom as to what can be do now augmented interest be give to this subject by the actual commencement of work upon the pacific railroad under auspex so favorable to rapid progress and completion the enlarged navigation become a palpable need to the great road i transmit the second annual report of the commissioner of the department of agriculture ask your attention to the development in that vital interest of the nation when congress assemble a year ago the war have already last nearly twenty month and there have be many conflict on both land and sea with vary result the rebellion have be press back into reduced limit yet the tone of public feeling and opinion at home and abroad be not satisfactory with other sign the popular election then just past indicate uneasiness among ourselves while amid much that be cold and menacing the kind word come from europe be utter in accent of pity that we be too blind to surrender a hopeless cause our commerce be suffer greatly by a few armed vessel build upon and furnish from foreign shore and we be threaten with such addition from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade we have fail to elicit from european government anything hopeful upon this subject the preliminary emancipation proclamation issue in september be run its assign period to the beginning of the new year a month later the final proclamation come include the announcement that color man of suitable condition would be receive into the war service the policy of emancipation and of employ black soldier give to the future a new aspect about which hope and fear and doubt contend in uncertain conflict accord to our political system as a matter of civil administration the general government have no lawful power to effect emancipation in any state and for a long time it have be hope that the rebellion could be suppress without resort to it as a military measure it be all the while deem possible that the necessity for it might come and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then be present it come and as be anticipate it be follow by dark and doubtful day eleven month having now pass we be permit to take another review the rebel border be press still far back and by the complete opening of the mississippi the country dominate by the rebellion be divide into distinct part with no practical communication between they tennessee and arkansas have be substantially clear of insurgent control and influential citizen in each owner of slave and advocate of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion now declare openly for emancipation in their respective states of those states not include in the emancipation proclamation maryland and missouri neither of which three year ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into new territories only dispute now as to the good mode of remove it within their own limit of those who be slave at the beginning of the rebellion full 100,000 be now in the united states military service about one half of which number actually bear arm in the rank thus give the double advantage of take so much labor from the insurgent cause and supply the place which otherwise must be fill with so many white man so far as test it be difficult to say they be not as good soldier as any no servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty have mark the measure of emancipation and arm the black these measure have be much discuss in foreign country and contemporary with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there be much improve at home the same measure have be fully discuss support criticise and denounce and the annual election follow be highly encouraging to those whose official duty it be to bear the country through this great trial thus we have the new reckoning the crisis which threaten to divide the friend of the union be past look now to the present and future and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within the states wherein that authority have be suspend i have think fit to issue a proclamation a copy of which be herewith transmit on examination of this proclamation it will appear as be believe that nothing will be attempt beyond what be amply justify by the constitution true the form of an oath be give but no man be coerce to take it the man be only promise a pardon in case he voluntarily take the oath the constitution authorize the executive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion and this include the power to grant on term as be fully establish by judicial and other authority it be also proffer that if in any of the states name a state government shall be in the mode prescribed set up such government shall be recognize and guarantee by the united states and that under it the state shall on the constitutional condition be protect against invasion and domestic violence the constitutional obligation of the united states to guarantee to every state in the union a republican form of government and to protect the state in the case state be explicit and full but why tender the benefit of this provision only to a state government set up in this particular way this section of the constitution contemplate a case wherein the element within a state favorable to republican government in the union may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to or even within the state and such be precisely the case with which we be now deal an attempt to guarantee and protect a revive state government construct in whole or in preponderate part from the very element against whose hostility and violence it be to be protect be simply absurd there must be a test by which to separate the oppose element so as to build only from the sound and that test be a sufficiently liberal one which accept as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness but if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political body an oath of allegiance to the constitution of the united states and to the union under it why also to the law and proclamation in regard to slavery those law and proclamation be enact and put forth for the purpose of aid in the suppression of the rebellion to give they their full effect there have to be a pledge for their maintenance in my judgment they have aid and will far aid the cause for which they be intend to now abandon they would be not only to relinquish a lever of power but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith i may add at this point that while i remain in my present position i shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation nor shall i return to slavery any person who be free by the term of that proclamation or by any of the act of congress for these and other reason it be think well that support of these measure shall be include in the oath and it be believe the executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited right which he have clear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the term which he shall deem wisest for the public interest it should be observe also that this part of the oath be subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation and supreme judicial decision the propose acquiescence of the national executive in any reasonable temporary state arrangement for the freed people be make with the view of possibly modify the confusion and destitution which must at well attend all class by a total revolution of labor throughout whole state it be hope that the already deeply afflict people in those states may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction if to this extent this vital matter be leave to themselves while no power of the national executive to prevent an abuse be abridge by the proposition the suggestion in the proclamation as to maintain the political framework of the states on what be call reconstruction be make in the hope that it may do good without danger of harm it will save labor and avoid great confusion but why any proclamation now upon this subject this question be beset with the conflict view that the step might be delay too long or be take too soon in some state the element for resumption seem ready for action but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying point a plan of action why shall a adopt the plan of b rather than b that of a and if a and b should agree how can they know but that the general government here will reject their plan by the proclamation a plan be present which may be accept by they as a rallying point and which they be assure in advance will not be reject here this may bring they to act soon than they otherwise would the objection to a premature presentation of a plan by the national executive consist in the danger of committal on point which could be more safely leave to further development care have be take to so shape the document as to avoid embarrassment from this source say that on certain term certain class will be pardon with right restore it be not say that other class or other term will never be in include say specify way it be say that reconstruction will be accept if present in a not say it will never be accept in any other way the movement by state action for emancipation in several of the states not include in the emancipation proclamation be matter of profound gratulation and while i do not repeat in detail what i have heretofore so earnestly urge upon this subject my general view and feeling remain unchanged and i trust that congress will omit no fair opportunity of aid these important step to a great consummation in the midst of other care however important we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power be still our main reliance to that power alone can we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the contested region that the insurgent power will not again overrun they until that confidence shall be establish little can be do anywhere for what be call reconstruction hence our chief care must still be direct to the army and navy who have thus far bear their hard part so nobly and well and it may be esteem fortunate that in give the great efficiency to these indispensable arm we do also honorably recognize the gallant man from commander to sentinel who compose they and to whom more than to other the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom disenthrall regenerate enlarge and perpetuate

 at the last session of congress a propose amendment of the constitution abolishing slavery throughout the united states pass the senate but fail for lack of the requisite two third vote in the house of representatives although the present be the same congress and nearly the same member and without question the wisdom or patriotism of those who stand in opposition i venture to recommend the reconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session of course the abstract question be not change but in intervene election show almost certainly that the next congress will pass the measure if this do not hence there be only a question of time as to when the propose amendment will go to the states for their action and as it be to so go at all event may we not agree that the soon the well it be not claim that the election have impose a duty on member to change their view or their vote any far than as an additional element to be consider their judgment may be affect by it it be the voice of the people now for the first time hear upon the question in a great national crisis like ours unanimity of action among those seek a common end be very desirable&mdash;almost indispensable and yet no approach to such unanimity be attainable unless some deference shall be pay to the will of the majority simply because it be the will of the majority in this case the common end be the maintenance of the union and among the mean to secure that end such will through the election be most dearly declare in favor of such constitutional amendment
 the most reliable indication of public purpose in this country be derive through our popular election judge by the recent canvass and its result the purpose of the people within the loyal states to maintain the integrity of the union be never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than now the extraordinary calmness and good order with which the million of voter meet and mingle at the poll give strong assurance of this not only all those who support the union ticket so call but a great majority of the oppose party also may be fairly claim to entertain and to be actuate by the same purpose it be an unanswerable argument to this effect that no candidate for any officce whatever high or low have venture to seek vote on the avowal that he be for give up the union there have be much impugn of motive and much heated controversy as to the proper mean and good mode of advance the union cause but on the distinct issue of union or no union the politician have show their instinctive knowledge that there be no diversity among the people in afford the people the fair opportunity of show one to another and to the world this firmess and unanimity of purpose the election have be of vast value to the national cause
 the election have exhibit another tact not less valuable to be known&mdash;the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of national resource that of live man while it be melancholy to reflect that the war have fill so many grave and carry mourning to so many heart it be some relief to know that compare with the surviving the fallen have be so few while corp and division and brigade and regiment have form and fight and dwindle and go out of existence a great majority of the man who compose they be still live the same be true of the naval service the election return prove this so many voter could not else be find the states regularly hold election both now and four year ago to wit california connecticut delaware illinois indiana iowa kentucky maine maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri new hampshire new jersey new york ohio oregon pennsylvania rhode island vermont west virginia and wisconsin east 3,982,011 vote now against 3,870,222 cast then show an aggregate now of 3,982,011 to this be to be add 33,762 cast now in the new states of kansas and nevada which states do not vote in 1860 thus swell the aggregate to 4,015,773 and the net increase during the three year and a half of war to 145,551 a table be append show particular to this again should be add the number of all soldier in the field from massachusetts rhode island new jersey delaware indiana illinois and california who by the law of those states could not vote away from their home and which number can not be less than 90,000 nor yet be this all the number in organize territories be triple now what it be four year ago while thousand white and black join we as the national arm press back the insurgent line so much be show affirmatively and negatively by the election it be not material to inquire how the increase have be produce or to show that it would have be great but for the war which be probably true the important fact remains demonstrate that we have more man now than we have when the war begin that we be not exhausted nor in process of exhaustion that we be gain strength and may if need be maintain the contest indefinitely this as to man material resource be now more complete and abundant than ever
 the national resource then be unexhausted and as we believe inexhaustible the public purpose to reestablish and maintain the national authority be unchanged and as we believe unchangeable the manner of continue the effort remain to choose on careful consideration of all the evidence accessible it seem to i that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good he would accept nothing short of severance of the union precisely what we will not and can not give his declaration to this effect be explicit and oft repeat he do not attempt to deceive we he afford we no excuse to deceive ourselves he can not voluntarily reaccept the union we can not voluntarily yield it between he and we the issue be distinct simple and inflexible it be an issue which can only be try by war and decide by victory if we yield we be beat if the southern people fail he he be beat either way it would be the victory and defeat follow war what be true however of he who head the insurgent cause be not necessarily true of those who follow although he can not reaccept the union they can some of they we know already desire peace and reunion the number of such may increase they can at any moment have peace simply by lay down their arm and submit to the national authority under the constitution alter so much the government could not if it would maintain war against they the loyal people would not sustain or allow it if question should remain we would adjust they by the peaceful mean of legislation conference court and vote operate only in constitutional and lawful channel some certain and other possible question be and would be beyond the executive power to adjust as for instance the admission of member into congress and whatever might require the appropriation of money the executive power itself would be greatly diminish by the cessation of actual war pardon and remission of forfeiture however would still be within executive control in what spirit and temper this control would be exercise can be fairly judge of by the past
 a year ago general pardon and amnesty upon specify term be offer to all except certain designate class and it be at the same time make known that the excepted class be still within contemplation of special clemency during the year many avail themselves of the general provision and many more would only that the sign of bad faith in some lead to such precautionary measure as render the practical process less easy and certain during the same time also special pardon have be grant to individual of the excepted class and no voluntary application have be deny thus practically the door have be for a full year open to all except such as be not in condition to make free choice that be such as be in custody or under constraint it be still so open to all but the time may come probably will come when public duty shall demand that it be close and that in lieu more rigorous measure than heretofore shall be adopt in present the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgent as the only indispensable condition to end the war on the part of the government i retract nothing heretofore say as to slavery i repeat the declaration make a year a ago that while i remain in my present position i shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation nor shall i return to slavery any person who be free by the term of that proclamation or by any of the act of congress if the people should by whatever mode or mean make it an executive duty to reenslave such person another and not i must be their instrument to perform it in state a single condition of peace i mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the government whenever it shall have cease on the part of those who begin it
fellow countryman   at this second appear to take the oath of the presidential office there be less occasion for an extended address than there be at the first then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursue seem fitting and proper now at the expiration of four year during which public declaration have be constantly call forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorb the attention and engross the energy of the nation little that be new could be present the progress of our arm upon which all else chiefly depend be as well known to the public as to myself and it be i trust reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all with high hope for the future no prediction in regard to it be venture on the occasion correspond to this four year ago all thought be anxiously direct to an impending civil war all dread it all seek to avert it while the inaugural address be be deliver from this place devote altogether to save the union without war insurgent agent be in the city seek to destroy it without war seek to dissolve the union and divide effect by negotiation both party deprecate war but one of they would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war come one eighth of the whole population be color slave not distribute generally over the union but localize in the southern part of it these slave constitute a peculiar and powerful interest all know that this interest be somehow the cause of the war to strengthen perpetuate and extend this interest be the object for which the insurgent would rend the union even by war while the government claim no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it neither party expect for the war the magnitude or the duration which it have already attain neither anticipate that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease each look for an easy triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invoke his aid against the other it may seem strange that any man should dare to ask a just god 's assistance in wring their bread from the sweat of other man 's face but let we judge not that we be not judge the prayer of both could not be answer that of neither have be answer fully the almighty have his own purpose woe unto the world because of offense for it must need be that offense come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh if we shall suppose that american slavery be one of those offense which in the providence of god must need come but which having continue through his appoint time he now will to remove and that he give to both north and south this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense come shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attribute which the believer in a live god always ascribe to he fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god will that it continue until all the wealth pile by the bondsman 's two hundred and fifty year of unrequited toil shall be sink and until every drop of blood draw with the lash shall be pay by another draw with the sword as be say three thousand year ago so still it must be say the judgment of the lord be true and righteous altogether "with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the fight as god give we to see the right let we strive on to finish the work we be in to bind up the nation 's wound to care for he who shall have bear the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and last peace among ourselves and with all nation

fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives to express gratitude to god in the name of the people for the preservationof the united states be my first duty in address you our thought nextrevert to the death of the late president by an act of parricidal treason the grief of the nation be still fresh it find some solace in the considerationthat he live to enjoy the high proof of its confidence by enteringon the renew term of the chief magistracy to which he have be elected;that he bring the civil war substantially to a close that his loss wasdeplore in all part of the union and that foreign nation have renderedjustice to his memory his removal cast upon i a heavy weight of caresthan ever devolve upon any one of his predecessor to fulfill my trusti need the support and confidence of all who be associate with i inthe various department of government and the support and confidence ofthe people there be but one way in which i can hope to gain their necessaryaid it be to state with frankness the principle which guide my conduct and their application to the present state of affair well aware thatthe efficiency of my labor will in a great measure depend on your andtheir undivided approbation the union of the united states of america be intend by its authorsto last as long as the states themselves shall last the union shall beperpetual be the word of the confederation to form a more perfectunion by an ordinance of the people of the united states be the declaredpurpose of the constitution the hand of divine providence be never moreplainly visible in the affair of man than in the framing and the adoptingof that instrument it be beyond comparison the great event in americanhistory and indeed be it not of all event in modern time the mostpregnant with consequence for every people of the earth the member ofthe convention which prepare it bring to their work the experience ofthe confederation of their several states and of other republican government old and new but they need and they obtain a wisdom superior to experience and when for its validity it require the approval of a people that occupieda large part of a continent and act separately in many distinct convention what be more wonderful than that after earnest contention and long discussion all feeling and all opinion be ultimately draw in one way to its support?the constitution to which life be thus impart contain within itselfample resource for its own preservation it have power to enforce the law punish treason and insure domestic tranquillity in case of the usurpationof the government of a state by one man or an oligarchy it become a dutyof the united states to make good the guaranty to that state of a republicanform of government and so to maintain the homogeneousness of all doesthe lapse of time reveal defect a simple mode of amendment be providedin the constitution itself so that its condition can always be make toconform to the requirement of advance civilization no room be allowedeven for the thought of a possibility of its come to an end and thesepower of self preservation have always be assert in their completeintegrity by every patriotic chief magistrate by jefferson and jacksonnot less than by washington and madison the parting advice of the fatherof his country while yet president to the people of the united stateswas that the free constitution which be the work of their hand mightbe sacredly maintain and the inaugural word of president jeffersonheld up the preservation of the general government in its whole constitutionalvigor as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad theconstitution be the work of the people of the united states and it shouldbe as indestructible as the people it be not strange that the framer of the constitution which have nomodel in the past should not have fully comprehend the excellence oftheir own work fresh from a struggle against arbitrary power many patriotssuffere from harass fear of an absorption of the state governmentsby the general government and many from a dread that the states wouldbreak away from their orbit but the very greatness of our country shouldallay the apprehension of encroachment by the general government thesubject that come unquestionably within its jurisdiction be so numerousthat it must ever naturally refuse to be embarrass by question thatlie beyond it be it otherwise the executive would sink beneath the burden the channel of justice would be choke legislation would be obstructedby excess so that there be a great temptation to exercise some of thefunction of the general government through the states than to trespasson their rightful sphere the absolute acquiescence in the decision ofthe majority be at the beginning of the century enforce by jeffersonas the vital principle of republic and the event of the last fouryear have establish we will hope forever that there lie no appealto force the maintenance of the union bring with it the support of the stategovernments in all their right but it be not one of the right of anystate government to renounce its own place in the union or to nullify thelaw of the union the large liberty be to be maintain in the discussionof the act of the federal government but there be no appeal from itslaw except to the various branch of that government itself or to thepeople who grant to the member of the legislative and of the executivedepartment no tenure but a limited one and in that manner always retainthe power of redress the sovereignty of the states be the language of the confederacy and not the language of the constitution the latter contain the emphaticwords-- this constitution and the law of the united states which shall be madein pursuance thereof and all treaty make or which shall be make underthe authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judge in every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitutionor law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding certainly the government of the united states be a limited government and so be every state government a limited government with we this ideaof limitation spread through every form of administration general state and municipal and rest on the great distinguishing principle of the recognitionof the right of man the ancient republic absorb the individual inthe state prescribe his religion and control his activity the americansystem rest on the assertion of the equal right of every man to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to freedom of conscience to theculture and exercise of all his faculty as a consequence the state governmentis limit as to the general government in the interest of union as tothe individual citizen in the interest of freedom state with proper limitation of power be essential to the existenceof the constitution of the united states at the very commencement whenwe assume a place among the power of the earth the declaration of independencewas adopt by states so also be the articles of confederation andwhen the people of the united states ordain and establish the constitutionit be the assent of the states one by one which give it vitality inthe event too of any amendment to the constitution the proposition ofcongress need the confirmation of states without states one great branchof the legislative government would be want and if we look beyond theletter of the constitution to the character of our country its capacityfor comprehend within its jurisdiction a vast continental empire isdue to the system of states the good security for the perpetual existenceof the states be the supreme authority of the constitution of the unitedstates the perpetuity of the constitution bring with it the perpetuityof the states their mutual relation make we what we be and in our politicalsystem their connection be indissoluble the whole can not exist withoutthe part nor the part without the whole so long as the constitutionof the united states endure the states will endure the destruction ofthe one be the destruction of the other the preservation of the one isthe preservation of the other i have thus explain my view of the mutual relation of the constitutionand the states because they unfold the principle on which i have soughtto solve the momentous question and overcome the appalling difficultiesthat meet i at the very commencement of my administration it have beenmy steadfast object to escape from the sway of momentary passion and toderive a healing policy from the fundamental and unchanging principlesof the constitution i find the states suffer from the effect of a civil war resistanceto the general government appear to have exhaust itself the unitedstates have recover possession of their fort and arsenal and theirarmie be in the occupation of every state which have attempt to secede whether the territory within the limit of those states should be heldas conquer territory under military authority emanating from the presidentas the head of the army be the first question that present itself fordecision now military government establish for an indefinite period wouldhave offer no security for the early suppression of discontent wouldhave divide the people into the vanquisher and the vanquished and wouldhave envenomed hatred rather than have restore affection once establish no precise limit to their continuance be conceivable they would haveoccasioned an incalculable and exhausting expense peaceful emigrationto and from that portion of the country be one of the good mean that canbe thought of for the restoration of harmony and that emigration wouldhave be prevent for what emigrant from abroad what industrious citizenat home would place himself willingly under military rule the chief personswho would have follow in the train of the army would have be dependentson the general government or man who expect profit from the miseriesof their err fellow citizen the power of patronage and rule whichwould have be exercise under the president over a vast and populousand naturally wealthy region be great than unless under extreme necessity i should be willing to intrust to any one man they be such as for myself i could never unless on occasion of great emergency consent to exercise the willful use of such power if continue through a period of year would have endanger the purity of the general administration and thelibertie of the states which remain loyal besides the policy of military rule over a conquered territory wouldhave imply that the states whose inhabitant may have take part in therebellion have by the act of those inhabitant cease to exist but thetrue theory be that all pretended act of secession be from the beginningnull and void the states can not commit treason nor screen the individualcitizen who may have commit treason any more than they can make validtreatie or engage in lawful commerce with any foreign power the statesattempting to secede place themselves in a condition where their vitalitywa impaired but not extinguish their function suspend but notdestroye but if any state neglect or refuse to perform its office there isthe more need that the general government should maintain all its authorityand as soon as practicable resume the exercise of all its function onthis principle i have act and have gradually and quietly and by almostimperceptible step seek to restore the rightful energy of the generalgovernment and of the states to that end provisional governor have beenappointe for the states convention call governor elect legislaturesassemble and senators and representatives choose to the congress of theunited states at the same time the court of the united states as fara could be do have be reopen so that the law of the united statesmay be enforce through their agency the blockade have be remove andthe custom house reestablish in port of entry so that the revenueof the united states may be collect the post office department renewsit ceaseless activity and the general government be thereby enable tocommunicate promptly with its officer and agent the court bring securityto person and property the opening of the port invite the restorationof industry and commerce the post office renew the facility of socialintercourse and of business and be it not happy for we all that the restorationof each one of these function of the general government bring with ita blessing to the states over which they be extend be it not a surepromise of harmony and renew attachment to the union that after all thatha happen the return of the general government be know only as a beneficence i know very well that this policy be attend with some risk that forit success it require at least the acquiescence of the states which itconcern that it imply an invitation to those states by renew theirallegiance to the united states to resume their function as states ofthe union but it be a risk that must be take in the choice of difficultiesit be the small risk and to diminish and if possible to remove alldanger i have feel it incumbent on i to assert one other power of thegeneral government the power of pardon as no state can throw a defenseover the crime of treason the power of pardon be exclusively vest inthe executive government of the united states in exercise that poweri have take every precaution to connect it with the clear recognitionof the bind force of the law of the united states and an unqualifiedacknowledgment of the great social change of condition in regard to slaverywhich have grow out of the war the next step which i have take to restore the constitutional relationsof the states have be an invitation to they to participate in the highoffice of amend the constitution every patriot must wish for a generalamnesty at the early epoch consistent with public safety for this greatend there be need of a concurrence of all opinion and the spirit of mutualconciliation all party in the late terrible conflict must work togetherin harmony it be not too much to ask in the name of the whole people that on the one side the plan of restoration shall proceed in conformitywith a willingness to cast the disorder of the past into oblivion andthat on the other the evidence of sincerity in the future maintenance ofthe union shall be put beyond any doubt by the ratification of the proposedamendment to the constitution which provide for the abolition of slaveryforever within the limit of our country so long as the adoption of thisamendment be delay so long will doubt and jealousy and uncertainty prevail this be the measure which will efface the sad memory of the past thisis the measure which will most certainly call population and capital andsecurity to those part of the union that need they most indeed it isnot too much to ask of the states which be now resume their place inthe family of the union to give this pledge of perpetual loyalty and peace until it be do the past however much we may desire it will not be forget the adoption of the amendment reunite we beyond all power of disruption;it heal the wound that be still imperfectly close it remove slavery the element which have so long perplexed and divide the country it makesof we once more a united people renew and strengthen bind more thanever to mutual affection and support the amendment to the constitution be adopt it would remain forthe states whose power have be so long in abeyance to resume their placesin the two branch of the national legislature and thereby complete thework of restoration here it be for you fellow citizen of the senate and for you fellow citizen of the house of representatives to judge each of you for yourself of the election return and qualificationsof your own member the full assertion of the power of the general government requiresthe holding of circuit court of the united states within the districtswhere their authority have be interrupt in the present posture of ourpublic affair strong objection have be urge to hold those courtsin any of the states where the rebellion have exist and it be ascertainedby inquiry that the circuit court of the united states would not be heldwithin the district of virginia during the autumn or early winter noruntil congress should have an opportunity to consider and act on the wholesubject to your deliberation the restoration of this branch of the civilauthority of the united states be therefore necessarily refer withthe hope that early provision will be make for the resumption of all itsfunction it be manifest that treason most flagrant in character hasbeen commit person who be charge with its commission should havefair and impartial trial in the high civil tribunal of the country in order that the constitution and the law may be fully vindicate thetruth dearly establish and affirm that treason be a crime that traitorsshould be punish and the offense make infamous and at the same time that the question may be judicially settle finally and forever thatno state of its own will have the right to renounce its place in the union the relation of the general government toward the 4,000,000 inhabitantswhom the war have call into freedom have engage my most serious consideration on the propriety of attempt to make the freedmen elector by the proclamationof the executive i take for my counsel the constitution itself the interpretationsof that instrument by its author and their contemporary and recentlegislation by congress when at the first movement toward independence the congress of the united states instruct the several state to institutegovernment of their own they leave each state to decide for itself thecondition for the enjoyment of the elective franchise during the periodof the confederacy there continue to exist a very great diversity in thequalification of elector in the several states and even within a statea distinction of qualification prevail with regard to the officer whowere to be choose the constitution of the united states recognize thesediversitie when it enjoin that in the choice of member of the houseof representatives of the united states the elector in each state shallhave the qualification requisite for elector of the most numerous branchof the state legislature after the formation of the constitution it remain as before the uniform usage for each state to enlarge the body of itselector accord to its own judgment and under this system one stateafter another have proceed to increase the number of its elector untilnow universal suffrage or something very near it be the general rule so fixed be this reservation of power in the habit of the people andso unquestione have be the interpretation of the constitution that duringthe civil war the late president never harbor the purpose certainlynever evowe the purpose of disregard it and in the act of congressdure that period nothing can be find which during the continuance ofhostilitie much less after their close would have sanction any departureby the executive from a policy which have so uniformly obtain moreover a concession of the elective franchise to the freedman by act of the presidentof the united states must have be extend to all colored man whereverfound and so must have establish a change of suffrage in the northern middle and western states not less than in the southern and southwestern such an act would have create a new class of voter and would have beenan assumption of power by the president which nothing in the constitutionor law of the united states would have warrant on the other hand every danger of conflict be avoid when the settlementof the question be refer to the several states they can each for itself decide on the measure and whether it be to be adopt at once and absolutelyor introduce gradually and with condition in my judgment the freedman if they show patience and manly virtue will soon obtain a participationin the elective franchise through the states than through the general government even if it have power to intervene when the tumult of emotion that havebeen raise by the suddenness of the social change shall have subside it may prove that they will receive the kind usage from some of thoseon whom they have heretofore most closely depended but while i have no doubt that now after the close of the war it isnot competent for the general government to extend the elective franchisein the several states it be equally clear that good faith require thesecurity of the freedman in their liberty and their property their rightto labor and their right to claim the just return of their labor i can not too strongly urge a dispassionate treatment of this subject whichshould be carefully keep aloof from all party strife we must equally avoidhasty assumption of any natural impossibility for the two race to liveside by side in a state of mutual benefit and good will the experimentinvolve we in no inconsistency let we then go on and make that experimentin good faith and not be too easily dishearten the country be in needof labor and the freedman be in need of employment culture and protection while their right of voluntary migration and expatriation be not to bequestione i would not advise their force removal and colonization letus rather encourage they to honorable and useful industry where it maybe beneficial to themselves and to the country and instead of hasty anticipationsof the certainty of failure let there be nothing want to the fair trialof the experiment the change in their condition be the substitution oflabor by contract for the status of slavery the freedman can not fairlybe accuse of unwillingness to work so long as a doubt remain about hisfreedom of choice in his pursuit and the certainty of his recover hisstipulated wage in this the interest of the employer and the employedcoincide the employer desire in his workman spirit and alacrity andthese can be permanently secure in no other way and if the one oughtto be able to enforce the contract so ought the other the public interestwill be well promote if the several states will provide adequate protectionand remedy for the freedman until this be in some way accomplish thereis no chance for the advantageous use of their labor and the blame ofill success will not rest on they i know that sincere philanthropy be earnest for the immediate realizationof its remotest aim but time be always an element in reform it be oneof the great act on record to have bring 4,000,000 people into freedom the career of free industry must be fairly open to they and then theirfuture prosperity and condition must after all rest mainly on themselves if they fail and so perish away let we be careful that the failure shallnot be attributable to any denial of justice in all that relate to thedestiny of the freedman we need not be too anxious to read the future;many incident which from a speculative point of view might raise alarmwill quietly settle themselves now that slavery be at an end or nearit end the greatness of its evil in the point of view of public economybecome more and more apparent slavery be essentially a monopoly of labor and as such lock the states where it prevail against the incoming offree industry where labor be the property of the capitalist the whiteman be exclude from employment or have but the second good chance offinde it and the foreign emigrant turn away from the region wherehis condition would be so precarious with the destruction of the monopolyfree labor will hasten from all pan of the civilized world to assist indevelope various and immeasurable resource which have hitherto laindormant the eight or nine states near the gulf of mexico have a soilof exuberant fertility a climate friendly to long life and can sustaina dense population than be find as yet in any part of our country andthe future influx of population to they will be mainly from the north orfrom the most cultivate nation in europe from the suffering that haveattende they during our late struggle let we look away to the future which be sure to be laden for they with great prosperity than have everbefore be know the removal of the monopoly of slave labor be a pledgethat those region will be people by a numerous and enterprise population which will vie with any in the union in compactness inventive genius wealth and industry our government spring from and be make for the people not the peoplefor the government to they it owe allegiance from they it must deriveit courage strength and wisdom but while the government be thus boundto defer to the people from whom it derive its existence it should from the very consideration of its origin be strong in its power of resistanceto the establishment of inequality monopoly perpetuity and classlegislation be contrary to the genius of free government and ought notto be allow here there be no room for favor class or monopolies;the principle of our government be that of equal law and freedom of industry wherever monopoly attain a foothold it be sure to be a source of danger discord and trouble we shall but fulfill our duty as legislator byaccorde equal and exact justice to all man special privilege to none the government be subordinate to the people but as the agent and representativeof the people it must be hold superior to monopoly which in themselvesought never to be grant and which where they exist must be subordinateand yield to the government the constitution confer on congress the right to regulate commerceamong the several states it be of the first necessity for the maintenanceof the union that that commerce should be free and unobstructed no statecan be justify in any device to tax the transit of travel and commercebetween state the position of many states be such that if they be allowedto take advantage of it for purpose of local revenue the commerce betweenstate might be injuriously burden or even virtually prohibit itis well while the country be still young and while the tendency to dangerousmonopolie of this kind be still feeble to use the power of congress soas to prevent any selfish impediment to the free circulation of man andmerchandise a tax on travel and merchandise in their transit constitutesone of the bad form of monopoly and the evil be increase if coupledwith a denial of the choice of route when the vast extent of our countryis consider it be plain that every obstacle to the free circulationof commerce between the states ought to be sternly guard against by appropriatelegislation within the limit of the constitution the report of the secretary of the interior explain the condition ofthe public land the transaction of the patent office

disposal of the land enter under this act and thatpayment in cash to the extent of from 40 to 50 per cent will be make bysettler who may thus at any time acquire title before the expiration ofthe period at which it would otherwise vest the homestead policy be establishedonly after long and earnest resistance experience prove its wisdom theland in the hand of industrious settler whose labor create wealthand contribute to the public resource be worth more to the united statesthan if they have be reserve as a solitude for future purchaser the lamentable event of the last four year and the

might content myself with a referenceto that report in which you will find all the information require foryour deliberation and decision but the paramount importance of the subjectso press itself on my own mind that i can not but lay before you my viewsof the measure which be require for the good character and i mightalmost say for the existence of this people the life of a republic liescertainly in the energy virtue and intelligence of its citizen butit be equally true that a good revenue system be the life of an organizedgovernment i meet you at a time when the nation have voluntarily burdeneditself with a debt unprecedented in our annal vast as be its amount it fade away into nothing when compare with the countless blessing thatwill be confer upon our country and upon man by the preservation ofthe nation 's life now on the first occasion of the meeting of congresssince the return of peace it be of the utmost importance to inauguratea just policy which shall at once be put in motion and which shall commenditself to those who come after we for its continuance we must aim at nothingless than the complete effacement of the financial evil that necessarilyfollowe a state of civil war we must endeavor to apply the early remedyto the deranged state of the currency and not shrink from devise a policywhich with out be oppressive to the people shall immediately beginto effect a reduction of the debt and if persist in discharge it fullywithin a definitely fix number of year it be our first duty to prepare in earnest for our recovery from theever increase evil of an irredeemable currency without a sudden revulsion and yet without untimely procrastination for that end we must each inour respective position prepare the way i hold it the duty of the executiveto insist upon frugality in the expenditure and a spare economy isitself a great national resource of the bank to which authority have beengiven to issue note secure by bond of the united states we may requirethe great moderation and prudence and the law must be rigidly enforcedwhen its limit be exceed we may each one of we counsel our activeand enterprise countryman to be constantly on their guard to liquidatedebt contract in a paper currency and by conduct business as nearlyas possible on a system of cash payment or short credit to hold themselvesprepare to return to the standard of gold and silver to aid our fellow citizensin the prudent management of their monetary affair the duty devolveson we to diminish by law the amount of paper money now in circulation five year ago the bank note circulation of the country amount to notmuch more than two hundred million now the circulation bank and national exceed seven hundred million the simple statement of the fact recommendsmore strongly than any word of mine could do the necessity of our restrainingthis expansion the gradual reduction of the currency be the only measurethat can save the business of the country from disastrous calamity andthis can be almost imperceptibly accomplish by gradually fund thenational circulation in security that may be make redeemable at the pleasureof the government our debt be doubly secure first in the actual wealth and still greaterundevelope resource of the country and next in the character of ourinstitution the most intelligent observer among political economistshave not fail to remark that the public debt of a country be safe inproportion as its people be free that the debt of a republic be the safestof all our history confirm and establish the theory and be i firmlybelieve destine to give it a still more signal illustration the secretof this superiority spring not merely from the fact that in a republicthe national obligation be distribute more widely through countlessnumber in all class of society it have its root in the character ofour law here all man contribute to the public welfare and bear theirfair share of the public burden during the war under the impulse ofpatriotism the man of the great body of the people without regard totheir own comparative want of wealth throng to our army and filledour fleet of war and hold themselves ready to offer their life for thepublic good now in their turn the property and income of the countryshould bear their just proportion of the burden of taxation while in ourimpost system through mean of which increase vitality be incidentallyimparte to all the industrial interest of the nation the duty shouldbe so adjust as to fall most heavily on article of luxury leave thenecessarie of life as free from taxation as the absolute want of thegovernment economically administer will justify no favor class shoulddemand freedom from assessment and the taxis should be so distributeda not to fall unduly on the poor but rather on the accumulate wealthof the country we should look at the national debt just as it be nota a national blessing but as a heavy burden on the industry of the country to be discharge without unnecessary delay it be estimate by the secretary of the treasury that the expendituresfor the fiscal year end the 30th of june 1866 will exceed the receipts$112,194,947 it be gratify however to state that it be also estimatedthat the revenue for the year end the 30th of june 1867 will exceedthe expenditure in the sum of $ 111,682,818 this amount or so much asmay be deem sufficient for the purpose may be apply to the reductionof the public debt which on the 31st day of october 1865 be $ 2,740,854,750.every reduction will diminish the total amount of interest to be pay and so enlarge the mean of still further reduction until the whole shallbe liquidate and this as will be see from the estimate of the secretaryof the treasury may be accomplish by annual payment even within a periodnot exceed thirty year i have faith that we shall do all this withina reasonable time that as we have amaze the world by the suppressionof a civil war which be think to be beyond the control of any government so we shall equally show the superiority of our institution by the promptand faithful discharge of our national obligation the department of agriculture under its present direction be accomplishingmuch in develop and utilize the vast agricultural capability ofthe country and for information respect the detail of its managementreference be make to the annual report of the commissioner i have dwell thus fully on our domestic affair because of their transcendentimportance under any circumstance our great extent of territory and varietyof climate produce almost everything that be necessary for the wantsand even the comfort of man make we singularly independent of the varyingpolicy of foreign power and protect we against every temptation to entanglingalliance while at the present moment the reestablishment of harmonyand the strength that come from harmony will be our good security against"nation who feel power and forget right for myself it have be andit will be my constant aim to promote peace and amity with all foreignnation and power and i have every reason to believe that they all withoutexception be animate by the same disposition our relation with theemperor of china so recent in their origin be most friendly our commercewith his dominion be receive new development and it be very pleasingto find that the government of that great empire manifest satisfactionwith our policy and repose just confidence in the fairness which marksour intercourse the unbroken harmony between the united states and theemperor of russia be receive a new support from an enterprise designedto carry telegraphic line across the continent of asia through his dominion and so to connect we with all europe by a new channel of intercourse ourcommerce with south america be about to receive encouragement by a directline of mail steamship to the rise empire of brazil the distinguishedparty of man of science who have recently leave our country to make a scientificexploration of the natural history and river and mountain range of thatregion have receive from the emperor that generous welcome which be tohave be expect from his constant friendship for the united states andhis well know zeal in promote the advancement of knowledge a hope isentertaine that our commerce with the rich and populous country thatborder the mediterranean sea may be largely increase nothing will bewanting on the part of this government to extend the protection of ourflag over the enterprise of our fellow citizen we receive from the powersin that region assurance of good will and it be worthy of note that aspecial envoy have bring we message of condolence on the death of ourlate chief magistrate from the bey of tunis whose rule include the olddominion of carthage on the african coast our domestic contest now happily end have leave some trace in ourrelation with one at least of the great maritime power the formal accordanceof belligerent right to the insurgent states be unprecedented and hasnot be justify by the issue but in the system of neutrality pursuedby the power which make that concession there be a marked difference the material of war for the insurgent states be furnish in a greatmeasure from the workshop of great britain and british ship mannedby british subject and prepare for receive british armament salliedfrom the port of great britain to make war on american commerce underthe shelter of a commission from the insurgent state these ship havingonce escape from british port ever afterwards enter they in everypart of the world to refit and so to renew their depredation the consequencesof this conduct be most disastrous to the states then in rebellion increasingtheir desolation and misery by the prolongation of our civil contest ithad moreover the effect to a great extent to drive the american flagfrom the sea and to transfer much of our shipping and our commerce tothe very power whose subject have create the necessity for such a change these event take place before i be call to the administration of thegovernment the sincere desire for peace by which i be animate lead meto approve the proposal already make to submit the question which hadthu arise between the country to arbitration these question be ofsuch moment that they must have command the attention of the great power and be so interwoven with the peace and interest of every one of themas to have insure an impartial decision i regret to inform you that greatbritain decline the arbitrament but on the other hand invite we tothe formation of a joint commission to settle mutual claim between thetwo country from which those for the depredation before mention shouldbe exclude the proposition in that very unsatisfactory form have beendecline the united states do not present the subject as an impeachment of thegood faith of a power which be profess the most friendly disposition but as involve question of public law of which the settlement be essentialto the peace of nation and though pecuniary reparation to their injuredcitizen would have follow incidentally on a decision against great britain such compensation be not their primary object they have a high motive and it be in the interest of peace and justice to establish importantprinciple of international law the correspondence will be place beforeyou the ground on which the british minister rest his justification be substantially that the municipal law of a nation and the domestic interpretationsof that law be the measure of its duty as a neutral and i feel boundto declare my opinion before you and before the world that that justificationcan not be sustain before the tribunal of nation at the same time;i do not advise to any present attempt at redress by act of legislation for the future friendship between the two country must rest on the basisof mutual justice from the moment of the establishment of our free constitution the civilizedworld have be convulse by revolution in the interest of democracy orof monarchy but through all those revolution the united states have wiselyand firmly refuse to become propagandist of republicanism it be theonly government suit to our condition but we have never seek to imposeit on other and we have consistently follow the advice of washingtonto recommend it only by the careful preservation and prudent use of theblessing during all the intervene period the policy of european powersand of the united states have on the whole be harmonious twice indeed rumor of the invasion of some part of america in the interest of monarchyhave prevail twice my predecessor have have occasion to announce theview of this nation in respect to such interference on both occasionsthe remonstrance of the united states be respect from a deep convictionon the part of european governments that the system of noninterferenceand mutual abstinence from propagandism be the true rule for the two hemisphere since those time we have advance in wealth and power but we retain thesame purpose to leave the nation of europe to choose their own dynastiesand form their own system of government this consistent moderation mayjustly demand a corresponding moderation we should regard it as a greatcalamity to ourselves to the cause of good government and to the peaceof the world should any european power challenge the american people asit be to the defense of republicanism against foreign interference we can not foresee and be unwilling to consider what opportunity mightpresent themselves what combination might offer to protect ourselvesagainst design inimical to our form of government the united states desireto act in the future as they have ever act heretofore they never willbe drive from that course but by the aggression of european power andwe rely on the wisdom and justice of those power to respect the systemof noninterference which have so long be sanction by time and whichby its good result have approve itself to both continent the correspondence between the united states and france in referenceto question which have become subject of discussion between the two governmentswill at a proper time be lay before congress when on the organization of our government under the constitution the president of the united states deliver his inaugural address to thetwo houses of congress he say to they and through they to the countryand to mankind that-- the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of therepublican model of government be justly consider perhaps as deeply as finally stake on the experiment intrust to the hand of the americanpeople and the house of representatives answer washington by the voice ofmadison we adore the invisible hand which have lead the american people throughso many difficulty to cherish a conscious responsibility for the destinyof republican liberty more than seventy six year have glide away since these word werespoken the united states have pass through severer trial than wereforeseen and now at this new epoch in our existence as one nation withour union purify by sorrow and strengthen by conflict and establishedby the virtue of the people the greatness of the occasion invite we oncemore to repeat with solemnity the pledge of our father to hold ourselvesanswerable before our fellow man for the success of the republican formof government experience have prove its sufficiency in peace and in war;it have vindicate its authority through danger and affliction and suddenand terrible emergency which would have crush any system that hadbeen less firmly fix in the heart of the people at the inaugurationof washington the foreign relation of the country be few and its tradewas repress by hostile regulation now all the civilized nation ofthe globe welcome our commerce and their government profess toward usamity then our country feel its way hesitatingly along an untried path with states so little bind together by rapid mean of communication asto be hardly know to one another and with historic tradition extendingover very few year now intercourse between the states be swift and intimate;the experience of century have be

through cession of land first colonizedby spain and france the country have acquire a more complex character and have for its natural limit the chain of lake the gulf of mexico and on the east and the west the two great ocean other nation be wastedby civil war for age before they could establish for themselves the necessarydegree of unity the latent conviction that our form of government be thebest

institutionsunimpaire the throng of emigrant that crowd to our shore be witness ofthe confidence of all people in our permanence here be the great landof free labor where industry be bless with

perpetuity who of they will not now acknowledge in the word of washington that every step by which the people of the united states have advancedto the character of an independent nation seem to have be distinguishedby some token of providential agency who will not join with i in theprayer that the invisible hand which have lead we through the cloud thatgloome around our path will so guide we

to the senate of the united states
 in reply to the resolution adopt by the senate on the 12th instant i have the honor to state that the rebellion wage by a portion of the people against the properly constitute authority of the government of the united states have be suppress that the united states be in possession of every state in which the insurrection exist and that as far as it could be do the court of the united states have be restore post office reestablish and step take to put into effective operation the revenue law of the country
 as the result of the measure institute by the executive with the view of induce a resumption of the function of the states comprehend in the inquiry of the senate the people of north carolina south carolina georgia alabama mississippi louisiana arkansas and tennessee have reorganize their respective state government and be yield obedience to the law and government of the united states with more willingness and great promptitude than under the circumstance could reasonably have be anticipate the propose amendment to the constitution provide for the abolition of slavery forever within the limit of the country have be ratify by each one of those states with the exception of mississippi from which no official information have be receive and in nearly all of they measure have be adopt or be now pende to confer upon freedman the privilege which be essential to their comfort protection and security in florida and texas the people be make commendable progress in restore their state government and no doubt be entertain that they will at an early period be in a condition to resume all of their practical relation with the general government
 in that portion of the union lately in rebellion the aspect of affair be more promising than in view of all the circumstance could well have be expect the people throughout the entire south evince a laudable desire to renew their allegiance to the government and to repair the devastation of war by a prompt and cheerful return to peaceful pursuit and abide faith be entertain that their action will conform to their profession and that in acknowledge the supremacy of the constitution and law of the united states their loyalty will be unreservedly give to the government whose leniency they can not fail to appreciate and whose fostering care will soon restore they to a condition of prosperity it be true that in some of the states the demoralize effect of the war be to be see in occasional disorder but these be local in character not frequent in occurrence and be rapidly disappear as the authority of civil law be extend and sustain perplexing question be naturally to be expect from the great and sudden change in the relation between the two race but system be gradually develop themselves under which the freedman will receive the protection to which he be justly entitle and by mean of his labor make himself a useful and independent member in the community in which he have a home
 from all the information in my possession and from that which i have recently derive from the most reliable authority i be induce to cherish the belief that sectional animosity be surely and rapidly merge itself into a spirit of nationality and that representation connect with a properly adjust system of taxation will result in a harmonious restoration of the relation of the states to the national union
 the report of carl schurz be herewith transmit as request by the senate no report from the hon john coyode have be receive by the president the attention of the senate be invite to the accompany report from lieutenant general grant who recently make a tour of inspection through several of the states whose inhabitant participate in the rebellion

to the senate of the united states

 i have examine with care the bill which originate in the senate and have be pass by the two houses of congress to amend an act entitle an act to establish a bureau for the relief of freedman and refugee and for other purpose have with much regret come to the conclusion that it would not be consistent with the public welfare to give my approval to the measure i return the hill to the senate with my objection to its become a law

 i might call to mind in advance of these objection that there be no immediate necessity for the propose measure the act to establish a bureau for the relief of freedman and refugee which be approve in the mouth of march last have not yet expire it be think stringent and extensive enough for the purpose in view in time of war before it cease to have effect further experience may assist to guide we to a wise conclusion as to the policy to be adopt in time of peace

 i share with congress the strong desire to secure to the freedman the full enjoyment of their freedom and property and their entire independence and equality in make contract for their labor but the bill before i contain provision which in my opinion be not warrant by the constitution and be not well suited to accomplish the end in view

 the bill propose to establish by authority of congress military jurisdiction over all part of the united states contain refugee and freedman it would by its very nature apply with most force to those part of the united states in which the freedman most abound and it expressly extend the exist temporary jurisdiction of the freedmen 's bureau with greatly enlarge power over those states in which the ordinary course of judicial proceeding have be interrupt by the rebellion the source from which this military jurisdiction be to emanate be none other than the president of the united states act through the war department and the commissioner of the freedmen 's bureau the agent to carry out this military jurisdiction be to be select either from the army or from civil life the country be to be divide into district and subdistrict and the number of salaried agent to be employ may be equal to the number of county or parish in all the united states where freedman and refugee be to be find

 the subject over which this military jurisdiction be to extend in every part of the united states include protection to all employee agent and officer of this bureau in the exercise of the duty impose upon they by the bill in eleven state it be furth to extend over all case affect freedman and refugee discriminate against by local law custom or prejudice in those eleven state the bill subject any white person who may be charge with deprive a freedman of any civil right or immunity belong to white person to imprisonment or fine or both without however define the civil right and immunity which be thus to be secure to the freedman by military law this military jurisdiction also extend to all question that may arise respect contract the agent who be thus to exercise the office of a military judge may be a strange entirely ignorant of the law of the place and expose to the error of judgment to which all man be liable the exercise of power over which there be no legal supervision by so vast a number of agent as be contemplate by the bill must by the very nature of man be attend by act of caprice injustice and passion

 the trial have their origin under this bill be to take place without the intervention of a jury and without any fix rule of law or evidence the rule on which offense be to be hear and determine by the numerous agent be such rule and regulation as the president through the war department shall prescribe no previous presentment be require nor any indictment charge the commission of a crime against the law but the trial must proceed on charge and specification the punishment will be not what the law declare but such as a court martial may think proper and from these arbitrary tribunal there lie no appeal no writ of error to any of the court in which the constitution of the united states vest exclusively the judicial power of the country

 while the territory and the class of action and offense that be make subject to this measure be so extensive the bill itself should it become a law will have no limitation in point of time but will form a part of the permanent legislation of the country i can not reconcile a system of military jurisdiction of this kind with the word of the constitution which declare that no person shall be hold to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury except in case arise in the land or naval force or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger and that in all criminal prosecution the accuse shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have be commit

 the safeguard which the experience and wisdom of age teach our father to establish as security for the protection of the innocent the punishment of the guilty and the equal administration of justice be to be set aside and for the sake of a more vigorous interposition in behalf of justice we be to take the risk of the many act of injustice that would necessarily follow from an almost countless number of agent establish in every parish or county in nearly a third of the states of the union over whose decision there be to be no supervision or control by the federal court the power that would be thus place in the hand of the president be such as in time of peace certainly ought never to be intrust to any one man

 if it be ask whether the creation of such a tribunal within a state be warrant as a measure of war the question immediately present itself whether we be still engage in war let we not unnecessarily disturb the commerce and credit and industry of the country by declare to the american people and to the world that the united states be still in a condition of civil war at present there be no part of our country in which the authority of the united states be dispute offense that may be commit by individual should not work a forfeiture of the right of whole community the country have return or be return to a state of peace and industry and the rebellion be in fact at an end the measure therefore seem to be as inconsistent with the actual condition of the country as it be at variance with the constitution of the united states

 if pass from general consideration we examine the bill in detail it be open to weighty objection

 in time of war it be eminently proper that we should provide for those who be pass suddenly from a condition of bondage to a state of freedom but this bill propose to make the freedmen 's bureau establish by the act of 1865 as one of many great and extraordinary military measure to suppress a formidable rebellion a permanent branch of the public administration with its power greatly enlarge i have no reason to suppose and i do not understand it to be allege that the act of march 1865 have prove deficient for the purpose for which it be pass although at that time and for a considerable period thereafter the government of the united states remain unacknowledged in most of the states whose inhabitant have be involve in the rebellion

 the institution of slavery for the military destruction of which the freedmen 's bureau be call into existence as an auxiliary have be already effectually and finally abrogate throughout the whole country by an amendment of the constitution of the united states and practically its eradication have receive the assent and concurrence of most of those states in which it at any time have an existence i be not therefore able to discern in the condition of the country anything to justify an apprehension that the power and agency of the freedmen 's bureau which be effective for the protection of freedman and refugee during the actual continuance of hostility and of african servitude will now in a time of peace and after the abolition of slavery prove inadequate to the same proper end if i be correct in these view there can be no necessity for the enlargement of the power of the bureau for which provision be make in the bill

 the third section of the bill authorize a general and unlimited grant of support to the destitute and suffer refugee and freedman their wife and child succeed section make provision for the rent or purchase of land estate for freedman and for the erection for their benefit of suitable building for asylum and school the expense to be defray from the treasury of the whole people the congress of the united states have never heretofore think itself empower to establish asylum beyond the limit of the district of columbia except for the benefit of our disabled soldier and sailor it have never found school for any class of our own people not even for the orphan of those who have fall in the defense of the union but have leave the care of education to the much more competent and efficient control of the states of community of private association and of individual it have never deem itself authorize to expend the public money for the rent or purchase of home for the thousand not to say million of the white race who be honestly toil from day to day for their subsistence a system for the support of indigent person in the united states be never contemplate by the author of the constitution nor can any good reason be advance why as a permanent establishment it should be found for one class or color of our people more than another pende the war many refugee and freedman receive support from the government but it be never intend that they should thenceforth be feed clothe educate and shelter by the united states the idea on which the slave be assist to freedom be that on become free they would be a self sustain population any legislation that shall imply that they be not expect to attain a self sustain condition must have a tendency injurious alike to their character and their prospect

 the appointment of an agent for every country and parish will create an immense patronage and the expense of the numerous officer and their clerk to be appoint by the president will be great in the beginning with a tendency steadily to increase the appropriation ask by the freedmen 's bureau as now establish for the year 1866 amount to $ 11,745,000 it may be safely estimate that the cost to be incur under the pende bill will require double that amount more than the entire sum expend in any one year under the administration of the second adams if the presence of agent in every parish and county be to be consider as a war measure opposition or even resistance might be provoke so that to give effect to their jurisdiction troop would have to be station within reach of every one of they and thus a large stand force be render necessary large appropriation would therefore be require to sustain and enforce military jurisdiction in every country or parish from the potomac to the rio grande the condition of our fiscal affair be encouraging but in order to sustain the present measure of public confidence it be necessary that we practice not merely customary economy but as far as possible severe retrenchment

 in addition to the objection already state the fifth section of the bill propose to take away land from its former owner without any legal proceeding be first have contrary to that provision of the constitution which declare that no person shall be deprive of life liberty or property without due process of law it do not appear that a part of the land to which this section refer may not be own by minor or person of unsound mind or by those who have be faithful to all their obligation as citizen of the united states if any portion of the land be hold by such person it be not competent for any authority to deprive they of it if on the other hand it be find that the property be liable to confiscation even then it can not be appropriate to public purpose until by due process of law it shall have be declare forfeited to the government

 there be still further objection to the bill on ground seriously affect the class of person to whom it be design to bring relief it will tend to keep the mind of the freedman in a state of uncertain expectation and restlessness while to those among whom he live it will be a source of constant and vague apprehension

 undoubtedly the freedman should be protect but he should be protect by the civil authority especially by the exercise of all the constitutional power of the court of the united states and of the states his condition be not so exposed as may at first be imagine he be in a portion of the country where his labor can not well be spare competition for his service from planter from those who be construct or repair railroad and from capitalist in his vicinage or from other states will enable he to command almost his own term he also possess a perfect right to change his place of abode and if therefore he do not find in one community or state a mode of life suit to his desire or proper remuneration for his labor he can move to another where that labor be more esteemed and well reward in truth however each state induce by its own want and interest will do what be necessary and proper to retain within its border all the labor that be need for the development of its resource the law that regulate supply and demand will maintain their force and the wage of the laborer will be regulate thereby there be no danger that the exceedingly great demand for labor will not operate in favor of the laborer

 neither be sufficient consideration give to the ability of the freedman to protect and take care of themselves it be no more than justice to they to believe that as they have receive their freedom with moderation and forbearance so they will distinguish themselves by their industry and thrift and soon show the world that in a condition of freedom they be self sustain capable of select their own employment and their own place of abode of insist for themselves on a proper remuneration and of establish and maintain their own asylum and school it be earnestly hope that instead of waste away they will by their own effort establish for themselves a condition of respectability and prosperity it be certain that they can attain to that condition only through their own merit and exertion

 in this connection the query present itself whether the system propose by the bill will not when put into complete operation practically transfer the entire care support and control of 4,000,000 emancipate slave to agent overseer or taskmaster who appoint at washington be to be locate in every county and parish throughout the united states contain freedman and refugee such a system would inevitably tend to a concentration of power in the executive which would enable he if so dispose to control the action of this numerous class and use they for the attainment of his own political end

 i can not but add another very grave objection to this bill the constitution imperatively declare in connection with taxation that each state shall have at least one representative and fix the rule for the number to which in future time each state shall be entitle it also provide that the senate of the united states shall be compose of two senator from each state and add with peculiar force that no state without its consent shall be deprive of its equal suffrage in the senate the original act be necessarily pass in the absence of the state chiefly to be affect because their people be then contumaciously engage in the rebellion

 now the case be change and some at least of those state be attend congress by loyal representative solicit the allowance of the constitutional right for representation at the time however of the consideration and the passing of this bill there be no senator or representative in congress from the eleven states which be to be mainly affect by its provision the very fact that report be and be make against the good disposition of the people of that portion of the country be an additional reason why they need and should have representative of their own in congress to explain their condition reply to accusation and assist by their local knowledge in the perfecting of measure immediately affect themselves while the liberty of deliberation would then be free and congress would have full power to decide accord to its judgment there could be no objection urge that the states most interested have not be permit to be hear the principle be firmly fix in the mind of the american people that there should be no taxation without representation great burden have now to be bear by all the country and we may well demand that they shall be bear without murmur when they be vote by a majority of the representative of all the people i would not interfere with the unquestionable right of congress to judge each house for itself of the election return and qualification of its own member but that authority can not be construe as include the right to shut out in time of peace any state from the representation to which it be entitle by the constitution at present all the people of eleven states be exclude those who be most faithful during the war not less than other

 the state of tennessee for instance whose authority engage in rebellion be restore to all her constitutional relation to the union by the patriotism and energy of she injure and betray people before the war be bring to a termination they have place themselves in relation with the general government have establish a state government of their own and as they be not include in the emancipation proclamation they by their own act have amend their constitution so as to abolish slavery within the limit of their state i know no reason why the state of tennessee for example should not fully enjoy all her constitutional relation to the united states

 the president of the united states stand toward the country in a somewhat different attitude from that of any member of congress each member of congress be choose from a single district or state the president be choose by the people of all the states as eleven state be not at this time represent in either branch of congress it would seem to be his duty on all proper occasion to present their just claim to congress there always will be difference of opinion in the community and individual may be guilty of transgression of the law but these do not constitute valid objection against the right of a state to representation i would in no wise interfere with the discretion of congress with regard to the qualification of member but i hold it my duty to recommend to you in the interest of peace and the interest of union the admission of every state to its share in public legislation when however insubordinate insurgent or rebellious its people may have be it present itself not only in an attitude of loyalty and harmony but in the person of representative whose loyalty can not be question under any exist constitutional or legal test it be plain that an indefinite or permanent exclusion of any part of the country from representation must be attend by a spirit of disquiet and complaint it be unwise and dangerous to pursue a course of measure which will unite a very large section of the country against another section of the country however much the latter may preponderate the course of emigration the development of industry and business and natural cause will raise up at the south man as devote to the union as those of any other part of the land but if they be all exclude from congress if in a permanent statute they be declare not to be in full constitutional relation to the country they may think they have cause to become a unit in feeling and sentiment against the government under the political education of the american people the idea be inherent and ineradicable that the consent of the majority of the whole people be necessary to secure a willing acquiescence in legislation

 the bill under consideration refer to certain of the states as though they have not be fully restore in all their constitutional relation to the united states if they have not let we at once act together to secure that desirable end at the early possible moment it be hardly necessary for i to inform congress that in my own judgment most of those states so far at least as depend upon their own action have already be fully restore and be to be deem as entitle to enjoy their constitutional right as member of the union reasoning from the constitution itself and from the actual situation of the country i feel not only entitle but bind to assume that with the federal court restore and those of the several states in the full exercise of their function the right and interest of all class of people will with the aid of the military in case of resistance to the law be essentially protect against unconstitutional infringement or violation should this expectation unhappily fail which i do not anticipate then the executive be already fully armed with the power confer by the act of march 1865 establish the freedmen 's bureau and hereafter as heretofore he can employ the land and naval force of the country to suppress insurrection or to overcome obstruction to the law

 in accordance with the constitution i return the bill to the senate in the earnest hope that a measure involve question and interest so important to the country will not become a law unless upon deliberate consideration by the people it shall receive the sanction of an enlighten public judgment

to the senate of the united states

 i regret that the bill which have pass both houses of congress entitle an act to protect all person in the united states in their civil right and furnish the mean of their vindication contain provision which i can not approve consistently with my sense of duty to the whole people and my obligation to the constitution of the united states i be therefore constrain to return it to the senate the house in which it originate with my objection to its become a law

 by the first section of the bill all person bear in the united states and not subject to any foreign power exclude indians not tax be declare to be citizen of the united states this provision comprehend the chinese of the pacific states indians subject to taxation the people call gypsy as well as the entire race designate as black people of color negro mulattoe and person of african blood every individual of these race bear in the united states be by the bill make a citizen of the united states it do not purport to declare or confer any other right of citizenship than federal citizenship it do not purport to give these class of person any status as citizen of states except that which may result from their status as citizen of the united states the power to confer the right of state citizenship be just as exclusively with the several states as the power to confer the right of federal citizenship be with congress

 the right of federal citizenship thus to be confer on the several excepted race before mention be now for the first time propose to be give by law if as be claim by many all person who be native bear already be by virtue of the constitution citizen of the united states the passage of the pende bill can not be necessary to make they such if on the other hand such person be not citizen as may be assume from the propose legislation to make they such the grave question present itself whether when eleven of the thirty six state be unrepresented in congress at the present time it be sound policy to make our entire colored population and all other except class citizen of the united states four million of they have just emerge from slavery into freedom can it be reasonably suppose that they possess the requisite qualification to entitle they to all the privilege and immunity of citizen of the united states have the people of the several states express such a conviction

 it may also be ask whether it be necessary that they should be declare citizen in order that they may be secure in the enjoyment of the civil right propose to be confer by the bill those right be by federal as well as state law secure to all domicile alien and foreigner even before the completion of the process of naturalization and it may safely be assume that the same enactment be sufficient to give like protection and benefit to those for whom this bill provide special legislation besides the policy of the government from its origin to the present time seem to have be that person who be stranger to and unfamiliar with our institution and our law should pass through a certain probation at the end of which before attain the coveted prize they must give evidence of their fitness to receive and to exercise the right of citizen as contemplate by the constitution of the united states the bill in effect propose a discrimination against large number of intelligent worthy and patriotic foreigner and in favor of the negro to whom after long year of bondage the avenue to freedom and intelligence have just now be suddenly open he must of necessity from his previous unfortunate condition of servitude be less informed as to the nature and character of our institution than he who come from abroad have to some extent at least familiarize himself with the principle of a government to which he voluntarily intrust life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

 yet it be now propose by a single legislative enactment to confer the right of citizen upon all person of african descent bear within the extend limit of the united states while person of foreign birth who make our land their home must undergo a probation of five year and can only then become citizen upon proof that they be of good moral character attach to the principle of the constitution of the united states and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same

 the first section of the bill also contain an enumeration of the right to be enjoy by these class so make citizen in every state and territory in the united states these right be to make and enforce contract to sue be party and give evidence to inherit purchase lease sell hold and convey real and personal property and to have full and equal benefit of all law and proceeding for the security of person and property as be enjoy by white citizen so too they be make subject to the same punishment pain and penalty in common with white citizen and to none other thus a perfect equality of the white and colored race be attempt to be fix by federal law in every state of the union over the vast field of state jurisdiction cover by these enumerate right in no one of these can any state ever exercise any power of discrimination between the different race in the exercise of state policy over matter exclusively affect the people of each state it have frequently be think expedient to discriminate between the two race by the statute of some of the states northern as well as southern it be enact for instance that no white person shall intermarry with a negro or mulatto chancellor kent say speak of the black

 marriages between they and the white be forbid in some of the states where slavery do not exist and they be prohibit in all the slaveholde state and when not absolutely contrary to law they be revolt and regard as an offense against public decorum

 i do not say that this bill repeal state law on the subject of marriage between the two race for as the white be forbid to intermarry with the black the black can only make such contract as the white themselves be allow to make and therefore can not under this bill enter into the marriage contract with the white i cite this discrimination however as an instance of the state policy as to discrimination and to inquire whether if congress can abrogate all state law of discrimination between the two race in the matter of real estate of suit and of contract generally congress may not also repeal the state law as to the contract of marriage between the two race

 hitherto every subject embrace in the enumeration of right contain in this bill have be consider as exclusively belong to the states they all relate to the internal police and economy of the respective states they be matter which in each state concern the domestic condition of its people vary in each accord to its own peculiar circumstance and the safety and well being of its own citizen i do not mean to say that upon all these subject there be not federal restraint as for instance in the state power of legislation over contract there be a federal limitation that no state shall pass a law impair the obligation of contract and as to crime that no state shall pass an ex post facto law and as to money that no state shall make anything but gold and silver a legal tender but where can we find a federal prohibition against the power of any state to discriminate as do most of they between alien and citizen between artificial person call corporation and natural person in the right to hold real estate

 if it be grant that congress can repeal all state law discriminate between white and black in the subject cover by this bill why it may be ask may not congress repeal in the same way all state law discriminate between the two race on the subject of suffrage and office if congress can declare by law who shall hold land who shall testify who shall have capacity to make a contract in a state then congress can by law also declare who without regard to color or race shall have the right to sit as a juror or as a judge to hold any office and finally to vote in every state and territory of the united states as respect the territories they come within the power of congress for as to they the lawmaking power be the federal power but as to the states no similar provision exist vest in congress the power to make rule and regulation for they

 the object of the second section of the bill be to afford discriminate protection to colored person in the full enjoyment of all the right secure to they by the precede section it declare

 that any person who under color of any law statute ordinance regulation or custom shall subject or cause to be subject any inhabitant of any state or territory to the deprivation of any right secure or protect by this act or to different punishment pain or penalty on account of such person have at any time be hold in a condition of slavery or involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have be duly convict or by reason of his color or race than be prescribe for the punishment of white person shall be deem guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction shall be punish by fine not exceed $ 1,000 or imprisonment not exceed one year or both in the discretion of the court

 this section seem to be design to apply to some exist or future law of a state or territory which may conflict with the provision of the bill now under consideration it provide for counteract such forbidden legislation by impose fine and imprisonment upon the legislator who may pass such conflict law or upon the officer or agent who shall put or attempt to put they into execution it mean an official offense not a common crime commit against law upon the person or property of the black race such an act may deprive the black man of his property but not of the right to hold property it mean a deprivation of the right itself either by the state judiciary or the state legislature

 it be therefore assume that under this section member of state legislature who should vote for law conflict with the provision of the bill that judge of the state court who should render judgment in antagonism with its term and that marshal and sheriff who should as ministerial officer execute process sanction by state law and issue by state judge in execution of their judgment could be bring before other tribunal and there subject to fine and imprisonment for the performance of the duty which such state law might impose the legislation thus propose invade the judicial power of the state it say to every state court or judge if you decide that this act be unconstitutional if you refuse under the prohibition of a state law to allow a negro to testify if you hold that over such a subject matter the state law be paramount and under color of a state law refuse the exercise of the right to the negro your error of judgment however conscientious shall subject you to fine and imprisonment i do not apprehend that the conflict legislation which the bill seem to contemplate be so likely to occur as to render it necessary at this time to adopt a measure of such doubtful constitutionality

 in the next place this provision of the bill seem to be unnecessary as adequate judicial remedy could be adopt to secure the desire end without invade the immunity of legislator always important to be preserve in the interest of public liberty without assail the independence of the judiciary always essential to the preservation of individual right and without impair the efficiency of ministerial officer always necessary for the maintenance of public peace and order the remedy propose by this section seem to be in this respect not only anomalous but unconstitutional for the constitution guarantee nothing with certainty if it do not insure to the several state the right of make and execute law in regard to all matter arise within their jurisdiction subject only to the restriction that in case of conflict with the constitution and constitutional law of the united states the latter should be hold to be the supreme law of the land

 the third section give the district court of the united states exclusive cognizance of all crime and offense commit against the provision of this act and concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit court of the united states of all civil and criminal case affect person who be deny or can not enforce in the court or judicial tribunal of the state or locality where they may be any of the right secure to they by the first section the construction which i have give to the second section be strengthen by this third section for it make clear what kind of denial or deprivation of the right secure by the first section be in contemplation it be a denial or deprivation of such right in the court or judicial tribunal of the state it stand therefore clear of doubt that the offense and the penalty provide in the second section be intend for the state judge who in the clear exercise of his function as a judge not act ministerially but judicially shall decide contrary to this federal law in other word when a state judge act upon a question involve a conflict between a state law and a federal law and bind accord to his own judgment and responsibility to give an impartial decision between the two come to the conclusion that the state law be valid and the federal law be invalid he must not follow the dictate of his own judgment at the peril of fine and imprisonment the legislative department of the government of the united states thus take from the judicial department of the states the sacred and exclusive duty of judicial decision and convert the state judge into a mere ministerial officer bind to decide accord to the will of congress

 it be clear that in states which deny to person whose right be secure by the first section of the bill any one of those right all criminal and civil case affect they will by the provision of the third section come under the exclusive cognizance of the federal tribunal it follow that if in any state which deny to a colored person any one of all those right that person should commit a crime against the law of a state murder arson rape or any other crime all protection and punishment through the court of the state be take away and he can only be try and punish in the federal court how be the criminal to be try if the offense be provide for and punish by federal law that law and not the state law be to govern it be only when the offense do not happen to be within the purview of federal law that the federal court be to try and punish he under any other law then resort be to be have to the common law as modify and change by state legislation so far as the same be not inconsistent with the constitution and law of the united states

 so that over this vast domain of criminal jurisprudence provide by each state for the protection of its own citizen and for the punishment of all person who violate its criminal law federal law whenever it can be make to apply displace state law the question here naturally arise from what source congress derive the power to transfer to federal tribunal certain class of case embrace in this section the constitution expressly declare that the judicial power of the united states shall extend to all case in law and equity arise under this constitution the law of the united states and treaty make or which shall be make under their authority to all case affect ambassador other public minister and consul to all case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to controversy to which the united states shall be a party to controversy between two or more state between a state and citizen of another state between citizen of different states between citizen of the same state claim land under grant of different states and between a state or the citizen thereof and foreign state citizen or subject here the judicial power of the united states be expressly set forth and define and the act of september 24 1789 establish the judicial court of the united states in confer upon the federal court jurisdiction over case originate in state tribunal be careful to confine they to the class enumerate in the above recite clause of the constitution this section of the bill undoubtedly comprehend case and authorize the exercise of power that be not by the constitution within the jurisdiction of the court of the united states to transfer they to those court would be an exercise of authority well calculate to excite distrust and alarm on the part of all the states for the bill apply alike to all of they as well to those that have as to those that have not be engage in rebellion

 it may be assume that this authority be incident to the power grant to congress by the constitution as recently amend to enforce by appropriate legislation the article declare that

 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have be duly convict shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction

 it can not however be justly claim that with a view to the enforcement of this article of the constitution there be at present any necessity for the exercise of all the power which this bill confer slavery have be abolish and at present nowhere exist within the jurisdiction of the united states nor have there be nor be it likely there will be any attempt to revive it by the people or the states if however any such attempt shall be make it will then become the duty of the general government to exercise any and all incidental power necessary and proper to maintain inviolate this great constitutional law of freedom

 the fourth section of the bill provide that officer and agent of the freedmen 's bureau shall be empower to make arrest and also that other officer may be specially commission for that purpose by the president of the united states it also authorize circuit court of the united states and the superior court of the territories to appoint without limitation commissioner who be to be charge with the performance of quasi judicial duty

 the fifth section empower the commissioner so to be select by the court to appoint in writing under their hand one or more suitable person from time to time to execute warrant and other process describe by the bill these numerous official agent be make to constitute a sort of police in addition to the military and be authorize to summon a posse comitatus and even to call to their aid such portion of the land and naval force of the united states or of the militia as may be necessary to the performance of the duty with which they be charge this extraordinary power be to be confer upon agent irresponsible to the government and to the people to whose number the discretion of the commissioner be the only limit and in whose hand such authority might be make a terrible engine of wrong oppression and fraud the general statute regulate the land and naval force of the united states the militia and the execution of the law be believe to be adequate for every emergency which can occur in time of peace if it should prove otherwise congress can at any time amend those law in such manner as while subserve the public welfare not to jeopard the right interest and liberty of the people

 the seventh section provide that a fee of $ 10 shall be pay to each commissioner in every case bring before he and a fee of $ 5 to his deputy or deputy for each person he or they may arrest and take before any such commissioner with such other fee as may be deem reasonable by such commissioner in general for perform such other duty as may be require in the premise all these fee be to be pay out of the treasury of the united states whether there be a conviction or not but in case of conviction they be to be recoverable from the defendant it seem to i that under the influence of such temptation bad man might convert any law however beneficent into an instrument of persecution and fraud

 by the eighth section of the bill the united states court which sit only in one place for white citizen must migrate with the marshal and district attorney and necessarily with the clerk although he be not mention to any part of the district upon the order of the president and there hold a court for the purpose of the more speedy arrest and trial of person charge with a violation of this act and there the judge and officer of the court must remain upon the order of the president for the time therein designated

 the ninth section authorize the president or such person as he may empower for that purpose to employ such part of the land or naval force of the united states or of the militia as shall be necessary to prevent the violation and enforce the due execution of this act this language seem to imply a permanent military force that be to be always at hand and whose only business be to be the enforcement of this measure over the vast region where it be intend to operate

 i do not propose to consider the policy of this bill to i the detail of the bill seem fraught with evil the white race and the black race of the south have hitherto live together under the relation of master and slave capital own labor now suddenly that relation be change and as to ownership capital and labor be divorce they stand now each master of itself in this new relation one be necessary to the other there will be a new adjustment which both be deeply interested in make harmonious each have equal power in settle the term and if leave to the law that regulate capital and labor it be confidently believe that they will satisfactorily work out the problem capital it be true have more intelligence but labor be never so ignorant as not to understand its own interest not to know its own value and not to see that capital must pay that value

 this bill frustrate this adjustment it intervene between capital and labor and attempt to settle question of political economy through the agency of numerous official whose interest it will be to foment discord between the two race for as the breach widen their employment will continue and when it be close their occupation will terminate

 in all our history in all our experience as a people live under federal and state law no such system as that contemplate by the detail of this bill have ever before be propose or adopt they establish for the security of the colored race safeguard which go infinitely beyond any that the general government have ever provide for the white race in fact the distinction of race and color be by the bill make to operate in favor of the colored and against the white race they interfere with the municipal legislation of the states with the relation exist exclusively between a state and its citizen or between inhabitant of the same state an absorption and assumption of power by the general government which if acquiesce in must sap and destroy our federative system of limited power and break down the barrier which preserve the right of the states it be another step or rather stride toward centralization and the concentration of all legislative power in the national government the tendency of the bill must be to resuscitate the spirit of rebellion and to arrest the progress of those influence which be more closely draw around the states the bond of union and peace

 my lamented predecessor in his proclamation of the 1st of january 1863 order and declare that all person hold as slave within certain states and part of states therein designate be and thenceforward should be free and far that the executive government of the united states include the military and naval authority thereof would recognize and maintain the freedom of such person this guaranty have be render especially obligatory and sacred by the amendment of the constitution abolishing slavery throughout the united states i therefore fully recognize the obligation to protect and defend that class of our people whenever and wherever it shall become necessary and to the full extent compatible with the constitution of the united states

 entertain these sentiment it only remain for i to say that i will cheerfully cooperate with congress in any measure that may be necessary for the protection of the civil right of the freedman as well as those of all other class of person throughout the united states by judicial process under equal and impartial law in conformity with the provision of the federal constitution

 i now return the bill to the senate and regret that in consider the bill and joint resolution forty two in number which have be thus far submit for my approval i be compel to withhold my assent from a second measure that have receive the sanction of both houses of congress

to the house of representatives

 the follow joint resolution restore tennessee to her relation in the union be last evening present for my approval

 whereas in the year 1861 the government of the state of tennessee be seize upon and take possession of by person in hostility to the united states and the inhabitant of say state in pursuance of an act of congress be declare to be in a state of insurrection against the united states and

 whereas say state government can only be restore to its former political relation in the union by the consent of the lawmaking power of the united states and

 whereas the people of say state do on the 22d day of february 1865 by a large popular vote adopt and ratify a constitution of government whereby slavery be abolish and all ordinance and law of secession and debt contract under the same be declare void and

 whereas a state government have be organize under say constitution which have ratify the amendment to the constitution of the united states abolish slavery also the amendment propose by the thirty ninth congress and have do other act proclaim and denote loyalty therefore

 be it resolve by the senate and house of representatives of the united states in congress assemble that the state of tennessee be hereby restore to her former proper practical relation to the union and be again entitle to be represent by senator and representatives in congress

 the preamble simply consist of statement some of which be assume while the resolution be merely a declaration of opinion it comprise no legislation nor do it confer any power which be bind upon the respective houses the executive or the states it do not admit to their seat in congress the senators and representatives from the state of tennessee for notwithstanding the passage of the resolution each house in the exercise of the constitutional right to judge for itself of the election return and qualification of its member may at its discretion admit they or continue to exclude they if a joint resolution of this kind be necessary and binding as a condition precedent to the admission of member of congress it would happen in the event of a veto by the executive that senators and representatives could only be admit to the hall of legislation by a two third vote of each of the houses

 among other reason recite in the preamble for the declaration contain in the resolution be the ratification by the state government of tennessee of the amendment to the constitution of the united states abolish slavery also the amendment propose by the thirty ninth congress if as be also declare in the preamble say state government can only be restore to its former political relation in the union by the consent of the lawmaking power of the united states it would really seem to follow that the joint resolution which at this late day have receive the sanction of congress should have be pass approve and place on the statute book before any amendment to the constitution be submit to the legislature of tennessee for ratification otherwise the inference be plainly deducible that while in the opinion of congress the people of a state may be too strongly disloyal to be entitle to representation they may nevertheless during the suspension of their former proper practical relation to the union have an equally potent voice with other and loyal states in proposition to amend the constitution upon which so essentially depend the stability prosperity and very existence of the nation

 a brief reference to my annual message of the 4th of december last will show the step take by the executive for the restoration to their constitutional relation to the union of the states that have be affect by the rebellion upon the cessation of active hostility provisional governor be appoint convention call governor elect by the people legislature assemble and senators and representatives choose to the congress of the united states

 at the same time the court of the united states be reopen the blockade remove the custom house reestablish and postal operation resume the amendment to the constitution abolishing slavery forever within the limit of the country be also submit to the states and they be thus invite to and do participate in its ratification thus exercise the high function pertain to a state in addition nearly all of these states through their convention and legislature have adopt and ratify constitution of government whereby slavery be abolish and all ordinance and law of secession and debt contract under the same be declare void so far then the political existence of the states and their relation to the federal government have be fully and completely recognize and acknowledge by the executive department of the government and the completion of the work of restoration which have progress so favorably be submit to congress upon which devolve all question pertain to the admission to their seat of the senators and representatives choose from the states whose people have engage in the rebellion

 all these step have be take when on the 4th day of december 1865 the thirty ninth congress assemble nearly eight month have elapse since that time and no other plan of restoration having be propose by congress for the measure institute by the executive it be now declare in the joint resolution submit for my approval that the state of tennessee be hereby restore to her former proper practical relation to the union and be again entitle to be represent by senator and representatives in congress thus after the lapse of nearly eight month congress propose to pave the way to the admission to representation of one of the eleven states whose people array themselves in rebellion against the constitutional authority of the federal government

 earnestly desire to remove every cause of further delay whether real or imaginary on the part of congress to the admission to seat of loyal senators and representatives from the state of tennessee i have notwithstanding the anomalous character of this proceeding affix my signature to the resolution my approval however be not to be construe as an acknowledgment of the right of congress to pass law preliminary to the admission of duly qualified representatives from any of the states neither be it to be consider as commit i to all the statement make in the preamble some of which be in my opinion without foundation in fact especially the assertion that the state of tennessee have ratify the amendment to the constitution of the united states propose by the thirty ninth congress no official notice of such ratification have be receive by the executive or file in the department of state on the contrary unofficial information from the most reliable source induce the belief that the amendment have not yet be constitutionally sanction by the legislature of tennessee the right of each house under the constitution to judge of the election return and qualification of its own member be undoubted and my approval or disapproval of the resolution could not in the slight degree increase or diminish the authority in this respect confer upon the two branch of congress

 in conclusion i can not too earnestly repeat my recommendation for the admission of tennessee and all other states to a fair and equal participation in national legislation when they present themselves in the person of loyal senators and representatives who can comply with all the requirement of the constitution and the law by this mean harmony and reconciliation will be effect the practical relation of all the states to the federal government reestablish and the work of restoration inaugurate upon the termination of the war successfully complete

 william h. seward
 secretary of state

fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives
 after a brief interval the congress of the united states resume its annual legislative labor an all wise and merciful providence have abate the pestilence which visit our shore leave its calamitous trace upon some portion of our country peace order tranquillity and civil authority have be formally declare to exist throughout the whole of the united states in all of the states civil authority have supersede the coercion of arm and the people by their voluntary action be maintain their government in full activity and complete operation the enforcement of the law be no long obstruct in any state by combination too powerful to be suppress by the ordinary course of judicial proceeding and the animosity engender by the war be rapidly yield to the beneficent influence of our free institution and to the kindly effect of unrestricted social and commercial intercourse an entire restoration of fraternal feeling must be the earnest wish of every patriotic heart and we will have accomplish our grand national achievement when forget the sad event of the past and remember only their instructive lesson we resume our onward career as a free prosperous and united people
 in my message of the 4th of december 1865 congress be inform of the measure which have be institute by the executive with a view to the gradual restoration of the states in which the insurrection occur to their relation with the general government provisional governor have be appoint convention call governor elect legislature assemble and senators and representatives choose to the congress of the united states court have be open for the enforcement of law long in abeyance the blockade have be remove custom house reestablish and the internal revenue law put in force in order that the people might contribute to the national income postal operation have be renew and effort be be make to restore they to their former condition of efficiency the states themselves have be ask to take dart in the high function of amend the constitution and of thus sanction the extinction of african slavery as one of the legitimate result of our internecine struggle
 having progress thus far the executive department find that it have accomplish nearly all that be within the scope of its constitutional authority one thing however yet remain to be do before the work of restoration could be complete and that be the admission to congress of loyal senators and representatives from the states whose people have rebel against the lawful authority of the general government this question devolve upon the respective houses which by the constitution be make the judge of the election return and qualification of their own member and its consideration at once engage the attention of congress
 in the meantime the executive department no other plan having be propose by congress continue its effort to perfect as far as be practicable the restoration of the proper relation between the citizen of the respective states the states and the federal government extend from time to time as the public interest seem to require the judicial revenue and postal system of the country with the advice and consent of the senate the necessary officer be appoint and appropriation make by congress for the payment of their salary the proposition to amend the federal constitution so as to prevent the existence of slavery within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction be ratify by the requisite number of states and on the 18th day of december 1865 it be officially declare to have become valid as a part of the constitution of the united states all of the states in which the insurrection have exist promptly amend their constitution so as to make they conform to the great change thus effect in the organic law of the land declare null and void all ordinance and law of secession repudiate all pretend debt and obligation create for the revolutionary purpose of the insurrection and proceed in good faith to the enactment of measure for the protection and amelioration of the condition of the colored race congress however yet hesitate to admit any of these states to representation and it be not until toward the close of the eighth month of the session that an exception be make in favor of tennessee by the admission of her senators and representatives
 i deem it a subject of profound regret that congress have thus far fail to admit to seat loyal senators and representatives from the other states whose inhabitant with those of tennessee have engage in the rebellion ten state more than one fourth of the whole number remain without representation the seat of fifty member in the house of representatives and of twenty member in the senate be yet vacant not by their own consent not by a failure of election but by the refusal of congress to accept their credential their admission it be believe would have accomplish much toward the renewal and strengthening of our relation as one people and remove serious cause for discontent on the part of the inhabitant of those states it would have accord with the great principle enunciate in the declaration of american independence that no people ought to bear the burden of taxation and yet be deny the right of representation it would have be in consonance with the express provision of the constitution that each state shall have at least one representative and that no state without its consent shall be deprive of its equal suffrage in the senate these provision be intend to secure to every state and to the people of every state the right of representation in each house of congress and so important be it deem by the framer of the constitution that the equality of the states in the senate should be preserve that not even by an amendment of the constitution can any state without its consent be deny a voice in that branch of the national legislature
 it be true it have be assume that the existence of the states be terminate by the rebellious act of their inhabitant and that the insurrection having be suppress they be thenceforward to be consider merely as conquer territory the legislative executive and judicial department of the government have however with heat distinctness and uniform consistency refuse to sanction an assumption so incompatible with the nature of our republican system and with the profess object of the war throughout the recent legislation of congress the undeniable fact make itself apparent that these ten political community be nothing less than state of this union at the very commencement of the rebellion each house declare with a unanimity as remarkable as it be significant that the war be not wage upon our part in any spirit of oppression nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation nor purpose of overthrow or interfere with the right or establish institution of those states but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the constitution and all law make in pursuance thereof and to preserve the union with all the dignity equality and right of the several states unimpaire and that as soon as these object be accomplish the war ought to cease in some instance senators be permit to continue their legislative function while in other instance representatives be elect and admit to seat after their states have formally declare their right to withdraw from the union and be endeavor to maintain that right by force of arm all of the states whose people be in insurrection as states be include in the apportionment of the direct tax of $ 20,000,000 annually lay upon the united states by the act approve 5th august 1861 congress by the act of march 4 1862 and by the apportionment of representation thereunder also recognize their presence as states in the union and they have for judicial purpose be divide into district as states alone can be divide the same recognition appear in the recent legislation in reference to tennessee which evidently rest upon the fact that the function of the state be not destroy by the rebellion but merely suspend and that principle be of course applicable to those states which like tennessee attempt to renounce their place in the union
 the action of the executive department of the government upon this subject have be equally definite and uniform and the purpose of the war be specifically state in the proclamation issue by my predecessor on the 22d day of september 1862 it be then solemnly proclaim and declare that hereafter as heretofore the war will be prosecute for the object of practically restore the constitutional relation between the united states and each of the states and the people thereof in which state that relation be or may be suspend or disturb
 the recognition of the states by the judicial department of the government have also be dear and conclusive in all proceeding affect they as states have in the supreme circuit and district court in the admission of senators and representatives from any and all of the states there can be no just ground of apprehension that person who be disloyal will be clothe with the power of legislation for this could not happen when the constitution and the law be enforce by a vigilant and faithful congress each house be make the judge of the election return and qualification of its own member and may with the concurrence of two third expel a member when a senator or representative present his certificate of election he may at once be admit or reject or should there be any question as to his eligibility his credential may be refer for investigation to the appropriate committee if admit to a seat it must be upon evidence satisfactory to the house of which he thus become a member that he possess the requisite constitutional and legal qualification if refuse admission as a member for want of due allegiance to the government and return to his constituent they be admonish that none but person loyal to the united states will be allow a voice in the legislative council of the nation and the political power and moral influence of congress be thus effectively exert in the interest of loyalty to the government and fidelity to the union upon this question so vitally affect the restoration of the union and the permanency of our present form of government my conviction heretofore express have undergo no change but on the contrary their correctness have be confirm by reflection and time if the admission of loyal member to seat in the respective houses of congress be wise and expedient a year ago it be no less wise and expedient now if this anomalous condition be right now if in the exact condition of these states at the present time it be lawful to exclude they from representation i do not see that the question will be change by the efflux of time ten year hence if these state remain as they be the right of representation will be no strong the right of exclusion will be no weak
 the constitution of the united states make it the duty of the president to recommend to the consideration of congress such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient i know of no measure more imperatively demand by every consideration of national interest sound policy and equal justice than the admission of loyal member from the now unrepresented states this would consummate the work of restoration and exert a most salutary influence in the reestablishment of peace harmony and fraternal feeling it would tend greatly to renew the confidence of the american people in the vigor and stability of their institution it would bind we more closely together as a nation and enable we to show to the world the inherent and recuperative power of a government found upon the will of the people and establish upon the principle of liberty justice and intelligence our increased strength and enhanced prosperity would irrefragably demonstrate the fallacy of the argument against free institution draw from our recent national disorder by the enemy of republican government the admission of loyal member from the states now exclude from congress by allay doubt and apprehension would turn capital now await an opportunity for investment into the channel of trade and industry it would alleviate the present troubled condition of those states and by induce emigration aid in the settlement of fertile region now uncultivated and lead to an increase production of those staple which have add so greatly to the wealth of the nation and commerce of the world new field of enterprise would be open to our progressive people and soon the devastation of war would be repair and all trace of our domestic difference efface from the mind of our countryman
 in our effort to preserve the unity of government which constitute as one people by restore the states to the condition which they hold prior to the rebellion we should be cautious lest having rescue our nation from peril of threatened disintegration we resort to consolidation and in the end absolute despotism as a remedy for the recurrence of similar trouble the war having terminate and with it all occasion for the exercise of power of doubtful constitutionality we should hasten to bring legislation within the boundary prescribe by the constitution and to return to the ancient landmark establish by our father for the guidance of succeed generation
 the constitution which at any time exist till change by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people be sacredly obligatory upon all if in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional power be in any particular wrong let it be correct by an amendment in the way which the constitution designate but let there be no change by usurpation for it be the customary weapon by which free government be destroy
 washington speak these word to his countryman when follow by their love and gratitude he voluntarily retire from the care of public life to keep in all thing within the pale of our constitutional power and cherish the federal union as the only rock of safety be prescribe by jefferson as rule of action to endear to his countryman the true principle of their constitution and promote a union of sentiment and action equally auspicious to their happiness and safety jackson hold that the action of the general government should always be strictly confine to the sphere of its appropriate duty and justly and forcibly urge that our government be not to be maintain nor our union preserve by invasion of the right and power of the several states in thus attempt to make our general government strong we make it weak its true strength consist in leave individual and states as much as possible to themselves in make itself feel not in its power but in its beneficence not in its control but in its protection not in bind the states more closely to the center but leave each to move unobstructed in its proper constitutional orbit these be the teaching of man whose deed and service have make they illustrious and who long since withdraw from the scene of life have leave to their country the rich legacy of their example their wisdom and their patriotism draw fresh inspiration from their lesson let we emulate they in love of country and respect for the constitution and the law
 the report of the secretary of the treasury afford much information respect the revenue and commerce of the country his view upon the currency and with reference to a proper adjustment of our revenue system internal as well as impost be commend to the careful consideration of congress in my last annual message i express my general view upon these subject i need now only call attention to the necessity of carry into every department of the government a system of rigid accountability thorough retrenchment and wise economy with no exceptional nor unusual expenditure the oppressive burden of taxation can be lessen by such a modification of our revenue law as will be consistent with the public faith and the legitimate and necessary want of the government

 i have regard the expedition as not only political in its nature but as also in a great measure foreign from the united states in its cause character and object the attempt be understand to be make in sympathy with an insurgent party in ireland and by strike at a british province on this continent be design to aid in obtain redress for political grievance which it be assume the people of ireland have suffer at the hand of the british government during a period of several century the person engage in it be chiefly native of that country some of whom have while other have not become citizen of the united states under our general law of naturalization complaint of misgovernment in ireland continually engage the attention of the british nation and so great an agitation be now prevail in ireland that the british government have deem it necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in that country these circumstance must necessarily modify the opinion which we might otherwise have entertain in regard to an expedition expressly prohibit by our neutrality law so long as those law remain upon our statute book they should be faithfully execute and if they operate harshly unjustly or oppressively congress alone can apply the remedy by their modification or repeal
 political and commercial interest of the united states be not unlikely to be affect in some degree by event which be transpire in the eastern region of europe and the time seem to have come when our government ought to have a proper diplomatic representation in greece
 this government have claim for all person not convict or accuse or suspect of crime an absolute political right of self expatriation and a choice of new national allegiance most of the european states have dissent from this principle and have claim a right to hold such of their subject as have emigrate to and be naturalize in the united states and afterwards return on transient visit to their native country to the performance of military service in like manner as resident subject complaint arise from the claim in this respect make by foreign state have heretofore be matter of controversy between the united states and some of the european power and the irritation consequent upon the failure to settle this question increase during the war in which prussia italy and austria be recently engage while great britain have never acknowledge the right of expatriation she have not for some year past practically insist upon the opposite doctrine france have be equally forbear and prussia have propose a compromise which although evince increase liberality have not be accept by the united states peace be now prevail everywhere in europe and the present seem to be a favorable time for an assertion by congress of the principle so long maintain by the executive department that naturalization by one state fully exempt the native bear subject of any other state from the performance of military service under any foreign government so long as he do not voluntarily renounce its right and benefit
 in the performance of a duty impose upon i by the constitution i have thus submit to the representative of the states and of the people such information of our domestic and foreign affair as the public interest seem to require our government be now undergo its most try ordeal and my earnest prayer be that the peril may be successfully and finally pass without impair its original strength and symmetry the interest of the nation be good to be promote by the revival of fraternal relation the complete obliteration of our past difference and the reinauguration of all the pursuit of peace direct our effort to the early accomplishment of these great end let we endeavor to preserve harmony between the coordinate department of the government that each in its proper sphere may cordially cooperate with the other in secure the maintenance of the constitution the preservation of the union and the perpetuity of our free institution

to the senate of the united states
 i return to the senate in which house it originate a bill entitle an act to admit the state of colorado into the union to which i can not consistently with my sense of duty give my approval with the exception of an additional section contain new provision it be substantially the same as the bill of a similar title pass by congress during the last session submit to the president for his approval return with the objection contain in a message beating date the 15th of may last and yet await the reconsideration of the senate
 a second bill have in view the same purpose have now pass both houses of congress and be present for my signature having again carefully consider the subject i have be unable to perceive any reason for change the opinion which have already be communicate to congress i find on the contrary that there be many objection to the propose legislation of which i be not at that time aware and that while several of those which i then assign have in the interval gain in strength yet other have be create by the altered character of the measure now submit
 the constitution under which the state government be propose to be form very properly contain a provision that all law in force at the time of its adoption and the admission of the state into the union shall continue as if the constitution have not be adopt among those law be one absolutely prohibit negro and mulatto from vote at the recent session of the territorial legislature a bill for the repeal of this law introduce into the council be almost unanimously reject and at the very time when congress be engage in enact the bill now under consideration the legislature pass an act exclude negro and mulatto from the right to sit as juror this bill be veto by the governor of the territory who hold that by the law of the united states negro and mulatto be citizen and subject to the duty as well as entitle to the right of citizenship the bill however be pass the objection of the governor to the contrary notwithstanding and be now a law of the territory yet in the bill now before i by which it be propose to admit the territory as a state it be provide that there shall be no denial of the elective franchise or any other right to any person by reason of race or color except indians not tax
 the incongruity thus exhibit between the legislation of congress and that of the territory take in connection with the protest against the admission of the state hereinafter refer to would seem clearly to indicate the impolicy and injustice of the propose enactment
 it might indeed be a subject of grave inquiry and doubtless will result in such inquiry if this bill become a law whether it do not attempt to exercise a power not confer upon congress by the federal constitution that instrument simply declare that congress may admit new states into the union it nowhere say that congress may make new states for the purpose of admit they into the union or for any other purpose and yet this bill be as clear an attempt to make the institution as any in which the people themselves could engage
 in view of this action of congress the house of representative of the territory have earnestly protest against be force into the union without first have the question submit to the people nothing would be more reasonable than the position which they thus assume and it certainly can not be the purpose of congress to force upon a community against their will a government which they do not believe themselves capable of sustain
 the following be a copy of the protest allude to as officially transmit to i
 whereas it be announce in the public print that it be the intention of congress to admit colorado as a state into the union therefore
 resolve by the house of representative of the territory that represent as we do the last and only legal expression of public opinion on this question we earnestly protest against the passage of a law admit the state without first have the question submit to a vote of the people for the reason first that we have a right to a voice in the selection of the character of our government second that we have not a sufficient population to support the expense of a state government for these reason we trust that congress will not force upon we a government against our will
 upon information which i consider reliable i assume in my message of the 15th of may last that the population of colorado be not more than 30,000 and express the opinion that this number be entirely too small either to assume the responsibility or to enjoy the privilege of a state
 it appear that previous to that time the legislature with a view to ascertain the exact condition of the territory have pass a law authorize a census of the population to be take the law make it the duty of the assessor in the several county to take the census in connection with the annual assessment and in order to secure a correct enumeration of the population allow they a liberal compensation for the service by pay they for every name return and add to their previous oath of office an oath to perform this duty with fidelity
 from the accompany official report it appear that return have be receive from fifteen of the eighteen county into which the state be divide and that their population amount in the aggregate to 24,909 the three remain county be estimate to contain 3,000 make a total population of 27,909
 this census be take in the summer season when it be claim that the population be much large than at any other period as in the autumn miner in large number leave their work and return to the east with the result of their summer enterprise
 the population it will be observe be but slightly in excess of one fifth of the number require as the basis of representation for a single congressional district in any of the states the number be 127,000
 i be unable to perceive any good reason for such great disparity in the right of representation give as it would to the people of colorado not only this vast advantage in the house of representatives but an equality in the senate where the other states be represent by million with perhaps a single exception no such inequality as this have ever before be attempt i know that it be claim that the population of the different states at the time of their admission have vary at different period but it have not vary much more than the population of each decade and the corresponding basis of representation for the different period
 the obvious intent of the constitution be that no state should be admit with a less population than the ratio for a representative at the time of application the limitation in the second section of the first article of the constitution declare that each state shall have at least one representative be manifestly design to protect the states which originally compose the union from be deprive in the event of a wane population of a voice in the popular branch of congress and be never intend as a warrant to force a new state into the union with a representative population far below that which might at the time be require of sister member of the confederacy this bill in view of the prohibition of the same section which declare that the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every 30,000 be at least a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the constitution
 it be respectfully submit that however congress under the pressure of circumstance may have admit two or three states with less than a representative population at the time there have be no instance in which an application for admission have ever be entertain when the population as officially ascertain be below 30,000
 be there any doubt of this be the true construction of the constitution it would be dispel by the early and long continue practice of the federal government for nearly sixty year after the adoption of the constitution no state be admit with a population believe at the time to be less than the current ratio for a representative and the first instance in which there appear to have be a departure from the principle be in 1845 in the case of florida obviously the result of sectional strife we would do well to regard it as a warning of evil rather than as be example for imitation and i think candid man of all party will agree that the inspiring cause of the violation of this wholesome principle of restraint be to be find in a vain attempt to balance these antagonism which refuse to be reconcile except through the bloody arbitrament of arm the plain fact of our history will attest that the great and leading states admit since 1845 viz iowa wisconsin california minnesota and kansas include texas which be admit that year have all come with an ample population for one representative and some of they with nearly or quite enough for two
 to demonstrate the correctness of my view on this question i subjoin a table contain a list of the states admit since the adoption of the federal constitution with the date of admission the ratio of representation and the representative population when admit deduce from the united states census table the calculation be make for the period of the decade correspond with the date of admission
 colorado which it be now propose to admit as a state contain as have already be state a population less than 28,000 while the present ratio of representation be 127,000
 there can be no reason that i can perceive for the admission of colorado that would not apply with equal force to nearly every other territory now organize and i submit whether if this bill become a law it will be possible to resist the logical conclusion that such territories as dakota montana and idaho must be receive as states whenever they present themselves without regard to the number of inhabitant they may respectively contain eight or ten new senators and four or five new member of the house of representatives would thus be admit to represent a population scarcely exceed that which in any other portion of the nation be entitle to but a single member of the house of representatives while the average for two senators in the union as now constitute be at least 1,000,000 people it would surely be unjust to all other section of the union to enter upon a policy with regard to the admission of new states which might result in confer such a disproportionate share of influence in the national legislature upon community which in pursuance of the wise policy of our father should for some year to come be retain under the foster care and protection of the national government if it be deem just and expedient now to depart from the settle policy of the nation during all its history and to admit all the territories to the right and privilege of states irrespective of their population or fitness for such government it be submit whether it would not be well to devise such measure as will bring the subject before the country for consideration and decision this would seem to be eminently wise because as have already be state if it be right to admit colorado now there be no reason for the exclusion of the other territories
 it be no answer to these suggestion that an enable act be pass authorize the people of colorado to take action on this subject it be well know that that act be pass in consequence of representation that the population reach accord to some statement as high as 80,000 and to none less than 50,000 and be grow with a rapidity which by the time the admission could be consummate would secure a population of over 100,000 these representation prove to have be wholly fallacious and in addition the people of the territory by a deliberate vote decide that they would not assume the responsibility of a state government by that decision they utterly exhaust all power that be confer by the enable act and there have be no step take since in relation to the admission that have have the slight sanction or warrant of law
 the proceeding upon which the present application be base be in the utter absence of all law in relation to it and there be no evidence that the vote on the question of the formation of a state government bear any relation whatever to the sentiment of the territory the protest of the house of representatives previously quote be conclusive evidence to the contrary
 but if none of these reason exist against this propose enactment the bill itself besides be inconsistent in its provision in confer power upon a person unknown to the law and who may never have a legal existence be so frame as to render its execution almost impossible it be indeed a question whether it be not in itself a nullity to say the least it be of exceedingly doubtful propriety to confer the power propose in this bill upon the governor elect for as by its own term the constitution be not to take effect until after the admission of the state he in the meantime have no more authority than any other private citizen but even suppose he to be clothe with sufficient authority to convene the legislature what constitute the state legislature to which be to be refer the submission of the condition impose by congress be it a new body to be elect and convene by proclamation of the governor elect or be it that body which meet more than a year ago under the provision of the state constitution by reference to the second section of the schedule and to the eighteenth section of the fourth article of the state constitution it will be see that the term of the member of the house of representative and that of one half of the member of the senate expire on the first monday of the present month it be clear that if there be no intrinsic objection to the bill itself in relation to purpose to be accomplish this objection would be fatal as it be apparent that the provision of the third section of the bill to admit colorado have reference to a period and a state of fact entirely different from the present and affair as they now exist and if carry into effect must necessarily lead to confusion
 even if it be settle that the old and not a new body be to act it would be find impracticable to execute the law because a considerable number of the member as i be inform have cease to be resident of the territory and in the sixty day within which the legislature be to be convene after the passage of the act there would not be sufficient time to fill the vacancy by new election be there any authority under which they could be hold
 it may not be improper to add that if these proceeding be all regular and the result to be obtain be desirable simple justice to the people of the territory would require a long period than sixty day within which to obtain action on the condition propose by the third section of the bill there be as be well know large portion of the territory with which there be and can be no general communication there be several county which from november to may can only be reach by person travel on foot while with other region of the territory occupy by a large portion of the population there be very little more freedom of access thus if this bill should become a law it would be impracticable to obtain any expression of public sentiment in reference to its provision with a view to enlighten the legislature if the old body be call together and of course equally impracticable to procure the election of a new body this defect might have be remedie by an extension of the time and a submission of the question to the people with a fair opportunity to enable they to express their sentiment
 the admission of a new state have generally be regard as an epoch in our history mark the onward progress of the nation but after the most careful and anxious inquiry on the subject i can not perceive that the propose proceeding be in conformity with the policy which from the origin of the government have uniformly prevail in the admission of new states i therefore return the bill to the senate without my signature

to the senate of the united states
 i return for reconsideration a bill entitle an act for the admission of the state of nebraska into the union which originate in the senate and have receive the assent of both houses of congress a bill have in view the same object be present for my approval a few hour prior to the adjournment of the last session but submit at a time when there be no opportunity for a proper consideration of the subject i withhold my signature and the measure fail to become a law
 it appear by the preamble of this bill that the people of nebraska avail themselves of the authority confer upon they by the act pass on the 19th day of april 1864 have adopt a constitution which upon due examination be find to conform to the provision and comply with the condition of say act and to be republican in its form of government and that they now ask for admission into the union this propose law would therefore seem to be base upon the declaration contain in the enable act that upon compliance with its term the people of nebraska should be admit into the union upon an equal footing with the original states reference to the bill however show that while by the first section congress distinctly accept ratifie and confirm the constitution and state government which the people of the territory have form for themselves declare nebraska to be one of the united states of america and admit she into the union upon an equal footing with the original states in all respect whatsoever the third section provide that this measure shall not take effect except upon the fundamental condition that within the state of nebraska there shall be no denial of the elective franchise or of any other right to any person by reason of race or color except indians not tax and upon the further fundamental condition that the legislature of say state by a solemn public act shall declare the assent of say state to the say fundamental condition and shall transmit to the president of the united states an authentic copy of say act upon receipt whereof the president by proclamation shall forthwith announce the fact whereupon say fundamental condition shall be hold as a part of the organic law of the state and thereupon and without any further proceeding on the part of congress the admission of say state into the union shall be consider as complete this condition be not mention in the original enable act be not contemplate at the time of its passage be not seek by the people themselves have not heretofore be apply to the inhabitant of any state ask admission and be in direct conflict with the constitution adopt by the people and declare in the preamble to be republican in its form of government for in that instrument the exercise of the elective franchise and the right to hold office be expressly limit to white citizen of the united states congress thus undertake to authorize and compel the legislature to change a constitution which it be declare in the preamble have receive the sanction of the people and which by this bill be accept ratify and confirm by the congress of the nation
 the first and third section of the bill exhibit yet further incongruity by the one nebraska be admit into the union upon an equal footing with the original states in all respect whatsoever while by the other congress demand as a condition precedent to her admission requirement which in our history have never be ask of any people when present a constitution and state government for the acceptance of the lawmaking power it be expressly declare by the third section that the bill shall not take effect except upon the fundamental condition that within the state of nebraska there shall be no denial of the elective franchise or of any other right to any person by reason of race or color except indians not tax neither more nor less than the assertion of the right of congress to regulate the elective franchise of any state hereafter to be admit this condition be in clear violation of the federal constitution under the provision of which from the very foundation of the government each state have be leave free to determine for itself the qualification necessary for the exercise of suffrage within its limit without precedent in our legislation it be in mark contrast with those limitation which impose upon states that from time to time have become member of the union have for their object the single purpose of prevent any infringement of the constitution of the country
 if congress be satisfied that nebraska at the present time possess sufficient population to entitle she to full representation in the council of the nation and that her people desire an exchange of a territorial for a state government good faith would seem to demand that she should be admit without further requirement than those express in the enable act with all of which it be assert in the preamble her inhabitant have comply congress may under the constitution admit new states or reject they but the people of a state can alone make or change their organic law and prescribe the qualification requisite for elector congress however in pass the bill in the shape in which it have be submit for my approval do not merely reject the application of the people of nebraska for present admission as a state into the union on the ground that the constitution which they have submit restrict the exercise of the elective franchise to the white population but impose condition which if accept by the legislature may without the consent of the people so change the organic law as to make elector of all person within the state without distinction of race or color in view of this fact i suggest for the consideration of congress whether it would not be just expedient and in accordance with the principle of our government to allow the people by popular vote or through a convention choose by themselves for that purpose to declare whether or not they will accept the term upon which it be now propose to admit they into the union this course would not occasion much great delay than that which the bill contemplate when it require that the legislature shall be convene within thirty day after this measure shall have become a law for the purpose of consider and decide the condition which it impose and gain additional force when we consider that the proceeding attend the formation of the state constitution be not in conformity with the provision of the enable act that in an aggregate vote of 7,776 the majority in favor of the constitution do not exceed 100 and that it be allege that in consequence of fraud even this result can not be receive as a fair expression of the wish of the people as upon they must fall the burden of a state organization it be but just that they should be permit to determine for themselves a question which so materially affect their interest possess a soil and a climate admirably adapt to those industrial pursuit which bring prosperity and greatness to a people with the advantage of a central position on the great highway that will soon connect the atlantic and pacific states nebraska be rapidly gain in number and wealth and may within a very brief period claim admission on ground which will challenge and secure universal assent she can therefore wisely and patiently afford to wait her population be say to be steadily and even rapidly increase be now generally concede as high as 40,000 and estimate by some whose judgment be entitle to respect at a still great number at her present rate of growth she will in a very short time have the requisite population for a representative in congress and what be far more important to her own citizen will have realize such an advance in material wealth as will enable the expense of a state government to be bear without oppression to the taxpayer of new community it may be say with special force and it be true of old one that the inducement to emigrant other thing be equal be in almost the precise ratio of the rate of taxation the great states of the northwest owe their marvelous prosperity largely to the fact that they be continue as territories until they have grow to be wealthy and populous community
 andrew johnson

to the house of representatives
 i have examine the bill to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel states with the care and anxiety which its transcendent importance be calculate to awaken i be unable to give it my assent for reason so grave that i hope a statement of they may have some influence on the mind of the patriotic and enlighten man with whom the decision must ultimately rest
 the bill place all the people of the ten states therein name under the absolute domination of military ruler and the preamble undertake to give the reason upon which the measure be base and the ground upon which it be justify it declare that there exist in those state no legal government and no adequate protection for life or property and assert the necessity of enforce peace and good order within their limit be this true as matter of fact
 it be not deny that the states in question have each of they an actual government with all the power executive judicial and legislative which properly belong to a free state they be organize like the other states of the union and like they they make administer and execute the law which concern their domestic affair an exist de facto government exercise such function as these be itself the law of the state upon all matter within its jurisdiction to pronounce the supreme lawmaking power of an establish state illegal be to say that law itself be unlawful
 the provision which these government have make for the preservation of order the suppression of crime and the redress of private injury be in substance and principle the same as those which prevail in the northern states and in other civilized country they certainly have not succeed in prevent the commission of all crime nor have this be accomplish anywhere in the world there as well as elsewhere offender sometimes escape for want of vigorous prosecution and occasionally perhaps by the inefficiency of court or the prejudice of juror it be undoubtedly true that these evil have be much increase and aggravate north and south by the demoralize influence of civil war and by the rancorous passion which the contest have engender but that these people be maintain local government for themselves which habitually defeat the object of all government and render their own life and property insecure be in itself utterly improbable and the averment of the bill to that effect be not support by any evidence which have come to my knowledge all the information i have on the subject convince i that the masse of the southern people and those who control their public act while they entertain diverse opinion on question of federal policy be completely unite in the effort to reorganize their society on the basis of peace and to restore their mutual prosperity as rapidly and as completely as their circumstance will permit
 the bill however would seem to show upon its face that the establishment of peace and good order be not its real object the fifth section declare that the precede section shall cease to operate in any state where certain event shall have happen these event be first the selection of delegate to a state convention by an election at which negro shall be allow to vote second the formation of a state constitution by the convention so choose third the insertion into the state constitution of a provision which will secure the right of voting at all election to negro and to such white man as may not be disfranchise for rebellion or felony fourth the submission of the constitution for ratification to negro and white man not disfranchise and its actual ratification by their vote fifth the submission of the state constitution to congress for examination and approval and the actual approval of it by that body sixth the adoption of a certain amendment to the federal constitution by a vote of the legislature elect under the new constitution seventh the adoption of say amendment by a sufficient number of other states to make it a part of the constitution of the united states all these condition must be fulfil before the people of any of these states can be relieve from the bondage of military domination but when they be fulfil then immediately the pain and penalty of the bill be to cease no matter whether there be peace and order or not and without any reference to the security of life or property the excuse give for the bill in the preamble be admit by the bill itself not to be real the military rule which it establish be plainly to be use not for any purpose of order or for the prevention of crime but solely as a means of coerce the people into the adoption of principle and measure to which it be know that they be opposed and upon which they have an undeniable right to exercise their own judgment
 i submit to congress whether this measure be not in its whole character scope and object without precedent and without authority in palpable conflict with the plain provision of the constitution and utterly destructive to those great principle of liberty and humanity for which our ancestor on both side of the atlantic have shed so much blood and expend so much treasure
 the ten states name in the bill be divide into five district for each district an officer of the army not below the rank of a brigadier general be to be appoint to rule over the people and he be to be support with an efficient military force to enable he to perform his duty and enforce his authority those duty and that authority as define by the third section of the bill be to protect all person in their right of person and property to suppress insurrection disorder and violence and to punish or cause to be punish all disturber of the public peace or criminal the power thus give to the command officer over all the people of each district be that of an absolute monarch his mere will be to take the place of all law the law of the states be now the only rule applicable to the subject place under his control and that be completely displace by the clause which declare all interference of state authority to be null and void he alone be permit to determine what be right of person or property and he may protect they in such way as in his discretion may seem proper it place at his free disposal all the land and good in his district and he may distribute they without let or hindrance to whom he please be bind by no state law and there be no other law to regulate the subject he may make a criminal code of his own and he can make it as bloody as any record in history or he can reserve the privilege of act upon the impulse of his private passion in each case that arise he be bind by no rule of evidence there be indeed no provision by which he be authorize or require to take any evidence at all everything be a crime which he choose to call so and all person be condemn whom he pronounce to be guilty he be not bind to keep any record or make any report of his proceeding he may arrest his victim wherever he find they without warrant accusation or proof of probable cause if he give they a trial before he inflict the punishment he give it of his grace and mercy not because he be command so to do
 to a casual reader of the bill it might seem that some kind of trial be secure by it to person accuse of crime but such be not the case the officer may allow local civil tribunal to try offender but of course this do not require that he shall do so if any state or federal court presume to exercise its legal jurisdiction by the trial of a malefactor without his special permission he can break it up and punish the judge and juror as be themselves malefactor he can save his friend from justice and despoil his enemy contrary to justice
 it be also provide that he shall have power to organize military commission or tribunal but this power he be not command to exercise it be merely permissive and be to be use only when in his judgment it may be necessary for the trial of offender even if the sentence of a commission be make a prerequisite to the punishment of a party it would be scarcely the slight check upon the officer who have authority to organize it as he please prescribe its mode of proceeding appoint its member from his own subordinate and revise all its decision instead of mitigate the harshness of his single rule such a tribunal would be use much more probably to divide the responsibility of make it more cruel and unjust
 several provision dictate by the humanity of congress have be insert in the bill apparently to restrain the power of the command officer but it seem to i that they be of no avail for that purpose the fourth section provide first that trial shall not be unnecessarily delay but i think i have show that the power be give to punish without trial and if so this provision be practically inoperative second cruel or unusual punishment be not to be inflict but who be to decide what be cruel and what be unusual the word have acquire a legal meaning by long use in the court can it be expect that military officer will understand or follow a rule express in language so purely technical and not pertain in the least degree to their profession if not then each officer may define cruelty accord to his own temper and if it be not usual he will make it usual corporal punishment imprisonment the gag the ball and chain and all the almost insupportable form of torture invent for military punishment lie within the range of choice third the sentence of a commission be not to be execute without be approve by the commander if it affect life or liberty and a sentence of death must be approve by the president this apply to ease in which there have be a trial and sentence i take it to be clear under this bill that the military commander may condemn to death without even the form of a trial by a military commission so that the life of the condemn may depend upon the will of two man instead of one
 it be plain that the authority here give to the military officer amount to absolute despotism but to make it still more unendurable the bill provide that it may be delegate to as many subordinate as he choose to appoint for it declare that he shall punish or cause to be punish such a power have not be wield by any monarch in england for more than five hundred year in all that time no people who speak the english language have bear such servitude it reduce the whole population of the ten states all person of every color sex and condition and every stranger within their limit to the most abject and degrading slavery no master ever have a control so absolute over the slave as this bill give to the military officer over both white and colored person
 it may be answer to this that the officer of the army be too magnanimous just and humane to oppress and trample upon a subjugate people i do not doubt that army officer be as well entitled to this kind of confidence as any other class of man but the history of the world have be write in vain if it do not teach we that unrestrained authority can never be safely trust in human hand it be almost sure to be more or less abuse under any circumstance and it have always result in gross tyranny where the ruler who exercise it be stranger to their subject and come among they as the representative of a distant power and more especially when the power that send they be unfriendly government closely resemble that here propose have be fairly try in hungary and poland and the suffering endure by those people rouse the sympathy of the entire world it be try in ireland and though temper at first by principle of english law it give birth to cruelty so atrocious that they be never recount without just indignation the french convention arm its deputy with this power and send they to the southern department of the republic the massacre murder and other atrocity which they commit show what the passion of the able man in the most civilized society will tempt they to do when wholly unrestrained by law
 the man of our race in every age have struggle to tie up the hand of their government and keep they within the law because their own experience of all mankind teach they that ruler could not be rely on to concede those right which they be not legally bind to respect the head of a great empire have sometimes govern it with a mild and paternal sway but the kindness of an irresponsible deputy never yield what the law do not extort from he between such a master and the people subject to his domination there can be nothing but enmity he punish they if they resist his authority and if they submit to it he hate they for their servility
 i come now to a question which be if possible still more important have we the power to establish and carry into execution a measure like this i answer certainly not if we derive our authority from the constitution and if we be bind by the limitation which it impose
 this proposition be perfectly clear that no branch of the federal government executive legislative or judicial can have any just power except those which it derive through and exercise under the organic law of the union outside of the constitution we have no legal authority more than private citizen and within it we have only so much as that instrument give we this broad principle limit all our function and apply to all subject it protect not only the citizen of states which be within the union but it shield every human being who come or be bring under our jurisdiction we have no right to do in one place more than in another that which the constitution say we shall not do at all if therefore the southern states be in truth out of the union we could not treat their people in a way which the fundamental law forbid
 some person assume that the success of our arm in crush the opposition which be make in some of the states to the execution of the federal law reduce those states and all their people the innocent as well as the guilty to the condition of vassalage and give we a power over they which the constitution do not bestow or define or limit no fallacy can be more transparent than this our victory subject the insurgent to legal obedience not to the yoke of an arbitrary despotism when an absolute sovereign reduce his rebellious subject he may deal with they accord to his pleasure because he have that power before but when a limited monarch put down an insurrection he must still govern accord to law if an insurrection should take place in one of our states against the authority of the state government and end in the overthrow of those who plan it would that take away the right of all the people of the county where it be favor by a part or a majority of the population could they for such a reason be wholly outlawed and deprive of their representation in the legislature i have always contend that the government of the united states be sovereign within its constitutional sphere that it execute its law like the states themselves by apply its coercive power directly to individual and that it could put down insurrection with the same effect as a state and no other the opposite doctrine be the bad heresy of those who advocate secession and can not be agree to without admit that heresy to be right
 invasion insurrection rebellion and domestic violence be anticipate when the government be frame and the mean of repel and suppress they be wisely provide for in the constitution but it be not think necessary to declare that the states in which they might occur should be expel from the union rebellion which be invariably suppress occur prior to that out of which these question grow but the states continue to exist and the union remain unbroken in massachusetts in pennsylvania in rhode island and in new york at different period in our history violent and armed opposition to the united states be earn on but the relation of those states with the federal government be not suppose to be interrupt or change thereby after the rebellion portion of their population be defeat and put down it be true that in these early case there be no formal expression of a determination to withdraw from the union but it be also true that in the southern states the ordinance of secession be treat by all the friend of the union as mere nullity and be now acknowledge to be so by the states themselves if we admit that they have any force or validity or that they do in fact take the states in which they be pass out of the union we sweep from under our foot all the ground upon which we stand in justify the use of federal force to maintain the integrity of the government
 this be a bill pass by congress in time of peace there be not in any one of the states bring under its operation either war or insurrection the law of the states and of the federal government be all in undisturbed and harmonious operation the court state and federal be open and in the full exercise of their proper authority over every state comprise in these five military district life liberty and property be secure by state law and federal law and the national constitution be everywhere in force and everywhere obey what then be the ground on which this bill proceed the title of the bill announce that it be intend for the more efficient government of these ten state it be recite by way of preamble that no legal state government nor adequate protection for life or property exist in those states and that peace and good order should be thus enforce the first thing which arrest attention upon these recital which prepare the way for martial law be this that the only foundation upon which martial law can exist under our form of government be not state or so much as pretend actual war foreign invasion domestic insurrection none of these appear and none of these in fact exist it be not even recite that any sort of war or insurrection be threaten let we pause here to consider upon this question of constitutional law and the power of congress a recent decision of the supreme court of the united states in ex parte milligan
 i will first quote from the opinion of the majority of the court
 martial law can not arise from a threatened invasion the necessity must be actual and present the invasion real such as effectually close the court and depose the civil administration
 we see that martial law come in only when actual war close the court and depose the civil authority but this bill in time of peace make martial law operate as though we be in actual war and become the cause instead of the consequence of the abrogation of civil authority one more quotation
 it follow from what have be say on this subject that there be occasion when martial law can be properly apply if in foreign invasion or civil war the court be actually closed and it be impossible to administer criminal justice accord to law then on the theater of active military operation where war really prevail there be a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority thus overthrow to preserve the safety of the army and society and as no power be leave but the military it be allow to govern by martial rule until the law can have their free course
 i now quote from the opinion of the minority of the court deliver by chief justice chase
 we by no mean assert that congress can establish and apply the law of war where no war have be declare or exist where peace exist the law of peace must prevail
 this be sufficiently explicit peace exist in all the territory to which this bill apply it assert a power in congress in time of peace to set aside the law of peace and to substitute the law of war the minority concur with the majority declare that congress do not possess that power again and if possible more emphatically the chief justice with remarkable clearness and condensation sum up the whole matter as follow
 there be under the constitution three kind of military jurisdiction one to be exercise both in peace and war another to be exercise in time of foreign war without the boundary of the united states or in time of rebellion and civil war within states or district occupy by rebel treat as belligerent and a third to be exercise in time of invasion or insurrection within the limit of the united states or during rebellion within the limit of the state maintain adhesion to the national government when the public danger require its exercise the first of these may be call jurisdiction under military law and be find in act of congress prescribing rule and article of war or otherwise provide for the government of the national force the second may be distinguish as military government supersede as far as may be deem expedient the local law and exercise by the military commander under the direction of the president with the express or imply sanction of congress while the third may be denominate martial law proper and be call into action by congress or temporarily when the action of congress can not be invite and in the case of justify or excuse peril by the president in time of insurrection or invasion or of civil or foreign war within district or locality where ordinary law no long adequately secure public safety and private right
 it will be observe that of the three kind of military jurisdiction which can be exercise or create under our constitution there be but one that can prevail in time of peace and that be the code of law enact by congress for the government of the national force that body of military law have no application to the citizen nor even to the citizen soldier enrol in the militia in time of peace but this bill be not a part of that sort of military law for that apply only to the soldier and not to the citizen whilst contrariwise the military law provide by this bill apply only to the citizen and not to the soldier
 i need not say to the representative of the american people that their constitution forbid the exercise of judicial power in any way but one that be by the ordain and established court it be equally well know that in all criminal case a trial by jury be make indispensable by the express word of that instrument i will not enlarge on the inestimable value of the right thus secure to every freeman or speak of the danger to public liberty in all part of the country which must ensue from a denial of it anywhere or upon any pretense a very recent decision of the supreme court have trace the history vindicate the dignity and make known the value of this great privilege so clearly that nothing more be need to what extent a violation of it might be excuse in time of war or public danger may admit of discussion but we be provide now for a time of profound peace when there be not an armed soldier within our border except those who be in the service of the government it be in such a condition of thing that an act of congress be propose which if carry out would deny a trial by the lawful court and jury to 9,000,000 american citizen and to their posterity for an indefinite period it seem to be scarcely possible that anyone should seriously believe this consistent with a constitution which declare in simple plain and unambiguous language that all person shall have that right and that no person shall ever in any case be deprive of it the constitution also forbid the arrest of the citizen without judicial warrant round on probable cause this bill authorize an arrest without warrant at the pleasure of a military commander the constitution declare that no person shall be hold to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on presentment by a grand jury this bill hold every person not a soldier answerable for all crime and all charge without any presentment the constitution declare that no person shall be deprive of life liberty or property without due process of law this bill set aside all process of law and make the citizen answerable in his person and property to the will of one man and as to his life to the will of two finally the constitution declare that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspend unless when in case of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it whereas this bill declare martial law which of itself suspend this great writ in time of peace and authorize the military to make the arrest and give to the prisoner only one privilege and that be a trial without unnecessary delay he have no hope of release from custody except the hope such as it be of release by acquittal before a military commission
 the united states be bind to guarantee to each state a republican form of government can it be pretend that this obligation be not palpably break if we carry out a measure like this which wipe away every vestige of republican government in ten state and put the life property liberty and honor of all the people in each of they under the domination of a single person clothe with unlimited authority
 the parliament of england exercise the omnipotent power which it claim be accustom to pass bill of attainder that be to say it would convict man of treason and other crime by legislative enactment the person accuse have a hearing sometimes a patient and fair one but generally party prejudice prevail instead of justice it often become necessary for parliament to acknowledge its error and reverse its own action the father of our country determine that no such thing should occur here they withhold the power from congress and thus forbid its exercise by that body and they provide in the constitution that no state should pass any bill of attainder it be therefore impossible for any person in this country to be constitutionally convict or punish for any crime by a legislative proceeding of any sort nevertheless here be a bill of attainder against 9,000,000 people at once it be base upon an accusation so vague as to be scarcely intelligible and find to be true upon no credible evidence not one of the 9,000,000 be hear in his own defense the representative of the doomed party be exclude from all participation in the trial the conviction be to be follow by the most ignominious punishment ever inflict on large masse of man it disfranchise they by hundred of thousand and degrade they all even those who be admit to be guiltless from the rank of freeman to the condition of slave
 the purpose and object of the bill the general intent which pervade it from begin to end be to change the entire structure and character of the state government and to compel they by force to the adoption of organic law and regulation which they be unwilling to accept if leave to themselves the negro have not ask for the privilege of voting the vast majority of they have no idea what it mean this bill not only thrust it into their hand but compel they as well as the white to use it in a particular way if they do not form a constitution with prescribe article in it and afterwards elect a legislature which will act upon certain measure in a prescribed way neither black nor white can be relieve from the slavery which the bill impose upon they without pause here to consider the policy or impolicy of africanize the southern part of our territory i would simply ask the attention of congress to that manifest well know and universally acknowledge rule of constitutional law which declare that the federal government have no jurisdiction authority or power to regulate such subject for any state to force the right of suffrage out of the hand of the white people and into the hand of the negro be an arbitrary violation of this principle
 this bill impose martial law at once and its operation will begin so soon as the general and his troop can be put in place the dread alternative between its harsh rule and compliance with the term of this measure be not suspend nor be the people afford any time for free deliberation the bill say to they take martial law first then deliberate and when they have do all that this measure require they to do other condition and contingency over which they have no control yet remain to be fulfil before they can be relieve from martial law another congress must first approve the constitution make in conformity with the will of this congress and must declare these states entitle to representation in both houses the whole question thus remain open and unsettled and must again occupy the attention of congress and in the meantime the agitation which now prevail will continue to disturb all portion of the people
 the bill also deny the legality of the government of ten of the states which participate in the ratification of the amendment to the federal constitution abolishing slavery forever within the jurisdiction of the united states and practically exclude they from the union if this assumption of the bill be correct their concurrence can not be consider as having be legally give and the important fact be make to appear that the consent of three fourth of the states the requisite number have not be constitutionally obtain to the ratification of that amendment thus leave the question of slavery where it stand before the amendment be officially declare to have become a part of the constitution
 that the measure propose by this bill do violate the constitution in the particular mention and in many other way which i forbear to enumerate be too clear to admit of the least doubt it only remain to consider whether the injunction of that instrument ought to be obey or not i think they ought to be obey for reason which i will proceed to give as briefly as possible
 in the first place it be the only system of free government which we can hope to have as a nation when it cease to be the rule of our conduct we may perhaps take our choice between complete anarchy a consolidated despotism and a total dissolution of the union but national liberty regulate by law will have pass beyond our reach
 it be the good frame of government the world ever see no other be or can be so well adapt to the genius habit or want of the american people combine the strength of a great empire with unspeakable blessing of local self government have a central power to defend the general interest and recognize the authority of the states as the guardian of industrial right it be the sheet anchor of our safety abroad and our peace at home it be ordain to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity promote the general welfare provide for the common defense and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity these great end have be attain heretofore and will be again by faithful obedience to it but they be certain to be lose if we treat with disregard its sacred obligation
 it be to punish the gross crime of defy the constitution and to vindicate its supreme authority that we carry on a bloody war of four years&#39 duration shall we now acknowledge that we sacrifice a million of life and expend billion of treasure to enforce a constitution which be not worthy of respect and preservation
 those who advocate the right of secession allege in their own justification that we have no regard for law and that their right of property life and liberty would not be safe under the constitution as administer by we if we now verify their assertion we prove that they be in truth and in fact fight for their liberty and instead of brand their leader with the dishonor name of traitor against a righteous and legal government we elevate they in history to the rank of self sacrifice patriot consecrate they to the admiration of the world and place they by the side of washington hampden and sidney no let we leave they to the infamy they deserve punish they as they should be punish accord to law and take upon ourselves no share of the odium which they should bear alone
 it be a part of our public history which can never be forget that both houses of congress in july 1861 declare in the form of a solemn resolution that the war be and should be carry on for no purpose of subjugation but solely to enforce the constitution and law and that when this be yield by the party in rebellion the contest should cease with the constitutional right of the states and of individual unimpaire this resolution be adopt and send forth to the world unanimously by the senate and with only two dissent voice in the house it be accept by the friend of the union in the south as well as in the north as express honestly and truly the object of the war on the faith of it many thousand of person in both section give their life and their fortune to the cause to repudiate it now by refuse to the states and to the individual within they the right which the constitution and law of the union would secure to they be a breach of our plight honor for which i can imagine no excuse and to which i can not voluntarily become a party
 the evil which spring from the unsettled state of our government will be acknowledge by all commercial intercourse be impede capital be in constant peril public security fluctuate in value peace itself be not secure and the sense of moral and political duty be impaired to avert these calamity from our country it be imperatively require that we should immediately decide upon some course of administration which can be steadfastly adhere to i be thoroughly convinced that any settlement or compromise or plan of action which be inconsistent with the principle of the constitution will not only be unavaile but mischievous that it will but multiply the present evil instead of remove they the constitution in its whole integrity and vigor throughout the length and breadth of the land be the good of all compromise besides our duty do not in my judgment leave we a choice between that and any other i believe that it contain the remedy that be so much need and that if the coordinate branch of the government would unite upon its provision they would be find broad enough and strong enough to sustain in time of peace the nation which they bear safely through the ordeal of a protract civil war among the most sacred guaranty of that instrument be those which declare that each state shall have at least one representative and that no state without its consent shall be deprive of its equal suffrage in the senate each house be make the judge of the election return and qualification of its own member and may with the concurrence of two third expel a member thus as heretofore urge in the admission of senators and representatives from any and all of the states there can be no just ground of apprehension that person who be disloyal will be clothe with the power of legislation for this could not happen when the constitution and the law be enforce by a vigilant and faithful congress when a senator or representative present his certificate of election he may at once be admit or reject or should there be any question as to his eligibility his credential may be refer for investigation to the appropriate committee if admit to a seat it must be upon evidence satisfactory to the house of which he thus become a member that he possess the requisite constitutional and legal qualification if refuse admission as a member for want of due allegiance to the government and return to his constituent they be admonish that none but person loyal to the united states will be allow a voice in the legislative council of the nation and the political power and moral influence of congress be thus effectively exert in the interest of loyalty to the government and fidelity to the union and be it not far well that the work of restoration should be accomplish by simple compliance with the plain requirement of the constitution than by a recourse to measure which in effect destroy the states and threaten the subversion of the general government all that be necessary to settle this simple but important question without further agitation or delay be a willingness on the part of all to sustain the constitution and carry its provision into practical operation if to morrow either branch of congress would declare that upon the presentation of their credential member constitutionally elect and loyal to the general government would be admit to seat in congress while all other would be exclude and their place remain vacant until the selection by the people of loyal and qualified person and if at the same time assurance be give that this policy would be continue until all the states be represent in congress it would send a thrill of joy throughout the entire land as indicate the inauguration of a system which must speedily bring tranquillity to the public mind
 while we be legislate upon subject which be of great importance to the whole people and which must affect all part of the country not only during the life of the present generation but for age to come we should remember that all man be entitle at least to a hearing in the council which decide upon the destiny of themselves and their child at present ten state be deny representation and when the fortieth congress assemble on the 4th day of the present month sixteen state will be without a voice in the house of representatives this grave fact with the important question before we should induce we to pause in a course of legislation which look solely to the attainment of political end fail to consider the right it transgress the law which it violate or the institution which it imperil

to the house of representatives
 i have consider the bill entitle an act supplementary to an act entitle 39;an act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel states,&#39 pass march 2 1867 and to facilitate restoration and now return it to the house of representatives with my objection
 this bill provide for election in the ten states bring under the operation of the original act to which it be supplementary its detail be principally direct to the election for the formation of the state constitution but by the sixth section of the bill all election in these states occur while the original act remain in force be bring within its purview refer to these detail it will be find that first of all there be to be a registration of the voter no one whose name have not be admit on the list be to be allow to vote at any of these election to ascertain who be entitle to registration reference be make necessary by the express language of the supplement to the original act and to the pende bill the fifth section of the original act provide as to voter that they shall be male citizen of the state 21 year old and upward of whatever race color or previous condition who have be resident of say state for one year this be the general qualification follow however by many exception no one can be register accord to the original act who may be disfranchise for participation in the rebellion"--a provision which leave undetermine the question as to what amount to disfranchisement and whether without a judicial sentence the act itself produce that effect this supplemental bill superadd an oath to be take by every person before his name can be admit upon the registration that he have not be disfranchise for participation in any rebellion or civil war against the united states it thus impose upon every person the necessity and responsibility of decide for himself under the peril of punishment by a military commission if he make a mistake what work disfranchisement by participation in rebellion and what amount to such participation almost every man the negro as well as the white above 21 year of age who be resident in these ten state during the rebellion voluntarily or involuntarily at some time and in some way do participate in resistance to the lawful authority of the general government the question with the citizen to whom this oath be to be propose must be a fearful one for while the bill do not declare that perjury may be assign for such false swearing nor fix any penalty for the offense we must not forget that martial law prevail that every person be answerable to a military commission without previous presentment by a grand jury for any charge that may be make against he and that the supreme authority of the military commander determine the question as to what be an offense and what be to be the measure of punishment
 the fourth section of the bill provide that the command general of each district shall appoint as many board of registration as may be necessary consist of three loyal officer or person the only qualification state for these officer be that they must be loyal they may be person in the military service or civilian resident of the state or stranger yet these person be to exercise most important duty and be vest with unlimited discretion they be to decide what name shall be place upon the register and from their decision there be to be no appeal they be to superintend the election and to decide all question which may arise they be to have the custody of the ballot and to make return of the person elect whatever fraud or error they may commit must pass without redress all that be leave for the command general be to receive the return of the election open the same and ascertain who be choose accord to the return of the officer who conduct say election by such mean and with this sort of agency be the convention of delegate to be constitute
 as the delegate be to speak for the people common justice would seem to require that they should have authority from the people themselves no convention so constitute will in any sense represent the wish of the inhabitant of these states for under the all embrace exception of these law by a construction which the uncertainty of the clause as to disfranchisement leave open to the board of officer the great body of the people may be exclude from the poll and from all opportunity of express their own wish or vote for delegate who will faithfully reflect their sentiment
 i do not deem it necessary far to investigate the detail of this bill no consideration could induce i to give my approval to such an election law for any purpose and especially for the great purpose of frame the constitution of a state if ever the american citizen should be leave to the free exercise of his own judgment it be when he be engage in the work of form the fundamental law under which he be to live that work be his work and it can not properly be take out of his hand all this legislation proceed upon the contrary assumption that the people of each of these states shall have no constitution except such as may be arbitrarily dictate by congress and form under the restraint of military rule a plain statement of fact make this evident
 in all these state there be exist constitution frame in the accustomed way by the people congress however declare that these constitution be not loyal and republican and require the people to form they anew what then in the opinion of congress be necessary to make the constitution of a state loyal and republican the original act answer the question it be universal negro suffrage a question which the federal constitution leave exclusively to the states themselves all this legislative machinery of martial law military coercion and political disfranchisement be avowedly for that purpose and none other the exist constitution of the ten states conform to the acknowledge standard of loyalty and republicanism indeed if there be degree in republican form of government their constitution be more republican now than when these states four of which be member of the original thirteen first become member of the union
 congress do not now demand that a single provision of their constitution be change except such as confine suffrage to the white population it be apparent therefore that these provision do not conform to the standard of republicanism which congress seek to establish that there may be no mistake it be only necessary that reference should be make to the original act which declare such constitution shall provide that the elective franchise shall be enjoy by all such person as have the qualification herein state for elector of delegate what class of person be here mean clearly appear in the same section that be to say the male citizen of say state 21 year old and upward of whatever race color or previous condition who have be resident in say state for one year previous to the day of such election
 without these provision no constitution which can be frame in any one of the ten states will be of any avail with congress this then be the test of what the constitution of a state of this union must contain to make it republican measure by such a standard how few of the states now compose the union have republican constitution if in the exercise of the constitutional guaranty that congress shall secure to every state a republican form of government universal suffrage for black as well as white be a sine qua non the work of reconstruction may as well begin in ohio as in virginia in pennsylvania as in north carolina
 when i contemplate the million of our fellow citizen of the south with no alternative leave but to impose upon themselves this fearful and untried experiment of complete negro enfranchisement and white disfranchisement it may be almost as complete or submit indefinitely to the rigor of martial law without a single attribute of freeman deprive of all the sacred guaranty of our federal constitution and threaten with even bad wrong if any bad be possible it seem to i their condition be the most deplorable to which any people can be reduce it be true that they have be engage in rebellion and that their object be a separation of the states and a dissolution of the union there be an obligation rest upon every loyal citizen to treat they as enemy and to wage war against their cause
 inflexibly oppose to any movement imperil the integrity of the government i do not hesitate to urge the adoption of all measure necessary for the suppression of the insurrection after a long and terrible struggle the effort of the government be triumphantly successful and the people of the south submit to the stern arbitrament yield forever the issue of the contest hostility terminate soon after it become my duty to assume the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the republic and i at once endeavor to repress and control the passion which our civil strife have engender and no long regard these err million as enemy again acknowledge they as our friend and our countryman the war have accomplish its object the nation be save and that seminal principle of mischief which from the birth of the government have gradually but inevitably bring on the rebellion be totally eradicate then it seem to i be the auspicious time to commence the work of reconciliation then when these people seek once more our friendship and protection i consider it our duty generously to meet they in the spirit of charity and forgiveness and to conquer they even more effectually by the magnanimity of the nation than by the force of its arm i yet believe that if the policy of reconciliation then inaugurate and which contemplate an early restoration of these people to all their political right have receive the support of congress every one of these ten states and all their people would at this moment be fast anchor in the union and the great work which give the war all its sanction and make it just and holy would have be accomplish then over all the vast and fruitful region of the south peace and its blessing would have prevail while now million be deprive of right guarantee by the constitution to every citizen and after nearly two year of legislation find themselves place under an absolute military despotism a military republic a government round on mock election and support only by the sword be nearly a quarter of a century since pronounce by daniel webster when speak of the south american states as a movement indeed but a retrograde and disastrous movement from the regular and old fashioned monarchical system and he add
 if man would enjoy the blessing of republican government they must govern themselves by reason by mutual counsel and consultation by a sense and feeling of general interest and by the acquiescence of the minority in the will of the majority properly express and above all the military must be keep accord to the language of our bill of right in strict subordination to the civil authority wherever this lesson be not both learn and practice there can be no political freedom absurd preposterous be it a scoff and a satire on free form of constitutional liberty for frame of government to be prescribe by military leader and the right of suffrage to be exercise at the point of the sword
 i confidently believe that a time will come when these states will again occupy their true position in the union the barrier which now seem so obstinate must yield to the force of an enlightened and just public opinion and soon or later unconstitutional and oppressive legislation will be efface from our statute book when this shall have be consummate i pray god that the error of the past may be forget and that once more we shall be a happy united and prosperous people and that at last after the bitter and eventful experience through which the nation have pass we shall all come to know that our only safety be in the preservation of our federal constitution and in accord to every american citizen and to every state the right which that constitution secure

to the house of representatives of the united states
 i return herewith the bill entitle an act supplementary to an act entitle 39;an act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel states,&#39 pass on the 2d day of march 1867 and the act supplementary thereto pass on the 23d day of march 1867 and will state as briefly as possible some of the reason which prevent i from give it my approval
 this be one of a series of measure pass by congress during the last four month on the subject of reconstruction the message return the act of the 2d of march last state at length my objection to the passage of that measure they apply equally well to the bill now before i and i be content merely to refer to they and to reiterate my conviction that they be sound and unanswerable
 there be some point peculiar to this bill which i will proceed at once to consider
 the first section purport to declare the true intent and meaning in some particular of the two prior act upon this subject
 it be declare that the intent of those act be first that the exist government in the ten rebel states be not legal state government and second that thereafter say government if continue be to be continue subject in all respect to the military commander of the respective district and to the paramount authority of congress
 congress may by a declaratory act fix upon a prior act a construction altogether at variance with its apparent meaning and from the time at least when such a construction be fix the original act will be construe to mean exactly what it be state to mean by the declaratory statute there will be then from the time this bill may become a law no doubt no question as to the relation in which the exist government in those states call in the original act the provisional government stand toward the military authority as those relation stand before the declaratory act these government it be true be make subject to absolute military authority in many important respect but not in all the language of the act be subject to the military authority of the united states as hereinafter prescribe by the sixth section of the original act these government be make in all respect subject to the paramount authority of the united states
 now by this declaratory act it appear that congress do not by the original act intend to limit the military authority to any particular or subject therein prescribe but mean to make it universal thus over all of these ten states this military government be now declare to have unlimited authority it be no long confine to the preservation of the public peace the administration of criminal law the registration of voter and the superintendence of election but in all respect be assert to be paramount to the exist civil government
 it be impossible to conceive any state of society more intolerable than this and yet it be to this condition that 12,000,000 american citizen be reduce by the congress of the united states over every foot of the immense territory occupy by these american citizen the constitution of the united states be theoretically in full operation it bind all the people there and should protect they yet they be deny every one of its sacred guaranty
 of what avail will it be to any one of these southern people when seize by a file of soldier to ask for the cause of arrest or for the production of the warrant of what avail to ask for the privilege of bail when in military custody which know no such thing as bail of what avail to demand a trial by jury process for witness a copy of the indictment the privilege of counsel or that great privilege the writ of habeas corpus
 the veto of the original bill of the 2d of march be base on two distinct ground the interference of congress in matter strictly appertain to the reserved power of the states and the establishment of military tribunal for the trial of citizen in time of peace the impartial reader of that message will understand that all that it contain with respect to military despotism and martial law have reference especially to the fearful power confer on the district commander to displace the criminal court and assume jurisdiction to try and to punish by military board that potentially the suspension of the habeas corpus be martial law and military despotism the act now before i not only declare that the intent be to confer such military authority but also to confer unlimited military authority over all the other court of the state and over all the office of the state legislative executive and judicial not content with the general grant of power congress in the second section of this bill specifically give to each military commander the power to suspend or remove from office or from the performance of official duty and the exercise of official power any officer or person hold or exercise or profess to hold or exercise any civil or military office or duty in such district under any power election appointment or authority derive from or grant by or claim under any so call state or the government thereof or any municipal or other division thereof
 a power that hitherto all the department of the federal government act in concert or separately have not dare to exercise be here attempt to be confer on a subordinate military officer to he as a military officer of the federal government be give the power support by a sufficient military force to remove every civil officer of the state what next the district commander who have thus displace the civil officer be authorize to fill the vacancy by the detail of an officer or soldier of the army or by the appointment of some other person
 this military appointee whether an officer a soldier or some other person be to perform the duty of such officer or person so suspend or remove in other word an officer or soldier of the army be thus transform into a civil officer he may be make a governor a legislator or a judge however unfit he may deem himself for such civil duty he must obey the order the officer of the army must if detailed go upon the supreme bench of the state with the same prompt obedience as if he be detailed to go upon a court martial the soldier if detail to act as a justice of the peace must obey as quickly as if he be detail for picket duty
 what be the character of such a military civil officer this bill declare that he shall perform the duty of the civil office to which he be detail it be clear however that he do not lose his position in the military service he be still an officer or soldier of the army he be still subject to the rule and regulation which govern it and must yield due deference respect and obedience toward his superior
 the clear intent of this section be that the officer or soldier detail to fill a civil office must execute its duty accord to the law of the state if he be appoint a governor of a state he be to execute the duty as provide by the law of that state and for the time be his military character be to be suspend in his new civil capacity if he be appoint a state treasurer he must at once assume the custody and disbursement of the fund of the state and must perform those duty precisely accord to the law of the state for he be intrust with no other official duty or other official power hold the office of treasurer and intrust with fund it happen that he be require by the state law to enter into bond with security and to take an oath of office yet from the beginning of the bill to the end there be no provision for any bond or oath of office or for any single qualification require under the state law such as residence citizenship or anything else the only oath be that provide for in the ninth section by the term of which everyone detail or appoint to any civil office in the state be require to take and to subscribe the oath of office prescribe by law for officer of the united states thus an officer of the army of the united states detail to fill a civil office in one of these states give no official bond and take no official oath for the performance of his new duty but as a civil officer of the state only take the same oath which he have already take as a military officer of the united states he be at last a military officer perform civil duty and the authority under which he act be federal authority only and the inevitable result be that the federal government by the agency of its own sworn officer in effect assume the civil government of the state
 a singular contradiction be apparent here congress declare these local state government to be illegal government and then provide that these illegal government shall be carry on by federal officer who be to perform the very duty impose on its own officer by this illegal state authority it certainly would be a novel spectacle if congress should attempt to carry on a legal state government by the agency of its own officer it be yet more strange that congress attempt to sustain and carry on an illegal state government by the same federal agency
 in this connection i must call attention to the tenth and eleventh section of the bill which provide that none of the officer or appointee of these military commander shall be bind in his action by any opinion of any civil officer of the united states and that all the provision of the act shall be construe liberally to the end that all the intent thereof may be fully and perfectly carry out
 it seem congress suppose that this bill might require construction and they fix therefore the rule to be apply but where be the construction to come from certainly no one can be more in want of instruction than a soldier or an officer of the army detail for a civil service perhaps the most important in a state with the duty of which he be altogether unfamiliar this bill say he shall not be bind in his action by the opinion of any civil officer of the united states the duty of the office be altogether civil but when he ask for an opinion he can only ask the opinion of another military officer who perhaps understand as little of his duty as he do himself and as to his action he be answerable to the military authority and to the military authority alone strictly no opinion of any civil officer other than a judge have a bind force
 but these military appointee would not be bind even by a judicial opinion they might very well say even when their action be in conflict with the supreme court of the united states that court be compose of civil officer of the united states and we be not bind to conform our action to any opinion of any such authority
 this bill and the act to which it be supplementary be all round upon the assumption that these ten community be not states and that their exist government be not legal throughout the legislation upon this subject they be call rebel states and in this particular bill they be denominate so call state and the vice of illegality be declare to pervade all of they the obligation of consistency bind a legislative body as well as the individual who compose it it be now too late to say that these ten political community be not state of this union declaration to the contrary make in these three act be contradict again and again by repeated act of legislation enact by congress from the year 1861 to the year 1867
 during that period while these state be in actual rebellion and after that rebellion be bring to a close they have be again and again recognize as states of the union representation have be apportion to they as states they have be divide into judicial district for the holding of district and circuit court of the united states as states of the union only can be district the last act on this subject be pass july 23 1866 by which every one of these ten states be arrange into district and circuit
 they have be call upon by congress to act through their legislature upon at least two amendment to the constitution of the united states as states they have ratify one amendment which require the vote of twenty seven states of the thirty six then compose the union when the requisite twenty seven vote be give in favor of that amendment seven of which vote be give by seven of these ten states it be proclaim to be a part of the constitution of the united states and slavery be declare no long to exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction if these seven state be not legal states of the union it follow as an inevitable consequence that in some of the states slavery yet exist it do not exist in these seven states for they have abolish it also in their state constitution but kentucky not having do so it would still remain in that state but in truth if this assumption that these states have no legal state government be true then the abolition of slavery by these illegal government bind no one for congress now deny to these states the power to abolish slavery by deny to they the power to elect a legal state legislature or to frame a constitution for any purpose even for such a purpose as the abolition of slavery
 as to the other constitutional amendment have reference to suffrage it happen that these states have not accept it the consequence be that it have never be proclaim or understand even by congress to be a part of the constitution of the united states the senate of the united states have repeatedly give its sanction to the appointment of judge district attorney and marshal for every one of these states yet if they be not legal state not one of these judge be authorize to hold a court so too both houses of congress have pass appropriation bill to pay all these judge attorney and officer of the united states for exercise their function in these states again in the machinery of the internal revenue law all these state be district not as territories but as states
 so much for continuous legislative recognition the instance cite however fall far short of all that might be enumerate executive recognition as be well know have be frequent and unwavering the same may be say as to judicial recognition through the supreme court of the united states that august tribunal from first to last in the administration of its duty in banc and upon the circuit have never fail to recognize these ten community as legal states of the union the case depend in that court upon appeal and writ of error from these states when the rebellion begin have not be dismiss upon any idea of the cessation of jurisdiction they be carefully continue from term to term until the rebellion be entirely subdue and peace reestablish and then they be call for argument and consideration as if no insurrection have intervene new case occur since the rebellion have come from these states before that court by writ of error and appeal and even by original suit where only a state can bring such a suit these case be entertain by that tribunal in the exercise of its acknowledge jurisdiction which could not attach to they if they have come from any political body other than a state of the union finally in the allotment of their circuit make by the judge at the december term 1865 every one of these states be put on the same footing of legality with all the other states of the union virginia and north carolina be a part of the fourth circuit be allot to the chief justice south carolina georgia alabama mississippi and florida constitute the fifth circuit and be allot to the late mr. justice wayne louisiana arkansas and texas be allot to the sixth judicial circuit as to which there be a vacancy on the bench
 the chief justice in the exercise of his circuit duty have recently hold a circuit court in the state of north carolina if north carolina be not a state of this union the chief justice have no authority to hold a court there and every order judgment and decree render by he in that court be coram non judice and void
 another ground on which these reconstruction act be attempt to be sustain be this that these ten state be conquer territory that the constitutional relation in which they stand as states toward the federal government prior to the rebellion have give place to a new relation that their territory be a conquered country and their citizen a conquered people and that in this new relation congress can govern they by military power
 a title by conquest stand on clear ground it be a new title acquire by war it apply only to territory for good or movable thing regularly capture in war be call booty or if take by individual soldier plunder
 there be not a foot of the land in any one of these ten states which the united states hold by conquest save only such land as do not belong to either of these states or to any individual owner i mean such land as do belong to the pretended government call the confederate states these land we may claim to hold by conquest as to all other land or territory whether belong to the states or to individual the federal government have now no more title or right to it than it have before the rebellion our own fort arsenal navy yard custom house and other federal property situate in those state we now hold not by the title of conquest but by our old title acquire by purchase or condemnation for public use with compensation to former owner we have not conquer these place but have simply repossess they
 if we require more site for fort custom house or other public use we must acquire the title to they by purchase or appropriation in the regular mode at this moment the united states in the acquisition of site for national cemetery in these states acquire title in the same way the federal court sit in court house own or lease by the united states not in the court house of the states the united states pay each of these states for the use of its jail finally the united states levy its direct taxis and its internal revenue upon the property in these state include the production of the land within their territorial limit not by way of levy and contribution in the character of a conqueror but in the regular way of taxation under the same law which apply to all the other states of the union
 from first to last during the rebellion and since the title of each of these states to the land and public building own by they have never be disturb and not a foot of it have ever be acquire by the united states even under a title by confiscation and not a foot of it have ever be tax under federal law
 in conclusion i must respectfully ask the attention of congress to the consideration of one more question arise under this bill it vest in the military commander subject only to the approval of the general of the army of the united states an unlimited power to remove from office any civil or military officer in each of these ten states and the further power subject to the same approval to detail or appoint any military officer or soldier of the united states to perform the duty of the officer so removed and to fill all vacancy occur in those states by death resignation or otherwise
 the military appointee thus require to perform the duty of a civil office accord to the law of the state and as such require to take an oath be for the time be a civil officer what be his character be he a civil officer of the state or a civil officer of the united states if he be a civil officer of the state where be the federal power under our constitution which authorize his appointment by any federal officer if however he be to be consider a civil officer of the united states as his appointment and oath would seem to indicate where be the authority for his appointment vest by the constitution the power of appointment of all officer of the united states civil or military where not provide for in the constitution be vest in the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate with this exception that congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officer as they think proper in the president alone in the court of law or in the head of department but this bill if these be to be consider inferior officer within the meaning of the constitution do not provide for their appointment by the president alone or by the court of law or by the head of departments but vest the appointment in one subordinate executive officer subject to the approval of another subordinate executive officer so that if we put this question and fix the character of this military appointee either way this provision of the bill be equally opposed to the constitution
 take the case of a soldier or officer appoint to perform the office of judge in one of these states and as such to administer the proper law of the state where be the authority to be find in the constitution for vest in a military or an executive officer strict judicial function to be exercise under state law it have be again and again decide by the supreme court of the united states that act of congress which have attempt to vest executive power in the judicial court or judge of the united states be not warrant by the constitution if congress can not clothe a judge with merely executive duty how can they clothe an officer or soldier of the army with judicial duty over citizen of the united states who be not in the military or naval service so too it have be repeatedly decide that congress can not require a state officer executive or judicial to perform any duty enjoin upon he by a law of the united states how then can congress confer power upon an executive officer of the united states to perform such duty in a state if congress could not vest in a judge of one of these states any judicial authority under the united states by direct enactment how can it accomplish the same thing indirectly by remove the state judge and put an officer of the united states in his place
 to i these consideration be conclusive of the unconstitutionality of this part of the bill now before i and i earnestly commend their consideration to the deliberate judgment of congress
 within a period less than a year the legislation of congress have attempt to strip the executive department of the government of some of its essential power the constitution and the oath provide in it devolve upon the president the power and duty to see that the law be faithfully execute the constitution in order to carry out this power give he the choice of the agent and make they subject to his control and supervision but in the execution of these law the constitutional obligation upon the president remain but the power to exercise that constitutional duty be effectually take away the military commander be as to the power of appointment make to take the place of the president and the general of the army the place of the senate and any attempt on the part of the president to assert his own constitutional power may under pretense of law be meet by official insubordination it be to be fear that these military officer look to the authority give by these law rather than to the letter of the constitution will recognize no authority but the commander of the district and the general of the army
 if there be no other objection than this to this propose legislation it would be sufficient whilst i hold the chief executive authority of the united states whilst the obligation rest upon i to see that all the law be faithfully execute i can never willingly surrender that trust or the power give for its execution i can never give my assent to be make responsible for the faithful execution of law and at the same time surrender that trust and the power which accompany it to any other executive officer high or low or to any number of executive officer if this executive trust vest by the constitution in the president be to be take from he and vest in a subordinate officer the responsibility will be with congress in clothing the subordinate with unconstitutional power and with the officer who assume its exercise
 this interference with the constitutional authority of the executive department be an evil that will inevitably sap the foundation of our federal system but it be not the bad evil of this legislation it be a great public wrong to take from the president power confer on he alone by the constitution but the wrong be more flagrant and more dangerous when the power so take from the president be confer upon subordinate executive officer and especially upon military officer over nearly one third of the states of the union military power regulate by no fix law rule supreme each one of the five district commander though not choose by the people or responsible to they exercise at this hour more executive power military and civil than the people have ever be willing to confer upon the head of the executive department though choose by and responsible to themselves the remedy must come from the people themselves they know what it be and how it be to be apply at the present time they can not accord to the form of the constitution repeal these law they can not remove or control this military despotism the remedy be nevertheless in their hand it be to be find in the ballot and be a sure one if not control by fraud overawe by arbitrary power or from apathy on their part too long delay with abide confidence in their patriotism wisdom and integrity i be still hopeful of the future and that in the end the rod of despotism will be break the armed heel of power lift from the neck of the people and the principle of a violate constitution preserve

 by the president
 william h. seward
 secretary of state

fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives
 the continue disorganization of the union to which the president have so often call the attention of congress be yet a subject of profound and patriotic concern we may however find some relief from that anxiety in the reflection that the painful political situation although before untried by ourselves be not new in the experience of nation political science perhaps as highly perfect in our own time and country as in any other have not yet disclose any mean by which civil war can be absolutely prevent an enlightened nation however with a wise and beneficent constitution of free government may diminish their frequency and mitigate their severity by direct all its proceeding in accordance with its fundamental law
 when a civil war have be bring to a close it be manifestly the first interest and duty of the state to repair the injury which the war have inflict and to secure the benefit of the lesson it teach as fully and as speedily as possible this duty be upon the termination of the rebellion promptly accept not only by the executive department but by the insurrectionary states themselves and restoration in the first moment of peace be believe to be as easy and certain as it be indispensable the expectation however then so reasonably and confidently entertain be disappoint by legislation from which i feel constrain by my obligation to the constitution to withhold my assent
 it be therefore a source of profound regret that in comply with the obligation impose upon the president by the constitution to give to congress from time to time information of the state of the union i be unable to communicate any definitive adjustment satisfactory to the american people of the question which since the close of the rebellion have agitate the public mind on the contrary candor compel i to declare that at this time there be no union as our father understand the term and as they mean it to be understand by we the union which they establish can exist only where all the states be represent in both houses of congress where one state be as free as another to regulate its internal concern accord to its own will and where the law of the central government strictly confine to matter of national jurisdiction apply with equal force to all the people of every section that such be not the present state of the union be a melancholy fact and we must all acknowledge that the restoration of the states to their proper legal relation with the federal government and with one another accord to the term of the original compact would be the great temporal blessing which god in his kind providence could bestow upon this nation it become our imperative duty to consider whether or not it be impossible to effect this most desirable consummation
 the union and the constitution be inseparable as long as one be obey by all party the other will be preserve and if one be destroy both must perish together the destruction of the constitution will be follow by other and still great calamity it be ordain not only to form a more perfect union between the states but to establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity nothing but implicit obedience to its requirement in all part of the country will accomplish these great end without that obedience we can look forward only to continual outrage upon individual right incessant breach of the public peace national weakness financial dishonor the total loss of our prosperity the general corruption of moral and the final extinction of popular freedom to save our country from evil so appalling as these we should renew our effort again and again
 to i the process of restoration seem perfectly plain and simple it consist merely in a faithful application of the constitution and law the execution of the law be not now obstruct or oppose by physical force there be no military or other necessity real or pretend which can prevent obedience to the constitution either north or south all the right and all the obligation of states and individual can be protect and enforce by mean perfectly consistent with the fundamental law the court may be everywhere open and if open their process would be unimpeded crime against the united states can be prevent or punish by the proper judicial authority in a manner entirely practicable and legal there be therefore no reason why the constitution should not be obey unless those who exercise its power have determine that it shall be disregard and violate the mere naked will of this government or of some one or more of its branch be the only obstacle that can exist to a perfect union of all the states
 on this momentous question and some of the measure grow out of it i have have the misfortune to differ from congress and have express my conviction without reserve though with become deference to the opinion of the legislative department those conviction be not only unchanged but strengthen by subsequent event and further reflection the transcendent importance of the subject will be a sufficient excuse for call your attention to some of the reason which have so strongly influence my own judgment the hope that we may all finally concur in a mode of settlement consistent at once with our true interest and with our sworn duty to the constitution be too natural and too just to be easily relinquish
 it be clear to my apprehension that the states lately in rebellion be still member of the national union when do they cease to be so the ordinance of secession adopt by a portion in most of they a very small portion of their citizen be mere nullity if we admit now that they be valid and effectual for the purpose intend by their author we sweep from under our foot the whole ground upon which we justify the war be those states afterwards expel from the union by the war the direct contrary be aver by this government to be its purpose and be so understand by all those who give their blood and treasure to aid in its prosecution it can not be that a successful war wage for the preservation of the union have the legal effect of dissolve it the victory of the nation&#39;s arm be not the disgrace of her policy the defeat of secession on the battlefield be not the triumph of its lawless principle nor could congress with or without the consent of the executive do anything which would have the effect directly or indirectly of separate the states from each other to dissolve the union be to repeal the constitution which hold it together and that be a power which do not belong to any department of this government or to all of they unite
 this be so plain that it have be acknowledge by all branch of the federal government the executive my predecessor as well as myself and the head of all the departments have uniformly act upon the principle that the union be not only undissolve but indissoluble congress submit an amendment of the constitution to be ratify by the southern states and accept their act of ratification as a necessary and lawful exercise of their high function if they be not states or be states out of the union their consent to a change in the fundamental law of the union would have be nugatory and congress in ask it commit a political absurdity the judiciary have also give the solemn sanction of its authority to the same view of the case the judge of the supreme court have include the southern states in their circuit and they be constantly in banc and elsewhere exercise jurisdiction which do not belong to they unless those state be states of the union
 if the southern states be component part of the union the constitution be the supreme law for they as it be for all the other states they be bind to obey it and so be we the right of the federal government which be clear and unquestionable to enforce the constitution upon they imply the correlative obligation on our part to observe its limitation and execute its guaranty without the constitution we be nothing by through and under the constitution we be what it make we we may doubt the wisdom of the law we may not approve of its provision but we can not violate it merely because it seem to confine our power within limit narrower than we could wish it be not a question of individual or class or sectional interest much less of party predominance but of duty of high and sacred duty which we be all swear to perform if we can not support the constitution with the cheerful alacrity of those who love and believe in it we must give to it at least the fidelity of public servant who act under solemn obligation and command which they dare not disregard
 the constitutional duty be not the only one which require the states to be restore there be another consideration which though of minor importance be yet of great weight on the 22d day of july 1861 congress declare by an almost unanimous vote of both houses that the war should be conduct solely for the purpose of preserve the union and maintain the supremacy of the federal constitution and law without impair the dignity equality and right of the states or of individual and that when this be do the war should cease i do not say that this declaration be personally bind on those who join in make it any more than individual member of congress be personally bind to pay a public debt create under a law for which they vote but it be a solemn public official pledge of the national honor and i can not imagine upon what ground the repudiation of it be to be justify if it be say that we be not bind to keep faith with rebel let it be remember that this promise be not make to rebel only thousand of true man in the south be draw to our standard by it and hundred of thousand in the north give their life in the belief that it would be carry out it be make on the day after the first great battle of the war have be fight and lose all patriotic and intelligent man then see the necessity of give such an assurance and believe that without it the war would end in disaster to our cause having give that assurance in the extremity of our peril the violation of it now in the day of our power would be a rude rending of that good faith which hold the moral world together our country would cease to have any claim upon the confidence of man it would make the war not only a failure but a fraud
 be sincerely convince that these view be correct i would be unfaithful to my duty if i do not recommend the repeal of the act of congress which place ten of the southern states under the domination of military master if calm reflection shall satisfy a majority of your honorable body that the act refer to be not only a violation of the national faith but in direct conflict with the constitution i dare not permit myself to doubt that you will immediately strike they from the statute book
 to demonstrate the unconstitutional character of those act i need do no more than refer to their general provision it must be see at once that they be not authorize to dictate what alteration shall be make in the constitution of the several states to control the election of state legislator and state officer member of congress and elector of president and vice president by arbitrarily declare who shall vote and who shall be exclude from that privilege to dissolve state legislature or prevent they from assemble to dismiss judge and other civil functionary of the state and appoint other without regard to state law to organize and operate all the political machinery of the states to regulate the whole administration of their domestic and local affair accord to the mere will of strange and irresponsible agent send among they for that purpose these be power not grant to the federal government or to any one of its branch not be grant we violate our trust by assume they as palpably as we would by act in the face of a positive interdict for the constitution forbid we to do whatever it do not affirmatively authorize either by express word or by clear implication if the authority we desire to use do not come to we through the constitution we can exercise it only by usurpation and usurpation be the most dangerous of political crime by that crime the enemy of free government in all age have work out their design against public liberty and private right it lead directly and immediately to the establishment of absolute rule for undelegated power be always unlimited and unrestrained
 the act of congress in question be not only objectionable for their assumption of ungranted power but many of their provision be in conflict with the direct prohibition of the constitution the constitution command that a republican form of government shall be guarantee to all the states that no person shall be deprive of life liberty or property without due process of law arrest without a judicial warrant or punish without a fair trial before an impartial jury that the privilege of habeas corpus shall not be deny in time of peace and that no bill of attainder shall be pass even against a single individual yet the system of measure establish by these act of congress do totally subvert and destroy the form as well as the substance of republican government in the ten states to which they apply it bind they hand and foot in absolute slavery and subject they to a strange and hostile power more unlimited and more likely to be abuse than any other now know among civilized man it trample down all those right in which the essence of liberty consist and which a free government be always most careful to protect it deny the habeas corpus and the trial by jury personal freedom property and life if assail by the passion the prejudice or the rapacity of the ruler have no security whatever it have the effect of a bill of attainder or bill of pain and penalty not upon a few individual but upon whole masse include the million who inhabit the subject state and even their unborn child these wrong be expressly forbid can not be constitutionally inflict upon any portion of our people no matter how they may have come within our jurisdiction and no matter whether they live in states territories or district
 i have no desire to save from the proper and just consequence of their great crime those who engage in rebellion against the government but as a mode of punishment the measure under consideration be the most unreasonable that could be invent many of those people be perfectly innocent many keep their fidelity to the union untainte to the last many be incapable of any legal offense a large proportion even of the person able to bear arm be force into rebellion against their will and of those who be guilty with their own consent the degree of guilt be as various as the shade of their character and temper but these act of congress confound they all together in one common doom indiscriminate vengeance upon class sect and party or upon whole community for offense commit by a portion of they against the government to which they owe obedience be common in the barbarous age of the world but christianity and civilization have make such progress that recourse to a punishment so cruel and unjust would meet with the condemnation of all unprejudiced and right minded man the punitive justice of this age and especially of this country do not consist in strip whole state of their liberty and reduce all their people without distinction to the condition of slavery it deal separately with each individual confine itself to the form of law and vindicate its own purity by an impartial examination of every case before a competent judicial tribunal if this do not satisfy all our desire with regard to southern rebel let we console ourselves by reflect that a free constitution triumphant in war and unbroken in peace be worth far more to we and our child than the gratification of any present feeling
 i be aware it be assume that this system of government for the southern states be not to be perpetual it be true this military government be to be only provisional but it be through this temporary evil that a great evil be to be make perpetual if the guaranty of the constitution can be break provisionally to serve a temporary purpose and in a part only of the country we can destroy they everywhere and for all time arbitrary measure often change but they generally change for the bad it be the curse of despotism that it have no halting place the intermit exercise of its power bring no sense of security to its subject for they can never know what more they will be call to endure when its red right hand be arm to plague they again nor be it possible to conjecture how or where power unrestraine by law may seek its next victim the states that be still free may be enslave at any moment for if the constitution do not protect all it protect none
 it be manifestly and avowedly the object of these law to confer upon negroes the privilege of voting and to disfranchise such a number of white citizen as will give the former a clear majority at all election in the southern states this to the mind of some person be so important that a violation of the constitution be justify as a means of bring it about the morality be always false which excuse a wrong because it propose to accomplish a desirable end we be not permit to do evil that good may come but in this case the end itself be evil as well as the mean the subjugation of the states to negro domination would be bad than the military despotism under which they be now suffer it be believe beforehand that the people would endure any amount of military oppression for any length of time rather than degrade themselves by subjection to the negro race therefore they have be leave without a choice negro suffrage be establish by act of congress and the military officer be command to superintend the process of clothing the negro race with the political privilege tear from white man
 the black in the south be entitle to be well and humanely govern and to have the protection of just law for all their right of person and property if it be practicable at this time to give they a government exclusively their own under which they might manage their own affair in their own way it would become a grave question whether we ought to do so or whether common humanity would not require we to save they from themselves but under the circumstance this be only a speculative point it be not propose merely that they shall govern themselves but that they shall rule the white race make and administer state law elect president and member of congress and shape to a great or less extent the future destiny of the whole country would such a trust and power be safe in such hand
 the peculiar quality which should characterize any people who be fit to decide upon the management of public affair for a great state have seldom be combine it be the glory of white man to know that they have have these quality in sufficient measure to build upon this continent a great political fabric and to preserve its stability for more than ninety year while in every other part of the world all similar experiment have fail but if anything can be prove by known fact if all reason upon evidence be not abandon it must be acknowledge that in the progress of nation negroes have show less capacity for government than any other race of people no independent government of any form have ever be successful in their hand on the contrary wherever they have be leave to their own device they have show a constant tendency to relapse into barbarism in the southern states however congress have undertake to confer upon they the privilege of the ballot just release from slavery it may be doubt whether as a class they know more than their ancestor how to organize and regulate civil society indeed it be admit that the black of the south be not only regardless of the right of property but so utterly ignorant of public affair that their voting can consist in nothing more than carry a ballot to the place where they be direct to deposit it i need not remind you that the exercise of the elective franchise be the high attribute of an american citizen and that when guide by virtue intelligence patriotism and a proper appreciation of our free institution it constitute the true basis of a democratic form of government in which the sovereign power be lodge in the body of the people a trust artificially create not for its own sake but solely as a means of promote the general welfare its influence for good must necessarily depend upon the elevated character and true allegiance of the elector it ought therefore to be repose in none except those who be fit morally and mentally to administer it well for if confer upon person who do not justly estimate its value and who be indifferent as to its result it will only serve as a means of place power in the hand of the unprincipled and ambitious and must eventuate in the complete destruction of that liberty of which it should be the most powerful conservator i have therefore heretofore urge upon your attention the great danger--
 to be apprehend from an untimely extension of the elective franchise to any new class in our country especially when the large majority of that class in wield the power thus place in their hand can not be expect correctly to comprehend the duty and responsibility which pertain to suffrage yesterday as it be 4,000,000 person be hold in a condition of slavery that have exist for generation to day they be freeman and be assume by law to be citizen it can not be presume from their previous condition of servitude that as a class they be as well inform as to the nature of our government as the intelligent foreigner who make our land the home of his choice in the case of the latter neither a residence of five year and the knowledge of our institution which it give nor attachment to the principle of the constitution be the only condition upon which he can be admit to citizenship he must prove in addition a good moral character and thus give reasonable ground for the belief that he will be faithful to the obligation which he assume as a citizen of the republic where a people the source of all political power speak by their suffrage through the instrumentality of the ballot box it must be carefully guard against the control of those who be corrupt in principle and enemy of free institution for it can only become to our political and social system a safe conductor of healthy popular sentiment when keep free from demoralize influence control through fraud and usurpation by the designing anarchy and despotism must inevitably follow in the hand of the patriotic and worthy our government will be preserve upon the principle of the constitution inherit from our father it follow therefore that in admit to the ballot box a new class of voter not qualified for the exercise of the elective franchise we weaken our system of government instead of add to its strength and durability
 i yield to no one in attachment to that rule of general suffrage which distinguish our policy as a nation but there be a limit wisely observed hitherto which make the ballot a privilege and a trust and which require of some class a time suitable for probation and preparation to give it indiscriminately to a new class wholly unprepared by previous habit and opportunity to perform the trust which it demand be to degrade it and finally to destroy its power for it may be safely assume that no political truth be well establish than that such indiscriminate and all embrace extension of popular suffrage must end at last in its destruction
 i repeat the expression of my willingness to join in any plan within the scope of our constitutional authority which promise to better the condition of the negroes in the south by encourage they in industry enlighten their mind improve their moral and give protection to all their just right as freedman but the transfer of our political inheritance to they would in my opinion be an abandonment of a duty which we owe alike to the memory of our father and the right of our child
 the plan of put the southern states wholly and the general government partially into the hand of negroes be propose at a time peculiarly unpropitious the foundation of society have be break up by civil war industry must be reorganize justice reestablish public credit maintain and order bring out of confusion to accomplish these end would require all the wisdom and virtue of the great man who form our institution originally i confidently believe that their descendant will be equal to the arduous task before they but it be bad than madness to expect that negroes will perform it for we certainly we ought not to ask their assistance till we despair of our own competency
 the great difference between the two race in physical mental and moral characteristic will prevent an amalgamation or fusion of they together in one homogeneous mass if the inferior obtain the ascendency over the other it will govern with reference only to its own interest for it will recognize no common interest and create such a tyranny as this continent have never yet witness already the negroes be influence by promise of confiscation and plunder they be teach to regard as an enemy every white man who have any respect for the right of his own race if this continue it must become bad and bad until all order will be subvert all industry cease and the fertile field of the south grow up into a wilderness of all the danger which our nation have yet encounter none be equal to those which must result from the success of the effort now make to africanize the half of our country
 i would not put consideration of money in competition with justice and right but the expense incident to reconstruction under the system adopt by congress aggravate what i regard as the intrinsic wrong of the measure itself it have cost uncounted million already and if persist in will add largely to the weight of taxation already too oppressive to be bear without just complaint and may finally reduce the treasury of the nation to a condition of bankruptcy we must not delude ourselves it will require a strong stand army and probably more than $ 200,000,000 per annum to maintain the supremacy of negro government after they be establish the sum thus throw away would if properly use form a sink fund large enough to pay the whole national debt in less than fifteen year it be vain to hope that negroes will maintain their ascendency themselves without military power they be wholly incapable of hold in subjection the white people of the south
 i submit to the judgment of congress whether the public credit may not be injuriously affect by a system of measure like this with our debt and the vast private interest which be complicated with it we can not be too cautious of a policy which might by possibility impair the confidence of the world in our government that confidence can only be retain by carefully inculcate the principle of justice and honor on the popular mind and by the most scrupulous fidelity to all our engagement of every sort any serious breach of the organic law persist in for a considerable time can not but create fear for the stability of our institution habitual violation of prescribed rule which we bind ourselves to observe must demoralize the people our only standard of civil duty be set at naught the sheet anchor of our political morality be lose the public conscience swing from its mooring and yield to every impulse of passion and interest if we repudiate the constitution we will not be expect to care much for mere pecuniary obligation the violation of such a pledge as we make on the 22d day of july 1861 will assuredly diminish the market value of our other promise besides if we acknowledge that the national debt be create not to hold the states in the union as the taxpayer be lead to suppose but to expel they from it and hand they over to be govern by negroes the moral duty to pay it may seem much less clear i say it may seem so for i do not admit that this or any other argument in favor of repudiation can be entertain as sound but its influence on some class of mind may well be apprehend the financial honor of a great commercial nation largely indebted and with a republican form of government administer by agent of the popular choice be a thing of such delicate texture and the destruction of it would be follow by such unspeakable calamity that every true patriot must desire to avoid whatever might expose it to the slight danger
 the great interest of the country require immediate relief from these enactment business in the south be paralyze by a sense of general insecurity by the terror of confiscation and the dread of negro supremacy the southern trade from which the north would have derive so great a profit under a government of law still languish and can never be revive until it cease to be fetter by the arbitrary power which make all its operation unsafe that rich country the rich in natural resource the world ever see be bad than lose if it be not soon place under the protection of a free constitution instead of be as it ought to be a source of wealth and power it will become an intolerable burden upon the rest of the nation
 another reason for retrace our step will doubtless be see by congress in the late manifestation of public opinion upon this subject we live in a country where the popular will always enforce obedience to itself soon or later it be vain to think of oppose it with anything short of legal authority back by overwhelming force it can not have escape your attention that from the day on which congress fairly and formally present the proposition to govern the southern states by military force with a view to the ultimate establishment of negro supremacy every expression of the general sentiment have be more or less adverse to it the affection of this generation can not be detach from the institution of their ancestor their determination to preserve the inheritance of free government in their own hand and transmit it undivide and unimpaire to their own posterity be too strong to be successfully opposed every weak passion will disappear before that love of liberty and law for which the american people be distinguish above all other in the world
 how far the duty of the president to preserve protect and defend the constitution require he to go in oppose an unconstitutional act of congress be a very serious and important question on which i have deliberate much and feel extremely anxious to reach a proper conclusion where an act have be pass accord to the form of the constitution by the supreme legislative authority and be regularly enrol among the public statute of the country executive resistance to it especially in time of high party excitement would be likely to produce violent collision between the respective adherent of the two branch of the government this would be simply civil war and civil war must be resort to only as the last remedy for the bad of evil whatever might tend to provoke it should be most carefully avoid a faithful and conscientious magistrate will concede very much to honest error and something even to perverse malice before he will endanger the public peace and he will not adopt forcible measure or such as might lead to force as long as those which be peaceable remain open to he or to his constituent it be true that case may occur in which the executive would be compel to stand on its right and maintain they regardless of all consequence if congress should pass an act which be not only in palpable conflict with the constitution but will certainly if carry out produce immediate and irreparable injury to the organic structure of the government and if there be neither judicial remedy for the wrong it inflict nor power in the people to protect themselves without the official aid of their elect defender if for instance the legislative department should pass an act even through all the form of law to abolish a coordinate department of the government in such a case the president must take the high responsibility of his office and save the life of the nation at all hazard the so call reconstruction act though as plainly unconstitutional as any that can be imagine be not believe to be within the class last mention the people be not wholly dis armed of the power of self defense in all the northern states they still hold in their hand the sacred right of the ballot and it be safe to believe that in due time they would come to the rescue of their own institution it give i pleasure to add that the appeal to our common constituent be not take in vain and that my confidence in their wisdom and virtue seem not to have be misplace
 it be well and publicly know that enormous fraud have be perpetrate on the treasury and that colossal fortune have be make at the public expense this specie of corruption have increase be increase and if not diminish will soon bring we into total ruin and disgrace the public creditor and the taxpayer be alike interested in an honest administration of the finance and neither class will long endure the large handed robbery of the recent past for this discreditable state of thing there be several cause some of the taxis be so lay as to present an irresistible temptation to evade payment the great sum which officer may win by connivance at fraud create a pressure which be more than the virtue of many can withstand and there can be no doubt that the open disregard of constitutional obligation avow by some of the high and most influential man in the country have greatly weaken the moral sense of those who serve in subordinate place the expense of the united states include interest on the public debt be more than six time as much as they be seven year ago to collect and disburse this vast amount require careful supervision as well as systematic vigilance the system never perfect be much disorganize by the tenure of office bill which have almost destroy official accountability the president may be thoroughly convinced that an officer be incapable dishonest or unfaithful to the constitution but under the law which i have name the utmost he can do be to complain to the senate and ask the privilege of supply his place with a well man if the senate be regard as personally or politically hostile to the president it be natural and not altogether unreasonable for the officer to expect that it will take his part as far as possible restore he to his place and give he a triumph over his executive superior the officer have other chance of impunity arise from accidental defect of evidence the mode of investigate it and the secrecy of the hearing it be not wonderful that official malfeasance should become bold in proportion as the delinquent learn to think themselves safe i be entirely persuade that under such a rule the president can not perform the great duty assign to he of see the law faithfully execute and that it disable he most especially from enforce that rigid accountability which be necessary to the due execution of the revenue law
 the constitution invest the president with authority to decide whether a removal should be make in any give case the act of congress declare in substance that he shall only accuse such as he suppose to be unworthy of their trust the constitution make he sole judge in the premise but the statute take away his jurisdiction transfer it to the senate and leave he nothing but the odious and sometimes impracticable duty of become a prosecutor the prosecution be to be conduct before a tribunal whose member be not like he responsible to the whole people but to separate constituent body and who may hear his accusation with great disfavor the senate be absolutely without any know standard of decision applicable to such a case its judgment can not be anticipate for it be not govern by any rule the law do not define what shall be deem good cause for removal it be impossible even to conjecture what may or may not be so consider by the senate the nature of the subject forbid clear proof if the charge be incapacity what evidence will support it fidelity to the constitution may be understand or misunderstood in a thousand different way and by violent party man in violent party time unfaithfulness to the constitution may even come to be consider meritorious if the officer be accuse of dishonesty how shall it be make out will it be infer from act unconnected with public duty from private history or from general reputation or must the president await the commission of an actual misdemeanor in office shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hand of man to whom he can not give his confidence must he forbear his complaint until the mischief be do and can not be prevent if his zeal in the public service should impel he to anticipate the overt act must he move at the peril of be try himself for the offense of slander his subordinate in the present circumstance of the country someone must be hold responsible for official delinquency of every kind it be extremely difficult to say where that responsibility should be throw if it be not leave where it have be place by the constitution but all just man will admit that the president ought to be entirely relieve from such responsibility if he can not meet it by reason of restriction place by law upon his action
 the unrestricted power of removal from office be a very great one to be trust even to a magistrate choose by the general suffrage of the whole people and accountable directly to they for his act it be undoubtedly liable to abuse and at some period of our history perhaps have be abuse if it be think desirable and constitutional that it should be so limited as to make the president merely a common informer against other public agent he should at least be permit to act in that capacity before some open tribunal independent of party politic ready to investigate the merit of every case furnish with the mean of take evidence and bind to decide accord to establish rule this would guarantee the safety of the accuser when he act in good faith and at the same time secure the right of the other party i speak of course with all proper respect for the present senate but it do not seem to i that any legislative body can be so constitute as to insure its fitness for these function
 it be not the theory of this government that public office be the property of those who hold they they be give merely as a trust for the public benefit sometimes for a fix period sometimes during good behavior but generally they be liable to be terminate at the pleasure of the appoint power which represent the collective majesty and speak the will of the people the force retention in office of a single dishonest person may work great injury to the public interest the danger to the public service come not from the power to remove but from the power to appoint therefore it be that the framer of the constitution leave the power of removal unrestricte while they give the senate a fight to reject all appointment which in its opinion be not fit to be make a little reflection on this subject will probably satisfy all who have the good of the country at heart that our good course be to take the constitution for our guide walk in the path mark out by the founder of the republic and obey the rule make sacred by the observance of our great predecessor
 the present condition of our finance and circulate medium be one to which your early consideration be invite
 the proportion which the currency of any country should bear to the whole value of the annual produce circulate by its means be a question upon which political economist have not agree nor can it be control by legislation but must be leave to the irrevocable law which everywhere regulate commerce and trade the circulate medium will ever irresistibly flow to those point where it be in great demand the law of demand and supply be as unerring as that which regulate the tide of the ocean and indeed currency like the tide have its ebb and flow throughout the commercial world
 at the beginning of the rebellion the bank note circulation of the country amount to not much more than $ 200,000,000 now the circulation of national bank note and those know as legal tender be nearly seven hundred million while it be urge by some that this amount should be increase other contend that a decide reduction be absolutely essential to the good interest of the country in view of these diverse opinion it may be well to ascertain the real value of our paper issue when compare with a metallic or convertible currency for this purpose let we inquire how much gold and silver could be purchase by the seven hundred million of paper money now in circulation probably not more than half the amount of the latter show that when our paper currency be compare with gold and silver its commercial value be compress into three hundred and fifty million this striking fact make it the obvious duty of the government as early as may be consistent with the principle of sound political economy to take such measure as will enable the holder of its note and those of the national bank to convert they without loss into specie or its equivalent a reduction of our paper circulate medium need not necessarily follow this however would depend upon the law of demand and supply though it should be bear in mind that by make legal tender and bank note convertible into coin or its equivalent their present specie value in the hand of their holder would be enhance 100 per cent
 legislation for the accomplishment of a result so desirable be demand by the high public consideration the constitution contemplate that the circulate medium of the country shall be uniform in quality and value at the time of the formation of that instrument the country have just emerge from the war of the revolution and be suffer from the effect of a redundant and worthless paper currency the sage of that period be anxious to protect their posterity from the evil that they themselves have experience hence in provide a circulate medium they confer upon congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof at the same time prohibit the states from make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debt
 the anomalous condition of our currency be in strike contrast with that which be originally design our circulation now embrace first note of the national bank which be make receivable for all due to the government exclude impost and by all its creditor except in payment of interest upon its bond and the security themselves second legal tender note issue by the united states and which the law require shall be receive as well in payment of all debt between citizen as of all government due except impost and third gold and silver coin by the operation of our present system of finance however the metallic currency when collect be reserve only for one class of government creditor who hold its bond semiannually receive their interest in coin from the national treasury they be thus make to occupy an invidious position which may be use to strengthen the argument of those who would bring into disrepute the obligation of the nation in the payment of all its debt the plighted faith of the government should be inviolably maintain but while it act with fidelity toward the bondholder who loan his money that the integrity of the union might be preserve it should at the same time observe good faith with the great masse of the people who having rescue the union from the peril of rebellion now bear the burden of taxation that the government may be able to fulfill its engagement there be no reason which will be accept as satisfactory by the people why those who defend we on the land and protect we on the sea the pensioner upon the gratitude of the nation bear the scar and wound receive while in its service the public servant in the various departments of the government the farmer who supply the soldier of the army and the sailor of the navy the artisan who toil in the nation&#39;s workshop or the mechanic and laborer who build its edifice and construct its fort and vessel of war should in payment of their just and hard earn due receive depreciate paper while another class of their countryman no more deserving be pay in coin of gold and silver equal and exact justice require that all the creditor of the government should be pay in a currency possess a uniform value this can only be accomplish by the restoration of the currency to the standard establish by the constitution and by this mean we would remove a discrimination which may if it have not already do so create a prejudice that may become deep rooted and widespread and imperil the national credit
 the feasibility of make our currency correspond with the constitutional standard may be see by reference to a few fact derive from our commercial statistic
 the production of precious metal in the united states from 1849 to 1857 inclusive amount to $ 579,000,000 from 1858 to 1860 inclusive to $ 137,500,000 and from 1861 to 1867 inclusive to $ 457,500,000 -making the grand aggregate of product since 1849 $ 1,174,000,000 the amount of specie coin from 1849 to 1857 inclusive be $ 439,000,000 from 1858 to 1860 inclusive $ 125,000,000 and from 1861 to 1867 inclusive $ 310,000,000 -making the total coinage since 1849 $ 874,000,000 from 1849 to 1857 inclusive the net export of specie amount to $ 271,000,000 from 1858 to 1860 inclusive to $ 148,000,000 and from 1861 to 1867 inclusive $ 322,000,000 -making the aggregate of net export since 1849 $ 741,000,000 these figure show an excess of product over net export of $ 433,000,000 there be in the treasury $ 111,000,000 in coin something more than $ 40,000,000 in circulation on the pacific coast and a few million in the national and other bank in all about $ 160,000,000 this however take into account the specie in the country prior to 1849 leave more than $ 300,000,000 which have not be account for by exportation and therefore may yet remain in the country
 these be important fact and show how completely the inferior currency will supersede the well force it from circulation among the masse and cause it to be export as a mere article of trade to add to the money capital of foreign land they show the necessity of retire our paper money that the return of gold and silver to the avenue of trade may be invite and a demand create which will cause the retention at home of at least so much of the production of our rich and inexhaustible gold bear field as may be sufficient for purpose of circulation it be unreasonable to expect a return to a sound currency so long as the government by continue to issue irredeemable note fill the channel of circulation with depreciated paper notwithstanding a coinage by our mint since 1849 of $ 874,000,000 the people be now stranger to the currency which be design for their use and benefit and specimen of the precious metal bear the national device be seldom see except when produce to gratify the interest excite by their novelty if depreciated paper be to be continue as the permanent currency of the country and all our coin be to become a mere article of traffic and speculation to the enhancement in price of all that be indispensable to the comfort of the people it would be wise economy to abolish our mint thus save the nation the care and expense incident to such establishment and let all our precious metal be export in bullion the time have come however when the government and national bank should be require to take the most efficient step and make all necessary arrangement for a resumption of specie payment at the early practicable period specie payment having be once resume by the government and bank all note or bill of paper issue by either of a less denomination than $ 20 should by law be exclude from circulation so that the people may have the benefit and convenience of a gold and silver currency which in all their business transaction will be uniform in value at home and abroad
 every man of property or industry every man who desire to preserve what he honestly possess or to obtain what he can honestly earn have a direct interest in maintain a safe circulate medium such a medium as shall be real and substantial not liable to vibrate with opinion not subject to be blow up or blow down by the breath of speculation but to be make stable and secure a disordered currency be one of the great political evil it undermine the virtue necessary for the support of the social system and encourage propensity destructive of its happiness it war against industry frugality and economy and it foster the evil spirit of extravagance and speculation
 it have be assert by one of our profound and most gifted statesman that--
 of all the contrivance for cheat the labor class of mankind none have be more effectual than that which delude they with paper money this be the most effectual of invention to fertilize the rich man&#39;s field by the sweat of the poor man&#39;s brow ordinary tyranny oppression excessive taxation these bear lightly on the happiness of the mass of the community compare with a fraudulent currency and the robbery commit by depreciated paper our own history have record for our instruction enough and more than enough of the demoralizing tendency the injustice and the intolerable oppression on the virtuous and well disposed of a degraded paper currency authorize by law or in any way countenance by government
 it be one of the most successful device in time of peace or war expansion or revulsion to accomplish the transfer of all the precious metal from the great mass of the people into the hand of the few where they be hoard in secret place or deposit in strong box under bolt and bar while the people be leave to endure all the inconvenience sacrifice and demoralization result from the use of a depreciated and worthless paper money

 under a sense of public duty i be compel to deny your right under the constitution and law of the united states without the advice and consent of the senate and without any legal cause to suspend i from office as secretary of war or the exercise of any or all function pertain to the same or without such advice and consent to compel i to transfer to any person the record book paper and public property in my custody as secretary
 but inasmuch as the general command the army of the united states have be appoint ad interim and have notify i that he have accept the appointment i have no alternative but to submit under protest to superior force
 to the president
 the suspension have not be revoke and the business of the war department be conduct by the secretary ad interim
 prior to the date of this suspension i have come to the conclusion that the time have arrive when it be proper mr. stanton should retire from my cabinet the mutual confidence and general accord which should exist in such a relation have cease i suppose that mr. stanton be well advise that his continuance in the cabinet be contrary to my wish for i have repeatedly give he so to understand by every mode short of an express request that he should resign having wait full time for the voluntary action of mr. stanton and see no manifestation on his part of an intention to resign i address he the follow note on the 5th of august
 sir public consideration of a high character constrain i to say that your resignation as secretary of war will be accept
 to this note i receive the follow reply
 war department
 august 5 1867
 sir your note of this day have be receive state that public consideration of a high character constrain you to say that my resignation as secretary of war will be accept
 in reply i have the honor to say that public consideration of a high character which alone have induce i to continue at the head of this department constrain i not to resign the office of secretary of war before the next meeting of congress
 edwin m. stanton
 secretary of war
 this reply of mr. stanton be not merely a disinclination of compliance with the request for his resignation it be a defiance and something more mr. stanton do not content himself with assume that public consideration bear upon his continuance in office form as fully a rule of action for himself as for the president and that upon so delicate a question as the fitness of an officer for continuance in his office the officer be as competent and as impartial to decide as his superior who be responsible for his conduct but he go far and plainly intimate what he mean by public consideration of a high character and this be nothing else than his loss of confidence in his superior he say that these public consideration have alone induce i to continue at the head of this department and that they constrain i not to resign the office of secretary of war before the next meeting of congress
 this language be very significant mr. stanton hold the position unwillingly he continue in office only under a sense of high public duty he be ready to leave when it be safe to leave and as the danger he apprehend from his removal then will not exist when congress be here he be constrain to remain during the interim what then be that danger which can only be avert by the presence of mr. stanton or of congress mr. stanton do not say that public consideration of a high character constrain he to hold on to the office indefinitely he do not say that no one other than himself can at any time be find to take his place and perform its duty on the contrary he express a desire to leave the office at the early moment consistent with these high public consideration he say in effect that while congress be away he must remain but that when congress be here he can go in other word he have lose confidence in the president he be unwilling to leave the war department in his hand or in the hand of anyone the president may appoint or designate to perform its duty if he resign the president may appoint a secretary of war that mr. stanton do not approve therefore he will not resign but when congress be in session the president can not appoint a secretary of war which the senate do not approve consequently when congress meet mr. stanton be ready to resign
 whatever cogency these consideration may have have on mr. stanton whatever right he may have have to entertain such consideration whatever propriety there might be in the expression of they to other one thing be certain it be official misconduct to say the least of it to parade they before his superior officer
 upon the receipt of this extraordinary note i only delay the order of suspension long enough to make the necessary arrangement to fill the office if this be the only cause for his suspension it would be ample necessarily it must end our most important official relation for i can not imagine a degree of effrontery which would embolden the head of a department to take his seat at the council table in the executive mansion after such an act nor can i imagine a president so forgetful of the proper respect and dignity which belong to his office as to submit to such intrusion i will not do mr. stanton the wrong to suppose that he entertain any idea of offer to act as one of my constitutional adviser after that note be write there be an interval of a week between that date and the order of suspension during which two cabinet meeting be hold mr. stanton do not present himself at either nor be he expect
 on the 12th of august mr. stanton be notify of his suspension and that general grant have be authorize to take charge of the department in his answer to this notification of the same date mr. stanton express himself as follow
 ldquo;under a sense of public duty i be compel to deny your fight under the constitution and law of the united states without the advice and consent of the senate and without any legal cause to suspend i from office as secretary of war or the exercise of any or all function pertain to the same or without such advice and consent to compel i to transfer to any person the record book paper and public property in my custody as secretary
 but inasmuch as the general command the army of the united states have be appoint ad interim and have notify i that he have accept the appointment i have no alternative but to submit under protest to superior force.&rdquo
 it will not escape attention that in his note of august 5 mr. stanton state that he have be constrain to continue in the office even before he be request to resign by consideration of a high public character in this note of august 12 a new and different sense of public duty compel he to deny the president&#39;s right to suspend he from office without the consent of the senate this last be the public duty of resist an act contrary to law and he charge the president with violation of the law in order his suspension
 mr. stanton refer generally to the constitution and law of the united states and say that a sense of public duty under these compel he to deny the right of the president to suspend he from office as to his sense of duty under the constitution that will be consider in the sequel as to his sense of duty under the law of the united states he certainly can not refer to the law which create the war department for that expressly confer upon the president the unlimited right to remove the head of the department the only other law bear upon the question be the tenure of office act pass by congress over the presidential veto march 2 1867 this be the law which under a sense of public duty mr. stanton volunteer to defend
 there be no provision in this law which compel any officer come within its provision to remain in office it forbid removal not resignation mr. stanton be perfectly free to resign at any moment either upon his own motion or in compliance with a request or an order it be a matter of choice or of taste there be nothing compulsory in the nature of legal obligation nor do he put his action upon that imperative ground he say he act under a sense of public duty not of legal obligation compel he to hold on and leave he no choice the public duty which be upon he arise from the respect which he owe to the constitution and the law violate in his own case he be therefore compel by this sense of public duty to vindicate violate law and to stand as its champion
 this be not the first occasion in which mr. stanton in discharge of a public duty be call upon to consider the provision of that law that tenure of office law do not pass without notice like other act it be send to the president for approval as be my custom i submit its consideration to my cabinet for their advice upon the question whether i should approve it or not it be a grave question of constitutional law in which i would of course rely most upon the opinion of the attorney general and of mr. stanton who have once be attorney general
 every member of my cabinet advise i that the propose law be unconstitutional all speak without doubt or reservation but mr. stanton&#39;s condemnation of the law be the most elaborate and emphatic he refer to the constitutional provision the debate in congress especially to the speech of mr. buchanan when a senator to the decision of the supreme court and to the usage from the beginning of the government through every successive administration all concur to establish the right of removal as vest by the constitution in the president to all these he add the weight of his own deliberate judgment and advise i that it be my duty to defend the power of the president from usurpation and to veto the law
 i do not know when a sense of public duty be more imperative upon a head of department than upon such an occasion as this he act then under the grave obligation of law for when he be call upon by the president for advice it be the constitution which speak to he all his other duty be leave by the constitution to be regulate by statute but this duty be deem so momentous that it be impose by the constitution itself
 after all this i be not prepare for the ground take by mr. stanton in his note of august 12 i be not prepared to find he compel by a new and indefinite sense of public duty under the constitution to assume the vindication of a law which under the solemn obligation of public duty impose by the constitution itself he advise i be a violation of that constitution i make great allowance for a change of opinion but such a change as this hardly fall within the limit of great indulgence
 where our opinion take the shape of advice and influence the action of other the utmost stretch of charity will scarcely justify we in repudiate they when they come to be apply to ourselves
 but to proceed with the narrative i be so much strike with the full mastery of the question manifest by mr. stanton and be at the time so fully occupy with the preparation of another veto upon the pende reconstruction act that i request he to prepare the veto upon this tenure of office bill this he decline on the ground of physical disability to undergo at the time the labor of writing but state his readiness to furnish what aid might be require in the preparation of material for the paper
 at the time this subject be before the cabinet it seem to be take for grant that as to those member of the cabinet who have be appoint by mr. lincoln their tenure of office be not fix by the provision of the act i do not remember that the point be distinctly decide but i well recollect that it be suggest by one member of the cabinet who be appoint by mr. lincoln and that no dissent be express
 whether the point be well take or not do not seem to i of any consequence for the unanimous expression of opinion against the constitutionality and policy of the act be so decide that i feel no concern so far as the act have reference to the gentleman then present that i would be embarrassed in the future the bill have not then become a law the limitation upon the power of removal be not yet impose and there be yet time to make any change if any one of these gentleman have then say to i that he would avail himself of the provision of that bill in case it become a law i should not have hesitate a moment as to his removal no pledge be then expressly give or require but there be circumstance when to give an express pledge be not necessary and when to require it be an imputation of possible bad faith i feel that if these gentleman come within the purview of the bill it be as to they a dead letter and that none of they would ever take refuge under its provision
 i now pass to another subject when on the 15th of april 1865 the duty of the presidential office devolve upon i i find a full cabinet of seven member all of they select by mr. lincoln i make no change on the contrary i shortly afterwards ratify a change determine upon by mr. lincoln but not perfect at his death and admit his appointee mr. harlan in the place of mr. usher who be in office at the time
 the great duty of the time be to reestablish government law and order in the insurrectionary states congress be then in recess and the sudden overthrow of the rebellion require speedy action this grave subject have engage the attention of mr. lincoln in the last day of his life and the plan accord to which it be to be manage have be prepare and be ready for adoption a lead feature of that plan be that it should be carry out by the executive authority for so far as i have be inform neither mr. lincoln nor any member of his cabinet doubt his authority to act or propose to call an extra session of congress to do the work the first business transact in cabinet after i become president be this unfinished business of my predecessor a plan or scheme of reconstruction be produce which have be prepare for mr. lincoln by mr. stanton his secretary of war it be approve and at the early moment practicable be apply in the form of a proclamation to the state of north carolina and afterwards become the basis of action in turn for the other states
 upon the examination of mr. stanton before the impeachment committee he be ask the follow question
 ldquo;did any one of the cabinet express a doubt of the power of the executive branch of the government to reorganize state government which have be in rebellion without the aid of congress?&rdquo
 he answer
 ldquo;none whatever i have myself entertain no doubt of the authority of the president to take measure for the organization of the rebel states on the plan propose during the vacation of congress and agree in the plan specify in the proclamation in the case of north carolina.&rdquo
 there be perhaps no act of my administration for which i have be more denounced than this it be not originate by i but i shrink from no responsibility on that account for the plan approve itself to my own judgment and i do not hesitate to carry it into execution
 thus far and upon this vital policy there be perfect accord between the cabinet and myself and i see no necessity for a change as time pass on there be develop an unfortunate difference of opinion and of policy between congress and the president upon this same subject and upon the ultimate basis upon which the reconstruction of these states should proceed especially upon the question of negro suffrage upon this point three member of the cabinet find themselves to be in sympathy with congress they remain only long enough to see that the difference of policy could not be reconcile they feel that they should remain no long and a high sense of duty and propriety constrain they to resign their position we part with mutual respect for the sincerity of each other in opposite opinion and mutual regret that the difference be on point so vital as to require a severance of official relation this be in the summer of 1866 the subsequent session of congress develop new complication when the suffrage bill for the district of columbia and the reconstruction act of march 2 and march 23 1867 all pass over the veto it be in cabinet consultation upon these bill that a difference of opinion upon the most vital point be develop upon these question there be perfect accord between all the member of the cabinet and myself except mr. stanton he stand alone and the difference of opinion could not be reconcile that unity of opinion which upon great question of public policy or administration be so essential to the executive be go
 i do not claim that a head of department should have no other opinion than those of the president he have the same right in the conscientious discharge of duty to entertain and express his own opinion as have the president what i do claim be that the president be the responsible head of the administration and when the opinion of a head of department be irreconcilably oppose to those of the president in grave matter of policy and administration there be but one result which can solve the difficulty and that be a severance of the official relation this in the past history of the government have always be the rule and it be a wise one for such difference of opinion among its member must impair the efficiency of any administration
 i have now refer to the general ground upon which the withdrawal of mr. stanton from my administration seem to i to be proper and necessary but i can not omit to state a special ground which if it stand alone would vindicate my action
 the sanguinary riot which occur in the city of new orleans on the 30th of august 1866 justly arouse public indignation and public inquiry not only as to those who be engage in it but as to those who more or less remotely might be hold to responsibility for its occurrence i need not remind the senate of the effort make to fix that responsibility on the president the charge be openly make and again and again reiterate all through the land that the president be warn in time but refuse to interfere
 by telegram from the lieutenant governor and attorney general of louisiana date the 27th and 28th of august i be advise that a body of delegate claim to be a constitutional convention be about to assemble in new orleans that the matter be before the grand jury but that it would be impossible to execute civil process without a riot and this question be ask
 ldquo;is the military to interfere to prevent process of court?&rdquo
 this question be ask at a time when the civil court be in the full exercise of their authority and the answer send by telegraph on the same 28th of august be this
 ldquo;the military will be expect to sustain and not to interfere with the proceeding of the courts.&rdquo
 on the same 28th of august the follow telegram be send to mr. stanton by major general baird then owe to the absence of general sheridan in command of the military at new orleans
 hon edwin m. stanton
 secretary of war
 a convention have be call with the sanction of governor wells to meet here on monday the lieutenant governor and city authority think it unlawful and propose to break it up by arrest the delegate i have give no order on the subject but have warn the party that i could not countenance or permit such action without instruction to that effect from the president please instruct i at once by telegraph
 the 28th of august be on saturday the next morning the 29th this dispatch be receive by mr. stanton at his residence in this city he take no action upon it and neither send instruction to general baird himself nor present it to i for such instruction on the next day monday the riot occur i never see this dispatch from general baird until some ten day or two week after the riot when upon my call for all the dispatch with a view to their publication mr. stanton send it to i
 these fact all appear in the testimony of mr. stanton before the judiciary committee in the impeachment investigation
 on the 30th the day of the riot and after it be suppress general baird write to mr. stanton a long letter from which i make the follow extract
 ldquo;sir i have the honor to inform you that a very serious riot have occur here to day i have not be apply to by the convention for protection but the lieutenant governor and the mayor have freely consult with i and i be so fully convinced that it be so strongly the intent of the city authority to preserve the peace in order to prevent military interference that i do not regard an outbreak as a thing to be apprehend the lieutenant governor have assure i that even if a writ of arrest be issue by the court the sheriff would not attempt to serve it without my permission and for to day they design to suspend it i inclose herewith copy of my correspondence with the mayor and of a dispatch which the lieutenant governor claim to have receive from the president i regret that no reply to my dispatch to you of saturday have yet reach i general sheridan be still absent in texas.&rdquo
 the dispatch of general baird of the 28th ask for immediate instruction and his letter of the 30th after detail the terrible riot which have just happen end with the expression of regret that the instruction which he ask for be not send it be not the fault or the error or the omission of the president that this military commander be leave without instruction but for all omission for all error for all failure to instruct when instruction might have avert this calamity the president be openly and persistently hold responsible instantly without wait for proof the delinquency of the president be herald in every form of utterance mr. stanton know then that the president be not responsible for this delinquency the exculpation be in his power but it be not give by he to the public and only to the president in obedience to a requisition for all the dispatch
 no one regret more than myself that general baird&#39;s request be not bring to my notice it be clear from his dispatch and letter that if the secretary of war have give he proper instruction the riot which arise on the assembling of the convention would have be avert
 there may be those ready to say that i would have give no instruction even if the dispatch have reach i in time but all must admit that i ought to have have the opportunity
 the following be the testimony give by mr. stanton before the impeachment investigation committee as to this dispatch
 q. refer to the dispatch of the 28th of july by general baird i ask you whether that dispatch on its receipt be communicate
 a. i receive that dispatch on sunday forenoon i examine it carefully and consider the question present i do not see that i could give any instruction different from the line of action which general baird propose and make no answer to the dispatch
 q. i see it state that this be receive at 10.20 p.m. be that the hour at which it be receive by you
 a. that be the date of its reception in the telegraph office saturday night i receive it on sunday forenoon at my residence a copy of the dispatch be furnish to the president several day afterwards along with all the other dispatch and communication on that subject but it be not furnish by i before that time i suppose it may have be ten or fifteen day afterwards
 o. the president himself be in correspondence with those party upon the same subject would it not have be proper to have advise he of the reception of that dispatch
 a. i know nothing about his correspondence and know nothing about any correspondence except this one dispatch we have intelligence of the riot on thursday morning the riot have take place on monday
 it be a difficult matter to define all the relation which exist between the head of departments and the president the legal relation be well enough define the constitution place these officer in the relation of his adviser when he call upon they for advice the act of congress go far take for example the act of 1789 create the war department it provide that--
 ldquo;there shall be a principal officer therein to be call the secretary for the department of war who shall perform and execute such duty as shall from time to time be enjoin on or intrust to he by the president of the united states&rdquo and furthermore ldquo;the say principal officer shall conduct the business of the said department in such manner as the president of the united states shall from time to time order and instruct.&rdquo
 provision be also make for the appointment of an inferior officer by the head of the department to be call the chief clerk who whenever say principal officer shall be remove from office by the president of the united states shall have the charge and custody of the book record and paper of the department
 the legal relation be analogous to that of principal and agent it be the president upon whom the constitution devolve as head of the executive department the duty to see that the law be faithfully execute but as he can not execute they in person he be allow to select his agent and be make responsible for their act within just limit so complete be this presume delegation of authority in the relation of a head of department to the president that the supreme court of the united states have decide that an order make by a head of department be presume to be make by the president himself
 the principal upon whom such responsibility be place for the act of a subordinate ought to be leave as free as possible in the matter of selection and of dismissal to hold he to responsibility for an officer beyond his control to leave the question of the fitness of such an agent to be decide for he and not by he to allow such a subordinate when the president move by public consideration of a high character request his resignation to assume for himself an equal right to act upon his own view of public consideration and to make his own conclusion paramount to those of the president to allow all this be to reverse the just order of administration and to place the subordinate above the superior
 there be however other relation between the president and a head of department beyond these define legal relation which necessarily attend they though not express chief among these be mutual confidence this relation be so delicate that it be sometimes hard to say when or how it cease a single flagrant act may end it at once and then there be no difficulty but confidence may be just as effectually destroy by a series of cause too subtle for demonstration as it be a plant of slow growth so too it may be slow in decay such have be the process here i will not pretend to say what act or omission have break up this relation they be hardly susceptible of statement and still less of formal proof nevertheless no one can read the correspondence of the 5th of august without be convince that this relation be effectually go on both side and that while the president be unwilling to allow mr. stanton to remain in his administration mr. stanton be equally unwilling to allow the president to carry on his administration without his presence
 in the great debate which take place in the house of representatives in 1789 in the first organization of the principal departments mr. madison speak as follow
 ldquo;it be evidently the intention of the constitution that the first magistrate should be responsible for the executive department so far therefore as we do not make the officer who be to aid he in the duty of that department responsible to he he be not responsible to the country again be there no danger that an officer when he be appoint by the concurrence of the senate and have friend in that body may choose rather to risk his establishment on the favor of that branch than rest it upon the discharge of his duty to the satisfaction of the executive branch which be constitutionally authorize to inspect and control his conduct and if it should happen that the officer connect themselves with the senate they may mutually support each other and for want of efficacy reduce the power of the president to a vapor in which case his responsibility would be annihilate and the expectation of it be unjust the high executive officer join in cabal with the senate would lay the foundation of discord and end in an assumption of the executive power only to be remove by a revolution in the government.&rdquo
 mr. sedgwick in the same debate refer to the proposition that a head of department should only be remove or suspend by the concurrence of the senate use this language
 ldquo;but if proof be necessary what be then the consequence why in nine case out of ten where the case be very dear to the mind of the president that the man ought to be remove the effect can not be produce because it be absolutely impossible to produce the necessary evidence be the senate to proceed without evidence some gentleman contend not then the object will be lose shall a man under these circumstance be saddle upon the president who have be appoint for no other purpose but to aid the president in perform certain duty shall he be continue i ask again against the will of the president if he be where be the responsibility be you to look for it in the president who have no control over the officer no power to remove he if he act unfeelingly or unfaithfully without you make he responsible you weaken and destroy the strength and beauty of your system what be to be do in case which can only be know from a long acquaintance with the conduct of an officer?&rdquo
 i have indulge the hope that upon the assembling of congress mr. stanton would have end this unpleasant complication accord to his intimation give in his note of august 12 the duty which i have feel myself call upon to perform be by no mean agreeable but i feel that i be not responsible for the controversy or for the consequence
 unpleasant as this necessary change in my cabinet have be to i upon personal consideration i have the consolation to be assure that so far as the public interest be involve there be no cause for regret
 salutary reform have be introduce by the secretary ad interim and great reduction of expense have be effect under his administration of the war department to the saving of million to the treasury

to the house of representatives
 in compliance with the resolution adopt yesterday by the house of representatives request any further correspondence the president may have have with general u. s. grant in addition to that heretofore submit on the subject of the recent vacation by the latter of the war office i transmit herewith a copy of a communication address to general grant on the 10th instant together with a copy of the accompany paper
 andrew johnson
 executive mansion february 10 1868
 general u. s. grant
 command army of the united states washington d.c.
 general the extraordinary character of your letter of the 3d instant would seem to preclude any reply on my part but the manner in which publicity have be give to the correspondence of which that letter form a part and the grave question which be involve induce i to take this mode of give as a proper sequel to the communication which have pass between we the statement of the five member of the cabinet who be present on the occasion of our conversation on the 14th ultimo copy of the letter which they have address to i upon the subject be accordingly herewith inclose
 you speak of my letter of the 31st ultimo as a reiteration of the many and gross misrepresentation contain in certain newspaper article and reassert the correctness of the statement contain in your communication of the 28th ultimo add and here i give your own words--"anything in yours in reply to it to the contrary notwithstanding
 when a controversy upon matter of fact reach the point to which this have be bring further assertion or denial between the immediate party should cease especially where upon either side it lose the character of the respectful discussion which be require by the relation in which the party stand to each other and degenerate in tone and temper in such a case if there be nothing to rely upon but the oppose statement conclusion must be draw from those statement alone and from whatever intrinsic probability they afford in favor of or against either of the party i should not shrink from this test in this controversy but fortunately it be not leave to this test alone there be five cabinet officer present at the conversation the detail of which in my letter of the 28th 31st ultimo you allow yourself to say contain many and gross misrepresentation these gentleman hear that conversation and have read my statement they speak for themselves and i leave the proof without a word of comment
 i deem it proper before conclude this communication to notice some of the statement contain in your letter
 you say that a performance of the promise allege to have be make by you to the president would have involve a resistance to law and an inconsistency with the whole history of my connection with the suspension of mr. stanton you then state that you have fear the president would on the removal of mr. stanton appoint someone in his place who would embarrass the army in carry out the reconstruction act and add
 it be to prevent such an appointment that i accept the office of secretary of war ad interim and not for the purpose of enable you to get rid of mr. stanton by withhold it from he in opposition to law or not do so myself surrender it to one who would as the statement and assumption in your communication plainly indicate be seek
 first of all you here admit that from the very beginning of what you term the whole history of your connection with mr. stanton&#39;s suspension you intend to circumvent the president it be to carry out that intent that you accept the appointment this be in your mind at the time of your acceptance it be not then in obedience to the order of your superior as have heretofore be suppose that you assume the duty of the office you know it be the president&#39;s purpose to prevent mr. stanton from resume the office of secretary of war and you intend to defeat that purpose you accept the office not in the interest of the president but of mr. stanton if this purpose so entertain by you have be confine to yourself if when accept the office you have do so with a mental reservation to frustrate the president it would have be a tacit deception in the ethic of some person such a course be allowable but you can not stand even upon that questionable ground the history of your connection with this transaction as write by yourself place you in a different predicament and show that you not only conceal your design from the president but induce he to suppose that you would carry out his purpose to keep mr. stanton out of office by retain it yourself after an attempt restoration by the senate so as to require mr. stanton to establish his right by judicial decision
 i now give that part of this history as write by yourself in your letter of the 28th ultimo
 some time after i assume the duty of secretary of war ad interim the president ask i my view as to the course mr. stanton would have to pursue in case the senate should not concur in his suspension to obtain possession of his office my reply be in substance that mr. stanton would have to appeal to the court to reinstate he illustrate my position by cite the ground i have take in the case of the baltimore police commissioner
 now at that time as you admit in your letter of the 3d instant you hold the office for the very object of defeat an appeal to the court in that letter you say that in accept the office one motive be to prevent the president from appoint some other person who would retain possession and thus make judicial proceeding necessary you know the president be unwilling to trust the office with anyone who would not by hold it compel mr. stanton to resort to the court you perfectly understand that in this interview some time after you accept the office the president not content with your silence desire an expression of your view and you answer he that mr. stanton would have to appeal to the court if the president repose confidence before he know your view and that confidence have be violate it might have be say he make a mistake but a violation of confidence repose after that conversation be no mistake of his nor of your it be the fact only that need be state that at the date of this conversation you do not intend to hold the office with the purpose of force mr. stanton into court but do hold it then and have accept it to prevent that course from be carry out in other word you say to the president that be the proper course and you say to yourself i have accept this office and now hold it to defeat that course the excuse you make in a subsequent paragraph of that letter of the 28th ultimo that afterwards you change your view as to what would be a proper course have nothing to do with the point now under consideration the point be that before you change your view you have secretly determine to do the very thing which at last you do surrender the office to mr. stanton you may have change your view as to the law but you certainly do not change your view as to the course you have mark out for yourself from the beginning
 i will only notice one more statement in your letter of the 3d instant that the performance of the promise which it be allege be make by you would have involve you in the resistance of law i know of no statute that would have be violate have you carry out your promise in good faith tender your resignation when you conclude not to be make a party in any legal proceeding you add
 i be in a measure confirm in this conclusion by your recent order direct i to disobey order from the secretary of war my superior and your subordinate without having countermand his authority to issue the order i be to disobey
 on the 24th ultimo you address a note to the president request in write an order give to you verbally five day before to disregard order from mr. stanton as secretary of war until you know from the president himself that they be his order
 on the 29th in compliance with your request i do give you instruction in write not to obey any order from the war department assume to be issue by the direction of the president unless such order be know by the general command the army of the united states to have be authorize by the executive
 there be some order which a secretary of war may issue without the authority of the president there be other which he issue simply as the agent of the president and which purport to be by direction of the president for such order the president be responsible and he should therefore know and understand what they be before give such direction mr. stanton state in his letter of the 4th instant which accompany the publish correspondence that he have have no correspondence with the president since the 12th of august last and he far say that since he resume the duty of the office he have continue to discharge they without any personal or write communication with the president and he add no order have be issue from this department in the name of the president with my knowledge and i have receive no order from he
 it thus seem that mr. stanton now discharge the duty of the war department without any reference to the president and without use his name
 my order to you have only reference to order assume to be issue by the direction of the president it would appear from mr. stanton&#39;s letter that you have receive no such order from he however in your note to the president of the 30th ultimo in which you acknowledge the receipt of the write order of the 29th you say that you have be inform by mr. stanton that he have not receive any order limit his authority to issue order to the army accord to the practice of the department and state that while this authority to the war department be not countermand it will be satisfactory evidence to i that any order issue from the war department by direction of the president be authorize by the executive
 the president issue an order to you to obey no order from the war department purport to be make by the direction of the president until you have refer it to he for his approval you reply that you have receive the president&#39;s order and will not obey it but will obey an order purport to be give by his direction if it come from the war department you will not obey the direct order of the president but will obey his indirect order if as you say there have be a practice in the war department to issue order in the name of the president without his direction do not the precise order you have request and have receive change the practice as to the general of the army could not the president countermand any such order issue to you from the war department if you should receive an order from that department issue in the name of the president to do a special act and an order directly from the president himself not to do the act be there a doubt which you be to obey you answer the question when you say to the president in your letter of the 3d instant the secretary of war be my superior and your subordinate and yet you refuse obedience to the superior out of a deference to the subordinate
 without further comment upon the insubordinate attitude which you have assume i be at a loss to know how you can relieve yourself from obedience to the order of the president who be make by the constitution the commander in chief of the army and navy and be therefore the official superior as well of the general of the army as of the secretary of war

 the president express great surprise at the course which general grant have think proper to pursue and address himself to the general proceed to say in substance that he have anticipate such action on the part of the senate and be very desirous to have the constitutionality of the tenure of office bill test and his fight to suspend or remove a member of the cabinet decide by the judicial tribunal of the country he have some time ago and shortly after general grant&#39;s appointment as secretary of war ad interim ask the general what his action would be in the event that the senate should refuse to concur in the suspension of mr. stanton and that the general have then agree either to remain at the head of the war department till a decision could be obtain from the court or resign the office into the hand of the president before the case be act upon by the senate so as to place the president in the same situation he occupy at the time of his grant&#39;s appointment
 the president far say that the conversation be renew on the precede saturday at which time he ask the general what he intend to do if the senate should undertake to reinstate mr. stanton in reply to which the general refer to their former conversation upon the same subject and say you understand my position and my conduct will be conformable to that understanding that he the general then express a repugnance to be make a party to a judicial proceeding say that he would expose himself to fine and imprisonment by do so as his continue to discharge the duty of secretary of war ad interim after the senate should have refuse to concur in the suspension of mr. stanton would be a violation of the tenure of office bill that in reply to this he the president inform general grant he have not suspend mr. stanton under the tenure of office bill but by virtue of the power confer on he by the constitution and that as to the fine and imprisonment he the president would pay whatever fine be impose and submit to whatever imprisonment might be adjudge against he the general that they continue the conversation for some time discuss the law at length and that they finally separate without having reach a definite conclusion and with the understanding that the general would see the president again on monday

 general grant&#39;s statement be that in that conversation he have state to you the legal difficulty which might arise involve fine and imprisonment under the civil tenure bill and that he do not care to subject himself to those penalty that you reply to this remark that you regard the civil tenure bill as unconstitutional and do not think its penalty be to be fear or that you would voluntarily assume they and you insist that general grant should either retain the office until relieve by yourself accord to what you claim be the original understanding between yourself and he or by seasonable notice of change of purpose on his part put you in the same situation which you would be if he adhere you claim that general grant finally say in that saturday&#39;s conversation that you understand his view and his proceeding thereafter would be consistent with what have be so understood general grant do not controvert nor can i say that he admit this last statement certainly general grant do not at any time in the cabinet meeting insist that he have in the saturday&#39;s conversation either distinctly or finally advise you of his determination to retire from the charge of the war department otherwise than under your own subsequent direction he acquiesce in your statement that the saturday&#39;s conversation end with an expectation that there would be a subsequent conference on the subject which he as well as yourself suppose could seasonably take place on monday you then allude to the fact that general grant do not call upon you on monday as you have expect from that conversation general grant admit that it be his expectation or purpose to call upon you on monday general grant assign reason for the omission he say he be in conference with general sherman that there be many little matter to be attend to he have converse upon the matter of the incumbency of the war department with general sherman and he expect that general sherman would call upon you on monday my own mind suggest a further explanation but i do not remember whether it be mention or not namely that it be not suppose by general grant on monday that the senate would decide the question so promptly as to anticipate further explanation between yourself and he if delay beyond that day general grant make another explanation that he be engage on sunday with general sherman and i think also on monday in regard to the war department matter with a hope though he do not say in an effort to procure an amicable settlement of the affair of mr. stanton and he still hope that it would be bring about
 i have the honor to be with great respect your obedient servant

 by order of the secretary of war
 ed schriver
 inspector general
to the senate of the united states
 i have receive a copy of the resolution adopt by the senate on the 21st instant as follow
 whereas the senate have receive and consider the communication of the president state that he have remove edwin m. stanton secretary of war and have designate the adjutant general of the army to act as secretary of war ad interim therefore
 resolve by the senate of the united states that under the constitution and law of the united states the president have no power to remove the secretary of war and designate any other officer to perform the duty of that office ad interim
 this resolution be confine to the power of the president to remove the secretary of war and to designate another officer to perform the duty of the office ad interim and by its preamble be make expressly applicable to the removal of mr. stanton and the designation to act ad interim of the adjutant general of the army without therefore attempt to discuss the general power of removal as to all officer upon which subject no expression of opinion be contain in the resolution i shall confine myself to the question as thus limited the power to remove the secretary of war
 it be declare in the resolution--
 that under the constitution and law of the united states the president have no power to remove the secretary of war and designate any other officer to perform the duty of that office ad interim
 as to the question of power under the constitution i do not propose at present to enter upon its discussion
 the uniform practice from the beginning of the government as establish by every president who have exercise the office and the decision of the supreme court of the united states have settle the question in favor of the power of the president to remove all officer except a class hold appointment of a judicial character no practice nor any decision have ever except a secretary of war from this general power of the president to make removal from office
 it be only necessary then that i should refer to the power of the executive under the law of the united states to remove from office a secretary of war the resolution deny that under these law this power have any existence in other word it affirm that no such authority be recognize or give by the statute of the country
 what then be the law of the united states which deny the president the power to remove that officer i know but two law which bear upon this question the first in order of time be the act of august 7 1789 create the department of war which after provide for a secretary as its principal officer proceed as follow
 sec 2 and be it far enact that there shall be in the say department an inferior officer to be appoint by the say principal officer to be employ therein as he shall deem proper and to be call the chief clerk in the department of war and who whenever the say principal officer shall be remove from office by the president of the united states or in any other case of vacancy shall during such vacancy have the charge and custody of all record book and paper appertain to the said department
 it be clear that this act pass by a congress many of whose member participate in the formation of the constitution so far from deny the power of the president to remove the secretary of war recognize it as exist in the executive alone without the concurrence of the senate or of any other department of the government furthermore this act do not purport to confer the power by legislative authority nor in fact be there any other exist legislation through which it be bestow upon the executive the recognition of the power by this act be therefore complete as a recognition under the constitution itself for there be no other source or authority from which it could be derive
 the other act which refer to this question be that regulate the tenure of certain civil office pass by congress on the 2d day of march 1867 the first section of that act be in the follow word
 that every person hold any civil office to which he have be appoint by and with the advice and consent of the senate and every person who shall hereafter be appoint to any such office and shall become duly qualified to act therein be and shall be entitle to hold such office until a successor shall have be in like manner appoint and duly qualify except as herein otherwise provide provide that the secretaries of state of the treasury of war of the navy and of the interior the postmaster general and the attorney general shall hold their office respectively for and during the term of the president by whom they may have be appoint and for one month thereafter subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of the senate
 the fourth section of the same act restrict the term of office to the limit prescribe by the law create they
 that part of the first section which precede the proviso declare that every person hold a civil office to which he have be or may be appoint by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall hold such office until a successor shall have be in like manner appoint it purport to take from the executive during the fix time establish for the tenure of the office the independent power of removal and to require for such removal the concurrent action of the president and the senate
 the proviso that follow proceed to fix the term of office of the seven head of departments whose tenure never have be define before by prescribe that they shall hold their office respectively for and during the term of the president by whom they may have be appoint and for one month thereafter subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of the senate
 thus as to these enumerate officer the proviso take from the president the power of removal except with the advice and consent of the senate by its term however before he can be deprive of the power to displace they it must appear that he himself have appoint they it be only in that case that they have any tenure of office or any independent right to hold during the term of the president and for one month after the cessation of his official function the proviso therefore give no tenure of office to any one of these officer who have be appoint by a former president beyond one month after the accession of his successor
 in the case of mr. stanton the only appointment under which he hold the office of secretary of war be that confer upon he by my immediate predecessor with the advice and consent of the senate he have never hold from i any appointment as the head of the war department whatever fight he have to hold the office be derive from that original appointment and my own sufferance the law be not intend to protect such an incumbent of the war department by take from the president the power to remove he this in my judgment be perfectly clear and the law itself admit of no other just construction we find in all that portion of the first section which precede the proviso that as to civil officer generally the president be deprive of the power of removal and it be plain that if there have be no proviso that power would just as clearly have be take from he so far as it apply to the seven head of department but for reason which be no doubt satisfactory to congress these principal officer be specially provide for and as to they the express and only requirement be that the president who have appoint they shall not without the advice and consent of the senate remove they from office the consequence be that as to my cabinet embrace the seven officer designate in the first section the act take from i the power without the concurrence of the senate to remove any one of they that i have appoint but it do not protect such of they as i do not appoint nor give to they any tenure of office beyond my pleasure
 an examination of this act then show that while in one part of the section provision be make for officer generally in another clause there be a class of officer designate by their official title who be except from the general term of the law and in reference to whom a clear distinction be make as to the general power of removal limit in the first clause of the section
 this distinction be that as to such of these enumerate officer as hold under the appointment of the president the power of removal can only be exercise by he with the consent of the senate while as to those who have not be appoint by he there be no like denial of his power to displace they it would be a violation of the plain meaning of this enactment to place mr. stanton upon the same footing as those head of departments who have be appoint by myself as to he this law give he no tenure of office the member of my cabinet who have be appoint by i be by this act entitle to hold for one month after the term of my office shall cease but mr. stanton could not against the wish of my successor hold a moment thereafter if he be permit by that successor to hold for the first two week would that successor have no power to remove he but the power of my successor over he could be no great than my own if my successor would have the power to remove mr. stanton after permit he to remain a period of two week because he be not appoint by he but by his predecessor i who have tolerate mr. stanton for more than two year certainly have the same right to remove he and upon the same ground namely that he be not appoint by i but by my predecessor
 under this construction of the tenure of office act i have never doubt my power to remove mr. stanton
 whether the act be constitutional or not it be always my opinion that it do not secure he from removal i be however aware that there be doubt as to the construction of the law and from the first i deem it desirable that at the early possible moment those doubt should be settle and the true construction of the act fix by decision of the supreme court of the united states my order of suspension in august last be intend to place the case in such a position as would make a resort to a judicial decision both necessary and proper my understanding and wish however under that order of suspension be frustrate and the late order for mr. stanton&#39;s removal be a further step toward the accomplishment of that purpose
 i repeat that my own conviction as to the true construction of the law and as to its constitutionality be well settle and be sustain by every member of my cabinet include mr. stanton himself upon the question of constitutionality each one in turn deliberately advise i that the tenure of office act be unconstitutional upon the question whether as to those member who be appoint by my predecessor that act take from i the power to remove they one of those member emphatically state in the presence of the other sit in cabinet that they do not come within the provision of the act and it be no protection to they no one dissent from this construction and i understand they all to acquiesce in its correctness in a matter of such grave consequence i be not disposed to rest upon my own opinion though fortify by my constitutional adviser i have therefore seek to bring the question at as early a day as possible before the supreme court of the united states for final and authoritative decision
 in respect to so much of the resolution as relate to the designation of an officer to act as secretary of war ad interim i have only to say that i have exercise this power under the provision of the first section of the act of february 13 1795 which so far as they be applicable to vacancy cause by removal i understand to be still in force
 the legislation upon the subject of ad interim appointment in the executive departments stand as to the war office as follow
 the second section of the act of the 7th of august 1789 make provision for a vacancy in the very case of a removal of the head of the war department and upon such a vacancy give the charge and custody of the record book and paper to the chief clerk next by the act of the 8th of may 1792 section 8 it be provide that in case of a vacancy occasion by death absence from the seat of government or sickness of the head of the war department the president may authorize a person to perform the duty of the office until a successor be appoint or the disability remove the act it will be observe do not provide for the case of a vacancy cause by removal then by the first section of the act of february 13 1795 it be provide that in case of any vacancy the president may appoint a person to perform the duty while the vacancy exist
 these act be follow by that of the 20th of february 1863 by the first section of which provision be again make for a vacancy cause by death resignation absence from the seat of government or sickness of the head of any executive department of the government and upon the occurrence of such a vacancy power be give to the president--
 to authorize the head of any other executive department or other officer in either of say departments whose appointment be vest in the president at his discretion to perform the duty of the say respective office until a successor be appoint or until such absence or inability by sickness shall cease provide that no one vacancy shall be supply in manner aforesaid for a long term than six month
 this law with some modification reenact the act of 1792 and provide as do that act for the sort of vacancy so to be fill but like the act of 1792 it make no provision for a vacancy occasion by removal it have reference altogether to vacancy arise from other cause
 accord to my construction of the act of 1863 while it impliedly repeal the act of 1792 regulate the vacancy therein describe it have no bearing whatever upon so much of the act of 1795 as apply to a vacancy cause by removal the act of 1795 therefore furnish the rule for a vacancy occasion by removal one of the vacancy expressly refer to in the act of the 7th of august 1789 create the department of war certainly there be no express repeal by the act of 1863 of the act of 1795 the repeal if there be any be by implication and can only be admit so far as there be a clear inconsistency between the two act the act of 1795 be inconsistent with that of 1863 as to a vacancy occasion by death resignation absence or sickness but not at all inconsistent as to a vacancy cause by removal
 it be assuredly proper that the president should have the same power to fill temporarily a vacancy occasion by removal as he have to supply a place make vacant by death or the expiration of a term if for instance the incumbent of an office should be find to be wholly unfit to exercise its function and the public service should require his immediate expulsion a remedy should exist and be at once apply and time be allow the president to select and appoint a successor as be permit he in case of a vacancy cause by death or the termination of an official term
 the necessity therefore for an ad interim appointment be just as great and indeed may be great in case of removal than in any other before it be hold therefore that the power give by the act of 1795 in case of removal be abrogate by succeed legislation an express repeal ought to appear so wholesome a power should certainly not be take away by loose implication
 it may be however that in this as in other case of imply repeal doubt may arise it be confessedly one of the most subtle and debatable question which arise in the construction of statute if upon such a question i have fall into an erroneous construction i submit whether it should be characterize as a violation of official duty and of law
 i have deem it proper in vindication of the course which i have consider it my duty to take to place before the senate the reason upon which i have base my action although i have be advise by every member of my cabinet that the entire tenure of office act be unconstitutional and therefore void and although i have expressly concur in that opinion in the veto message which i have the honor to submit to congress when i return the bill for reconsideration i have refrain from make a removal of any officer contrary to the provision of the law and have only exercise that power in the case of mr. stanton which in my judgment do not come within its provision i have endeavor to proceed with the great circumspection and have act only in an extreme and exceptional case carefully follow the course which i have mark out for myself as a general rule faithfully to execute all law though pass over my objection on the score of constitutionality in the present instance i have appeal or seek to appeal to that final arbiter fix by the constitution for the determination of all such question to this course i have be impel by the solemn obligation which rest upon i to sustain inviolate the power of the high office commit to my hand
 whatever may be the consequence merely personal to myself i could not allow they to prevail against a public duty so clear to my own mind and so imperative if what be possible have be certain if i have be fully advise when i remove mr. stanton that in thus defend the trust commit to my hand my own removal be sure to follow i could not have hesitate actuate by public consideration of the high character i earnestly protest against the resolution of the senate which charge i in what i have do with a violation of the constitution and law of the united states

to the senate of the united states
 i have consider with such care as the pressure of other duty have permit a bill entitle an act to amend an act entitle 39;an act to amend the judiciary act pass the 24th of september 1789.&#39 not be able to approve all of its provision i herewith return it to the senate in which house it originate with a brief statement of my objection
 the first section of the bill meet my approbation as for the purpose of protect the right of property from the erroneous decision of inferior judicial tribunal it provide mean for obtain uniformity by appeal to the supreme court of the united states in case which have now become very numerous and of much public interest and in which such remedy be not now allow the second section however take away the right of appeal to that court in case which involve the life and liberty of the citizen and leave they expose to the judgment of numerous interior tribunal it be apparent that the two section be conceive in a very different spirit and i regret that my objection to one impose upon i the necessity of withhold my sanction from the other
 i can not give my assent to a measure which propose to deprive any person restrain of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution or of any treaty or law of the united states from the right of appeal to the high judicial authority know to our government to secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity be one of the declare object of the federal constitution to assure these guaranty be provide in the same instrument as well against unreasonable search and seizure as against the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus unless when in case of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it it be doubtless to afford the people the mean of protect and enforce these inestimable privilege that the jurisdiction which this bill propose to take away be confer upon the supreme court of the nation the act confer that jurisdiction be approve on the 5th day of february 1867 with a full knowledge of the motive that prompt its passage and because it be believe to be necessary and right nothing have since occur to disprove the wisdom and justness of the measure and to modify it as now propose would be to lessen the protection of the citizen from the exercise of arbitrary power and to weaken the safeguard of life and liberty which can never be make too secure against illegal encroachment
 the bill not only prohibit the adjudication by the supreme court of case in which appeal may hereafter be take but interdict its jurisdiction on appeal which have already be make to that high judicial body if therefore it should become a law it will by its retroactive operation wrest from the citizen a remedy which he enjoy at the time of his appeal it will thus operate most harshly upon those who believe that justice have be deny they in the inferior court
 the legislation propose in the second section it seem to i be not in harmony with the spirit and intention of the constitution it can not fail to affect most injuriously the just equipoise of our system of government for it establish a precedent which if follow may eventually sweep away every check on arbitrary and unconstitutional legislation thus far during the existence of the government the supreme court of the united states have be view by the people as the true expounder of their constitution and in the most violent party conflict its judgment and decree have always be seek and defer to with confidence and respect in public estimation it combine judicial wisdom and impartiality in a great degree than any other authority know to the constitution and any act which may be construe into or mistaken for an attempt to prevent or evade its decision on a question which affect the liberty of the citizen and agitate the country can not fail to be attend with unpropitious consequence it will be justly hold by a large portion of the people as an admission of the unconstitutionality of the act on which its judgment may be forbid or forestall and may interfere with that willing acquiescence in its provision which be necessary for the harmonious and efficient execution of any law
 for these reason thus briefly and imperfectly state and for other of which want of time forbid the enumeration i deem it my duty to withhold my assent from this bill and to return it for the reconsideration of congress

to the house of representatives
 i return without my signature a bill entitle an act to admit the state of arkansas to representation in congress
 the approval of this bill would be an admission on the part of the executive that the act for the more efficient government of the rebel state pass march 2 1867 and the act supplementary thereto be proper and constitutional my opinion however in reference to those measure have undergo no change but on the contrary have be strengthen by the result which have attend their execution even be this not the case i could not consent to a bill which be base upon the assumption either that by an act of rebellion of a portion of its people the state of arkansas secede from the union or that congress may at its pleasure expel or exclude a state from the union or interrupt its relation with the government by arbitrarily deprive it of representation in the senate and house of representatives if arkansas be a state not in the union this bill do not admit it as a state into the union if on the other hand arkansas be a state in the union no legislation be necessary to declare it entitle to representation in congress as one of the states of the union the constitution already declare that each state shall have at least one representative that the senate shall be compose of two senator from each state and that no state without its consent shall be deprive of its equal suffrage in the senate
 that instrument also make each house the judge of the election return and qualification of its own member and therefore all that be now necessary to restore arkansas in all its constitutional relation to the government be a decision by each house upon the eligibility of those who present their credential claim seat in the respective houses of congress this be the plain and simple plan of the constitution and believe that have it be pursue when congress assemble in the month of december 1865 the restoration of the states would long since have be complete i once again earnestly recommend that it be adopt by each house in preference to legislation which i respectfully submit be not only of at least doubtful constitutionality and therefore unwise and dangerous as a precedent but be unnecessary not so effective in its operation as the mode prescribe by the constitution involve additional delay and from its term may be take rather as applicable to a territory about to be admit as one of the united states than to a state which have occupy a place in the union for upward of a quarter of a century
 the bill declare the state of arkansas entitle and admit to representation in congress as one of the states of the union upon the follow fundamental condition
 that the constitution of arkansas shall never be so amend or change as to deprive any citizen or class of citizen of the united states of the right to vote who be entitle to vote by the constitution herein recognize except as a punishment for such crime as be now felony at common law whereof they shall have be duly convict under law equally applicable to all the inhabitant of say state provide that any alteration of said constitution prospective in its effect may be make in regard to the time and place of residence of voter
 i have be unable to find in the constitution of the united states any warrant for the exercise of the authority thus claim by congress in assume the power to impose a fundamental condition upon a state which have be duly admit into the union upon an equal footing with the original states in all respect whatever congress assert a right to enter a state as it may a territory and to regulate the high prerogative of a free people the elective franchise this question be reserve by the constitution to the states themselves and to concede to congress the power to regulate the subject would be to reverse the fundamental principle of the republic and to place in the hand of the federal government which be the creature of the states the sovereignty which justly belong to the states or the people the true source of all political power by whom our federal system be create and to whose will it be subordinate
 the bill fail to provide in what manner the state of arkansas be to signify its acceptance of the fundamental condition which congress endeavor to make unalterable and irrevocable nor do it prescribe the penalty to be impose should the people of the state amend or change the particular portion of the constitution which it be one of the purpose of the bill to perpetuate but as to the consequence of such action leave they in uncertainty and doubt when the circumstance under which this constitution have be bring to the attention of congress be consider it be not unreasonable to suppose that effort will be make to modify its provision and especially those in respect to which this measure prohibit any alteration it be seriously question whether the constitution have be ratify by a majority of the person who under the act of march 2 1867 and the act supplementary thereto be entitle to registration and to vote upon that issue section 10 of the schedule provide that--
 no person disqualify from vote or register under this constitution shall vote for candidate for any office nor shall be permit to vote for the ratification or rejection of the constitution at the poll herein authorize
 assume to be in force before its adoption in disregard of the law of congress the constitution undertake to impose upon the elector other and further condition the fifth section of the eighth article provide that all person before register or voting must take and subscribe an oath which among other contain the follow clause
 that i accept the civil and political equality of all man and agree not to attempt to deprive any person or person on account of race color or previous condition of any political or civil right privilege or immunity enjoy by any other class of man
 it be well know that a very large portion of the elector in all the states if not a large majority of all of they do not believe in or accept the political equality of indians mongolians or negroes with the race to which they belong if the voter in many of the states of the north and west be require to take such an oath as a test of their qualification there be reason to believe that a majority of they would remain from the poll rather than comply with its degrading condition how far and to what extent this test oath prevent the registration of those who be qualified under the law of congress it be not possible to know but that such be its effect at least sufficient to overcome the small and doubtful majority in favor of this constitution there can be no reasonable doubt should the people of arkansas therefore desire to regulate the elective franchise so as to make it conform to the constitution of a large proportion of the states of the north and west modify the provision refer to in the fundamental condition what be to be the consequence be it intend that a denial of representation shall follow and if so may we not dread at some future day a recurrence of the trouble which have so long agitate the country would it not be the part of wisdom to take for our guide the federal constitution rather than resort to measure which look only to the present may in a few year renew in an aggravate form the strife and bitterness cause by legislation which have prove to be so ill timed and unfortunate

to the senate and house of representatives
 experience have fully demonstrate the wisdom of the framer of the federal constitution under all circumstance the result of their labor be as near an approximation to perfection as be compatible with the fallibility of man such be the estimation in which the constitution be and have ever be hold by our countryman it be not surprising that any proposition for its alteration or amendment should be receive with reluctance and distrust while this sentiment deserve commendation and encouragement as a useful preventive of unnecessary attempt to change its provision it must be concede that time have develop imperfection and omission in the constitution the reformation of which have be demand by the good interest of the country some of these have be remedie in the manner provide in the constitution itself there be other which although heretofore bring to the attention of the people have never be so present as to enable the popular judgment to determine whether they should be correct by mean of additional amendment my object in this communication be to suggest certain defect in the constitution which seem to i to require correction and to recommend that the judgment of the people be take on the amendment propose
 the first of the defect to which i desire to direct attention be in that clause of the constitution which provide for the election of president and vice president through the intervention of elector and not by an immediate vote of the people the importance of so amend this clause as to secure to the people the election of president and vice president by their direct vote be urge with great earnestness and ability by president jackson in his first annual message and the recommendation be repeat in five of his subsequent communication to congress extend through the eight year of his administration in his message of 1829 he say
 ldquo;to the people belong the fight of elect their chief magistrate it be never design that their choice should in any case be defeat either by the intervention of electoral college or by the agency confide under certain contingency to the house of representatives.&rdquo
 he then proceed to state the objection to an election of president by the house of representatives the most important of which be that the choice of a clear majority of the people might be easily defeat he then close the argument with the following communication
 ldquo;i would therefore recommend such an amendment of the constitution as may remove all intermediate agency in the election of the president and vice president the mode may be so regulated as to preserve to each state its present relative weight in the election and a failure in the first attempt may be provide for by confine the second to a choice between the two high candidate in connection with such an amendment it would seem advisable to limit the service of the chief magistrate to a single term of either four or six year if however it should not be adopt it be worthy of consideration whether a provision disqualify for office the representatives in congress on whom such an election may have devolve would not be proper.&rdquo
 although this recommendation be repeat with undiminished earnestness in several of his succeed message yet the propose amendment be never adopt and submit to the people by congress the danger of a defeat of the people&#39; choice in an election by the house of representatives remain unprovided for in the constitution and would be greatly increase if the house of representatives should assume the power arbitrarily to reject the vote of a state which might not be cast in conformity with the wish of the majority in that body
 but if president jackson fail to secure the amendment to the constitution which he urge so persistently his argument contribute largely to the formation of party organization which have effectually avoid the contingency of an election by the house of representatives these organization first by a resort to the caucus system of nominating candidate and afterwards to state and national convention have be successful in so limit the number of candidate as to escape the danger of an election by the house of representatives
 it be clear however that in thus limit the number of candidate the true object and spirit of the constitution have be evade and defeat it be an essential feature in our republican system of government that every citizen possess the constitutional qualification have a right to become a candidate for the office of president and vice president and that every qualified elector have a right to cast his vote for any citizen whom he may regard as worthy of these office but under the party organization which have prevail for year these assert right of the people have be as effectually cut off and destroy as if the constitution itself have inhibit their exercise
 the danger of a defeat of the popular choice in an election by the house of representatives be no great than in an election make nominally by the people themselves when by the law of party organization and by the constitutional provision require the people to vote for elector instead of for the president or vice president it be make impracticable for any citizen to be a candidate except through the process of a party nomination and for any voter to cast his suffrage for any other person than one thus bring forward through the manipulation of a nominate convention it be thus apparent that by mean of party organization that provision of the constitution which require the election of president and vice president to be make through the electoral college have be make instrumental and potential in defeat the great object of confer the choice of these officer upon the people it may be concede that party organization be inseparable from republican government and that when form and manage in subordination to the constitution they may be valuable safeguard of popular liberty but when they be pervert to purpose of bad ambition they be liable to become the dangerous instrument of overthrow the constitution itself strongly impress with the truth of these view i feel call upon by an imperative sense of duty to revive substantially the recommendation so often and so earnestly make by president jackson and to urge that the amendment to the constitution herewith present or some similar proposition may be submit to the people for their ratification or rejection
 recent event have show the necessity of an amendment to the constitution distinctly define the person who shall discharge the duty of president of the united states in the event of a vacancy in that office by the death resignation or removal of both the president and vice president it be clear that this should be fix by the constitution and not be leave to repealable enactment of doubtful constitutionality it occur to i that in the event of a vacancy in the office of president by the death resignation disability or removal of both the president and vice president the duty of the office should devolve upon an officer of the executive department of the government rather than one connect with the legislative or judicial department the objection to designate either the president pro tempore of the senate or the chief justice of the supreme court especially in the event of a vacancy produce by removal be so obvious and so unanswerable that they need not be state in detail it be enough to state that they be both interested in produce a vacancy and accord to the provision of the constitution be member of the tribunal by whose decree a vacancy may be produce
 under such circumstance the impropriety of designate either of these officer to succeed the president so removed be palpable the framer of the constitution when they refer to congress the settlement of the succession to the office of president in the event of a vacancy in the office of both president and vice president do not in my opinion contemplate the designation of any other than an officer of the executive department on whom in such a contingency the power and duty of the president should devolve until recently the contingency have be remote and serious attention have not be call to the manifest incongruity between the provision of the constitution on this subject and the act of congress of 1792 have however be bring almost face to face with this important question it seem an eminently proper time for we to make the legislation conform to the language intent and theory of the constitution and thus place the executive department beyond the reach of usurpation and remove from the legislative and judicial department every temptation to combine for the absorption of all the power of government
 it have occur to i that in the event of such a vacancy the duty of president would devolve most appropriately upon some one of the head of the several executive departments and under this conviction i present for your consideration an amendment to the constitution on this subject with the recommendation that it be submit to the people for their action
 experience seem to have establish the necessity of an amendment of that clause of the constitution which provide for the election of senator to congress by the legislature of the several states it would be more consistent with the genius of our form of government if the senators be choose directly by the people of the several states the objection to the election of senators by the legislature be so palpable that i deem it unnecessary to do more than submit the proposition for such an amendment with the recommendation that it be open to the people for their judgment
 it be strongly impressed on my mind that the tenure of office by the judiciary of the united states during good behavior for life be incompatible with the spirit of republican government and in this opinion i be fully sustain by the evidence of popular judgment upon this subject in the different states of the union
 i therefore deem it my duty to recommend an amendment to the constitution by which the term of the judicial officer would be limit to a period of year and i herewith present it in the hope that congress will submit it to the people for their decision
 the foregoing view have long be entertain by i in 1845 in the house of representatives and afterwards in 1860 in the senate of the united states i submit substantially the same proposition as those to which the attention of congress be herein invite time observation and experience have confirm these conviction and as a matter of public duty and a deep sense of my constitutional obligation to recommend to the consideration of congress such measure as i deem necessary and expedient i submit the accompany proposition and urge their adoption and submission to the judgment of the people

to the senate of the united states
 i have give to the joint resolution entitle a resolution exclude from the electoral college the vote of states lately in rebellion which shall not have be reorganize as careful examination as i have be able to bestow upon the subject during the few day that have intervene since the measure be submit for my approval
 feel constrain to withhold my consent i herewith return the resolution to the senate in which house it originate with a brief statement of the reason which have induce my action this joint resolution be base upon the assumption that some of the states whose inhabitant be lately in rebellion be not now entitle to representation in congress and participation in the election of president and vice president of the united states
 have heretofore have occasion to give in detail my reason for dissent from this view it be not necessary at this time to repeat they it be sufficient to state that i continue strong in my conviction that the act of secession by which a number of the states seek to dissolve their connection with the other states and to subvert the union be unauthorized by the constitution and in direct violation thereof be from the beginning absolutely null and void it follow necessarily that when the rebellion terminate the several states which have attempt to secede continue to be state in the union and all that be require to enable they to resume their relation to the union be that they should adopt the measure necessary to their practical restoration as states such measure be adopt and the legitimate result be that those state having conform to all the requirement of the constitution resume their former relation and become entitled to the exercise of all the right guarantee to they by its provision
 the joint resolution under consideration however seem to assume that by the insurrectionary act of their respective inhabitant those states forfeit their right as such and can never again exercise they except upon readmission into the union on the term prescribe by congress if this position be correct it follow that they be take out of the union by virtue of their act of secession and hence that the war wage upon they be illegal and unconstitutional we would thus be place in this inconsistent attitude that while the war be commence and carry on upon the distinct ground that the southern states be component part of the union be in rebellion against the lawful authority of the united states upon its termination we resort to a policy of reconstruction which assume that it be not in fact a rebellion but that the war be wage for the conquest of territory assume to be outside of the constitutional union
 the mode and manner of receive and count the electoral vote for president and vice president of the united states be in plain and simple term prescribe by the constitution that instrument imperatively require that the president of the senate shall in the presence of the senate and house of representatives open all the certificate and the vote shall then be count congress have therefore no power under the constitution to receive the electoral vote or reject they the whole power be exhaust when in the presence of the two houses the vote be count and the result declare in this respect the power and duty of the president of the senate be under the constitution purely ministerial when therefore the joint resolution declare that no electoral vote shall be receive or count from states that since the 4th of march 1867 have not adopt a constitution of state government under which a state government shall have organize a power be assume which be nowhere delegate to congress unless upon the assumption that the state government organize prior to the 4th of march 1867 be illegal and void
 the joint resolution by implication at least concede that these states be states by virtue of their organization prior to the 4th of march 1867 but deny to they the right to vote in the election of president and vice president of the united states it follow either that this assumption of power be wholly unauthorized by the constitution or that the states so exclude from voting be out of the union by reason of the rebellion and have never be legitimately restore be fully satisfied that they be never out of the union and that their relation thereto have be legally and constitutionally restore i be force to the conclusion that the joint resolution which deprive they of the right to have their vote for president and vice president receive and count be in conflict with the constitution and that congress have no more power to reject their vote than those of the states which have be uniformly loyal to the federal union
 it be worthy of remark that if the states whose inhabitant be recently in rebellion be legally and constitutionally organize and restore to their right prior to the 4th of march 1867 as i be satisfied they be the only legitimate authority under which the election for president and vice president can be hold therein must be derive from the government institute before that period it clearly follow that all the state government organize in those states under act of congress for that purpose and under military control be illegitimate and of no validity whatever and in that view the vote cast in those states for president and vice president in pursuance of act pass since the 4th of march 1867 and in obedience to the so call reconstruction act of congress can not be legally receive and count while the only vote in those states that can be legally cast and count will be those cast in pursuance of the law in force in the several states prior to the legislation by congress upon the subject of reconstruction
 i can not refrain from direct your special attention to the declaration contain in the joint resolution that none of the states whose inhabitant be lately in rebellion shall be entitle to representation in the electoral college etc if it be mean by this declaration that no state be to be allow to vote for president and vice president all of whose inhabitant be engage in the late rebellion it be apparent that no one of the states will be exclude from voting since it be well know that in every southern state there be many inhabitant who not only do not participate m the rebellion but who actually take part in the suppression or refrain from give it any aid or countenance i therefore conclude that the true meaning of the joint resolution be that no state a portion of whose inhabitant be engage in the rebellion shall be permit to participate in the presidential election except upon the term and condition therein prescribed
 assume this to be the true construction of the resolution the inquiry become pertinent may those northern states a portion of whose inhabitant be actually in the rebellion be prevent at the discretion of congress from have their electoral vote count it be well know that a portion of the inhabitant of new york and a portion of the inhabitant of virginia be alike engage in the rebellion yet it be equally well known that virginia as well as new york be at all time during the war recognize by the federal government as a state in the union so clearly that upon the termination of hostility it be not even deem necessary for her restoration that a provisional governor should be appoint yet accord to this joint resolution the people of virginia unless they comply with the term it prescribe be deny the right of voting for president while the people of new york a portion of the inhabitant of which state be also in rebellion be permit to have their electoral vote count without undergo the process of reconstruction prescribe for virginia new york be no more a state than virginia the one be as much entitle to representation in the electoral college as the other if congress have the power to deprive virginia of this right it can exercise the same authority with respect to new york or any other of the states thus the result of the presidential election may be control and determine by congress and the people be deprive of their right under the constitution to choose a president and vice president of the united states
 if congress be to provide by law that the vote of none of the states should be receive and count if cast for a candidate who differ in political sentiment with a majority of the two houses such legislation would at once be condemn by the country as an unconstitutional and revolutionary usurpation of power it would however be exceedingly difficult to find in the constitution any more authority for the passage of the joint resolution under consideration than for an enactment look directly to the rejection of all vote not in accordance with the political preference of a majority of congress no power exist in the constitution authorize the joint resolution or the suppose law the only difference be that one would be more palpably unconstitutional and revolutionary than the other both would rest upon the radical error that congress have the power to prescribe term and condition to the right of the people of the states to cast their vote for president and vice president
 for the reason thus indicate i be constrain to return the joint resolution to the senate for such further action thereon as congress may deem necessary

fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives

 upon the reassembling of congress it again become my duty to call your attention to the state of the union and to its continue disorganized condition under the various law which have be pass upon the subject of reconstruction

 it may be safely assume as an axiom in the government of state that the great wrong inflict upon a people be cause by unjust and arbitrary legislation or by the unrelenting decree of despotic ruler and that the timely revocation of injurious and oppressive measure be the great good that can be confer upon a nation the legislator or ruler who have the wisdom and magnanimity to retrace his step when convince of error will soon or later be reward with the respect and gratitude of an intelligent and patriotic people

 our own history although embrace a period less than a century afford abundant proof that most if not all of our domestic trouble be directly traceable to violation of the organic law and excessive legislation the most striking illustration of this fact be furnish by the enactment of the past three year upon the question of reconstruction after a fair trial they have substantially fail and prove pernicious in their result and there seem to be no good reason why they should long remain upon the statute book state to which the constitution guarantee a republican form of government have be reduce to military dependency in each of which the people have be make subject to the arbitrary will of the command general although the constitution require that each state shall be represent in congress virginia mississippi and texas be yet exclude from the two houses and contrary to the express provision of that instrument be deny participation in the recent election for a president and vice president of the united states the attempt to place the white population under the domination of person of color in the south have impair if not destroy the kindly relation that have previously exist between they and mutual distrust have engender a feeling of animosity which lead in some instance to collision and bloodshed have prevent that cooperation between the two race so essential to the success of industrial enterprise in the southern states nor have the inhabitant of those states alone suffer from the disturbed condition of affair grow out of these congressional enactment the entire union have be agitate by grave apprehension of trouble which might again involve the peace of the nation its interest have be injuriously affect by the derangement of business and labor and the consequent want of prosperity throughout that portion of the country

 the federal constitution the magna carta of american right under whose wise and salutary provision we have successfully conduct all our domestic and foreign affair sustain ourselves in peace and in war and become a great nation among the power of the earth must assuredly be now adequate to the settlement of question grow out of the civil war wage alone for its vindication this great fact be make most manifest by the condition of the country when congress assemble in the month of december 1865 civil strife have cease the spirit of rebellion have spend its entire force in the southern states the people have warm into national life and throughout the whole country a healthy reaction in public sentiment have take place by the application of the simple yet effective provision of the constitution the executive department with the voluntary aid of the states have bring the work of restoration as near completion as be within the scope of its authority and the nation be encourage by the prospect of an early and satisfactory adjustment of all its difficulty congress however intervene and refuse to perfect the work so nearly consummate decline to admit member from the unrepresented states adopt a series of measure which arrest the progress of restoration frustrate all that have be so successfully accomplish and after three year of agitation and strife have leave the country far from the attainment of union and fraternal feeling than at the inception of the congressional plan of reconstruction it need no argument to show that legislation which have produce such baneful consequence should be abrogate or else make to conform to the genuine principle of republican government

 under the influence of party passion and sectional prejudice other act have be pass not warrant by the constitution congress have already be make familiar with my view respect the tenure of office bill experience have prove that its repeal be demand by the good interest of the country and that while it remain in force the president can not enjoin that rigid accountability of public officer so essential to an honest and efficient execution of the law its revocation would enable the executive department to exercise the power of appointment and removal in accordance with the original design of the federal constitution

 the act of march 2 1867 make appropriation for the support of the army for the year end june 30 1868 and for other purpose contain provision which interfere with the president 's constitutional function as commander in chief of the army and deny to states of the union the right to protect themselves by mean of their own militia these provision should be at once annul for while the first might in time of great emergency seriously embarrass the executive in effort to employ and direct the common strength of the nation for its protection and preservation the other be contrary to the express declaration of the constitution that a well regulate militia be necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe

 it be believe that the repeal of all such law would be accept by the american people as at least a partial return to the fundamental principle of the government and an indication that hereafter the constitution be to be make the nation 's safe and unerring guide they can be productive of no permanent benefit to the country and should not be permit to stand as so many monument of the deficient wisdom which have characterize our recent legislation

 the condition of our finance demand the early and earnest consideration of congress compare with the growth of our population the public expenditure have reach an amount unprecedented in our history

 the population of the united states in 1790 be nearly 4,000,000 people increase each decade about 33 percent it reach in 1860 31,000,000 an increase of 700 percent on the population in 1790 in 1869 it be estimate that it will reach 38,000,000 or an increase of 868 percent in seventy nine year

 the annual expenditure of the federal government in 1791 be $ 4,200,000 in 1820 $ 18.200,000 in 1850 forty one million in 1860 sixty three million in 1865 nearly thirteen hundred million and in 1869 it be estimate by the secretary of the treasury in his last annual report that they will be three hundred and seventy two million

 by compare the public disbursement of 1869 as estimate with those of 1791 it will be see that the increase of expenditure since the beginning of the government have be 8,618 percent while the increase of the population for the same period be only 868 percent again the expense of the government in 1860 the year of peace immediately precede the war be only sixty three million while in 1869 the year of peace three year after the war it be estimate they will be three hundred and seventy two million an increase of 489 percent while the increase of population be only 21 percent for the same period

 these statistic far show that in 1791 the annual national expense compare with the population be little more than $ 1 per capita and in 1860 but $ 2 per capita while in 1869 they will reach the extravagant sum of $ 9.78 per capita

 it will be observe that all these statement refer to and exhibit the disbursement of peace period it may therefore be of interest to compare the expenditure of the three war period the war with great britain the mexican war and the war of the rebellion

 in 1814 the annual expense incident to the war of 1812 reach their high amount about thirty one million while our population slightly exceed 8,000,000 show an expenditure of only $ 3.80 per capita in 1847 the expenditure grow out of the war with mexico reach fifty five million and the population about 21,000,000 give only $ 2.60 per capita for the war expense of that year in 1865 the expenditure call for by the rebellion reach the vast amount of twelve hundred and ninety million which compare with a population of 34,000,000 give $ 38.20 per capita

 from the 4th day of march 1789 to the 30th of june 1861 the entire expenditure of the government be $ 1,700,000,000 during that period we be engage in war with great britain and mexico and be involve in hostility with powerful indian tribe louisiana be purchase from france at a cost of $ 15,000,000 florida be cede to we by spain for five million california be acquire from mexico for fifteen million and the territory of new mexico be obtain from texas for the sum of ten million early in 1861 the war of the rebellion commence and from the 1st of july of that year to the 30th of june 1865 the public expenditure reach the enormous aggregate of thirty three hundred million three year of peace have intervene and during that time the disbursement of the government have successively be five hundred and twenty million three hundred and forty six million and three hundred and ninety three million add to these amount three hundred and seventy two million estimate as necessary for the fiscal year end the 30th of june 1869 we obtain a total expenditure of $ 1,600,000,000 during the four year immediately succeed the war or nearly as much as be expend during the seventy two year that precede the rebellion and embrace the extraordinary expenditure already name

 these startling fact clearly illustrate the necessity of retrenchment in all branch of the public service abuse which be tolerate during the war for the preservation of the nation will not be endure by the people now that profound peace prevail the receipt from internal revenue and custom have during the past three year gradually diminish and the continuance of useless and extravagant expenditure will involve we in national bankruptcy or else make inevitable an increase of taxis already too onerous and in many respect obnoxious on account of their inquisitorial character one hundred million annually be expend for the military force a large portion of which be employ in the execution of law both unnecessary and unconstitutional one hundred and fifty million be require each year to pay the interest on the public debt an army of tax gatherer impoverish the nation and public agent place by congress beyond the control of the executive divert from their legitimate purpose large sum of money which they collect from the people in the name of the government judicious legislation and prudent economy can alone remedy defect and avert evil which if suffer to exist can not fail to diminish confidence in the public council and weaken the attachment and respect of the people toward their political institution without proper care the small balance which it be estimate will remain in the treasury at the close of the present fiscal year will not be realize and additional million be add to a debt which be now enumerate by billion

 it be show by the able and comprehensive report of the secretary of the treasury that the receipt for the fiscal year end june 30 1868 be $ 405,638,083 and that the expenditure for the same period be $ 377,340,284 leave in the treasury a surplus of $ 28,297,798 it be estimate that the receipt during the present fiscal year end june 30 1869 will be $ 341,392,868 and the expenditure $ 336,152,470 show a small balance of $ 5,240,398 in favor of the government for the fiscal year end june 30 1870 it be estimate that the receipt will amount to $ 327,000,000 and the expenditure to $ 303,000,000 leave an estimate surplus of $ 24,000,000

 it become proper in this connection to make a brief reference to our public indebtedness which have accumulate with such alarming rapidity and assume such colossal proportion

 in 1789 when the government commence operation under the federal constitution it be burden with an indebtedness of $ 75,000,000 create during the war of the revolution this amount have be reduce to $ 45,000,000 when in 1812 war be declare against great britain the three year struggle that follow largely increase the national obligation and in 1816 they have attain the sum of $ 127,000,000 wise and economical legislation however enable the government to pay the entire amount within a period of twenty year and the extinguishment of the national debt fill the land with rejoice and be one of the great event of president jackson 's administration after its redemption a large fund remain in the treasury which be deposit for safe keeping with the several states on condition that it should be return when require by the public want in 1849 the year after the termination of an expensive war with mexico we find ourselves involve in a debt of $ 64,000,000 and this be the amount owe by the government in 1860 just prior to the outbreak of the rebellion in the spring of 1861 our civil war commence each year of its continuance make an enormous addition to the debt and when in the spring of 1865 the nation successfully emerge from the conflict the obligation of the government have reach the immense sum of $ 2.873,992,909 the secretary of the treasury show that on the 1st day of november 1867 this amount have be reduce to $ 2,491,504,450 but at the same time his report exhibit an increase during the past year of $ 35,625,102 for the debt on the 1st day of november last be state to have be $ 2,527,129,552 it be estimate by the secretary that the return for the past month will add to our liability the further sum of $ 11,000,000 make a total increase during thirteen month of $ 46,500,000

 in my message to congress december 4 1865 it be suggest that a policy should be devise which without be oppressive to the people would at once begin to effect a reduction of the debt and if persist in discharge it fully within a definite number of year the secretary of the treasury forcibly recommend legislation of this character and justly urge that the long it be defer the more difficult must become its accomplishment we should follow the wise precedent establish in 1789 and 1816 and without further delay make provision for the payment of our obligation at as early a period as may be practicable the fruit of their labor should be enjoy by our citizen rather than use to build up and sustain moneyed monopoly in our own and other land our foreign debt be already compute by the secretary of the treasury at $ 850,000,000 citizen of foreign country receive interest upon a large portion of our security and american taxpayer be make to contribute large sum for their support the idea that such a debt be to become permanent should be at all time discard as involve taxation too heavy to be bear and payment once in every sixteen year at the present rate of interest of an amount equal to the original sum this vast debt if permit to become permanent and increase must eventually be gather into the hand of a few and enable they to exert a dangerous and control power in the affair of the government the borrower would become servant to the lender the lender the master of the people we now pride ourselves upon having give freedom to 4,000,000 of the colored race it will then be our shame that 40,000,000 of people by their own toleration of usurpation and profligacy have suffer themselves to become enslaved and merely exchange slave owner for new taskmaster in the shape of bondholder and tax gatherer besides permanent debt pertain to monarchical government and tend to monopoly perpetuity and class legislation be totally irreconcilable with free institution introduce into our republican system they would gradually but surely sap its foundation eventually subvert our governmental fabric and erect upon its ruin a moneyed aristocracy it be our sacred duty to transmit unimpaire to our posterity the blessing of liberty which be bequeath to we by the founder of the republic and by our example teach those who be to follow we carefully to avoid the danger which threaten a free and independent people

 various plan have be propose for the payment of the public debt however they may have vary as to the time and mode in which it should be redeem there seem to be a general concurrence as to the propriety and justness of a reduction in the present rate of interest the secretary of the treasury in his report recommend 5 percent congress in a bill pass prior to adjournment on the 27th of july last agree upon 4 and 4 1/2 percent while by many 3 percent have be hold to be an amply sufficient return for the investment the general impression as to the exorbitancy of the exist rate of interest have lead to an inquiry in the public mind respect the consideration which the government have actually receive for its bond and the conclusion be become prevalent that the amount which it obtain be in real money three or four hundred percent less than the obligation which it issue in return it can not be deny that we be pay an extravagant percentage for the use of the money borrow which be paper currency greatly depreciate below the value of coin this fact be make apparent when we consider that bondholder receive from the treasury upon each dollar they own in government security 6 percent in gold which be nearly or quite equal to 9 percent in currency that the bond be then convert into capital for the national bank upon which those institution issue their circulation bear 6 percent interest and that they be exempt from taxation by the government and the states and thereby enhance 2 percent in the hand of the holder we thus have an aggregate of 17 percent which may be receive upon each dollar by the owner of government security a system that produce such result be justly regard as favor a few at the expense of the many and have lead to the further inquiry whether our bondholder in view of the large profit which they have enjoy would themselves be averse to a settlement of our indebtedness upon a plan which would yield they a fair remuneration and at the same time be just to the taxpayer of the nation our national credit should be sacredly observe but in make provision for our creditor we should not forget what be due to the masse of the people it may be assume that the holder of our security have already receive upon their bond a large amount than their original investment measure by a gold standard upon this statement of fact it would seem but just and equitable that the 6 percent interest now pay by the government should be apply to the reduction of the principal in semiannual installment which in sixteen year and eight month would liquidate the entire national debt six percent in gold would at present rate be equal to 9 percent in currency and equivalent to the payment of the debt one and a half time in a fraction less than seventeen year this in connection with all the other advantage derive from their investment would afford to the public creditor a fair and liberal compensation for the use of their capital and with this they should be satisfy the lesson of the past admonish the lender that it be not well to be over anxious in exact from the borrower rigid compliance with the letter of the bond

 if provision be make for the payment of the indebtedness of the government in the manner suggest our nation will rapidly recover its wonte prosperity its interest require that some measure should be take to release the large amount of capital invest in the security of the government it be not now merely unproductive but in taxation annually consume $ 150,000,000 which would otherwise be use by our enterprising people in add to the wealth of the nation our commerce which at one time successfully rival that of the great maritime power have rapidly diminish and our industrial interest be in a depressed and languish condition the development of our inexhaustible resource be check and the fertile field of the south be become waste for want of mean to till they with the release of capital new life would be infuse into the paralyzed energy of our people and activity and vigor impart to every branch of industry our people need encouragement in their effort to recover from the effect of the rebellion and of injudicious legislation and it should be the aim of the government to stimulate they by the prospect of an early release from the burden which impede their prosperity if we can not take the burden from their shoulder we should at least manifest a willingness to help to bear they

 in refer to the condition of the circulate medium i shall merely reiterate substantially that portion of my last annual message which relate to that subject

 the proportion which the currency of any country should bear to the whole value of the annual produce circulate by its means be a question upon which political economist have not agree nor can it be control by legislation but must be leave to the irrevocable law which everywhere regulate commerce and trade the circulate medium will ever irresistibly flow to those point where it be in great demand the law of demand and supply be as unerring as that which regulate the tide of the ocean and indeed currency like the tide have its ebb and flow throughout the commercial world

 at the beginning of the rebellion the bank note circulation of the country amount to not much more than $ 200,000,000 now the circulation of national bank note and those know as legal tender be nearly seven hundred million while it be urge by some that this amount should be increase other contend that a decide reduction be absolutely essential to the good interest of the country in view of these diverse opinion it may be well to ascertain the real value of our paper issue when compare with a metallic or convertible currency for this purpose let we inquire how much gold and silver could be purchase by the seven hundred million of paper money now in circulation probably not more than half the amount of the latter show that when our paper currency be compare with gold and silver its commercial value be compress into three hundred and fifty million this striking fact make it the obvious duty of the government as early as may be consistent with the principle of sound political economy to take such measure as will enable the holder of its note and those of the national bank to convert they without loss into specie or its equivalent a reduction of our paper circulate medium need not necessarily follow this however would depend upon the law of demand and supply though it should be bear in mind that by make legal tender and bank note convertible into coin or its equivalent their present specie value in the hand of their holder would be enhance 100 percent



 legislation for the accomplishment of a result so desirable be demand by the high public consideration the constitution contemplate that the circulate medium of the country shall be uniform in quality and value at the time of the formation of that instrument the country have just emerge from the war of the revolution and be suffer from the effect of a redundant and worthless paper currency the sage of that period be anxious to protect their posterity from the evil which they themselves have experience hence in provide a circulate medium they confer upon congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof at the same time prohibit the states from make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debt

 the anomalous condition of our currency be in strike contrast with that which be originally design our circulation now embrace first note of the national bank which be make receivable for all due to the government exclude impost and by all its creditor except in payment of interest upon its bond and the security themselves second legal tender issue by the united states and which the law require shall be receive as well in payment of all debt between citizen as of all government due except impost and third gold and silver coin by the operation of our present system of finance however the metallic currency when collect be reserve only for one class of government creditor who hold its bond semiannually receive their interest in coin from the national treasury there be no reason which will be accept as satisfactory by the people why those who defend we on the land and protect we on the sea the pensioner upon the gratitude of the nation bear the scar and wound receive while in its service the public servant in the various department of the government the farmer who supply the soldier of the army and the sailor of the navy the artisan who toil in the nation 's workshop or the mechanic and laborer who build its edifice and construct its fort and vessel of war should in payment of their just and hard earn due receive depreciate paper while another class of their countryman no more deserving be pay in coin of gold and silver equal and exact justice require that all the creditor of the government should be pay in a currency possess a uniform value this can only be accomplish by the restoration of the currency to the standard establish by the constitution and by this mean we would remove a discrimination which may if it have not already do so create a prejudice that may become deep rooted and widespread and imperil the national credit

 the feasibility of make our currency correspond with the constitutional standard may be see by reference to a few fact derive from our commercial statistic

 the aggregate product of precious metal in the united states from 1849 to 1867 amount to $ 1,174,000,000 while for the same period the net export of specie be $ 741,000,000 this show an excess of product over net export of $ 433,000,000 there be in the treasury $ 103,407,985 in coin in circulation in the states on the pacific coast about $ 40,000,000 and a few million in the national and other bank in all less than $ 160,000,000 take into consideration the specie in the country prior to 1849 and that produce since 1867 and we have more than $ 300,000,000 not account for by exportation or by return of the treasury and therefore most probably remain in the country

 these be important fact and show how completely the inferior currency will supersede the well force it from circulation among the masse and cause it to be export as a mere article of trade to add to the money capital of foreign land they show the necessity of retire our paper money that the return of gold and silver to the avenue of trade may be invite and a demand create which will cause the retention at home of at least so much of the production of our rich and inexhaustible gold bear field as may be sufficient for purpose of circulation it be unreasonable to expect a return to a sound currency so long as the government and bank by continue to issue irredeemable note fill the channel of circulation with depreciated paper notwithstanding a coinage by our mint since 1849 of $ 874,000,000 the people be now stranger to the currency which be design for their use and benefit and specimen of the precious metal bear the national device be seldom see except when produce to gratify the interest excite by their novelty if depreciated paper be to be continue as the permanent currency of the country and all our coin be to become a mere article of traffic and speculation to the enhancement in price of all that be indispensable to the comfort of the people it would be wise economy to abolish our mint thus save the nation the care and expense incident to such establishment and let our precious metal be export in bullion the time have come however when the government and national bank should be require to take the most efficient step and make all necessary arrangement for a resumption of specie payment let specie payment once be earnestly inaugurate by the government and bank and the value of the paper circulation would directly approximate a specie standard

 specie payment having be resume by the government and bank all note or bill of paper issue by either of a less denomination than $ 20 should by law be exclude from circulation so that the people may have the benefit and convenience of a gold and silver currency which in all their business transaction will be uniform in value at home and abroad

 every man of property or industry every man who desire to preserve what he honestly possess or to obtain what he can honestly earn have a direct interest in maintain a safe circulate medium such a medium as shall be real and substantial not liable to vibrate with opinion not subject to be blow up or blow down by the breath of speculation but to be make stable and secure a disordered currency be one of the great political evil it undermine the virtue necessary for the support of the social system and encourage propensity destructive of its happiness it war against industry frugality and economy and it foster the evil spirit of extravagance and speculation

 it have be assert by one of our profound and most gifted statesman that
 of all the contrivance for cheat the labor class of mankind none have be more effectual than that which delude they with paper money this be the most effectual of invention to fertilize the rich man 's field by the sweat of the poor man 's brow ordinary tyranny oppression excessive taxation these bear lightly on the happiness of the mass of the community compare with a fraudulent currency and the robbery commit by depreciated paper our own history have record for our instruction enough and more than enough of the demoralizing tendency the injustice and the intolerable oppression on the virtuous and well dispose of a degraded paper currency authorize by law or in any way countenance by government

 it be one of the most successful device in time of peace or war of expansion or revulsion to accomplish the transfer of all the precious metal from the great mass of the people into the hand of the few where they be hoard in secret place or deposit under bolt and bar while the people be leave to endure all the inconvenience sacrifice and demoralization result from the use of depreciated and worthless paper

 i be aware that upon the question of far extend our possession it be apprehend by some that our political system can not successfully be apply to an area more extended than our continent but the conviction be rapidly gain ground in the american mind that with the increase facility for intercommunication between all portion of the earth the principle of free government as embrace in our constitution if faithfully maintain and carry out would prove of sufficient strength and breadth to comprehend within their sphere and influence the civilized nation of the world

 first for an election of president and vice president by a direct vote of the people instead of through the agency of elector and make they ineligible for reelection to a second term
 second for a distinct designation of the person who shall discharge the duty of president in the event of a vacancy in that office by the death resignation or removal of both the president and vice president
 third for the election of senator of the united states directly by the people of the several states instead of by the legislature and
 fourth for the limitation to a period of year of the term of federal judge

 profoundly impressed with the propriety of make these important modification in the constitution i respectfully submit they for the early and mature consideration of congress we should as far as possible remove all pretext for violation of the organic law by remedy such imperfection as time and experience may develop ever remember that the constitution which at any time exist until change by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people be sacredly obligatory upon all

 in the performance of a duty impose upon i by the constitution i have thus communicate to congress information of the state of the union and recommend for their consideration such measure as have seem to i necessary and expedient if carry into effect they will hasten the accomplishment of the great and beneficent purpose for which the constitution be ordain and which it comprehensively state be to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity in congress be vest all legislative power and upon they devolve the responsibility as well for frame unwise and excessive law as for neglect to devise and adopt measure absolutely demand by the want of the country let we earnestly hope that before the expiration of our respective term of service now rapidly draw to a close an all wise providence will so guide our counsel as to strengthen and preserve the federal unions inspire reverence for the constitution restore prosperity and happiness to our whole people and promote on earth peace good will toward man

citizen of the united states

 your suffrage having elect i to the office of president of the united states i have in conformity to the constitution of our country take the oath of office prescribe therein i have take this oath without mental reservation and with the determination to do to the good of my ability all that be require of i the responsibility of the position i feel but accept they without fear the office have come to i unsought i commence its duty untrammele i bring to it a conscious desire and determination to fill it to the good of my ability to the satisfaction of the people

 on all lead question agitate the public mind i will always express my view to congress and urge they accord to my judgment and when i think it advisable will exercise the constitutional privilege of interpose a veto to defeat measure which i oppose but all law will be faithfully execute whether they meet my approval or not

 i shall on all subject have a policy to recommend but none to enforce against the will of the people law be to govern all alike those oppose as well as those who favor they i know no method to secure the repeal of bad or obnoxious law so effective as their stringent execution

 the country having just emerge from a great rebellion many question will come before it for settlement in the next four year which precede administration have never have to deal with in meet these it be desirable that they should be approach calmly without prejudice hate or sectional pride remember that the great good to the great number be the object to be attain

 this require security of person property and free religious and political opinion in every part of our common country without regard to local prejudice all law to secure these end will receive my good effort for their enforcement

 a great debt have be contract in securing to we and our posterity the union the payment of this principal and interest as well as the return to a specie basis as soon as it can be accomplish without material detriment to the debtor class or to the country at large must be provide for to protect the national honor every dollar of government indebtedness should be pay in gold unless otherwise expressly stipulate in the contract let it be understand that no repudiator of one farthing of our public debt will be trust in public place and it will go far toward strengthen a credit which ought to be the good in the world and will ultimately enable we to replace the debt with bond bear less interest than we now pay to this should be add a faithful collection of the revenue a strict accountability to the treasury for every dollar collect and the great practicable retrenchment in expenditure in every department of government

 when we compare the pay capacity of the country now with the ten states in poverty from the effect of war but soon to emerge i trust into great prosperity than ever before with its pay capacity twenty five year ago and calculate what it probably will be twenty five year hence who can doubt the feasibility of pay every dollar then with more ease than we now pay for useless luxury why it look as though providence have bestow upon we a strong box in the precious metal lock up in the sterile mountain of the far west and which we be now forge the key to unlock to meet the very contingency that be now upon we

 ultimately it may be necessary to insure the facility to reach these rich and it may be necessary also that the general government should give its aid to secure this access but that should only be when a dollar of obligation to pay secure precisely the same sort of dollar to use now and not before whilst the question of specie payment be in abeyance the prudent business man be careful about contracting debt payable in the distant future the nation should follow the same rule a prostrate commerce be to be rebuild and all industry encourage

 the young man of the country those who from their age must be its ruler twenty five year hence have a peculiar interest in maintain the national honor a moment 's reflection as to what will be our command influence among the nation of the earth in their day if they be only true to themselves should inspire they with national pride all division geographical political and religious can join in this common sentiment how the public debt be to be pay or specie payment resume be not so important as that a plan should be adopt and acquiesce in a united determination to do be worth more than divided counsel upon the method of do legislation upon this subject may not be necessary now or even advisable but it will be when the civil law be more fully restore in all part of the country and trade resume its wonte channel

 it will be my endeavor to execute all law in good faith to collect all revenue assess and to have they properly account for and economically disbursed i will to the good of my ability appoint to office those only who will carry out this design

 in regard to foreign policy i would deal with nation as equitable law require individual to deal with each other and i would protect the law abide citizen whether of native or foreign birth wherever his right be jeopardize or the flag of our country float i would respect the right of all nation demand equal respect for our own if other depart from this rule in their dealing with we we may be compel to follow their precedent

 the proper treatment of the original occupant of this land the indians one deserving of careful study i will favor any course toward they which tend to their civilization and ultimate citizenship

 the question of suffrage be one which be likely to agitate the public so long as a portion of the citizen of the nation be exclude from its privilege in any state it seem to i very desirable that this question should be settle now and i entertain the hope and express the desire that it may be by the ratification of the fifteenth article of amendment to the constitution

 in conclusion i ask patient forbearance one toward another throughout the land and a determined effort on the part of every citizen to do his share toward cement a happy union and i ask the prayer of the nation to almighty god in behalf of this consummation

to the senate and house of representatives
 while i be aware that the time in which congress propose now to remain in session be very brief and that it be its desire as far as be consistent with the public interest to avoid enter upon the general business of legislation there be one subject which concern so deeply the welfare of the country that i deem it my duty to bring it before you
 i have no doubt that you will concur with i in the opinion that it be desirable to restore the states which be engage in the rebellion to their proper relation to the government and the country at as early a period as the people of those states shall be find willing to become peaceful and orderly community and to adopt and maintain such constitution and law as will effectually secure the civil and political right of all person within their border the authority of the united states which have be vindicate and establish by its military power must undoubtedly be assert for the absolute protection of all its citizen in the full enjoyment of the freedom and security which be the object of a republican government but whenever the people of a rebellious state be ready to enter in good faith upon the accomplishment of this object in entire conformity with the constitutional authority of congress it be certainly desirable that all cause of irritation should be remove as promptly as possible that a more perfect union may be establish and the country be restore to peace and prosperity
 the convention of the people of virginia which meet in richmond on tuesday december 3 1867 frame a constitution for that state which be adopt by the convention on the 17th of april 1868 and i desire respectfully to call the attention of congress to the propriety of provide by law for the holding of an election in that state at some time during the month of may and june next under the direction of the military commander of that district at which the question of the adoption of that constitution shall be submit to the citizen of the state and if this should seem desirable i would recommend that a separate vote be take upon such part as may be think expedient and that at the same time and under the same authority there shall be an election for the officer provide under such constitution and that the constitution or such part thereof as shall have be adopt by the people be submit to congress on the first monday of december next for its consideration so that if the same be then approve the necessary step will have be take for the restoration of the state of virginia to its proper relation to the union i be lead to make this recommendation from the confident hope and belief that the people of that state be now ready to cooperate with the national government in bring it again into such relation to the union as it ought as soon as possible to establish and maintain and to give to all its people those equal right under the law which be assert in the declaration of independence in the word of one of the most illustrious of its son
 i desire also to ask the consideration of congress to the question whether there be not just ground for believe that the constitution frame by a convention of the people of mississippi for that state and once reject might not be again submit to the people of that state in like manner and with the probability of the same result

enlightened constituency nor by our own conscience emerge from a rebellion of gigantic magnitude aid as it be by the sympathy and assistance of nation with which we be at peace eleven states of the union be four year ago leave without legal state government a national debt have be contract american commerce be almost drive from the sea the industry of one half of the country have be take from the control of the capitalist and place where all labor rightfully belong in the keeping of the laborer the work of restore state government loyal to the union of protect and foster free labor and provide mean for pay the interest on the public debt have receive ample attention from congress although your effort have not meet with the success in all particular that might have be desire yet on the whole they have be more successful than could have be reasonably anticipate seven state which pass ordinance of secession have be fully restore to their place in the union the eighth georgia hold an election at which she ratify her constitution republican in form elect a governor members of congress a state legislature and all other officer require the governor be duly instal and the legislature meet and perform all the act then require of they by the reconstruction act of congress subsequently however in violation of the constitution which they have just ratify as since decide by the supreme court of the state they unseat the colored member of the legislature and admit to seat some member who be disqualify by the third clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution an article which they themselves have contribute to ratify under these circumstance i would submit to you whether it would not be wise without delay to enact a law authorize the governor of georgia to convene the member originally elect to the legislature require each member to take the oath prescribe by the reconstruction act and none to be admit who be ineligible under the third clause of the fourteenth amendment the freedman under the protection which they have receive be make rapid progress in learning and no complaint be hear of lack of industry on their part where they receive fair remuneration for their labor the mean provide for pay the interest on the public debt with all other expense of government be more than ample the loss of our commerce be the only result of the late rebellion which have not receive sufficient attention from you to this subject i call your earnest attention i will not now suggest plan by which this object may be effect but will if necessary make it the subject of a special message during the session of congress at the march term congress by joint resolution authorize the executive to order election in the states of virginia mississippi and texas to submit to they the constitution which each have previously in convention frame and submit the constitution either entire or in separate part to be vote upon at the discretion of the executive under this authority election be call in virginia the election take place on the 6th of july 1869 the governor and lieutenant governor elect have be instal the legislature meet and do all require by this resolution and by all the reconstruction act of congress and abstain from all doubtful authority i recommend that her senators and representatives be promptly admit to their seat and that the state be fully restore to its place in the family of states election be call in mississippi and texas to commence on the 30th of november 1869 and to last two day in mississippi and four day in texas the election have take place but the result be not know it be to be hope that the act of the legislature of these states when they meet will be such as to receive your approval and thus close the work of reconstruction among the evil grow out of the rebellion and not yet refer to be that of an irredeemable currency it be an evil which i hope will receive your most earnest attention it be a duty and one of the high duty of government to secure to the citizen a medium of exchange of fix unvarying value this imply a return to a specie basis and no substitute for it can be devise it should be commence now and reach at the early practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interest of the debtor class immediate resumption if practicable would not be desirable it would compel the debtor class to pay beyond their contract the premium on gold at the date of their purchase and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thousand fluctuation however in the paper value of the measure of all value gold be detrimental to the interest of trade it make the man of business an involuntary gambler for in all sale where future payment be to be make both party speculate as to what will be the value of the currency to be pay and receive i earnestly recommend to you then such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payment and put an immediate stop to fluctuation in the value of currency the method to secure the former of these result be as numerous as be the speculator on political economy to secure the latter i see but one way and that be to authorize the treasury to redeem its own paper at a fix price whenever present and to withhold from circulation all currency so redeem until sell again for gold the vast resource of the nation both develop and undeveloped ought to make our credit the good on earth with a less burden of taxation than the citizen have endure for six year past the entire public debt could be pay in ten year but it be not desirable that the people should be tax to pay it in that time year by year the ability to pay increase in a rapid ratio but the burden of interest ought to be reduce as rapidly as can be do without the violation of contract the public debt be represent in great part by bond have from five to twenty and from ten to forty year to run bear interest at the rate of 6 per cent and 5 per cent respectively it be optional with the government to pay these bond at any period after the expiration of the least time mention upon their face the time have already expire when a great part of they may be take up and be rapidly approach when all may be it be believe that all which be now due may be replace by bond bear a rate of interest not exceed 4 1/2 per cent and as rapidly as the remainder become due that they may be replace in the same way to accomplish this it may be necessary to authorize the interest to be pay at either of three or four of the money center of europe or by any assistant treasurer of the united states at the option of the holder of the bond i suggest this subject for the consideration of congress and also simultaneously with this the propriety of redeem our currency as before suggest at its market value at the time the law go into effect increase the rate at which currency shall be buy and sell from day to day or week to week at the same rate of interest as government pay upon its bond the subject of tariff and internal taxation will necessarily receive your attention the revenue of the country be great than the requirement and may with safety be reduce but as the funding of the debt in a 4 or a 4 1/2 per cent loan would reduce annual current expense largely thus after funding justify a great reduction of taxation than would be now expedient i suggest postponement of this question until the next meeting of congress it may be advisable to modify taxation and tariff in instance where unjust or burdensome discrimination be make by the present law but a general revision of the law regulate this subject i recommend the postponement of for the present i also suggest the renewal of the tax on income but at a reduce rate say of 3 per cent and this tax to expire in three year with the funding of the national debt as here suggest i feel safe in say that taxis and the revenue from import may be reduce safely from sixty to eighty million per annum at once and may be still far reduce from year to year as the resource of the country be develop the report of the secretary of the treasury show the receipt of the government for the fiscal year end june 30 1869 to be $ 370,943,747 and the expenditure include interest bounty etc to be $ 321,490,597 the estimate for the ensue year be more favorable to the government and will no doubt show a much large decrease of the public debt the receipt in the treasury beyond expenditure have exceed the amount necessary to place to the credit of the sink fund as provide by law to lock up the surplus in the treasury and withhold it from circulation would lead to such a contraction of the currency as to cripple trade and seriously affect the prosperity of the country under these circumstance the secretary of the treasury and myself heartily concur in the propriety of use all the surplus currency in the treasury in the purchase of government bond thus reduce the interest bear indebtedness of the country and of submit to congress the question of the disposition to be make of the bond so purchase the bond now hold by the treasury amount to about seventy five million include those belong to the sink fund i recommend that the whole be place to the credit of the sink fund your attention be respectfully invite to the recommendation of the secretary of the treasury for the creation of the office of commissioner of custom revenue for the increase of salary to certain class of official the substitution of increase national bank circulation to replace the outstanding 3 per cent certificate and most especially to his recommendation for the repeal of law allow share of fine penalty forfeiture etc to officer of the government or to informer the office of commissioner of internal revenue be one of the most arduous and responsible under the government it fall but little if any short of a cabinet position in its importance and responsibility i would ask for it therefore such legislation as in your judgment will place the office upon a footing of dignity commensurate with its importance and with the character and qualification of the class of man require to fill it properly as the united states be the free of all nation so too its people sympathize with all people struggle for liberty and self government but while so sympathize it be due to our honor that we should abstain from enforce our view upon unwilling nation and from take an interested part without invitation in the quarrel between different nation or between government and their subject our course should always be in conformity with strict justice and law international and local such have be the policy of the administration in deal with these question for more than a year a valuable province of spain and a near neighbor of ours in whom all our people can not but feel a deep interest have be struggle for independence and freedom the people and government of the united states entertain the same warm feeling and sympathy for the people of cuba in their pending struggle that they manifest throughout the previous struggle between spain and her former colony in behalf of the latter but the contest have at no time assume the condition which amount to a war in the sense of international law or which would show the existence of a de facto political organization of the insurgent sufficient to justify a recognition of belligerency the principle be maintain however that this nation be its own judge when to accord the right of belligerency either to a people struggle to free themselves from a government they believe to be oppressive or to independent nation at war with each other the united states have no disposition to interfere with the exist relation of spain to her colonial possession on this continent they believe that in due time spain and other european power will find their interest in terminate those relation and establish their present dependency as independent power member of the family of nation these dependency be no long regard as subject to transfer from one european power to another when the present relation of colony cease they be to become independent power exercise the right of choice and of self control in the determination of their future condition and relation with other power the united states in order to put a stop to bloodshed in cuba and in the interest of a neighbor people propose their good office to bring the exist contest to a termination the offer not be accept by spain on a basis which we believe could be receive by cuba be withdraw it be hope that the good office of the united states may yet prove advantageous for the settlement of this unhappy strife meanwhile a number of illegal expedition against cuba have be break up it have be the endeavor of the administration to execute the neutrality law in good faith no matter how unpleasant the task make so by the suffering we have endure from lack of like good faith toward we by other nation on the 26th of march last the united states schooner lizzie major be arrest on the high sea by a spanish frigate and two passenger take from it and carry as prisoner to cuba representation of these fact be make to the spanish government as soon as official information of they reach washington the two passenger be set at liberty and the spanish government assure the united states that the captain of the frigate in make the capture have act without law that he have be reprimand for the irregularity of his conduct and that the spanish authority in cuba would not sanction any act that could violate the right or treat with disrespect the sovereignty of this nation the question of the seizure of the brig mary lowell at one of the bahama islands by spanish authority be now the subject of correspondence between this government and those of spain and great britain the captain general of cuba about may last issue a proclamation authorize search to be make of vessel on the high sea immediate remonstrance be make against this whereupon the captain general issue a new proclamation limit the right of search to vessel of the united states so far as authorize under the treaty of 1795 this proclamation however be immediately withdraw i have always feel that the most intimate relation should be cultivate between the republic of the united states and all independent nation on this continent it may be well worth consider whether new treaty between we and they may not be profitably enter into to secure more intimate relation friendly commercial and otherwise the subject of an interoceanic canal to connect the atlantic and pacific ocean through the isthmus of darien be one in which commerce be greatly interested instruction have be give to our minister to the republic of the united states of colombia to endeavor to obtain authority for a survey by this government in order to determine the practicability of such an undertaking and a charter for the right of way to build by private enterprise such a work if the survey prove it to be practicable in order to comply with the agreement of the united states as to a mixed commission at lima for the adjustment of claim it become necessary to send a commissioner and secretary to lima in august last no appropriation having be make by congress for this purpose it be now ask that one be make cover the past and future

congress have be invite to be hold in washington during the present winter a grant have be give to europeans of an exclusive right of transit over the territory of nicaragua to which costa rico have give its assent which it be allege conflict with vested right of citizen of the united states the department of state have now this subject under consideration the minister of peru having make representation that there be a state of war between peru and spain and that spain be construct in and near new york thirty gunboat which might be use by spain in such a way as to relieve the naval force at cuba so as to operate against peru order be give to prevent their departure no further step having be take by the representative of the peruvian government to prevent the departure of these vessel and i not feel authorized to detain the property of a nation with which we be at peace on a mere executive order the matter have be refer to the court to decide the conduct of the war between the ally and the republic of paraguay have make the intercourse with that country so difficult that it have be deem advisable to withdraw our representative from there toward the close of the last administration a convention be sign at london for the settlement of all outstanding claim between great britain and the united states which fail to receive the advice and consent of the senate to its ratification the time and the circumstance attend the negotiation of that treaty be unfavorable to its acceptance by the people of the united states and its provision be wholly inadequate for the settlement of the grave wrong that bad be sustain by this government as well as by its citizen the injury result to the united states by reason of the course adopt by great britain during our late civil war in the increase rate of insurance in the diminution of export and import and other obstruction to domestic industry and production in its effect upon the foreign commerce of the country in the decrease and transfer to great britain of our commercial marine in the prolongation of the war and the increase cost both in treasure and in life of its suppression could not be adjust and satisfied as ordinary commercial claim which continually arise between commercial nation and yet the convention treat they simply as such ordinary claim from which they differ more widely in the gravity of their character than in the magnitude of their amount great even as be that difference not a word be find in the treaty and not an inference could be draw from it to remove the sense of the unfriendliness of the course of great britain in our struggle for existence which have so deeply and universally impress itself upon the people of this country believe that a convention thus misconceive in its scope and inadequate in its provision would not have produce the hearty cordial settlement of pende question which alone be consistent with the relation which i desire to have firmly establish between the united states and great britain i regard the action of the senate in reject the treaty to have be wisely take in the interest of peace and as a necessary step in the direction of a perfect and cordial friendship between the two country a sensitive people conscious of their power be more at ease under a great wrong wholly unatoned than under the restraint of a settlement which satisfy neither their idea of justice nor their grave sense of the grievance they have sustain the rejection of the treaty be follow by a state of public feeling on both side which i think not favorable to an immediate attempt at renew negotiation i accordingly so instruct the minister of the united states to great britain and find that my view in this regard be share by her majesty 's minister i hope that the time may soon arrive when the two government can approach the solution of this momentous question with an appreciation of what be due to the right dignity and honor of each and with the determination not only to remove the cause of complaint in the past but to lay the foundation of a broad principle of public law which will prevent future difference and tend to firm and continue peace and friendship this be now the only grave question which the united states have with any foreign nation the question of renew a treaty for reciprocal trade between the united states and the british provinces on this continent have not be favorably consider by the administration the advantage of such a treaty would be wholly in favor of the british producer except possibly a few engage in the trade between the two section no citizen of the united states would be benefit by reciprocity our internal taxation would prove a protection to the british producer almost equal to the protection which our manufacturer now receive from the tariff some arrangement however for the regulation of commercial intercourse between the united states and the dominion of canada may be desirable the commission for adjust the claim of the hudsons bay and puget sound agricultural company upon the united states have terminate its labor the award of $ 650,000 have be make and all right and title of the company on the territory of the united states have be extinguish deed for the property of the company have be deliver an appropriation by congress to meet this sum be ask the commissioner for determine the northwestern land boundary between the united states and the british possession under the treaty of 1856 have complete their labor and the commission have be dissolve in conformity with the recommendation of congress a proposition be early make to the british government to abolish the mixed court create under the treaty of april 7 1862 for the suppression of the slave trade the subject be still under negotiation it having come to my knowledge that a corporate company organize under british law propose to land upon the shore of the united states and to operate there a submarine cable under a concession from his majesty the emperor of the french of an exclusive right for twenty year of telegraphic communication between the shore of france and the united states with the very objectionable feature of subject all message convey thereby to the scrutiny and control of the french government i cause the french and british legation at washington to be make acquainted with the probable policy of congress on this subject as foreshadow by the bill which pass the senate in march last this draw from the representative of the company an agreement to accept as the basis of their operation the provision of that bill or of such other enactment on the subject as might be pass during the approach session of congress also to use their influence to secure from the french government a modification of their concession so as to permit the landing upon french soil of any cable belong to any company incorporate by the authority of the united states or of any state in the union and on their part not to oppose the establishment of any such cable in consideration of this agreement i direct the withdrawal of all opposition by the united states authority to the landing of the cable and to the working of it until the meeting of congress i regret to say that there have be no modification make in the company 's concession nor so far as i can learn have they attempt to secure one their concession exclude the capital and the citizen of the united states from competition upon the shore of france i recommend legislation to protect the right of citizen of the united states as well as the dignity and sovereignty of the nation against such an assumption i shall also endeavor to secure by negotiation an abandonment of the principle of monopoly in ocean telegraphic cable copy of this correspondence be herewith furnish the unsettled political condition of other country less fortunate than our own sometimes induce their citizen to come to the united states for the sole purpose of becoming naturalize having secure this they return to their native country and reside there without disclose their change of allegiance they accept official position of trust or honor which can only be hold by citizen of their native land they journey under passport describe they as such citizen and it be only when civil discord after perhaps year of quiet threaten their person or their property or when their native state draft they into its military service that the fact of their change of allegiance be make known they reside permanently away from the united states they contribute nothing to its revenue they avoid the duty of its citizenship and they only make themselves know by a claim of protection i have direct the diplomatic and consular officer of the united states to scrutinize carefully all such claim for protection the citizen of the united states whether native or adopt who discharge his duty to his country be entitle to its complete protection while i have a voice in the direction of affair i shall not consent to imperil this sacred right by confer it upon fictitious or fraudulent claimant on the accession of the present administration it be find that the minister for north germany have make proposition for the negotiation of a convention for the protection of emigrant passenger to which no response have be give it be conclude that to be effectual all the maritime power engage in the trade should join in such a measure invitation have be extend to the cabinet of london paris florence berlin brussels the hague copenhagen and stockholm to empower their representative at washington to simultaneously enter into negotiation and to conclude with the united states convention identical in form make uniform regulation as to the construction of the part of vessel to be devoted to the use of emigrant passenger as to the quality and quantity of food as to the medical treatment of the sick and as to the rule to be observe during the voyage in order to secure ventilation to promote health to prevent intrusion and to protect the female and provide for the establishment of tribunal in the several country for enforce such regulation by summary process your attention be respectfully call to the law regulate the tariff on russian hemp and to the question whether to fix the charge on russian hemp higher than they be fix upon manila be not a violation of our treaty with russia place her product upon the same footing with those of the most favored nation our manufacture be increase with wonderful rapidity under the encouragement which they now receive with the improvement in machinery already effect and still increase cause machinery to take the place of skilled labor to a large extent our import of many article must fall off largely within a very few year fortunately too manufacture be not confine to a few locality as formerly and it be to be hope will become more and more diffused make the interest in they equal in all section they give employment and support to hundred of thousand of people at home and retain with we the mean which otherwise would be ship abroad the extension of railroad in europe and the east be bring into competition with our agricultural product like product of other country self interest if not self preservation therefore dictate caution against disturb any industrial interest of the country it teach we also the necessity of look to other market for the sale of our surplus our neighbor south of we and china and japan should receive our special attention it will be the endeavor of the administration to cultivate such relation with all these nation as to entitle we to their confidence and make it their interest as well as ours to establish well commercial relation through the agency of a more enlightened policy than that heretofore pursue toward china largely due to the sagacity and effort of one of our own distinguished citizen the world be about to commence largely increase relation with that populous and hitherto exclusive nation as the united states have be the initiator in this new policy so they should be the most earnest in show their good faith in make it a success in this connection i advise such legislation as will forever preclude the enslavement of the chinese upon our soil under the name of coolie and also prevent american vessel from engage in the transportation of coolie to any country tolerate the system i also recommend that the mission to china be raise to one of the first class on my assume the responsible duty of chief magistrate of the united states it be with the conviction that three thing be essential to its peace prosperity and full development first among these be strict integrity in fulfil all our obligation second to secure protection to the person and property of the citizen of the united states in each and every portion of our common country wherever he may choose to move without reference to original nationality religion color or politic demand of he only obedience to the law and proper respect for the right of other third union of all the states with equal right indestructible by any constitutional mean to secure the first of these congress have take two essential step first in declare by joint resolution that the public debt shall be pay principal and interest in coin and second by provide the mean for pay provide the mean however could not secure the object desire without a proper administration of the law for the collection of the revenue and an economical disbursement of they to this subject the administration have most earnestly address itself with result i hope satisfactory to the country there have be no hesitation in change official in order to secure an efficient execution of the law sometimes too when in a mere party view undesirable political result be likely to follow nor any hesitation in sustain efficient official against remonstrance wholly political it may be well to mention here the embarrassment possible to arise from leave on the statute book the so call tenure of office act and to earnestly recommend their total repeal it could not have be the intention of the framer of the constitution when provide that appointment make by the president should receive the consent of the senate that the latter should have the power to retain in office person place there by federal appointment against the will of the president the law be inconsistent with a faithful and efficient administration of the government what faith can an executive put in official force upon he and those too whom he have suspend for reason how will such official be likely to serve an administration which they know do not trust them?for the second requisite to our growth and prosperity time and a firm but humane administration of exist law amend from time to time as they may prove ineffective or prove harsh and unnecessary be probably all that be require the third can not be attain by special legislation but must be regard as fix by the constitution itself and gradually acquiesce in by force of public opinion from the foundation of the government to the present the management of the original inhabitant of this continent the indians have be a subject of embarrassment and expense and have be attend with continuous robbery murder and war from my own experience upon the frontier and in indian country i do not hold either legislation or the conduct of the white who come most in contact with the indian blameless for these hostility the past however can not be undo and the question must be meet as we now find it i have attempt a new policy toward these ward of the nation they can not be regard in any other light than as ward with fair result so far as try and which i hope will be attend ultimately with great success the society of friends be well know as having succeed in live in peace with the indians in the early settlement of pennsylvania while their white neighbor of other sect in other section be constantly embroil they be also know for their opposition to all strife violence and war and be generally note for their strict integrity and fair dealing these consideration induce i to give the management of a few reservation of indians to they and to throw the burden of the selection of agent upon the society itself the result have prove most satisfactory it will be find more fully set forth in the report of the commissioner of indian affairs for superintendent and indian agent not on the reservation officer of the army be select the reason for this be numerous where indian agent be send there or near there troop must be send also the agent and the commander of troop be independent of each other and be subject to order from different departments of the government the army officer hold a position for life the agent one at the will of the president the former be personally interested in live in harmony with the indian and in establish a permanent peace to the end that some portion of his life may be spend within the limit of civilized society the latter have no such personal interest another reason be an economic one and still another the hold which the government have upon a life officer to secure a faithful discharge of duty in carry out a give policy the building of railroad and the access thereby give to all the agricultural and mineral region of the country be rapidly bring civilized settlement into contact with all the tribe of indians no matter what ought to be the relation between such settlement and the aborigine the fact be they do not harmonize well and one or the other have to give way in the end a system which look to the extinction of a race be too horrible for a nation to adopt without entail upon itself the wrath of all christendom and engendering in the citizen a disregard for human life and the right of other dangerous to society i see no substitute for such a system except in place all the indians on large reservation as rapidly as it can be do and give they absolute protection there as soon as they be fit for it they should be induce to take their land in severalty and to set up territorial government for their own protection for full detail on this subject i call your special attention to the report of the secretary of the interior and the commissioner of indian affairs the report of the secretary of war show the expenditure of the war department for the year end june 30 1869 to be $ 80,644,042 of which $ 23,882,310 be disburse in the payment of debt contract during the war and be not chargeable to current army expense his estimate of $ 34,531,031 for the expense of the army for the next fiscal year be as low as it be believe can be rely on the estimate of bureau officer have be carefully scrutinize and reduce wherever it have be deem practicable if however the condition of the country should be such by the beginning of the next fiscal year as to admit of a great concentration of troop the appropriation ask for will not be expend the appropriation estimate for river and harbor improvement and for fortification be submit separately whatever amount congress may deem proper to appropriate for these purpose will be expend the recommendation of the general of the army that appropriation be make for the fort at boston portland new york philadelphia new orleans and san francisco if for no other be concur in i also ask your special attention to the recommendation of the general command the military

virginia mississippi and texas and the report of the general of the army in full the recommendation therein contain have be well consider and be submit for your action i however call special attention to the recommendation of the chief of ordnance for the sale of arsenal and land no long of use to the government also to the recommendation of the secretary of war that the act of 3d march 1869 prohibit promotion and appointment in the staff corps of the army be repeal the extent of country to be garrison and the number of military post to be occupy be the same with a reduce army as with a large one the number of staff officer require be more dependent upon the latter than the former condition the report of the secretary of the navy accompany this show the condition of the navy when this administration come into office and the change make since strenuous effort have be make to place as many vessel in commission or render they fit for service if require as possible and to substitute the sail for steam while cruise thus materially reduce the expense of the navy and add greatly to its efficiency look to our future i recommend a liberal though not extravagant policy toward this branch of the public service the report of the postmaster general furnish a clear and comprehensive exhibit of the operation of the postal service and of the financial condition of the post office department the ordinary postal revenue for the year end the 30th of june 1869 amount to $ 18,344,510 and the expenditure to $ 23,698,131 show an excess of expenditure over receipt of $ 5,353,620 the excess of expenditure over receipt for the previous year amount to $ 6,437,992 the increase of revenue for 1869 over those of 1868 be $ 2,051,909 and the increase of expenditure be $ 967,538 the increase revenue in 1869 exceed the increase revenue in 1868 by $ 996,336 and the increase expenditure in 1869 be $ 2,527,570 less than the increase expenditure in 1868 show by comparison this gratifying feature of improvement that while the increase of expenditure over the increase of receipt in 1868 be $ 2,439,535 the increase of receipt over the increase of expenditure in 1869 be $ 1,084,371.your attention be respectfully call to the recommendation make by the postmaster general for authority to change the rate of compensation to the main trunk railroad line for their service in carry the mail for have post route map execute for reorganize and increase the efficiency of the special agency service for increase of the mail service on the pacific and for establish mail service under the flag of the union on the atlantic and most especially do i call your attention to his recommendation for the total abolition of the franking privilege this be an abuse from which no one receive a commensurate advantage it reduce the receipt for postal service from 25 to 30 per cent and largely increase the service to be perform the method by which postage should be pay upon public matter be set forth fully in the report of the postmaster general the report of the secretary of the interior show that the quantity of public land dispose of during the year end the 30th of june 1869 be 7,666,152 acre exceed that of the precede year by 1,010,409 acre of this amount 2,899,544 acre be sell for cash and 2,737,365 acre enter under the homestead law the remainder be grant to aid in the

be $ 28,422,884 an increase of $ 4,411,902 on that of the previous year the munificence of congress have be conspicuously manifest in its legislation for the soldier and sailor who suffer in the recent struggle to maintain that unity of government which make we one people the addition to the pension roll of each successive year since the conclusion of hostility result in a great degree from the repeat amendment of the act of the 14th of july 1862 which extend its provision to case not fall within its original scope the large outlay which be thus occasion be far increase by the more liberal allowance bestow since that date upon those who in the line of duty be wholly or permanently disabled public opinion have give an emphatic sanction to these measure of congress and it will be concede that no part of our public burden be more cheerfully bear than that which be impose by this branch of the service it necessitate for the next fiscal year in addition to the amount justly chargeable to the naval pension fund an appropriation of $ 30,000,000.during the year end the 30th of september 1869 the patent office issue 13,762 patent and its receipt be $ 686,389 be $ 213,926 more than the expenditure i would respectfully call your attention to the recommendation of the secretary of the interior for unite the duty of supervise the education of freedman with the other duty devolve upon the commissioner of education if it be the desire of congress to make the census which must be take during the year 1870 more complete and perfect than heretofore i would suggest early action upon any plan that may be agree upon as congress at the last session appoint a committee to take into consideration such measure as might be deem proper in reference to the census and report a plan i desist from say more i recommend to your favorable consideration the claim of the agricultural bureau for liberal appropriation in a country so diversified in climate and soil as ours and with a population so largely dependent upon agriculture the benefit that can be confer by properly foster this bureau be incalculable i desire respectfully to call the attention of congress to the inadequate salary of a number of the most important office of the government in this message i will not enumerate they but will specify only the justice of the supreme court no change have be make in their salary for fifteen year within that time the labor of the court have largely increase and the expense of living have at least double during the same time congress have twice find it necessary to increase largely the compensation of its own member and the duty which it owe to another department of the government deserve and will undoubtedly receive its due consideration there be many subject not allude to in this message which might with propriety be introduce but i abstain believe that your patriotism and statesmanship will suggest the topic and the legislation most conducive to the interest of the whole people on my part i promise a rigid adherence to the law and their strict enforcement
to the senate and house of representatives
 it be unusual to notify the two houses of congress by message of the promulgation by proclamation of the secretary of state of the ratification of a constitutional amendment in view however of the vast importance of the fifteenth amendment to the constitution this day declare a part of that revere instrument i deem a departure from the usual custom justifiable a measure which make at once 4,000,000 people voter who be heretofore declare by the high tribunal in the land not citizen of the united states nor eligible to become so with the assertion that at the time of the declaration of independence the opinion be fix and universal in the civilized portion of the white race regard as an axiom in moral as well as in politic that black man have no right which the white man be bind to respect be indeed a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day
 institution like ours in which all power be derive directly from the people must depend mainly upon their intelligence patriotism and industry i call the attention therefore of the newly enfranchised race to the importance of their strive in every honorable manner to make themselves worthy of their new privilege to the race more favor heretofore by our law i would say withhold no legal privilege of advancement to the new citizen the framer of our constitution firmly believe that a republican government could not endure without intelligence and education generally diffuse among the people the father of his country in his farewell address use this language
 promote then as an object of primary importance institution for the general diffusion of knowledge in proportion as the structure of a government give force to public opinion it be essential that public opinion should be enlighten
 in his first annual message to congress the same view be forcibly present and be again urge in his eighth message
 i repeat that the adoption of the fifteenth amendment to the constitution complete the great civil change and constitute the most important event that have occur since the nation come into life the change will be beneficial in proportion to the heed that be give to the urgent recommendation of washington if these recommendation be important then with a population of but a few million how much more important now with a population of 40,000,000 and increase in a rapid ratio i would therefore call upon congress to take all the mean within their constitutional power to promote and encourage popular education throughout the country and upon the people everywhere to see to it that all who possess and exercise political right shall have the opportunity to acquire the knowledge which will make their share in the government a blessing and not a danger by such mean only can the benefit contemplate by this amendment to the constitution be secure

to the senate of the united states
 i transmit to the senate for consideration with a view to its ratification an additional article to the treaty of the 29th of november last for the annexation of the dominican republic to the united states stipulate for an extension of the time for exchange the ratification thereof sign in this city on the 14th instant by the plenipotentiary of the party
 it be my intention to have also negotiate with the plenipotentiary of san domingo amendment to the treaty of annexation to obviate objection which may be urge against the treaty as it be now word but on reflection i deem it well to submit to the senate the propriety of their amend the treaty as follow first to specify that the obligation of this government shall not exceed the $ 1,500,000 stipulate in the treaty secondly to determine the manner of appoint the agent to receive and disburse the same thirdly to determine the class of creditor who shall take precedence in the settlement of their claim and finally to insert such amendment as may suggest themselves to the mind of senator to carry out in good faith the condition of the treaty submit to the senate of the united states in january last accord to the spirit and intent of that treaty from the most reliable information i can obtain the sum specify in the treaty will pay every just claim against the republic of san domingo and leave a balance sufficient to carry on a territorial government until such time as new law for provide a territorial revenue can be enact and put in force
 i feel an unusual anxiety for the ratification of this treaty because i believe it will redound greatly to the glory of the two country interest to civilization and to the extirpation of the institution of slavery
 the doctrine promulgate by president monroe have be adhere to by all political party and i now deem it proper to assert the equally important principle that hereaft no territory on this continent shall be regard as subject of transfer to a european power
 the government of san domingo have voluntarily seek this annexation it be a weak power number probably less than 120,000 soul and yet possess one of the rich territory under the sun capable of support a population of 10,000,000 people in luxury the people of san domingo be not capable of maintain themselves in their present condition and must look for outside support
 they yearn for the protection of our free institution and law our progress and civilization shall we refuse they
 i have information which i believe reliable that a european power stand ready now to offer $ 2,000,000 for the possession of samana bay alone if refuse by we with what grace can we prevent a foreign power from attempt to secure the prize
 the acquisition of san domingo be desirable because of its geographical position it command the entrance to the caribbean sea and the isthmus transit of commerce it possess the rich soil good and most capacious harbor most salubrious climate and the most valuable product of the forest mine and soil of any of the west india islands its possession by we will in a few year build up a coastwise commerce of immense magnitude which will go far toward restore to we our lose merchant marine it will give to we those article which we consume so largely and do not produce thus equalize our export and import
 in case of foreign war it will give we command of all the island refer to and thus prevent an enemy from ever again possess himself of rendezvous upon our very coast
 at present our coast trade between the states border on the atlantic and those border on the gulf of mexico be cut into by the bahamas and the antilles twice we must as it be pass through foreign country to get by sea from georgia to the west coast of florida
 san domingo with a stable government under which her immense resource can be develop will give remunerative wage to ten of thousand of laborer not now on the island
 this labor will take advantage of every available mean of transportation to abandon the adjacent island and seek the blessing of freedom and its sequence each inhabitant receive the reward of his own labor porto rico and cuba will have to abolish slavery as a measure of self preservation to retain their laborer
 san domingo will become a large consumer of the product of northern farm and manufactory the cheap rate at which her citizen can be furnish with food tool and machinery will make it necessary that the contiguous island should have the same advantage in order to compete in the production of sugar coffee tobacco tropical fruit etc this will open to we a still wide market for our product
 the production of our own supply of these article will cut off more than one hundred million of our annual import besides largely increase our export with such a picture it be easy to see how our large debt abroad be ultimately to be extinguish with a balance of trade against we include interest on bond hold by foreigner and money spend by our citizen travel in foreign land equal to the entire yield of the precious metal in this country it be not so easy to see how this result be to be otherwise accomplish
 the acquisition of san domingo be an adherence to the monroe doctrine it be a measure of national protection it be assert our just claim to a control influence over the great commercial traffic soon to flow from east to west by the way of the isthmus of darien it be to build up our merchant marine it be to furnish new market for the product of our farm shop and manufactory it be to make slavery insupportable in cuba and porto rico at once and ultimately so in brazil it be to settle the unhappy condition of cuba and end an exterminate conflict it be to provide honest mean of pay our honest debt without overtax the people it be to furnish our citizen with the necessary of everyday life at cheap rate than ever before and it be in fine a rapid stride toward that greatness which the intelligence industry and enterprise of the citizen of the united states entitle this country to assume among nation

to the senate and house of representatives
 in my annual message to congress at the beginning of its present session i refer to the contest which have then for more than a year exist in the island of cuba between a portion of its inhabitant and the government of spain and the feeling and sympathy of the people and government of the united states for the people of cuba as for all people struggle for liberty and self government and say that the contest have at no time assume the condition which amount to war in the sense of international law or which would show the existence of a de facto political organization of the insurgent sufficient to justify a recognition of belligerency
 during the six month which have pass since the date of that message the condition of the insurgent have not improve and the insurrection itself although not subdue exhibit no sign of advance but seem to be confine to an irregular system of hostility carry on by small and illy armed band of man roam without concentration through the wood and the sparsely populated region of the island attack from ambush convoy and small band of troop burn plantation and the estate of those not sympathize with their cause
 but if the insurrection have not gain ground it be equally true that spain have not suppress it climate disease and the occasional bullet have work destruction among the soldier of spain and although the spanish authority have possession of every seaport and every town on the island they have not be able to subdue the hostile feeling which have drive a considerable number of the native inhabitant of the island to armed resistance against spain and still lead they to endure the danger and the privation of a roam life of guerrilla warfare
 on either side the contest have be conduct and be still carry on with a lamentable disregard of human life and of the rule and practice which modern civilization have prescribe in mitigation of the necessary horror of war the torch of spaniard and of cuban be alike busy in carry devastation over fertile region murderous and revengeful decree be issue and execute by both party count valmaseda and colonel boet on the part of spain have each startled humanity and arouse the indignation of the civilized world by the execution each of a score of prisoner at a time while general quesada the cuban chief coolly and with apparent unconsciousness of aught else than a proper act have admit the slaughter by his own deliberate order in one day of upward of 650 prisoner of war
 a summary trial with few if any escape from conviction follow by immediate execution be the fate of those arrest on either side on suspicion of infidelity to the cause of the party make the arrest
 whatever may be the sympathy of the people or of the government of the united states for the cause or object for which a part of the people of cuba be understand to have put themselves in armed resistance to the government of spain there can be no just sympathy in a conflict carry on by both party alike in such barbarous violation of the rule of civilized nation and with such continued outrage upon the plain principle of humanity
 we can not discriminate in our censure of their mode of conduct their contest between the spaniards and the cubans each commit the same atrocity and outrage alike the establish rule of war
 the property of many of our citizen have be destroy or embargo the life of several have be sacrifice and the liberty of other have be restrain in every case that have come to the knowledge of the government an early and earnest demand for reparation and indemnity have be make and most emphatic remonstrance have be present against the manner in which the strife be conduct and against the reckless disregard of human life the wanton destruction of material wealth and the cruel disregard of the establish rule of civilized warfare
 i have since the beginning of the present session of congress communicate to the house of representatives upon their request an account of the step which i have take in the hope of bring this sad conflict to an end and of securing to the people of cuba the blessing and the right of independent self government the effort thus make fail but not without an assurance from spain that the good office of this government might still avail for the object to which they have be address
 during the whole contest the remarkable exhibition have be make of large number of cubans escape from the island and avoid the risk of war congregate in this country at a safe distance from the scene of danger and endeavor to make war from our shore to urge our people into the fight which they avoid and to embroil this government in complication and possible hostility with spain it can scarce be doubt that this last result be the real object of these party although carefully cover under the deceptive and apparently plausible demand for a mere recognition of belligerency
 it be state on what i have reason to regard as good authority that cuban bond have be prepare to a large amount whose payment be make dependent upon the recognition by the united states of either cuban belligerency or independence the object of make their value thus contingent upon the action of this government be a subject for serious reflection
 in determine the course to be adopt on the demand thus make for a recognition of belligerency the liberal and peaceful principle adopt by the father of his country and the eminent statesman of his day and follow by succeed chief magistrates and the man of their day may furnish a safe guide to those of we now charge with the direction and control of the public safety
 from 1789 to 1815 the dominant thought of our statesman be to keep the united states out of the war which be devastate europe the discussion of measure of neutrality begin with the state paper of mr. jefferson when secretary of state he show that they be measure of national right as well as of national duty that misguide individual citizen can not be tolerate in make war accord to their own caprice passion interest or foreign sympathy that the agent of foreign government recognize or unrecognize can not be permit to abuse our hospitality by usurp the function of enlist or equip military or naval force within our territory washington inaugurate the policy of neutrality and of absolute abstinence from all foreign entangle alliance which result in 1794 in the first municipal enactment for the observance of neutrality
 the duty of opposition to filibustering have be admit by every president washington encounter the effort of genet and of the french revolutionist john adams the project of miranda jefferson the scheme of aaron burr madison and subsequent president have to deal with the question of foreign enlistment or equipment in the united states and since the day of john quincy adams it have be one of the constant care of government in the united states to prevent piratical expedition against the feeble spanish american republics from leave our shore in no country be man want for any enterprise that hold out promise of adventure or of gain
 in the early day of our national existence the whole continent of america outside of the limit of the united states and all its island be in colonial dependence upon european power
 the revolution which from 1810 spread almost simultaneously through all the spanish american continental colony result in the establishment of new states like ourselves of european origin and interested in exclude european politic and the question of dynasty and of balance of power from further influence in the new world
 the american policy of neutrality important before become doubly so from the fact that it become applicable to the new republics as well as to the mother country
 it then devolve upon we to determine the great international question at what time and under what circumstance to recognize a new power as entitle to a place among the family of nation as well as the preliminary question of the attitude to be observe by this government toward the insurrectionary party pende the contest
 mr. monroe concisely express the rule which have control the action of this government with reference to revolt colony pende their struggle by say
 as soon as the movement assume such a steady and consistent form as to make the success of the provinces probable the right to which they be entitle by the law of nation as equal party to a civil war be extend to they
 the strict adherence to this rule of public policy have be one of the high honor of american statesmanship and have secure to this government the confidence of the feeble power on this continent which induce they to rely upon its friendship and absence of design of conquest and to look to the united states for example and moral protection it have give to this government a position of prominence and of influence which it should not abdicate but which impose upon it the most delicate duty of right and of honor regard american question whether those question affect emancipate colony or colony still subject to european dominion
 the question of belligerency be one of fact not to be decide by sympathy for or prejudice against either party the relation between the parent state and the insurgent must amount in fact to war in the sense of international law fight though fierce and protract do not alone constitute war there must be military force act in accordance with the rule and custom of war flag of truce cartel exchange of prisoner etc and to justify a recognition of belligerency there must be above all a de facto political organization of the insurgent sufficient in character and resource to constitute it if leave to itself a state among nation capable of discharge the duty of a state and of meet the just responsibility it may incur as such toward other power in the discharge of its national duty
 apply the good information which i have be enable to gather whether from official or unofficial source include the very exaggerated statement which each party give to all that may prejudice the opposite or give credit to its own side of the question i be unable to see in the present condition of the contest in cuba those element which be requisite to constitute war in the sense of international law
 the insurgent hold no town or city have no establish seat of government they have no prize court no organization for the receiving and collecting of revenue no seaport to which a prize may be carry or through which access can be have by a foreign power to the limited interior territory and mountain fastness which they occupy the existence of a legislature represent any popular constituency be more than doubtful
 in the uncertainty that hang around the entire insurrection there be no palpable evidence of an election of any delegate authority or of any government outside the limit of the camp occupy from day to day by the rove company of insurgent troop there be no commerce no trade either internal or foreign no manufacture
 the late commander in chief of the insurgent having recently come to the united states publicly declare that all commercial intercourse or trade with the exterior world have be utterly cut off and he far add today we have not 10,000 arm in cuba
 it be a well establish principle of public law that a recognition by a foreign state of belligerent right to insurgent under circumstance such as now exist in cuba if not justify by necessity be a gratuitous demonstration of moral support to the rebellion such necessity may yet hereafter arrive but it have not yet arrive nor be its probability clearly to be see
 if it be war between spain and cuba and be so recognize it be our duty to provide for the consequence which may ensue in the embarrassment to our commerce and the interference with our revenue
 if belligerency be recognize the commercial marine of the united states become liable to search and to seizure by the commission cruiser of both party they become subject to the adjudication of prize court
 our large coastwise trade between the atlantic and the gulf states and between both and the isthmus of panama and the states of south america engage the large part of our commercial marine pass of necessity almost in sight of the island of cuba under the treaty with spain of 1795 as well as by the law of nation our vessel will be liable to visit on the high sea in case of belligerency the carrying of contraband which now be lawful become liable to the risk of seizure and condemnation the parent government become relieved from responsibility for act do in the insurgent territory and acquire the right to exercise against neutral commerce all the power of a party to a maritime war to what consequence the exercise of those power may lead be a question which i desire to commend to the serious consideration of congress
 in view of the gravity of this question i have deem it my duty to invite the attention of the war make power of the country to all the relation and bearing of the question in connection with the declaration of neutrality and granting of belligerent right
 there be not a de facto government in the island of cuba sufficient to execute law and maintain just relation with other nation spain have not be able to suppress the opposition to spanish rule on the island nor to award speedy justice to other nation or citizen of other nation when their right have be invade
 there be serious complication grow out of the seizure of american vessel upon the high sea execute american citizen without proper trial and confiscate or embargo the property of american citizen solemn protest have be make against every infraction of the right either of individual citizen of the united states or the right of our flag upon the high sea and all proper step have be take and be be press for the proper reparation of every indignity complain of
 the question of belligerency however which be to be decide upon definite principle and accord to ascertained fact be entirely different from and unconnected with the other question of the manner in which the strife be carry on both side and the treatment of our citizen entitle to our protection
 the question concern our own dignity and responsibility and they have be make as i have say the subject of repeat communication with spain and of protest and demand for redress on our part it be hope that these will not be disregard but should they be these question will be make the subject of a further communication to congress

to the senate of the united states
 i transmit to the senate in answer to their resolution of the 7th instant a report from the secretary of state with accompany document
 u. s. grant
 department of state
 washington july 14 1870
 the secretary of state to whom be refer the resolution of the senate request the president to institute an inquiry by such mean as in his judgment shall be deem proper into the present condition of the commercial relation between the united states and the spanish american states on this continent and between those country and other nation and to communicate to the senate full and complete statement regard the same together with such recommendation as he may think necessary to promote the development and increase of our commerce with those region and to secure to the united states that proportionate share of the trade of this continent to which their close relation of geographical contiguity and political friendship with all the states of america justly entitle they have the honor to report
 the resolution justly regard the commercial and the political relation of the united states with the american states of spanish origin as necessarily dependent upon each other if the commerce of those country have be divert from its natural connection with the united states the fact may probably be partly trace to political cause which have be sweep away by the great civil convulsion in this country
 for the just comprehension of the position of this government in the american political system and for the cause which have fail to give it hitherto the influence to which it be properly entitle by reason of its democratic system and of the moderation and sense of justice which have distinguish its foreign policy through successive administration from the birth of the nation until now it be necessary to make a brief notice of such measure as affect our present relation to the other part of this continent
 the united states be the first of the european colony in america to arrive at maturity as a people and assume the position of an independent republic since then important change have take place in various nation and in every part of the world our own growth in power have be not the least remarkable of all the great event of modern history
 when at the conclusion of the revolutionary war having conquer by arm our right to exist as a sovereign state that right be at length recognize by treaty we occupy only a narrow belt of land along the atlantic coast hem in at the north the west and the south by the possession of european governments or by uncultivated waste beyond the alleghanies inhabit only by the aborigine but in the very infancy of the united states far sight statesman see and predict that weak in population and apparently restrict in available territory as the new republic then be it have within it the germ of colossal grandeur and would at no remote day occupy the continent of america with its institution its authority and its peaceful influence
 that expectation have be thus far signally verify the united states enter at once into the occupation of their rightful possession westward to the bank of the mississippi next by the spontaneous proffer of france they acquire louisiana and its territorial extension or right of extension north to the line of the treaty demarcation between france and great britain and west to the pacific ocean next by amicable arrangement with spain they acquire the floridas and complete southern maritime frontier upon the gulf of mexico then come the union with the independent state of texas follow by the acquisition of california and new mexico and then of arizona finally russia have cede to we alaska and the continent of north america have become independent of europe except so much of it as continue to maintain political relation with great britain
 meanwhile partly by natural increase and partly by voluntary immigration from europe our population have rise from 3,000,000 to nearly 40,000,000 the number of states and territories unite under the constitution have be augment from thirteen to forty seven the development of internal wealth and power have keep pace with political expansion we have occupy in part and people the vast interior of the continent we have bind the pacific to the atlantic by a chain of intervene states and organize territories we have deliver the republic from the anomaly and the ignominy of domestic servitude we have constitutionally fix the equality of all race and of all man before the law and we have establish at the cost of a great civil war a cost however not beyond the value of such a result the indissoluble national unity of the united states
 in all these mark stage of national progress from the declaration of independence to the recent amendment of the constitution it be impossible not to perceive a providential series and succession of event intimately attach one to the other and possess of definite character as a whole whatever incidental departure from such uniformity may have mark or seem to mark our foreign policy under the influence of temporary cause or of the conflict opinion of statesman
 in the time of washington of the first adams of jefferson and of madison the condition of europe engage in the gigantic war of the french revolution and of the empire produce its series of public question and give tone and color to our foreign policy in the time of monroe of the second adams and of jackson and subsequently thereto the independence of the spanish and portuguese colony of america produce its series of question and its apparent modification of our public policy domestic question of territorial organization of social emancipation and of national unity have also largely occupy the mind and the attention of the later administration
 the treaty of alliance and guaranty with france which contribute so much to our independence be one source of solicitude to the early administrations which be endeavor to protect our commerce from the depredation and wrong to which the maritime policy of england and the reaction of that policy on france subject it for twenty year we struggle in vain to accomplish this and at last drift into war
 the avoidance of entangle alliance the characteristic feature of the foreign policy of washington spring from this condition of thing but the entangle alliance which then exist be engagement make with france as a part of the general contract under which aid be furnish to we for the achievement of our independence france be willing to waive the letter of the obligation as to her west india possession but demand in its stead privilege in our port which the administration be unwilling to concede to make its refusal acceptable to a public which sympathize with france the cabinet of general washington exaggerate the principle into a theory tend to national isolation
 the public measure design to maintain unimpaired the domestic sovereignty and the international neutrality of the united states be independent of this policy though apparently incidental to it the municipal law enact by congress then and since have be but declaration of the law of nation they be essential to the preservation of our national dignity and honor they have for their object to repress and punish all enterprise of private war one of the last relic of mediaeval barbarism and they have descend to we from the father of the republic support and enforce by every succeed president of the united states
 the foreign policy of these early day be not a narrow one during this period we secure the evacuation by great britain of the country wrongfully occupy by she on the lakes we acquire louisiana we measure force on the sea with france and on the land and sea with england we set the example of resist and chastise the piracy of the barbary states we initiate in negotiation with prussia the long line of treaty for the liberalization of war and the promotion of international intercourse and we steadily demand and at length obtain indemnification from various government for the loss we have suffer by foreign spoliation in the war of europe
 to this point in our foreign policy we have arrive when the revolutionary movement in spanish and portuguese america compel a modification of our relation with europe in consequence of the rise of new and independent state in america
 the revolution which commence in 1810 and extend through all the spanish american continental colony after vain effort of repression on the part of spain protract through twenty year terminate in the establishment of the independent states of mexico guatemala san salvador honduras nicaragua costa rica venezuela colombia ecuador peru chile bolivia the argentine republic uruguay and paraguay to which the empire of brazil come in time to be add these event necessarily enlarge the sphere of action of the united states and essentially modify our relation with europe and our attitude to the rest of this continent
 the new states be like ourselves revolt colony they continue the precedent we have set of separate from europe their assumption of independence be stimulate by our example they professedly imitate we and copy our national constitution sometimes even to their inconvenience
 the spanish american colony have not the same preparation for independence that we have each of the british colony possess complete local autonomy its formal transition from dependence to independence consist chiefly in expel the british governor of the colony and elect a governor of the state from which to the organized union be but a step all these condition of success be want in spanish america and hence many of the difficulty in their career as independent state and far while the revolution in british america be the exclusive result of the march of opinion in the british colony the simultaneous action of the separate spanish colony though show a desire for independence be principally produce by the accident of the invasion of spain by france
 the formation of these new sovereignty in america be important to we not only because of the cessation of colonial monopoly to that extent but because of the geographical relation to we hold by so many new nation all like ourselves create from european stock and interested in exclude european politic dynastic question and balance of power from further influence in the new world
 thus the united states be force into new line of action which though apparently in some respect conflict be really in harmony with the line mark out by washington the avoidance of entangle political alliance and the maintenance of our own independent neutrality become doubly important from the fact that they become applicable to the new republics as well as to the mother country the duty of noninterference have be admit by every president the question come up in the time of the first adams on the occasion of the enlistment project of miranda it appear again under jefferson anterior to the revolt of the spanish colony in the scheme of aaron burr it be an ever present question in the administrations of madison monroe and the young adams in reference to the question of foreign enlistment or equipment in the united states and when these new republic enter the family of nation many of they very feeble and all too much subject to internal revolution and civil war a strict adherence to our previous policy and a strict enforcement of our law become essential to the preservation of friendly relation with they for since that time it have be one of the principal care of those intrust with the administration of the government to prevent piratical expedition against these sister republics from leave our port and thus the change condition of the new world make no change in the traditional and peaceful policy of the united states in this respect
 in one respect however the advent of these new states in america do compel an apparent change of foreign policy on our part it devolve upon we the determination of the great international question at what time and under what circumstance to recognize a new power as entitle to a place among the family of nation there be but little of precedent to guide we except our own case something indeed could be infer from the historical origin of the netherlands and switzerland but our own case carefully and conscientiously consider be sufficient to guide we to right conclusion we maintain our position of international friendship and of treaty obligation toward spain but we do not consider that we be bind to wait for its recognition of the new republics before admit they into treaty relation with we as sovereign state we hold that it be for we to judge whether or not they have attain to the condition of actual independence and the consequent right of recognition by we we consider this question of fact deliberately and coolly we send commissioner to spanish america to ascertain and report for our information concern their actual circumstance and in the fullness of time we acknowledge their independence we exchange diplomatic minister and make treaty of amity with they the early of which negotiate by mr. john quincy adams serve as the model for the subsequent treaty with the spanish american republics we also simultaneously therewith exert our good office with spain to induce she to submit to the inevitable result and herself to accept and acknowledge the independence of her late colony we endeavor to induce russia to join we in these representation in all this our action be positive in the direction of promote the complete political separation of america from europe
 a vast field be thus open to the statesman of the united states for the peaceful introduction the spread and the permanent establishment of the american idea of republican government of modification of the law of war of liberalization of commerce of religious freedom and toleration and of the emancipation of the new world from the dynastic and balance of power controversy of europe
 mr. john quincy adams beyond any other statesman of the time in this country have the knowledge and experience both european and american the comprehension of thought and purpose and the moral conviction which peculiarly fit he to introduce our country into this new field and to lay the foundation of an american policy the declaration know as the monroe doctrine and the object and purpose of the congress of panama both suppose to have be largely inspire by mr. adams have influence public event from that day to this as a principle of government for this continent and its adjacent island
 it be at the period of the congress of aix la chapelle and of laybach when the holy alliance be combine to arrest all political change in europe in the sense of liberty when they be intervene in southern europe for the reestablishment of absolutism and when they be meditate interference to check the progress of free government in america that mr. monroe in his annual message of december 1823 declare that the united states would consider any attempt to extend the european system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety with the exist colony or dependency of any european power he say we have not interfere and shall not interfere but with the government who have declare their independence and maintain it and whose independence we have on great consideration and on just principle acknowledge we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppress they or control in any other manner their destiny by any european power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the united states
 this declaration resolve the solution of the immediate question of the independence of the spanish american colony and be suppose to have exercise some influence upon the course of the british cabinet in regard to the absolutist scheme in europe as well as in america
 it have also exercise a permanent influence on this continent it be at once invoke in consequence of the suppose peril of cuba on the side of europe it be apply to a similar danger threaten yucatan it be embody in the treaty of the united states and great britain as to central america it produce the successful opposition of the united states to the attempt of great britain to exercise dominion in nicaragua under the cover of the mosquito indians and it operate in like manner to prevent the establishment of a european dynasty in mexico
 the united states stand solemnly commit by repeat declaration and repeat act to this doctrine and its application to the affair of this continent in his message to the two houses of congress at the commencement of the present session the president follow the teaching of all our history say that the exist dependency be no long regard as subject to transfer from one european power to another when the present relation of colony cease they be to become independent power exercise the right of choice and of self control in the determination of their future condition and relation with other power
 this policy be not a policy of aggression but it oppose the creation of european dominion on american soil or its transfer to other european power and it look hopefully to the time when by the voluntary departure of european government from this continent and the adjacent island america shall be wholly american
 it do not contemplate forcible intervention in any legitimate contest but it protest against permit such a contest to result in the increase of european power or influence and it ever impel this government as in the late contest between the south american republics and spain to interpose its good office to secure an honorable peace
 the congress of panama be plan by bolivar to secure the union of spanish america against spain it have originally military as well as political purpose in the military object the united states could take no part and indeed the necessity for such object cease when the full effect of mr. monroe&#39;s declaration be feel but the pacific object of the congress the establishment of close and cordial relation of amity the creation of commercial intercourse of interchange of political thought and of habit of good understanding between the new republics and the united states and their respective citizen might perhaps have be attain have the administration of that day receive the united support of the country unhappily they be lose the new states be remove from the sympathetic and protect influence of our example and their commerce which we might then have secure pass into other hand unfriendly to the united states
 in look back upon the panama congress from this length of time it be easy to understand why the earnest and patriotic man who endeavor to crystallize an american system for this continent fail
 mr. clay and mr. adams be far sighted statesman but unfortunately they strike against the rock of african slavery one of the question propose for discussion in the conference be the consideration of the mean to be adopt for the entire abolition of the african slave trade to which proposition the committee of the united states senate of that day reply the united states have not certainly the right and ought never to feel the inclination to dictate to other who may differ with they upon this subject nor do the committee see the expediency of insult other state with whom we be maintain relation of perfect amity by ascend the moral chair and proclaim from thence mere abstract principle of the rectitude of which each nation enjoy the perfect right of decide for itself the same committee also allude to the possibility that the condition of the island of cuba and porto rico still the possession of spain and still slaveholde might be make the subject of discussion and of contemplated action by the panama congress if ever the united states they say permit themselves to be associate with these nation in any general congress assemble for the discussion of common plan in any way affect european interest they will by such act not only deprive themselves of the ability they now possess of render useful assistance to the other american states but also produce other effect prejudicial to their own interest
 thus the necessity at that day of preserve the great interest of the southern states in african slavery and of prevent a change in the character of labor in the island of cuba and porto rico lose to the united states the opportunity of give a permanent direction to the political and commercial connection of the newly enfranchise spanish american states and their trade pass into hand unfriendly to the united states and have remain there ever since
 event subsequent to that date have tend to place we in a position to retrieve our mistake among which event may be particularly name the suppression of the rebellion the manifestation of our undeveloped and unexpected military power the retirement of the french from mexico and the abolition of slavery in the united states
 there be good reason to believe that the latter fact have have an important influence in our favor in spanish america it have cause we to be regard there with more sympathetic as well as more respectful consideration it have relieve those republic from the fear of filibusterism which have be formerly incite against central america and mexico in the interest of slave extension and it have produce an impression of the stability of our institution and of our public strength sufficient to dissipate the fear of our friend or the hope of those who wish us ill
 thus there exist in the spanish american republics confidence toward the united states on our side they find a feeling of cordial amity and friendship and a desire to cultivate and develop our common interest on this continent with some of these state our relation be more intimate than with other either by reason of close similarity of constitutional form of great commercial intercourse of proximity in fact or of the construction or contemplated construction of line of transit for our trade and commerce between the atlantic and the pacific with several of they we have peculiar treaty relation the treaty of 1846 between the united states and new granada contain stipulation of guaranty for the neutrality of the part of the isthmus within the present territory of colombia and for the protection of the right of sovereignty and property therein belong to colombia similar stipulation appear in the treaty of 1867 with nicaragua and of july 1864 with honduras those treaty like the treaty of alliance make with france in 1778 by dr. franklin silas deane and arthur lee constitute pro tanto a true protective alliance between the united states and each of those republics provision of like effect appear in the treaty of april 19 1850 between great britain and the united states
 brazil with her imperial semblance and constitutional reality have always hold relation of amity with we which have be fortify by the opening of her great river to commerce it need only that in emulation of russia and the united states she should emancipate her slave to place she in more complete sympathy with the rest of america
 it will not be presumptuous after the foregoing sketch to say with entire consideration for the sovereignty and national pride of the spanish american republics that the united states by the priority of their independence by the stability of their institution by the regard of their people for the form of law by their resource as a government by their naval power by their commercial enterprise by the attraction which they offer to european immigration by the prodigious internal development of their resource and wealth and by the intellectual life of their population occupy of necessity a prominent position on this continent which they neither can nor should abdicate which entitle they to a lead voice and which impose upon they duty of right and of honor regard american question whether those question affect emancipate colony or colony still subject to european dominion
 the public question which exist as to all european colony prior to and during the revolution in the continental colony of spain and portugal still exist with reference to the european colony which remain and they now return upon we in full force as we watch event in cuba and porto rico
 whatever may be the result of the pende contest in cuba it appear to be the belief of some of the lead statesman of spain that the relation which now exist between the island and the mother country can not be long continue it be understand that the resource for carry on the struggle have be supply mainly from cuba by the aid of that portion of the population which do not desire to see its political destiny intrust to the person who direct the movement of the insurgent but it do not follow that its political relation with spain be to remain unchanged or that even the party which be now dominant in the island will wish to forever continue colonist
 these fact give reason to think that when the contest shall close cuba with her resource strain but unexhausted whatever may be her political relation will resume and continue her old commercial relation with the united states and it be not impossible that at some day not far distant when measure by the course of history she will be call upon to elect her position in the family of nation
 although the resolution of the senate do not in term apply to the island of the antilles it be impossible to answer it without speak of they they outlie the southern coast of the united states and guard the approach to the port of mexico venezuela and the isthmus by which we reach from the east the western coast of mexico and of the spanish states the people of the spanish island speak the language and share the tradition custom idea and religion of the spanish american states of the continent and will probably like they become at some time independent of the mother country it would therefore be unwise while shape a commercial policy for the continent to disregard the island which lie so much near to our seaport
 with the spanish island of cuba and porto rico we maintain in spite of their adverse legislation a large commerce by reason of our necessity and of their proximity in the year end june 30 1869 we import from they merchandise value at $ 65,609,274 during the same time we send they good to the value only of $ 15,313,919
 the prohibitory duty force upon they by the policy of spain shut out much that we might supply their tropical production for instance be too valuable to allow their land to be give up to the growth of breadstuff yet instead of take these article from the superabundant field of their near neighbor they be force to go to the distant plain of spain it will be for the interest of the united states to shape its general policy so that this relation of import and export shall be alter in cuba when peace be restore and its political condition be satisfactorily establish
 with none of the other spanish american states in north and south america be our commercial relation what they should be our total import in the year end june 30 1869 from these country be less than $ 25,000,000 or not one half the amount from cuba alone and our export for the same time to they be only $ 17,850,313 and yet these country have an aggregate population nearly or quite as great as that of the united states they have republican form of government and they profess to be and probably really be in political sympathy with we
 this department be not able to give with entire accuracy the import and export of great britain with the same country during the corresponding period it be believe however the follow figure will be find to be not far from correct import to great britain $ 42,820,942 export from great britain $ 40,682,102
 it thus appear that notwithstanding the great distance which the commerce have to travel in come to and from great britain notwithstanding the political sympathy which ought naturally to exist between republic notwithstanding the american idea which have be so prominently and so constantly put forward by the government of the united states notwithstanding the acknowledge skill of american manufacturer notwithstanding the ready market which the great city of the united states afford for the consumption of tropical production the inhabitant of the spanish american continent consume of the product of great britain more than twice the quantity they take of the product of the united states and that they sell to we only three fifth of the amount they sell to great britain
 the secretary of state append to this report the table on which these statement be rounded that their commerce with the united states be not large may be partially explain by the fact that these states have be subject to many successive revolution since the failure of the congress of panama these revolution not only exhaust their resource and burden they with debt but they check emigration prevent the flow of foreign capital into the country and stop the enterprise which need a stable government for its development
 these suggestion be however applicable to the british commerce as well as to our own and they do not explain why we with the natural advantage in our favor fall so far behind the isthmus of panama be the common point where the commerce of the western coast of mexico and south america meet when it arrive there why should it seek liverpool and london rather than new york
 the political cause which have operate to divert this commerce from we the secretary of state have endeavor to explain a favorable time have now come for remove they for lay the foundation of an american policy which shall bind in close union the american republics let they understand that the united states do not covet their territory that our only desire be to see they peaceful with free and stable government increase in wealth and population and develop in the line in which their own tradition custom habit law and mode of thought will naturally take they let they feel that as in 1826 so now this government be ready to aid they to the full extent of its constitutional power in any step which they may take for their well protection against anarchy let they be convince that the united states be prepare in good faith and without ulterior purpose to join they in the development of a peaceful american commercial policy that may in time include this continent and the west indian islands let this be comprehend and there will be no political reason why we may not secure to the united states that proportionate share of the trade of this continent to which their close relation of geographical contiguity and political friendship with all the states of america justly entitle they
 it may not be enough to remove the political obstacle only the financial policy which the war make necessary may have operate injuriously upon our commerce with these states the resolution of the senate call on these point for detailed information which be not within the control of the secretary of state and for recommendation for the future which he be not prepared to give without that information to fully answer the senate&#39;s call it would probably be necessary to employ some competent agent familiar with the spanish american states to collate and arrange the information ask for for this there be no appropriation by congress

 secretary of state

to the senate and house of representatives a year of peace and general prosperity to this nation have pass since the last assembling of congress we have through a kind providence be bless with abundant crop and have be spare from complication and war with foreign nation in our midst comparative harmony have be restore it be to be regret however that a free exercise of the elective franchise have by violence and intimidation be deny to citizen in exceptional case in several of the states lately in rebellion and the verdict of the people have thereby be reverse the states of virginia mississippi and texas have be restore to representation in our national council georgia the only state now without representation may confidently be expect to take her place there also at the beginning of the new year and then let we hope will be complete the work of reconstruction with an acquiescence on the part of the whole people in the national obligation to pay the public debt create as the price of our union the pension to our disabled soldier and sailor and their widow and orphan and in the change to the constitution which have be make necessary by a great rebellion there be no reason why we should not advance in material prosperity and happiness as no other nation ever do after so protracted and devastate a war soon after the exist war break out in europe the protection of the united states minister in paris be invoke in favor of north germans domicile in french territory instruction be issue to grant the protection this have be follow by an extension of american protection to citizen of saxony hesse and saxe coburg gotha colombia portugal uruguay the dominican republic ecuador chile paraguay and venezuela in paris the charge be an onerous one require constant and severe labor as well as the exercise of patience prudence and good judgment it have be perform to the entire satisfaction of this government and as i be officially inform equally so to the satisfaction of the government of north germany as soon as i learn that a republic have be proclaim at paris and that the people of france have acquiesce in the change the minister of the united states be direct by telegraph to recognize it and to tender my congratulation and those of the people of the united states the reestablishment in france of a system of government disconnect with the dynastic tradition of europe appear to be a proper subject for the felicitation of americans should the present struggle result in attach the heart of the french to our simple form of representative government it will be a subject of still further satisfaction to our people while we make no effort to impose our institution upon the inhabitant of other country and while we adhere to our traditional neutrality in civil contest elsewhere we can not be indifferent to the spread of american political idea in a great and highly civilized country like france we be ask by the new government to use our good office jointly with those of european power in the interest of peace answer be make that the establish policy and the true interest of the united states forbid they to interfere in european question jointly with european power i ascertain informally and unofficially that the government of north germany be not then disposed to listen to such representation from any power and though earnestly wish to see the blessing of peace restore to the belligerent with all of whom the united states be on term of friendship i decline on the part of this government to take a step which could only result in injury to our true interest without advance the object for which our intervention be invoke should the time come when the action of the united states can hasten the return of peace by a single hour that action will be heartily take i deem it prudent in view of the number of person of german and french birth live in the united states to issue soon after official notice of a state of war have be receive from both belligerent a proclamation define the duty of the united states as a neutral and the obligation of person reside within their territory to observe their law and the law of nation this proclamation be follow by other as circumstance seem to call for they the people thus acquaint in advance of their duty and obligation have assist in prevent violation of the neutrality of the united states it be not understand that the condition of the insurrection in cuba have materially change since the close of the last session of congress in an early stage of the contest the authority of spain inaugurate a system of arbitrary arrest of close confinement and of military trial and execution of person suspect of complicity with the insurgent and of summary embargo of their property and sequestration of their revenue by executive warrant such proceeding so far as they affect the person or property of citizen of the united states be in violation of the provision of the treaty of 1795 between the united states and spain representation of injury result to several person claim to be citizen of the united states by reason of such violation be make to the spanish government from april 1869 to june last the spanish minister at washington have be clothe with a limited power to aid in redress such wrong that power be find to be withdraw in view as it be say of the favorable situation in which the island of cuba then be which however do not lead to a revocation or suspension of the extraordinary and arbitrary function exercise by the executive power in cuba and we be oblige to make our complaint at madrid in the negotiation thus open and still pende there the united states only claim that for the future the right secure to their citizen by treaty should be respect in cuba and that as to the past a joint tribunal should be establish in the united states with full jurisdiction over all such claim before such an impartial tribunal each claimant would be require to prove his case on the other hand spain would be at liberty to traverse every material fact and thus complete equity would be do a case which at one time threaten seriously to affect the relation between the united states and spain have already be dispose of in this way the claim of the owner of the colonel lloyd aspinwall for the illegal seizure and detention of that vessel be refer to arbitration by mutual consent and have result in an award to the united states for the owner of the sum of $ 19,702.50 in gold another and long pende claim of like nature that of the whaleship canada have be dispose of by friendly arbitrament during the present year it be refer by the joint consent of brazil and the united states to the decision of sir edward thornton her britannic majesty 's minister at washington who kindly undertake the laborious task of examine the voluminous mass of correspondence and testimony submit by the two government and award to the united states the sum of $ 100,740.09 in gold which have since be pay by the imperial government these recent example show that the mode which the united states have propose to spain for adjust the pende claim be just and feasible and that it may be agree to by either nation without dishonor it be to be hope that this moderate demand may be accede to by spain without further delay should the pende negotiation unfortunately and unexpectedly be without result it will then become my duty to communicate that fact to congress and invite its action on the subject the long defer peace conference between spain and the ally south american republics have be inaugurate in washington under the auspex of the united states pursuant to the recommendation contain in the resolution of the house of representatives of the 17th of december 1866 the executive department of the government offer its friendly office for the promotion of peace and harmony between spain and the allied republics hesitation and obstacle occur to the acceptance of the offer ultimately however a conference be arrange and be open in this city on the 29th of october last at which i authorize the secretary of state to preside it be attend by the minister of spain peru chile and ecuador in consequence of the absence of a representative from bolivia the conference be adjourn until the attendance of a plenipotentiary from that republic could be secure or other measure could be adopt toward compass its object the allied and other republics of spanish origin on this continent may see in this fact a new proof of our sincere interest in their welfare of our desire to see they bless with good government capable of maintain order and of preserve their respective territorial integrity and of our sincere wish to extend our own commercial and social relation with they the time be not probably far distant when in the natural course of event the european political connection with this continent will cease our policy should be shape in view of this probability so as to ally the commercial interest of the spanish american states more closely to our own and thus give the united states all the preeminence and all the advantage which mr. monroe mr. adams and mr. clay contemplate when they propose to join in the congress of panama during the last session of congress a treaty for the annexation of the republic of san domingo to the united states fail to receive the requisite two third vote of the senate i be thoroughly convince then that the good interest of this country commercially and materially demand its ratification time have only confirm i in this view i now firmly believe that the moment it be know that the united states have entirely abandon the project of accept as a part of its territory the island of san domingo a free port will be negotiate for by european nation in the bay of samana a large commercial city will spring up to which we will be tributary without receive correspond benefit and then will be see the folly of our reject so great a prize the government of san domingo have voluntarily seek this annexation it be a weak power number probably less than 120,000 soul and yet possess one of the rich territory under the sun capable of support a population of 10,000,000 people in luxury the people of san domingo be not capable of maintain themselves in their present condition and must look for outside support they yearn for the protection of our free institution and law our progress and civilization shall we refuse them?the acquisition of san domingo be desirable because of its geographical position it command the entrance to the caribbean sea and the isthmus transit of commerce it possess the rich soil good and most capacious harbor most salubrious climate and the most valuable product of the forest mine and soil of any of the west india islands its possession by we will in a few year build up a coastwise commerce of immense magnitude which will go far toward restore to we our lose merchant marine it will give to we those article which we consume so largely and do not produce thus equalize our export and import in case of foreign war it will give we command of all the island refer to and thus prevent an enemy from ever again possess himself of rendezvous upon our very coast at present our coast trade between the states border on the atlantic and those border on the gulf of mexico be cut into by the bahamas and the antilies twice we must as it be pass through foreign country to get by sea from georgia to the west coast of florida san domingo with a stable government under which her immense resource can be develop will give remunerative wage to ten of thousand of laborer not now upon the island this labor will take advantage of every available mean of transportation to abandon the adjacent island and seek the blessing of freedom and its sequence each inhabitant receive the reward of his own labor porto rico and cuba will have to abolish slavery as a measure of self preservation to retain their laborer san domingo will become a large consumer of the product of northern farm and manufactory the cheap rate at which her citizen can be furnish with food tool and machinery will make it necessary that contiguous island should have the same advantage in order to compete in the production of sugar coffee tobacco tropical fruit etc this will open to we a still wide market for our product the production of our own supply of these article will cut off more than one hundred million of our annual import besides largely increase our export with such a picture it be easy to see how our large debt abroad be ultimately to be extinguish with a balance of trade against we include interest on bond hold by foreigner and money spend by our citizen travel in foreign land equal to the entire yield of the precious metal in this country it be not so easy to see how this result be to be otherwise accomplish the acquisition of san domingo be an adherence to the monroe doctrine it be a measure of national protection it be assert our just claim to a control influence over the great commercial traffic soon to flow from west to east by way of the isthmus of darien it be to build up our merchant marine it be to furnish new market for the product of our farm shop and manufactory it be to make slavery insupportable in cuba and porto rico at once and ultimately so in brazil it be to settle the unhappy condition of cuba and end an exterminate conflict it be to provide honest mean of pay our honest debt without overtax the people it be to furnish our citizen with the necessary of everyday life at cheap rate than ever before and it be in fine a rapid stride toward that greatness which the intelligence industry and enterprise of the citizen of the united states entitle this country to assume among nation in view of the importance of this question i earnestly urge upon congress early action expressive of its view as to the good mean of acquire san domingo my suggestion be that by joint resolution of the two houses of congress the executive be authorize to appoint a commission to negotiate a treaty with the authority of san domingo for the acquisition of that island and that an appropriation be make to defray the expense of such a commission the question may then be determine either by the action of the senate upon the treaty or the joint action of the two houses of congress upon a resolution of annexation as in the case of the acquisition of texas so convinced be i of the advantage to flow from the acquisition of san domingo and of the great disadvantage i might almost say calamity to flow from nonacquisition that i believe the subject have only to be investigate to be approve it be to be regret that our representation in regard to the injurious effect especially upon the revenue of the united states of the policy of the mexican government in exempt from impost duty a large tract of its territory on our border have not only be fruitless but that it be even propose in that country to extend the limit within which the privilege advert to have hitherto be enjoy the expediency of take into your serious consideration proper measure for countervail the policy refer to will it be presume engage your earnest attention it be the obvious interest especially of neighboring nation to provide against impunity to those who may have commit high crime within their border and who may have seek refuge abroad for this purpose extradition treaty have be conclude with several of the central american republics and other be in progress the sense of congress be desire as early as may be convenient upon the proceeding of the commission on claim against venezuela as communicate in my message of march 16 1869 march 1 1870 and march 31 1870 it have not be deem advisable to distribute any of the money which have be receive from that government until congress shall have act on the subject the massacre of french and russian resident at tien tsin under circumstance of great barbarity be suppose by some to have be premeditate and to indicate a purpose among the populace to exterminate foreigner in the chinese empire the evidence fail to establish such a supposition but show a complicity between the local authority and the mob the government at peking however seem to have be dispose to fulfill its treaty obligation so far as it be able to do so unfortunately the news of the war between the german states and france reach china soon after the massacre it would appear that the popular mind become possess with the idea that this contest extend to chinese water would neutralize the christian influence and power and that the time be come when the superstitious masse might expel all foreigner and restore mandarin influence anticipate trouble from this cause i invite france and north germany to make an authorized suspension of hostility in the east where they be temporarily suspend by act of the commander and to act together for the future protection in china of the life and property of americans and europeans since the adjournment of congress the ratification of the treaty with great britain for abolish the mixed court for the suppression of the slave trade have be exchange it be believe that the slave trade be now confine to the eastern coast of africa whence the slave be take to arabian market the ratification of the naturalization convention between great britain and the united states have also be exchange during the recess and thus a long stand dispute between the two government have be settle in accordance with the principle always contend for by the united states in april last while engage in locate a military reservation near pembina a corps of engineer discover that the commonly receive boundary line between the united states and the british possession at that place be about 4,700 foot south of the true position of the forty ninth parallel and that the line when run on what be now suppose to be the true position of that parallel would leave the fort of the hudsons bay company at pembina within the territory of the united states this information be communicate to the british government i be request to consent and do consent that the british occupation of the fort of the hudsons bay company should continue for the present i deem it important however that this part of the boundary line should be definitely fix by a joint commission of the two government and i submit herewith estimate of the expense of such a commission on the part of the united states and recommend that an appropriation be make for that purpose the land boundary have already be fix and mark from the summit of the rocky mountains to the georgian bay it should now be in like manner mark from the lake of the woods to the summit of the rocky mountains i regret to say that no conclusion have be reach for the adjustment of the claim against great britain grow out of the course adopt by that government during the rebellion the cabinet of london so far as its view have be express do not appear to be willing to concede that her majesty 's government be guilty of any negligence or do or permit any act during the war by which the united states have just cause of complaint our firm and unalterable conviction be directly the reverse i therefore recommend to congress to authorize the appointment of a commission to take proof of the amount and the ownership of these several claim on notice to the representative of her majesty at washington and that authority be give for the settlement of these claim by the united states so that the government shall have the ownership of the private claim as well as the responsible control of all the demand against great britain it can not be necessary to add that whenever her majesty 's government shall entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claim the united states will enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for a conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both nation the course pursue by the canadian authority toward the fisherman of the united states during the past season have not be mark by a friendly feeling by the first article of the convention of 1818 between great britain and the united states it be agree that the inhabitant of the united states should have forever in common with british subject the right of take fish in certain water therein define in the water not include in the limit name in the convention within 3 mile of part of the british coast it have be the custom for many year to give to intrude fisherman of the united states a reasonable warning of their violation of the technical right of great britain the imperial government be understand to have delegate the whole or a share of its jurisdiction or control of these inshore fishing ground to the colonial authority know as the dominion of canada and this semi independent but irresponsible agent have exercise its delegate power in an unfriendly way vessel have be seize without notice or warning in violation of the custom previously prevail and have be take into the colonial port their voyage break up and the vessel condemn there be reason to believe that this unfriendly and vexatious treatment be design to bear harshly upon the hardy fisherman of the united states with a view to political effect upon this government the statute of the dominion of canada assume a still broad and more untenable jurisdiction over the vessel of the united states they authorize officer or person to bring vessel hover within 3 marine mile of any of the coast bay creek or harbor of canada into port to search the cargo to examine the master on oath touch the cargo and voyage and to inflict upon he a heavy pecuniary penalty if true answer be not give and if such a vessel be find prepare to fish within 3 marine mile of any of such coast bay creek or harbor without a license or after the expiration of the period name in the last license grant to it they provide that the vessel with her tackle etc shall be forfeit it be not know that any condemnation have be make under this statute should the authority of canada attempt to enforce it it will become my duty to take such step as may be necessary to protect the right of the citizen of the united states it have be claim by her majesty 's officer that the fishing vessel of the united states have no right to enter the open port of the british possession in north america except for the purpose of shelter and repair damage of purchase wood and obtain water that they have no right to enter at the british custom house or to trade there except in the purchase of wood and water and that they must depart within twenty four hour after notice to leave it be not know that any seizure of a fishing vessel carry the flag of the united states have be make under this claim so far as the claim be found on an alleged construction of he convention of 1818 it can not be acquiesce in by the united states it be hope that it will not be insist on by her majesty 's government during the conference which precede the negotiation of the convention of 1818 the british commissioner propose to expressly exclude the fisherman of the united states from the privilege of carry on trade with any of his britannic majesty 's subject reside within the limit assign for their use and also that it should not be lawful for the vessel of the united states engage in say fishery to have on board any good ware or merchandise whatever except such as may be necessary for the prosecution of their voyage to and from the say fishing ground and any vessel of the united states which shall contravene this regulation may be seize condemn and confiscate with her cargo "this proposition which be identical with the construction now put upon the language of the convention be emphatically reject by the american commissioner and thereupon be abandon by the british plenipotentiary and article i as it stand in the convention be substitute if however it be say that this claim be found on provincial or colonial statute and not upon the convention this government can not but regard they as unfriendly and in contravention of the spirit if not of the letter of the treaty for the faithful execution of which the imperial government be alone responsible anticipate that an attempt may possibly be make by the canadian authority in the come season to repeat their unneighborly act toward our fisherman i recommend you to confer upon the executive the power to suspend by proclamation the operation of the law authorize the transit of good ware and merchandise in bond across the territory of the united states to canada and far should such an extreme measure become necessary to suspend the operation of any law whereby the vessel of the dominion of canada be permit to enter the water of the united states a like unfriendly disposition have be manifest on the part of canada in the maintenance of a claim of right to exclude the citizen of the united states from the navigation of the st. lawrence this river constitute a natural outlet to the ocean for eight states with an aggregate population of about 17,600,000 inhabitant and with an aggregate tonnage of 661,367 ton upon the water which discharge into it the foreign commerce of our port on these water be open to british competition and the major part of it be do in british bottom if the american seaman be exclude from this natural avenue to the ocean the monopoly of the direct commerce of the lake port with the atlantic would be in foreign hand their vessel on transatlantic voyage have an access to our lake port which would be deny to american vessel on similar voyage to state such a proposition be to refute its justice during the administration of mr. john quincy adams mr. clay unanswerably demonstrate the natural right of the citizen of the united states to the navigation of this river claim that the act of the congress of vienna in open the rhine and other river to all nation show the judgment of european jurist and statesman that the inhabitant of a country through which a navigable river pass have a natural right to enjoy the navigation of that river to and into the sea even though pass through the territory of another power this right do not exclude the coequal right of the sovereign possess the territory through which the river debouch into the sea to make such regulation relative to the police of the navigation as may be reasonably necessary but those regulation should be frame in a liberal spirit of comity and should not impose needless burden upon the commerce which have the right of transit it have be find in practice more advantageous to arrange these regulation by mutual agreement the united states be ready to make any reasonable arrangement as to the police of the st. lawrence which may be suggest by great britain if the claim make by mr. clay be just when the population of states border on the shore of the lakes be only 3,400,000 it now derive great force and equity from the increase population wealth production and tonnage of the states on the canadian frontier since mr. clay advance his argument in behalf of our right the principle for which he contend have be frequently and by various nation recognize by law or by treaty and have be extend to several other great river by the treaty conclude at mayence in 1831 the rhine be declare free from the point where it be first navigable into the sea by the convention between spain and portugal conclude in 1835 the navigation of the douro throughout its whole extent be make free for the subject of both crowns in 1853 the argentine confederation by treaty throw open the free navigation of the parana and the uruguay to the merchant vessel of all nation in 1856 the crimean war be close by a treaty which provide for the free navigation of the danube in 1858 bolivia by treaty declare that it regard the river amazon and la plata in accordance with fix principle of national law as highway or channel open by nature for the commerce of all nation in 1859 the paraguay be make free by treaty and in december 1866 the emperor of brazil by imperial decree declare the amazon to be open to the frontier of brazil to the merchant ship of all nation the great living british authority on this subject while assert the abstract right of the british claim say it seem difficult to deny that great britain may ground her refusal upon strict law but it be equally difficult to deny first that in so do she exercise harshly an extreme and hard law secondly that her conduct with respect to the navigation of the st. lawrence be in glare and discreditable inconsistency with her conduct with respect to the navigation of the mississippi on the ground that she possess a small domain in which the mississippi take its rise she insist on the right to navigate the entire volume of its water on the ground that she possess both bank of the st. lawrence where it disembogue itself into the sea she deny to the united states the right of navigation though about one half of the water of lakes ontario erie huron and superior and the whole of lake michigan through which the river flow be the property of the united states the whole nation be interested in secure cheap transportation from the agricultural states of the west to the atlantic seaboard to the citizen of those states it secure a great return for their labor to the inhabitant of the seaboard it afford cheap food to the nation an increase in the annual surplus of wealth it be hope that the government of great britain will see the justice of abandon the narrow and inconsistent claim to which her canadian provinces have urge her adherence our depressed commerce be a subject to which i call your special attention at the last session and suggest that we will in the future have to look more to the country south of we and to china and japan for its revival our representative to all these government have exert their influence to encourage trade between the united states and the country to which they be accredit but the fact exist that the carrying be do almost entirely in foreign bottom and while this state of affair exist we can not control our due share of the commerce of the world that between the pacific states and china and japan be about all the carry trade now conduct in american vessel i would recommend a liberal policy toward that line of american steamer one that will insure its success and even increase usefulness the cost of build iron vessel the only one that can compete with foreign ship in the carry trade be so much great in the united states than in foreign country that without some assistance from the government they can not be successfully build here there will be several proposition lay before congress in the course of the present session look to a remedy for this evil even if it should be at some cost to the national treasury i hope such encouragement will be give as will secure american shipping on the high sea and american shipbuilding at home the condition of the archive at the department of state call for the early action of congress the building now rent by that department be a frail structure at an inconvenient distance from the executive mansion and from the other departments be ill adapt to the purpose for which it be use have not capacity to accommodate the archive and be not fireproof its remote situation its slender construction and the absence of a supply of water in the neighborhood leave but little hope of safety for either the building or its content in case of the accident of a fire its destruction would involve the loss of the roll contain the original act and resolution of congress of the historic record of the revolution and of the confederation of the whole series of diplomatic and consular archive since the adoption of the constitution and of the many other valuable record and paper leave with that department when it be the principal depository of the governmental archive i recommend an appropriation for the construction of a building for the department of state i recommend to your consideration the propriety of transfer to the department of the interior to which they seem more appropriately to belong all power and duty in relation to the territories with which the department of state be now charge by law or usage and from the interior department to the war department the pension bureau so far as it regulate the payment of soldier pension i would far recommend that the payment of naval pension be transfer to one of the bureaus of the navy department the estimate for the expense of the government for the next fiscal year be $ 18,244,346.01 less than for the current one but exceed the appropriation for the present year for the same item $ 8,972,127.56 in this estimate however be include $ 22,338,278.37 for public work heretofore begin under congressional provision and of which only so much be ask as congress may choose to give the appropriation for the same work for the present fiscal year be $ 11,984,518.08.the average value of gold as compare with national currency for the whole of the year 1869 be about 134 and for eleven month of 1870 the same relative value have be about 115 the approach to a specie basis be very gratifying but the fact can not be deny that the instability of the value of our currency be prejudicial to our prosperity and tend to keep up price to the detriment of trade the evil of a depreciated and fluctuate currency be so great that now when the premium on gold have fall so much it would seem that the time have arrive when by wise and prudent legislation congress should look to a policy which would place our currency at par with gold at no distant day the tax collect from the people have be reduce more than $ 80,000,000 per annum by steadiness in our present course there be no reason why in a few short year the national tax gatherer may not disappear from the door of the citizen almost entirely with the revenue stamp dispense by postmaster in every community a tax upon liquor of all sort and tobacco in all its form and by a wise adjustment of the tariff which will put a duty only upon those article which we could dispense with know as luxury and on those which we use more of than we produce revenue enough may be raise after a few year of peace and consequent reduction of indebtedness to fulfill all our obligation a further reduction of expense in addition to a reduction of interest account may be rely on to make this practicable revenue reform if it mean this have my hearty support if it imply a collection of all the revenue for the support of the government for the payment of principal and interest of the public debt pension etc by directly tax the people then i be against revenue reform and confidently believe the people be with i if it mean failure to provide the necessary mean to defray all the expense of government and thereby repudiation of the public debt and pension then i be still more opposed to such kind of revenue reform revenue reform have not be define by any of its advocate to my knowledge but seem to be accept as something which be to supply every man 's want without any cost or effort on his part a true revenue reform can not be make in a day but must be the work of national legislation and of time as soon as the revenue can be dispense with all duty should be remove from coffee tea and other article of universal use not produce by ourselves the necessity of the country compel we to collect revenue from our import an army of assessor and collector be not a pleasant sight to the citizen but that of a tariff for revenue be necessary such a tariff so far as it act as an encouragement to home production afford employment to labor at live wage in contrast to the pauper labor of the old world and also in the development of home resource under the act of congress of the 15th day of july 1870 the army have gradually be reduce so that on the 1st day of january 1871 the number of commission officer and man will not exceed the number contemplate by that law the war department building be an old structure not fireproof and entirely inadequate in dimension to our present want many thousand of dollar be now pay annually for rent of private building to accommodate the various bureaus of the department i recommend an appropriation for a new war department building suit to the present and grow want of the nation the report of the secretary of war show a very satisfactory reduction in the expense of the army for the last fiscal year for detail you be refer to his accompany report the expense of the navy for the whole of the last year i.e from december 1 1869 the date of the last report be less than $ 19,000,000 or about $ 1,000,000 less than they be the previous year the expense since the commencement of this fiscal year i.e since july 1 -show for the five month a decrease of over $ 2,400,000 from those of the corresponding month last year the estimate for the current year be $ 28,205,671.37 those for next year be $ 20,683,317 with $ 955,100 additional for necessary permanent improvement these estimate be make closely for the mere maintenance of the naval establishment as now be without much in the nature of permanent improvement the appropriation make for the last and current year be evidently intend by congress and be sufficient only to keep the navy on its present footing by the repair and refit of our old ship this policy must of course gradually but surely destroy the navy and it be in itself far from economical as each year that it be pursue the necessity for mere repair in ship and navy yard become more imperative and more costly and our current expense be annually increase for the mere repair of ship many of which must soon become unsafe and useless i hope during the present session of congress to be able to submit to it a plan by which naval vessel can be build and repair make with great saving upon the present cost it can hardly be wise statesmanship in a government which represent a country with over 5,000 mile of coast line on both ocean exclusive of alaska and contain 40,000,000 progressive people with relation of every nature with almost every foreign country to rest with such inadequate mean of enforce any foreign policy either of protection or redress separate by the ocean from the nation of the eastern continent our navy be our only mean of direct protection to our citizen abroad or for the enforcement of any foreign policy the accompanying report of the postmaster general show a most satisfactory working of that department with the adoption of the recommendation contain therein particularly those relate to a reform in the franking privilege and the adoption of the correspondence card a self sustain postal system may speedily be look for and at no distant day a further reduction of the rate of postage be attain i recommend authorization by congress to the postmaster general and attorney general to issue all commission to official appoint through their respective department at present these commission where appointment be presidential be issue by the state department the law in all the departments of government except those of the post office and of justice authorize each to issue its own commission always favor practical reform i respectfully call your attention to one abuse of long standing which i would like to see remedied by this congress it be a reform in the civil service of the country i would have it go beyond the mere fixing of the tenure of office of clerk and employee who do not require the advice and consent of the senate to make their appointment complete i would have it govern not the tenure but the manner of make all appointment there be no duty which so much embarrass the executive and head of departments as that of appointment nor be there any such arduous and thankless labor impose on senators and representatives as that of find place for constituent the present system do not secure the good man and often not even fit man for public place the elevation and purification of the civil service of the government will be hail with approval by the whole people of the united states reform in the management of indian affair have receive the special attention of the administration from its inauguration to the present day the experiment of make it a missionary work be try with a few agency give to the denomination of friend and have be find to work most advantageously all agency and superintendencie not so disposed of be give to officer of the army the act of congress reduce the army render army officer ineligible for civil position indian agency be civil office i determine to give all the agency to such religious denomination as have heretofore establish missionary among the indians and perhaps to some other denomination who would undertake the work on the same term i.e. as a missionary work the society select be allow to name their own agent subject to the approval of the executive and be expect to watch over they and aid they as missionary to christianize and civilize the indian and to train he in the art of peace the government watch over the official act of these agent and require of they as strict an accountability as if they be appoint in any other manner i entertain the confident hope that the policy now pursue will in a few year bring all the indians upon reservation where they will live in house and have schoolhouse and church and will be pursue peaceful and self sustain avocation and where they may be visit by the law abide white man with the same impunity that he now visit the civilized white settlement i call your special attention to the report of the commissioner of indian affairs for full information on this subject during the last fiscal year 8,095,413 acre of public land be dispose of of this quantity 3,698,910.05 acre be take under the homestead law and 2,159,515.81 acre sell for cash the remainder be locate with military warrant college or indian scrip or apply in satisfaction of grant to railroad or for other public use the entry under the homestead law during the last year cover 961,545 acre more than those during the precede year survey have be vigorously prosecute to the full extent of the mean applicable to the purpose the quantity of land in market will amply supply the present demand the claim of the settler under the homestead or the preemption law be not however limit to land subject to sale at private entry any unappropriated survey public land may to a limited amount be acquire under the former law if the party entitle to enter under they will comply with the requirement they prescribe in regard to the residence and cultivation the actual settler 's preference right of purchase be even broad and extend to land which be unsurveye at the time of his settlement his right be formerly confine within much narrow limit and at one period of our history be confer only by special statute they be enact from time to time to legalize what be then regard as an unauthorized intrusion upon the national domain the opinion that the public land should be regard chiefly as a source of revenue be no long maintain the rapid settlement and successful cultivation of they be now justly consider of more importance to our well being than be the fund which the sale of they would produce the remarkable growth and prosperity of our new states and territories attest the wisdom of the legislation which invite the tiller of the soil to secure a permanent home on term within the reach of all the pioneer who incur the danger and privation of a frontier life and thus aid in lay the foundation of new commonwealth render a signal service to his country and be entitle to its special favor and protection these law secure that object and largely promote the general welfare they should therefore be cherish as a permanent feature of our land system good faith require we to give full effect to exist grant the time honor and beneficent policy of set apart certain section of public land for educational purpose in the new states should be continue when ample provision shall have be make for these object i submit as a question worthy of serious consideration whether the residue of our national domain should not be wholly dispose of under the provision the homestead and preemption law in addition to the swamp and overflow land grant to the states in which they be situate the land take under the agricultural college act and for internal improvement purpose under the act of september 1841 and the act supplemental thereto there have be convey up to the close of the last fiscal year by patent or other equivalent title to states and corporation 27,836,257.63 acre for railway canal and wagon road it be estimate that an additional quantity of 174,735,523 acre be still due under grant for like use the policy of thus aid the states in build work of internal improvement be inaugurate more than forty year since in the grant to indiana and illinois to aid those states in open canal to connect the water of the wabash with those of lake erie and the water of the illinois with those of lake michigan it be follow with some modification in the grant to illinois of alternate section of public land within certain limit of the illinois central railway fourteen states and sundry corporation have receive similar subsidy in connection with railway complete or in process of construction as the reserved section be rate at the double minimum the sale of they at the enhance price have thus in many instance indemnify the treasury for the grant land the construction of some of these thoroughfare have undoubtedly give a vigorous impulse to the development of our resource and the settlement of the more distant portion of the country it may however be well insist that much of our legislation in this regard have be characterize by indiscriminate and profuse liberality the united states should not loan their credit in aid of any enterprise undertake by state or corporation nor grant land in any instance unless the project work be of acknowledge national importance i be strongly inclined to the opinion that it be inexpedient and unnecessary to bestow subsidy of either description but should congress determine otherwise i earnestly recommend that the right of settler and of the public be more effectually secure and protect by appropriate legislation during the year end september 30 1870 there be file in the patent office 19,411 application for patent 3,374 caveat and 160 application for the extension of patent thirteen thousand six hundred and twenty two patent include reissue and design be issue 1,010 extend and 1,089 allow but not issue by reason of the nonpayment of the final fee the receipt of the office during the year be $ 136,304.29 in excess of its expenditure the work of the census bureau have be energetically prosecute the preliminary report contain much information of special value and interest will be ready for delivery during the present session the remain volume will be complete with all the dispatch consistent with perfect accuracy in arrange and classify the return we shall thus at no distant day be furnish with an authentic record of our condition and resource it will i doubt not attest the grow prosperity of the country although during the decade which have just close it be so severely try by the great war wage to maintain its integrity and to secure and perpetuate our free institution during the last fiscal year the sum pay to pensioner include the cost of disbursement be $ 27,780,811.11 and 1,758 bounty land warrant be issue at its close 198,686 name be on the pension roll the labor of the pension office have be direct to the severe scrutiny of the evidence submit in favor of new claim and to the discovery of fictitious claim which have be heretofore allow the appropriation for the employment of special agent for the investigation of fraud have be judiciously use and the result obtain have be of unquestionable benefit to the service the subject of education and agriculture be of great interest to the success of our republican institution happiness and grandeur as a nation in the interest of one a bureau have be establish in the interior department the bureau of education and in the interest of the other a separate department that of agriculture i believe great general good be to flow from the operation of both these bureaus if properly foster i can not commend to your careful consideration too highly the report of the commissioners of education and of agriculture nor urge too strongly such liberal legislation as to secure their efficiency in conclusion i would sum up the policy of the administration to be a thorough enforcement of every law a faithful collection of every tax provide for economy in the disbursement of the same a prompt payment of every debt of the nation a reduction of taxis as rapidly as the requirement of the country will admit reduction of taxation and tariff to be so arrange as to afford the great relief to the great number honest and fair dealing with all other people to the end that war with all its blight consequence may be avoid but without surrender any right or obligation due to we a reform in the treatment of indians and in the whole civil service of the country and finally in secure a pure untrammeled ballot where every man entitle to cast a vote may do so just once at each election without fear of molestation or proscription on account of his political faith nativity of color

 the union of the states of germany into a form of government similar in many respect to that of the american union be an event that can not fail to touch deeply the sympathy of the people of the united states
 this union have be bring about by the long continue persistent effort of the people with the deliberate approval of the government and people of twenty four of the german states through their regularly constitute representative
 in it the american people see an attempt to reproduce in europe some of the good feature of our own constitution with such modification as the history and condition of germany seem to require the local government of the several member of the union be preserve while the power confer upon the chief impart strength for the purpose of self defense without authority to enter upon war of conquest and ambition
 the cherished aspiration for national unity which for age have inspire the many million of people speak the same language inhabit a contiguous and compact territory but unnaturally separate and divide by dynastic jealousy and the ambition of short sighted ruler have be attain and germany now contain a population of about 34,000,000 united like our own under one government for its relation with other power but retain in its several member the right and power of control of their local interest habit and institution
 the bringing of great masse of thoughtful and free people under a single government must tend to make government what alone they should be the representative of the will and the organization of the power of the people
 the adoption in europe of the american system of union under the control and direction of a free people educate to self restraint can not fail to extend popular institution and to enlarge the peaceful influence of american idea
 the relation of the united states with germany be intimate and cordial the commercial intercourse between the two country be extensive and be increase from year to year and the large number of citizen and resident in the united states of german extraction and the continued flow of emigration thence to this country have produce an intimacy of personal and political intercourse approach if not equal to that with the country from which the founder of our government derive their origin
 the extent of these interest and the greatness of the german union seem to require that in the classification of the representative of this government to foreign power there should no long be an apparent undervaluation of the importance of the german mission such as be make in the difference between the compensation allow by law to the minister to germany and those to great britain and france there would seem to be a great propriety in place the representative of this government at berlin on the same footing with that of its representative at london and paris the union of the several states of germany under one government and the increase commercial and personal intercourse between the two country will also add to the labor and the responsibility of the legation
 i therefore recommend that the salary of the minister and of the secretary of legation at berlin be respectively increase to the same amount as be allow to those at london and paris

to the senate and house of representatives
 i have this day transmit to the senate the announcement that senate bill no 218 an act prescribe an oath of office to be take by person who participate in the late rebellion but who be not disqualify from hold office by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states have become a law in the manner prescribe by the constitution without the signature of the president
 if this be a bill for the repeal of the test oath require of person select or appoint to office of honor or trust it would meet my approval the effect of the law however be to relieve from take a prescribed oath all those person whom it be intend to exclude from such office and to require it from all other by this law the soldier who fight and bleed for his country be to swear to his loyalty before assume official function while the general who command host for the overthrow of his government be admit to place without it i can not affix my name to a law which discriminate against the upholder of his government
 i believe however that it be not wise policy to keep from office by an oath those who be not disqualify by the constitution and who be the choice of legal voter but while relieve they from an oath which they can not take i recommend the release also of those to whom the oath have no application

no conflict interest of individual or of jurisdiction be likely to interfere to the delay or embarrassment of the actual location of the line if defer until population shall enter and occupy the territory some trivial contest of neighbor may again array the two government in antagonism i therefore recommend the appointment of a commission to act jointly with one that may be appoint on the part of great britain to determine the line between our territory of alaska and the conterminous possession of great britain in my last annual message i recommend the legislation necessary on the part of the united states to bring into operation the article of the treaty of washington of may 8 1871 relate to the fishery and to other matter touch the relation of the united states toward the british north american possession to become operative so soon as the proper legislation should be have on the part of great britain and its possession that legislation on the part of great britain and its possession have not then be have and during the session of congress a question be raise which for the time raise a doubt whether any action by congress in the direction indicate would become important this question have since be dispose of and i have receive notice that the imperial parliament and the legislature of the provincial government have pass law to carry the provision of the treaty on the matter refer to into operation i therefore recommend your early adoption of the legislation in the same direction necessary on the part of this government the joint commission for determine the boundary line between the united states and the british possession between the lake of the woods and the rocky mountains have organize and enter upon its work it be desirable that the force be increase in order that the completion of the survey and determination of the line may be the soon attain to this end i recommend that a sufficient appropriation be make with france our early ally russia the constant and steady friend of the united states germany with whose government and people we have so many cause of friendship and so many common sympathy and the other power of europe our relation be maintain on the most friendly term since my last annual message the exchange have be make of the ratification of a treaty with the austro hungarian empire relate to naturalization also of a treaty with the german empire respect consul and trade mark also of a treaty with sweden and norway relate to naturalization all of which treaty have be duly proclaim congress at its last session having make an appropriation to defray the expense of commissioner on the part of the united states to the international statistical congress at st. petersburg the person appoint in that character proceed to their destination and attend the session of the congress their report shall in due season be lay before you this congress meet at interval of about three year and have hold its session in several of the country of europe i submit to your consideration the propriety of extend an invitation to the congress to hold its next meeting in the united states the centennial celebration to be hold in 1876 would afford an appropriate occasion for such meeting preparation be make for the international exposition to be hold during the next year in vienna on a scale of very great magnitude the tendency of these exposition be in the direction of advanced civilization and of the elevation of industry and of labor and of the increase of human happiness as well as of great intercourse and good will between nation as this exposition be to be the first which will have be hold in eastern europe it be believe that american inventor and manufacturer will be ready to avail themselves of the opportunity for the presentation of their production if encourage by proper aid and protection at the last session of congress authority be give for the appointment of one or more agent to represent this government at the exposition the authority thus give have be exercise but in the absence of any appropriation there be danger that the important benefit which the occasion offer will in a large degree be lose to citizen of the united states i commend the subject strongly to your consideration and recommend that an adequate appropriation be make for the purpose to far aid american exhibitor at the vienna exposition i would recommend in addition to an appropriation of money that the secretary of the navy be authorize to fit up two naval vessel to transport between our atlantic city and trieste or the most convenient port to vienna and back their article for exhibition since your last session the president of the mexican republic distinguish by his high character and by his service to his country have die his temporary successor have now be elect with great unanimity by the people a proof of confidence on their part in his patriotism and wisdom which it be believe will be confirm by the result of his administration it be particularly desirable that nothing should be leave undo by the government of either republic to strengthen their relation as neighbor and friend it be much to be regret that many lawless act continue to disturb the quiet of the settlement on the border between our territory and that of mexico and that complaint of wrong to american citizen in various part of the country be make the revolutionary condition in which the neighboring republic have so long be involve have in some degree contribute to this disturbance it be to be hope that with a more settle rule of order through the republic which may be expect from the present government the act of which just complaint be make will cease the proceeding of the commission under the convention with mexico of the 4th of july 1868 on the subject of claim have unfortunately be check by an obstacle for the removal of which measure have be take by the two government which it be believe will prove successful the commissioner appoint pursuant to the joint resolution of congress of the 7th of may last to inquire into depredation on the texan frontier have diligently make investigation in that quarter their report upon the subject will be communicate to you their research be necessarily incomplete partly on account of the limited appropriation make by congress mexico on the part of that government have appoint a similar commission to investigate these outrage it be not announce officially but the press of that country state that the full investigation be desire and that the cooperation of all party concern be invite to secure that end i therefore recommend that a special appropriation be make at the early day practicable to enable the commissioner on the part of the united states to return to their labor without delay it be with regret that i have again to announce a continuance of the disturb condition of the island of cuba no advance toward the pacification of the discontent part of the population have be make while the insurrection have gain no advantage and exhibit no more of the element of power or of the prospect of ultimate success than be exhibit a year ago spain on the other hand have not succeed in its repression and the party stand apparently in the same relative attitude which they have occupy for a long time past this contest have last now for more than four year be its scene at a distance from our neighborhood we might be indifferent to its result although humanity could not be unmove by many of its incident wherever they might occur it be however at our door i can not doubt that the continue maintenance of slavery in cuba be among the strong inducement to the continuance of this strife a terrible wrong be the natural cause of a terrible evil the abolition of slavery and the introduction of other reform in the administration of government in cuba could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order it be greatly to be hope that the present liberal government of spain will voluntarily adopt this view the law of emancipation which be pass more than two year since have remain unexecuted in the absence of regulation for its enforcement it be but a feeble step toward emancipation but it be the recognition of right and be hail as such and exhibit spain in harmony with sentiment of humanity and of justice and in sympathy with the other power of the christian and civilized world within the past few week the regulation for carry out the law of emancipation have be announce give evidence of the sincerity of intention of the present government to carry into effect the law of 1870 i have not fail to urge the consideration of the wisdom the policy and the justice of a more effective system for the abolition of the great evil which oppress a race and continue a bloody and destructive contest close to our border as well as the expediency and the justice of concede reform of which the propriety be not question deeply impressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery be one of the most active cause of the continuance of the unhappy condition in cuba i regret to believe that citizen of the united states or those claim to be such be large holder in cuba of what be there claim as property but which be forbid and denounce by the law of the united states they be thus in defiance of the spirit of our own law contribute to the continuance of this distressing and sickening contest in my last annual message i refer to this subject and i again recommend such legislation as may be proper to denounce and if not prevent at least to discourage american citizen from hold or deal in slave it be gratify to announce that the ratification of the convention conclude under the auspex of this government between spain on the one part and the allied republics of the pacific on the other provide for an armistice have be exchange a copy of the instrument be herewith submit it be hope that this may be follow by a permanent peace between the same party the difference which at one time threaten the maintenance of peace between brazil and the argentine republic it be hope be in the way of satisfactory adjustment with these states as with the republics of central and of south america we continue to maintain the most friendly relation it be with regret however i announce that the government of venezuela have make no further payment on account of the award under the convention of the 25th of april 1866 that republic be understand to be now almost if not quite tranquilize it be hope therefore that it will lose no time in provide for the unpaid balance of its debt to the united states which having originate in injury to our citizen by venezuelan authority and having be acknowledge pursuant to a treaty in the most solemn form know among nation would seem to deserve a preference over debt of a different origin and contract in a different manner this subject be again recommend to the attention of congress for such action as may be deem proper our treaty relation with japan remain unchanged an impose embassy from that interesting and progressive nation visit this country during the year that be pass but be unprovide with power for the signing of a convention in this country no conclusion in that direction be reach it be hope however that the interchange of opinion which take place during their stay in this country have lead to a mutual appreciation of the interest which may be promote when the revision of the exist treaty shall be undertake in this connection i renew my recommendation of one year ago that to give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic relation with japan and china and to further aid in retain the good opinion of those people and to secure to the united states its share of the commerce destine to flow between those nation and the balance of the commercial world an appropriation be make to support at least four american youth in each of those country to serve as a part of the official family of our minister there our representative would not even then be place upon an equality with the representative of great britain and of some other power as now situate our representative in japan and china have to depend for interpreter and translator upon native of those country who know our language imperfectly or procure for the occasion the service of employee in foreign business house or the interpreter to other foreign minister i renew the recommendation make on a previous occasion of the transfer to the department of the interior to which they seem more appropriately to belong of all the power and duty in relation to the territories with which the department of state be now charge by law or by custom congress from the beginning of the government have wisely make provision for the relief of distressed seaman in foreign country no similar provision however have hitherto be make for the relief of citizen in distress abroad other than seaman it be understand to be customary with other government to authorize consul to extend such relief to their citizen or subject in certain case a similar authority and an appropriation to carry it into effect be recommend in the case of citizen of the united states destitute or sick under such circumstance it be well know that such citizen resort to foreign country in great number though most of they be able to bear the expense incident to locomotion there be some who through accident or otherwise become penniless and have no friend at home able to succor they person in this situation must either perish cast themselves upon the charity of foreigner or be relieve at the private charge of our own officer who usually even with the most benevolent disposition have nothing to spare for such purpose should the authority and appropriation ask for be grant care will be take so to carry the beneficence of congress into effect that it shall not be unnecessarily or unworthily bestow treasury .the money receive and cover into the treasury during the fiscal year end june 30 1872 be from customs$216,370,286.77from sale

to various enterprise for the more certain and cheap transportation of the constantly increase surplus of western and southern product to the atlantic seaboard the subject be one that will force

they be not only of national interest but that when complete they will be of a value commensurate with their cost that production increase more rapidly than the mean of transportation in our country have be demonstrate by past experience that the unprecedented growth in population and product of the whole country will require additional facility and cheap one for the more bulky article of commerce to reach tide water and a market will be demand in the near future be equally demonstrable i would therefore suggest either a committee or a commission to be authorize to consider this whole question and to report to congress at some future day for its well guidance in legislate on this important subject the railroad of the country have be rapidly extend during the last few year to meet the grow demand of producer and reflect much credit upon the capitalist and manager engage in their construction in addition to these a project to facilitate commerce by the building of a ship canal around niagara falls on the united states side which have be agitate for many year will no doubt be call to your attention at this session look to the great future growth of the country and the increase demand of commerce it might be well while on this subject not only to have examine and report upon the various practicable route for connect the mississippi with tide water on the atlantic but the feasibility of an almost continuous landlocked navigation from maine to the gulf of mexico such a route along our coast would be of great value at all time and of inestimable value in ease of a foreign war nature have provide the great part of this route and the obstacle to overcome be easily within the skill of the engineer i have not allude to this subject with the view of have any further expenditure of public money at this time than may be necessary to procure and place all the necessary information before congress in an authentic form to enable it hereafter if deem practicable and worthy to legislate on the subject without delay navy department the report of the secretary of the navy herewith accompany explain fully the condition of that branch of the public service its want and deficiency expense incur during the past year and appropriation for the same it also give a complete history of the service of the navy for the past year in addition to its

progressive business people like ours penetrate and form business relation with every part of the known world a navy strong enough to command the respect of our flag abroad be necessary for the full protection of their right i recommend careful consideration by congress of the recommendation make by the secretary of the navy post office department the accompanying report of the postmaster general

advantageous footing by the improved postal convention and arrangement recently conclude with the lead commercial country of europe and america and the gratifying statement be make that with the conclusion of a satisfactory convention with france the detail of which have be definitely agree to by the head of the french postal department subject to the approval of the minister of finance little remain to be accomplish by treaty for some time to come with respect either to reduction of rate or improved facility of postal intercourse your favorable consideration be respectfully invite to the recommendation make by the postmaster general for an increase of service from monthly to semimonthly trip on the mail steamship route to brazil for a subsidy in aid of the establishment of an american line of mail steamer between san francisco new zealand and australia for the establishment of post office saving bank and for the increase of the salary of the head of bureau i have heretofore recommend the abolition of the franking privilege and see no reason now for change my view on that subject it not having be favorably regard by congress however i now suggest a modification of that privilege to correct its glaring and costly abuse i would recommend also the appointment of a committee or commission to take into consideration the good method equitable to private corporation who have invest their time and capital in the establishment of telegraph line of acquire the title to all telegraph line now in operation and of connect this service with the postal service of the nation it be not probable that this subject could receive the proper consideration during the limit of a short session of congress but it may be initiate so that future action may be fair to the government and to private party concern there be but three line of ocean steamer namely the pacific mail steamship company between san francisco china and japan with provision make for semimonthly service after october 1 1873 the united states and brazil line monthly and the california new zealand and australian line monthly ply between the united states and foreign port and own and operate under our flag i earnestly recommend that such liberal contract for carry the mail be authorize with these line as will insure their continuance if the expediency of extend the aid of government to line of steamer which hitherto have not receive it should be deem worthy of the consideration of congress political and commercial object make it advisable to bestow such aid on a line under our flag between panama and the western south american port by this mean much trade now divert to other country might be bring to we to the mutual advantage of this country and those lie in that quarter of the continent of america the report of the secretary of the treasury will show an alarm fall off in our carrying trade for the last ten or twelve year and even for the past year i do not believe that public treasure can be well expend in the interest of the whole people than in try to recover this trade an expenditure of $ 5,000,000 per annum for the next five year if it would restore to we our proportion of the carry trade of the world would be profitably expend the price of labor in europe have so much enhance within the last few year that the cost of building and operating ocean steamer in the united states be not so much great than in europe and i believe the time have arrive for congress to take this subject into serious consideration department of justice detailed statement of the disbursement through the department of justice will be furnish by the report of the attorney general and though these have be somewhat increase by the recent act of congress to enforce the right of citizen of the united states to vote in the several states of the union and to enforce the provision of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states and the amendment thereto i can not question the necessity and salutary effect of those enactment reckless and lawless man i regret to say have associate themselves together in some locality to deprive other citizen of those right guarantee to they by the constitution of the united states and to that end have commit deed of blood and violence but the prosecution and punishment of many of these person have tend greatly to the repression of such disorder i do not doubt that a great majority of the people in all part of the country favor the full enjoyment by all class of person of those right to which they be entitle under the constitution and law and i invoke the aid and influence of all good citizen to prevent organization whose object be by unlawful mean to interfere with those right i look with confidence to the time not far distant when the obvious advantage of good order and peace will induce an abandonment of all combination prohibit by the act refer to and when it will be unnecessary to carry on prosecution or inflict punishment to protect citizen from the lawless doing of such combination application have be make to i to pardon person convict of a violation of say act upon the ground that clemency in such case would tend to tranquilize the public mind and to test the virtue of that policy i be dispose as far as my sense of justice will permit to give to these application a favorable consideration but any action thereon be not to be construe as indicate any change in my determination to enforce with vigor such act so long as the conspiracy and combination therein name disturb the peace of the country it be much to be regret and be regret by no one more than myself that a necessity have ever exist to execute the enforcement act no one can desire more than i that the necessity of apply it may never again be demand interior department the secretary of the interior report satisfactory improvement and progress in each of the several bureau under the control of the interior department they be all in excellent condition the work which in some of they for some year have be in arrear have be bring down to a recent date and in all the current business be be promptly

form of government be one of great importance as a complement of the exist indian policy the question of removal to that territory have within the past year be present to many of the tribe resident upon other and less desirable portion of the public domain and have generally be receive by they with favor as a preliminary step to the organization of such a territory it will be necessary to confine the indians now resident therein to farm of proper size which should be secure to they in fee the residue to be use for the settlement of other friendly indians effort will be make in the immediate future to induce the removal of as many peaceably dispose indians to the indian territory as can be settle properly without disturb the harmony of those already there there be no other location now available where a people who be endeavor to acquire a knowledge of pastoral and agricultural pursuit can be as well accommodate as upon the unoccupied land in the indian territory a

add an estimate amount of $ 750,000 per annum to the roll without increase the number of pensioner we can not therefore look for any substantial decrease in the expenditure of this department for some time to come or so long as congress continue to so change the rate of pension the whole number of soldier enlist in the war of the rebellion be 2,688,523 the total number of claim for invalid pension

census be about complete its early completion be a subject of congratulation inasmuch as the use to be make of the statistic therein contain depend very greatly on the promptitude of publication the secretary of the interior recommend that a census be take in 1875 which recommendation should receive the early attention of congress the interval at present establish between the federal census be so long that the information obtain at the decennial period as to the material condition want and resource of the nation be of little practical value after the expiration of the first half of that period it would probably obviate the constitutional provision regard the decennial census if a census take in 1875 should be divest of all political character and no reapportionment of congressional representation be make under it such a census come as it would in the last year of the first century of our national existence would furnish a noble monument of the progress of the united states during that century education .the rapidly increase interest in education be a most encouraging feature in the current history of the country and it be no doubt true that this be due in a great measure to the effort of the bureau of education that office be continually receive evidence which abundantly prove its efficiency from the various institution of learning and educator of all kind throughout the country the report of the commissioner contain a vast amount of educational detail of great interest the bill now pende before congress provide for the appropriation of the net proceed of the sale of public land for educational purpose to aid the states in the general education of their rise generation be a measure of such great importance to our real progress and be so unanimously approve by the lead friend of education that i commend it to the favorable attention of congress territory .affairs in the territories be generally satisfactory the energy and business capacity of the pioneer who be settle up the vast domain not yet incorporate into states be keep pace in internal improvement and civil government with the old community in but one of they utah be the condition of affair unsatisfactory except so far as the quiet of the citizen may be disturb by real or imaginary danger of indian hostility it have seem to be the policy of the legislature of utah to evade all responsibility to the government of the united states and even to hold a position in hostility to it i recommend a careful revision of the present law of the territory by congress and the enactment of such a law the one propose in congress at its last session for instance or something similar to it as will secure peace the equality of all citizen before the law and the ultimate extinguishment of polygamy since the establishment of a territorial government for the district of columbia the improvement of the condition of the city of washington and surrounding and the increase prosperity of the citizen be observable to the most casual visitor the nation be a large owner of property in the city should bear with the citizen of the district its just share of the expense of these improvement i recommend therefore an appropriation to reimburse the citizen for the work do by they along and in front of public ground during the past year and liberal appropriation in order that the improvement and embellishment of the public building and ground may keep pace with the improvement make by the territorial authority agriculture .the report of the commissioner of agriculture give a very full and interesting account of the several division of that department the horticultural agricultural statistical entomological and chemical and the benefit confer by each upon the agricultural interest of the country the whole report be a complete history in detail of the working of that department in all its branch show the manner in which the farmer merchant and miner be inform and the extent to which he be aid in his pursuit the commissioner make one recommendation that measure be take by congress to protect and induce the planting of forest and suggest that no part of the public land should be dispose of without the condition that one tenth of it should be reserve in timber where it exist and where it do not exist inducement should be offer for plant it centennial celebration in accordance with the term of the act of congress approve march 3 1871 provide for the celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of american independence a commission have be organize consist of two member from each of the states and territories this commission have hold two session and have make satisfactory progress in the organization and in the initiatory step necessary for carry out the provision of the act and for execute also the provision of the act of june 1 1872 create a centennial board of finance a preliminary report of progress have be receive from the president of the

celebration will be look forward to by american citizen with great interest as mark a century of great progress and prosperity than be record in the history of any other nation and as serve a further good purpose in bring together on our soil people of all the commercial nation of the earth in a manner calculate to insure international good feeling civil service an earnest desire have be feel to correct abuse which have grow up in the civil service of the country through the defective method of make appointment to office heretofore federal office have be regard too much as the reward of political service under authority of congress rule have be establish to regulate the tenure of office and the mode of appointment it can not be expect that any system of rule can be entirely effective and prove a perfect remedy for the exist evil until they have be thoroughly test by actual practice and amend accord to the requirement of the service during my term of office it shall be my earnest endeavor to so apply the rule as to secure the great possible reform in the civil service of the government but it will require the direct action of congress to render the enforcement of the system bind upon my successor and i hope that the experience of the past year together with appropriate legislation by congress may reach a satisfactory solution of this question and secure to the public service for all time a practical method of obtain faithful and efficient officer and employee
fellow citizens

 under providence i have be call a second time to act as executive over this great nation it have be my endeavor in the past to maintain all the law and so far as lie in my power to act for the good interest of the whole people my good effort will be give in the same direction in the future aid i trust by my four year experience in the office

 when my first term of the office of chief executive begin the country have not recover from the effect of a great internal revolution and three of the former states of the union have not be restore to their federal relation

 it seem to i wise that no new question should be raise so long as that condition of affair exist therefore the past four year so far as i could control event have be consume in the effort to restore harmony public credit commerce and all the art of peace and progress it be my firm conviction that the civilized world be tend toward republicanism or government by the people through their choose representative and that our own great republic be destine to be the guide star to all other

 under our republic we support an army less than that of any european power of any standing and a navy less than that of either of at least five of they there could be no extension of territory on the continent which would call for an increase of this force but rather might such extension enable we to diminish it

 the theory of government change with general progress now that the telegraph be make available for communicate thought together with rapid transit by steam all part of a continent be make contiguous for all purpose of government and communication between the extreme limit of the country make easy than it be throughout the old thirteen state at the beginning of our national existence

 the effect of the late civil strife have be to free the slave and make he a citizen yet he be not possess of the civil right which citizenship should carry with it this be wrong and should be correct to this correction i stand committed so far as executive influence can avail

 social equality be not a subject to be legislate upon nor shall i ask that anything be do to advance the social status of the colored man except to give he a fair chance to develop what there be good in he give he access to the school and when he travel let he feel assured that his conduct will regulate the treatment and fare he will receive

 the states lately at war with the general government be now happily rehabilitate and no executive control be exercise in any one of they that would not be exercise in any other state under like circumstance

 in the first year of the past administration the proposition come up for the admission of santo domingo as a territory of the union it be not a question of my seeking but be a proposition from the people of santo domingo and which i entertain i believe now as i do then that it be for the good interest of this country for the people of santo domingo and all concerned that the proposition should be receive favorably it be however reject constitutionally and therefore the subject be never bring up again by i

 in future while i hold my present office the subject of acquisition of territory must have the support of the people before i will recommend any proposition look to such acquisition i say here however that i do not share in the apprehension hold by many as to the danger of government becoming weaken and destroy by reason of their extension of territory commerce education and rapid transit of thought and matter by telegraph and steam have change all this rather do i believe that our great maker be prepare the world in his own good time to become one nation speak one language and when army and navy will be no long require

 my effort in the future will be direct to the restoration of good feeling between the different section of our common country to the restoration of our currency to a fix value as compare with the world 's standard of value gold and if possible to a par with it to the construction of cheap route of transit throughout the land to the end that the product of all may find a market and leave a live remuneration to the producer to the maintenance of friendly relation with all our neighbor and with distant nation to the reestablishment of our commerce and share in the carrying trade upon the ocean to the encouragement of such manufacturing industry as can be economically pursue in this country to the end that the export of home product and industry may pay for our import the only sure method of return to and permanently maintain a specie basis to the elevation of labor and by a humane course to bring the aborigine of the country under the benign influence of education and civilization it be either this or war of extermination war of extermination engage in by people pursue commerce and all industrial pursuit be expensive even against the weak people and be demoralize and wicked our superiority of strength and advantage of civilization should make we lenient toward the indian the wrong inflict upon he should be take into account and the balance place to his credit the moral view of the question should be consider and the question ask can not the indian be make a useful and productive member of society by proper teaching and treatment if the effort be make in good faith we will stand well before the civilized nation of the earth and in our own conscience for having make it

 all these thing be not to be accomplish by one individual but they will receive my support and such recommendation to congress as will in my judgment well serve to carry they into effect i beg your support and encouragement

 it have be and be my earnest desire to correct abuse that have grownup in the civil service of the country to secure this reformation rule regulate method of appointment and promotion be establish and have be try my effort for such reformation shall be continue to the good of my judgment the spirit of the rule adopt will be maintain

 i acknowledge before this assemblage represent as it do every section of our country the obligation i be under to my countryman for the great honor they have confer on i by return i to the high office within their gift and the further obligation rest on i to render tot hem the good service within my power this i promise look forward with the great anxiety to the day when i shall be release from responsibility that at time be almost overwhelming and from which i have scarcely have a respite since the eventful firing upon fort sumter in april 1861 to the present day my service be then tender and accept under the first call for troop grow out of that event

 i do not ask for place or position and be entirely without influence or the acquaintance of person of influence but be resolve to perform my part in a struggle threaten the very existence of the nation i perform a conscientious duty without ask promotion or command and without a revengeful feeling toward any section or individual

 notwithstanding this throughout the war and from my candidacy for my present office in 1868 to the close of the last presidential campaign i have be the subject of abuse and slander scarcely ever equal in political history which to day i feel that i can afford to disregard in view of your verdict which i gratefully accept as my vindication

to the senate and house of representatives the year that have pass since the submission of my last message to congress have especially during the latter part of it be an eventful one to the country in the midst of great national prosperity a financial crisis have occur that have bring low fortune of gigantic proportion political partisanship have almost cease to exist especially in the agricultural region and finally the capture upon the high sea of a vessel bear our flag have for a time threaten the most serious consequence and have agitate the public mind from one end of the country to the other but this happily now be in the course of satisfactory adjustment honorable to both nation concern the relation of the united states however with most of the other power continue to be friendly and cordial with france germany russia italy and the minor european power with brazil and most of the south american republics and with japan nothing have occur during the year to demand special

discharge duty require great labor and constant patience to the satisfaction i believe of both government i recommend legislation to create a special court to consist of three judge who shall be empower to hear and determine all claim of alien upon the united states arise out of act commit against their person or property during the insurrection the recent reference under the treaty of washington be confine to claim of british subject arise during the period name in the treaty but it be understand that there be other british claim of a similar nature arise after the 9th of april 1865 and it be know that other claim of a like nature be advance by citizen or subject of other power it be desirable to have these claim also examine and dispose of official information be receive from the dutch government of a state of war between the king of the netherlands and the sultan of acheen the officer of the united states who be near the seat of the war be instruct to observe an impartial neutrality it be believe that they have do so the joint commission under the convention with mexico of 1868 having again be legally prolong have resume its business which it be hope may be bring to an early conclusion the distinguished representative of her britannic majesty at washington have kindly consent with the approval of his government to assume the arduous and responsible duty of umpire in this commission and to lend the weight of his character and name to such decision as may not receive the acquiescence of both the arbitrator appoint by the respective government the commissioner appoint pursuant to the authority of congress to examine into the nature and extent of the foray by trespasser from that country upon the herd of texas have make a report which will be submit for your consideration the venezuelan government have be apprise of the sense of congress in regard to the award of the joint commission under the convention of 25th april 1866 as express in the act of the 25th of february last it be apprehend that that government do not realize the character of its obligation under that convention as there be reason to believe however that its hesitancy in recognize they spring in part at least from real difficulty in discharge they in connection with its obligation to other government the expediency of further forbearance on our part be believe to be worthy of your consideration the ottoman government and that of egypt have latterly show a disposition to relieve foreign consul of the judicial power which heretofore they have exercise in the turkish dominion by organize other tribunal as congress however have by law provide for the discharge of judicial function by consul of the united states in that quarter under the treaty of 1830 i have not feel at liberty formally to accept the propose change without the assent of congress whose decision upon the subject at as early a period as may be convenient be earnestly request i transmit herewith for the consideration and determination of congress an application of the republic of santo domingo to this government to exercise a protectorate over that republic since the adjournment of congress the follow treaty with foreign power have be proclaim a naturalization convention with denmark a convention with mexico for renew the claims commission a convention of friendship commerce and extradition with the orange free state and a naturalization convention with ecuador i renew the recommendation make in my message of december 1870 that congress authorize the postmaster general to issue all commission to official appoint through his department i invite the earnest attention of congress to the exist law of the united states respect expatriation and the election of nationality by individual many citizen of the united states reside permanently abroad with their family under the provision of the act approve february 10 1855 the child of such person be to be deem and take to be citizen of the united states but the right of citizenship be not to descend to person whose father never reside in the united states it thus happen that person who have never reside within the united states have be enable to put forward a pretension to the protection of the united states against the claim to military service of the government under whose protection they be bear and have be rear in some case even naturalize citizen of the united states have return to the land of their birth with intent to remain there and their child the issue of a marriage contract there after their return and who have never be in the united states have lay claim to our protection when the lapse of many year have impose upon they the duty of military service to the only government which have ever know they personally until the year 1868 it be leave embarrass by conflict opinion of court and of jurist to determine how far the doctrine of perpetual allegiance derive from our former colonial relation with great britain be applicable to american citizen congress then wisely sweep these doubt away by enact that any declaration instruction opinion order or decision of any officer of this government which deny restrict impairs or question the right of expatriation be inconsistent with the fundamental principle of this government but congress do not indicate in that statute nor have it since do so what act be to be deem to work expatriation for my own guidance in determine such question i require under the provision of the constitution the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments upon certain question relate to this subject the result satisfy i that further legislation have become necessary i therefore commend the subject to the careful consideration of congress and i transmit herewith copy of the several opinion of the principal officer of the executive departments together with other correspondence and pertinent information on the same subject the united states who lead the way in the overthrow of the feudal doctrine of perpetual allegiance be among the last to indicate how their own citizen may elect another nationality the paper submit herewith indicate what be necessary to place we on a par with other lead nation in liberality of legislation on this international question we have already in our treaty assent to the principle which would need to be embody in law intend to accomplish such result we have agree that citizen of the united states may cease to be citizen and may voluntarily render allegiance to other power we have agree that residence in a foreign land without intent to return shall of itself work expatriation we have agree in some instance upon the length of time necessary for such continued residence to work a presumption of such intent i invite congress now to mark out and define when and how expatriation can be accomplish to regulate by law the condition of american woman marry foreigner to fix the status of child bear in a foreign country of american parent reside more or less permanently abroad and to make rule for determine such other kindre point as may seem good to congress in compliance with the request of congress i transmit to the american minister at madrid with instruction to present it to the spanish government the joint resolution approve on the 3d of march last tender to the people of spain in the name and on the behalf of the american people the congratulation of congress upon the effort to consolidate in spain the principle of universal liberty in a republican form of government the existence of this new republic be inaugurate by strike the fetter from the slave in porto rico this beneficent measure be follow by the release of several thousand person illegally hold as slave in cuba next the captain general of that colony be deprive of the power to set aside the order of his superior at madrid which have pertain to the office since 1825 the sequester estate of american citizen which have be the cause of long and fruitless correspondence be order to be restore to their owner all these liberal step be take in the face of a violent opposition direct by the reactionary slave holder of havana who be vainly strive to stay the march of idea which have terminate slavery in christendom cuba only except unhappily however this baneful influence have thus far succeed in defeat the effort of all liberal minded man in spain to abolish slavery in cuba and in prevent the promise reform in that island the struggle for political supremacy continue there the proslavery and aristocratic party in cuba be gradually arraign itself in more and more open hostility and defiance of the home government while it still maintain a political connection with the republic in the peninsula and although usurping and defy the authority of the home government whenever such usurpation or defiance tend in the direction of oppression or of the maintenance of abuse it be still a power in madrid and be recognize by the government thus an element more dangerous to continue colonial relation between cuba and spain than that which inspire the insurrection at yara an element oppose to grant any relief from misrule and abuse with no aspiration after freedom command no sympathy in generous breast aim to rivet still strong the shackle of slavery and oppression have seize many of the emblem of power in cuba and under profession of loyalty to the mother country be exhaust the resource of the island and be do act which be at variance with those principle of justice of liberality and of right which give nobility of character to a republic in the interest of humanity of civilization and of progress it be to be hope that this evil influence may be soon avert the steam virginius be on the 26th day of september 1870 duly register at the port of new york as a part of the commercial marine of the united states on the 4th of october 1870 having receive the certificate of her register in the usual legal form she sail from the port of new york and have not since be within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states on the 31st day of october last while sail under the flag of the united states on the high sea she be forcibly seize by the spanish gunboat tornado and be carry into the port of santiago de cuba where fifty three of her passenger and crew be inhumanly and so far at least as relate to those who be citizen of the united states without due process of law put to death it be a well establish principle assert by the united states from the beginning of their national independence recognize by great britain and other maritime power and state by the senate in a resolution pass unanimously on the 16th of june 1858 that american vessel on the high sea in time of peace bear the american flag remain under the jurisdiction of the country to which they belong and therefore any visitation molestation or detention of such vessel by force or by the exhibition of force on the part of a foreign power be in derogation of the sovereignty of the united states in accordance with this principle the restoration of the virginius and the surrender of the survivor of her passenger and crew and a due reparation to the flag and the punishment of the authority who have be guilty of the illegal act of violence be demand the spanish government have recognize the justice of the demand and have arrange for the immediate delivery of the vessel and for the surrender of the survivor of the passenger and crew and for a salute to the flag and for proceeding look to the punishment of those who may be prove to have be guilty of illegal act of violence toward citizen of the united states and also toward indemnify those who may be show to be entitle to indemnity a copy of a protocol of a conference between the secretary of state and the spanish minister in which the term of this arrangement be agree to be transmit herewith the correspondence on this subject with the legation of the united states in madrid be conduct in cipher and by cable and need the verification of the actual text of the correspondence it have seem to i to be due to the importance of the case not to submit this correspondence until the accurate text can be receive by mail it be expect shortly and will be submit when receive in take leave of this subject for the present i wish to renew the expression of my conviction that the existence of african slavery in cuba be a principal cause of the lamentable condition of the island i do not doubt that congress share with i the hope that it will soon be make to disappear and that peace and prosperity may follow its abolition the embargoing of american estate in cuba cruelty to american citizen detect in no act of hostility to the spanish government the murdering of prisoner take with arm in their hand and finally the capture upon the high sea of a vessel sailing under the united states flag and bear a united states registry have culminate in an outburst of indignation that have seem for a time to threaten war pende negotiation between the united states and the government of spain on the subject of this capture i have authorize the secretary of the navy to put our navy on a war footing to the extent at least of the entire annual appropriation for that branch of the service trust to congress and the public opinion of the american people to justify my action assume from the action of the last congress in appoint a committee on privileges and elections to prepare and report to this congress a constitutional amendment to provide a well method of elect the president and vice president of the united states and also from the necessity of such an amendment that there will be submit to the state legislature for ratification such an improvement in our constitution i suggest two other for your consideration first to authorize the executive to approve of so much of any measure pass the two houses of congress as his judgment may dictate without approve the whole the disapprove portion or portion to be subject to the same rule as now to wit to be refer back to the house in which the measure or measure originate and if pass by a two third vote of the two houses then to become a law without the approval of the president i would add to this a provision that there should be no legislation by congress during the last twenty four hour of its sitting except upon veto in order to give the executive an opportunity to examine and approve or disapprove bill understandingly second to provide by amendment that when an extra session of congress be convene by executive proclamation legislation during the continuance of such extra session shall be confine to such subject as the executive may bring before it from time to time in writing the advantage to be gain by these two amendment be too obvious for i to comment upon they one session in each year be provide for by the constitution in which there be no restriction as to the subject of legislation by congress if more be require it be always in the power of congress during their term of office to provide for session at any time the first of these amendment would protect the public against the many abuse and waste of public money which creep into appropriation bill and other important measure pass during the expire hour of congress to which otherwise due consideration can not be give treasury department the receipt of the government from all source for the last fiscal year be $ 333,738,204 and expenditure on all account $ 290,345,245 thus show an excess of receipt over expenditure of $ 43,392,959 but it be not probable that this favorable exhibit will be show for the present fiscal year indeed it be very doubtful whether except with great economy on the part of congress in make appropriation and the same economy in administer the various departments of government the revenue will not fall short of meet actual expense include interest on the public debt i commend to congress such economy and point out two source where it seem to i it might commence to wit in the appropriation for public building in the many city where work have not yet be commence in the appropriation for river and harbor improvement in those locality where the improvement be of but little benefit to general commerce and for fortification there be a still more fruitful source of expenditure which i will point out later in this message i refer to the easy method of manufacture claim for loss incur in suppress the late rebellion i would not be understand here as oppose the erection of good substantial and even ornamental building by the government wherever such building be need in fact i approve of the government own its own building in all section of the country and hope the day be not far distant when it will not only possess they but will erect in the capital suitable residence for all person who now receive commutation for quarter or rent at government expense and for the cabinet thus set an example to the states which may induce they to erect building for their senator but i would have this work conduct at a time when the revenue of the country would abundantly justify it the revenue have materially fall off for the first five month of the present fiscal year from what they be expect to produce owe to the general panic now prevail which commence about the middle of september last the full effect of this disaster if it should not prove a blessing in disguise be yet to be demonstrate in either event it be your duty to heed the lesson and to provide by wise and well consider legislation as far as it lie in your power against its recurrence and to take advantage of all benefit that may have accrue my own judgment be that however much individual may have suffer one long step have be take toward specie payment that we can never have permanent prosperity until a specie basis be reach and that a specie basis can not be reach and maintain until our export exclusive of gold pay for our import interest due abroad and other specie obligation or so nearly so as to leave an appreciable accumulation of the precious metal in the country from the product of our mine the development of the mine of precious metal during the past year and the prospective development of they for year to come be gratify in their result could but one half of the gold extract from the mine be retain at home our advance toward specie payment would be rapid to increase our export sufficient currency be require to keep all the industry of the country employ without this national as well as individual bankruptcy must ensue undue inflation on the other hand while it might give temporary relief would only lead to inflation of price the impossibility of compete in our own market for the product of home skill and labor and repeat renewal of present experience elasticity to our circulate medium therefore and just enough of it to transact the legitimate business of the country and to keep all industry employ be what be most to be desire the exact medium be specie the recognize medium of exchange the world over that obtain we shall have a currency of an exact degree of elasticity if there be too much of it for the legitimate purpose of trade and commerce it will flow out of the country if too little the reverse will result to hold what we have and to appreciate our currency to that standard be the problem deserve of the most serious consideration of congress the experience of the present panic have prove that the currency of the country base as it be upon the credit of the country be the good that have ever be devise usually in time of such trial currency have become worthless or so much depreciate in value as to inflate the value of all the necessary of life as compare with the currency everyone hold it have be anxious to dispose of it on any term now we witness the reverse holder of currency hoard it as they do gold in former experience of a like nature it be patent to the most casual observer that much more currency or money be require to transact the legitimate trade of the country during the fall and winter month when the vast crop be be remove than during the balance of the year with our present system the amount in the country remain the same throughout the entire year result in an accumulation of all the surplus capital of the country in a few center when not employ in the moving of crop tempt there by the offer of interest on call loan interest be pay this surplus capital must earn this interest pay with a profit be subject to call it can not be loan only in part at well to the merchant or manufacturer for a fix term hence no matter how much currency there might be in the country it would be absorb price keep pace with the volume and panic stringency and disaster would ever be recur with the autumn elasticity in our monetary system therefore be the object to be attain first and next to that as far as possible a prevention of the use of other people 's money in stock and other specie of speculation to prevent the latter it seem to i that one great step would be take by prohibit the national bank from pay interest on deposit by require they to hold their reserve in their own vault and by force they into resumption though it would only be in legal tender note for this purpose i would suggest the establishment of clear house for your consideration to secure the former many plan have be suggest most if not all of which look to i more like inflation on the one hand or compelling the government on the other to pay interest without correspond benefit upon the surplus fund of the country during the season when otherwise unemployed i submit for your consideration whether this difficulty might not be overcome by authorize the secretary of the treasury to issue at any time to national bank of issue any amount of their own note below a fix percentage of their issue say 40 per cent upon the bank deposit with the treasurer of the united states an amount of government bond equal to the amount of note demand the bank to forfeit to the government say 4 per cent of the interest accrue on the bond so pledge during the time they remain with the treasurer as security for the increased circulation the bond so pledge to be redeemable by the bank at their pleasure either in whole or in part by return their own bill for cancellation to an amount equal to the face of the bond withdraw i would far suggest for your consideration the propriety of authorize national bank to diminish their standing issue at pleasure by return for cancellation their own bill and withdraw so many united states bond as be pledge for the bill return in view of the great actual contraction that have take place in the currency and the comparative contraction continuously go on due to the increase of population increase of manufactory and all the industry i do not believe there be too much of it now for the dull period of the year indeed if clearing house should be establish thus force redemption it be a question for your consideration whether banking should not be make free retain all the safeguard now require to secure bill holder in any modification of the present law regulate national bank as a further step toward prepare for resumption of specie payment i invite your attention to a consideration of the propriety of exact from they the retention as a part of their reserve either the whole or a part of the gold interest accrue upon the bond pledge as security for their issue i have not reflect enough on the bearing this might have in produce a scarcity of coin with which to pay duty on import to give it my positive recommendation but your attention be invite to the subject during the last four year the currency have be contract directly by the withdrawal of 3 per cent certificate compound interest note and seven thirty bond outstanding on the 4th of march 1869 all of which take the place of legal tender in the bank reserve to the extent of $ 63,000,000.during the same period there have be a much large comparative contraction of the currency the population of the country have largely increase more than 25,000 mile of railroad have be build require the active use of capital to operate they million of acre of land have be open to cultivation require capital to move the product manufactory have multiply beyond all precedent in the same period of time require capital weekly for the payment of wage and for the purchase of material and probably the large of all comparative contraction arise from the organizing of free labor in the south now every laborer there receive his wage and for want of saving bank the great part of such wage be carry in the pocket or hoard until require for use these suggestion be throw out for your consideration without any recommendation that they shall be adopt literally but hope that the good method may be arrive at to secure such an elasticity of the currency as will keep employ all the industry of the country and prevent such an inflation as will put off indefinitely the resumption of specie payment an object so devoutly to be wish for by all and by none more earnestly than the class of people most directly interested those who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow the decision of congress on this subject will have the hearty support of the executive in previous message i have call attention to the decline in american shipbuilding and recommend such legislation as would secure to we our proportion of the carrying trade stimulate by high rate and abundance of freight the progress for the last year in shipbuilding have be very satisfactory there have be an increase of about 3 per cent in the amount transport in american vessel over the amount of last year with the reduce cost of material which have take place it may reasonably be hope that this progress will be maintain and even increase however as we pay about $ 80,000,000 per annum to foreign vessel for the transportation to a market of our surplus product thus increase the balance of trade against we to this amount the subject be one worthy of your serious consideration "cheap transportation be a subject that have attract the attention of both producer and consumer for the past few year and have contribute to if it have not be the direct cause of the recent panic and stringency as congress at its last session appoint a special committee to investigate this whole subject during the vacation and report at this session i have nothing to recommend until their report be read there be one work however of a national character in which the great portion of the east and the west the north and the south be equally interested to which i will invite your attention the state of new york have a canal connect lake erie with tide water on the hudson river the state of illinois have a similar work connect lake michigan with navigable water on the illinois river thus make water communication inland between the east and the west and south these great artificial water course be the property of the states through which they pass and pay toll to those states would it not be wise statesmanship to pledge these states that if they will open these canal for the passage of large vessel the general government will look after and keep in navigable condition the great public highway with which they connect to wit the overslaugh on the hudson the st. clair flats and the illinois and mississippi river this would be a national work one of great value to the producer of the west and south in give they cheap transportation for their produce to the seaboard and a market and to the consumer in the east in give they cheap food particularly of those article of food which do not find a foreign market and the price of which therefore be not regulate by foreign demand the advantage of such a work be too obvious for argument i submit the subject to you therefore without further comment in attempt to regain our lose commerce and carry trade i have heretofore call attention to the states south of we offer a field where much might be accomplish to far this object i suggest that a small appropriation be make accompany with authority for the secretary of the navy to fit out a naval vessel to ascend the amazon river to the mouth of the madeira thence to explore that river and its tributary into bolivia and to report to congress at its next session or as soon as practicable the accessibility of the country by water its resource and the population so reach such an exploration would cost but little it can do no harm and may result in establish a trade of value to both nation in further connection with the treasury department i would recommend a revision and codification of the tariff law and the opening of more mint for coin money with authority to coin for such nation as may apply war department the attention of congress be invite to the recommendation contain in the report of the secretary of war herewith accompany the apparent great cost of support the army be fully explain by this report and i hope will receive your attention while invite your general attention to all the recommendation make by the secretary of war there be two which i would especially invite you to consider first the importance of prepare for war in time of peace by provide proper armament for our seacoast defense proper armament be of vastly more importance than fortification the latter can be supply very speedily for temporary purpose when need the former can not the second be the necessity of reopen promotion in the staff corps of the army particularly be this necessity feel in the medical pay and ordnance department at this time it be necessary to employ contract surgeon to supply the necessary medical attendance require by the army with the present force of the pay department it be now difficult to make the payment to troop provide for by law long delay in payment be productive of desertion and other demoralization and the law prohibit the payment of troop by other than regular army paymaster there be now sixteen vacancy in the ordnance department thus leave that branch of the service without sufficient officer to conduct the business of the different arsenal on a large scale if ever require navy department during the past year our navy have be deplete by the sale of some vessel no long fit for naval service and by the condemnation of other not yet dispose of this however have be more than compensate for by the repair of six of the old wooden ship and by the building of eight new sloop of war authorize by the last congress the building of these latter have occur at a doubly fortunate time they be about be complete at a time when they may possibly be much need and the work upon they have not only give direct employment to thousand of man but have no doubt be the mean of keep open establishment for other work at a time of great financial distress since the commencement of the last month however the distressing occurrence which have take place in the water of the caribbean sea almost on our very seaboard while they illustrate most forcibly the necessity always exist that a nation situate like ours should maintain in a state of possible efficiency a navy adequate to its responsibility have at the same time demand that all the effective force we really have shall be put in immediate readiness for warlike service this have be and be be do promptly and effectively and i be assure that all the available ship and every authorized man of the american navy will be ready for whatever action be require for the safety of our citizen or the maintenance of our honor this of course will require the expenditure in a short time of some of the appropriation which be calculate to extend through the fiscal year but congress will i doubt not understand and appreciate the emergency and will provide adequately not only for the present preparation but for the future maintenance of our naval force the secretary of the navy have during the past year be quietly put some of our most effective monitor in condition for service and thus the exigency find we in a much well condition for work than we could possibly have be without his action post office department a complete exhibit be present in the accompanying report of the postmaster general of the operation of the post office department during the year the ordinary postal revenue for the fiscal year end june 30 1873 amount to $ 22,996,741.57 and the expenditure of all kind to $ 29,084,945.67 the increase of revenue over 1872 be $ 1,081,315.20 and the increase of expenditure $ 2,426,753.36.independent of the payment make from special appropriation for mail steamship line the amount draw from the general treasury to meet deficiency be $ 5,265,475 the constant and rapid extension of our postal service particularly upon railway and the improved facility for the collection transmission distribution and delivery of the mail which be constantly be provide account for the increase expenditure of this popular branch of the public service the total number of post office in operation on june 30 1873 be 33,244 a net increase of 1,381 over the number report the precede year the number of presidential office be 1,363 an increase of 163 during the year the total length of railroad mail route at the close of the year

pay from special appropriation to subsidize line of mail steamer be $ 1,047,271.35.new or additional postal convention have be conclude with sweden norway belgium germany canada newfoundland and japan reduce postage rate on correspondence exchange with those country and further effort have be make to conclude a satisfactory postal convention with france but without success i invite the favorable consideration of congress to the suggestion and recommendation of the postmaster general for an extension of the free delivery system in all city have a population of not less than 10,000 for the prepayment of postage on newspaper and other print matter of the second class for a uniform postage and limit of weight on miscellaneous matter for adjust the compensation of all postmaster not appoint by the president by the old method of commission on the actual receipt of the office instead of the present mode of fix the salary in advance upon special return and especially do i urge favorable action by congress on the important recommendation of the postmaster general for the establishment of united states postal saving depository your attention be also again call to a consideration of the question of postal telegraph and the argument adduce in support thereof in the hope that you may take such action in connection therewith as in your judgment will most contribute to the good interest of the country department of justice affair in utah require your early and special attention the supreme court of the united states in the case of clinton vs. englebrecht decide that the united states marshal of that territory could not lawfully summon juror for the district court and those court hold that the territorial marshal can not lawfully perform that duty because he be elect by the legislative assembly and not appoint as provide for in the act organize the territory all proceeding at law be practically abolish by these decision and there have be but few or no jury trial in the district court of that territory since the last session of congress property be leave without protection by the court and crime go unpunished to prevent anarchy there it be absolutely necessary that congress provide the court with some mode of obtain juror and i recommend legislation to that end and also that the probate court of the territory now assume to issue writ of injunction and habeas corpus and to try criminal case and question as to land title be deny all jurisdiction not possess ordinarily by court of that description i have become impressed with the belief that the act approve march 2 1867 entitle an act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the united states be productive of more evil than good at this time many consideration might be urge for its total repeal but if this be not consider advisable i think it will not be seriously question that those portion of say act provide for what be call involuntary bankruptcy operate to increase the financial embarrassment of the country careful and prudent man very often become involved in debt in the transaction of their business and though they may possess ample property if it could be make available for that purpose to meet all their liability yet on account of the extraordinary scarcity of money they may be unable to meet all their pecuniary obligation as they become due in consequence of which they be liable to be prostrate in their business by proceeding in bankruptcy at the instance of unrelenting creditor people be now so easily alarm as to monetary matter that the mere filing of a petition in bankruptcy by an unfriendly creditor will necessarily embarrass and oftentime accomplish the financial ruin of a responsible business man those who otherwise might make lawful and just arrangement to relieve themselves from difficulty produce by the present stringency in money be prevent by their constant exposure to attack and disappointment by proceeding against they in bankruptcy and besides the law be make use of in many case by obdurate creditor to frighten or force debtor into a compliance with their wish and into act of injustice to other creditor and to themselves i recommend that so much of say act as provide for involuntary bankruptcy on account of the suspension of payment be repeal your careful attention be invite to the subject of claim against the government and to the facility afford by exist law for their prosecution each of the departments of state treasury and war have demand for many million of dollar upon its file and they be rapidly accumulate to these may be add those now pende before congress the court of claims and the southern claims commission make in the aggregate an immense sum most of these grow out of the rebellion and be intend to indemnify person on both side for their loss during the war and not a few of they be fabricate and support by false testimony project be on foot it be believe to induce congress to provide for new class of claim and to revive old one through the repeal or modification of the statute of limitation by which they be now bar i presume these scheme if propose will be receive with little favor by congress and i recommend that person have claim against the united states cognizable by any tribunal or department thereof be require to present they at an early day and that legislation be direct as far as practicable to the defeat of unfounded and unjust demand upon the government and i would suggest as a means of prevent fraud that witness be call upon to appear in person to testify before those tribunal having say claim before they for adjudication probably the large saving to the national treasury can be secure by timely legislation on these subject of any of the economic measure that will be propose you will be advise of the operation of the department of justice by the report of the attorney general and i invite your attention to the amendment of exist law suggest by he with the view of reduce the expense of that department department of the interior the policy inaugurate toward the indians at the beginning of the last administration have be steadily pursue and i believe with beneficial result it will be continue with only such modification as time and experience may demonstrate as necessary with the encroachment of civilization upon the indian reservation and hunting ground disturbance have take place between the indians and white during the past year and probably will continue to do so until each race appreciate that the other have right which must be respect the policy have be to collect the indians as rapidly as possible on reservation and as far as practicable within what be know as the indian territory and to teach they the art of civilization and self support where find off their reservation and endanger the peace and safety of the white they have be punish and will continue to be for like offense the indian territory south of kansas and west of arkansas be sufficient in area and agricultural resource to support all the indians east of the rocky mountains in time no doubt all of they except a few who may elect to make their home among white people will be collect there as a preparatory step for this consummation i be now satisfied that a territorial form of government should be give they which will secure the treaty right of the original settler and protect their homestead from alienation for a period of twenty year the operation of the patent office be grow to such a magnitude and the accumulation of material be become so great that the necessity of more room be become more obvious day by day i respectfully invite your attention to the report of the secretary of the interior and commissioner of patents on this subject the business of the general land office exhibit a material increase in all its branch during the last fiscal year during that time there be dispose of out of the public land 13,030,606 acre be an amount great by 1,165,631 acre than be dispose of during the precede year of the amount dispose of 1,626,266 acre be sell for cash 214,940 acre be locate with military land

states as swamp land 138,681 acre be certify for agricultural college common school university and seminary 190,775 acre be approve to states for internal improvement and 14,222 acre be locate with indian scrip the cash receipt during the same time be $ 3,408,515.50 be $ 190,415.50 in excess of the receipt of the previous year during the year 30,488,132 acre of public land be survey an increase over the amount survey the previous year of 1,037,193 acre and add to the area previously survey aggregate 616,554,895 acre which have be survey leave 1,218,443,505 acre of the public land still unsurveye the increased and steadily increase facility for reach our unoccupied public domain and for the transportation of surplus product enlarge the available field for desirable homestead location thus stimulate settlement and extend year by year in a gradually increase ratio the area of occupation and cultivation the express desire of the representative of a large colony of citizen of russia to emigrate to this country as be understand with the consent of their government if certain concession can be make to enable they to settle in a compact colony be of great interest as go to show the light in which our institution be regard by an industrious intelligent and wealthy people desirous of enjoy civil and religious liberty and the acquisition of so large an immigration of citizen of a superior class would without doubt be of substantial benefit to the country i invite attention to the suggestion of the secretary of the interior in this behalf there be pay during the last fiscal year for pension include the expense of disbursement $ 29,185,289.62 be an amount less by $ 984,050.98 than be expend for the same purpose the precede year although this statement of expenditure would indicate a material reduction in amount compare with the precede year it be believe that the change in the pension law at the last session of congress will absorb that amount the current year at the close of the last fiscal year there be on the pension roll 99,804 invalid military pensioner and 112,088 widow orphan and dependent relative of deceased soldier make a total of that class of 211,892 18,266 survivor of the war of 1812 and 5,058 widow of soldier of that war pension under the act of congress of february 14 1871 make a total of that class of 23,319 1,480 invalid navy pensioner and 1,770 widow orphan and dependent relative of deceased officer sailor and marine of the navy make a total of navy pensioner of 3,200 and a grand total of pensioner of 311 class of 238,411 show a net increase during the last fiscal year of 6,182 during the last year the name of 16,405 pensioner be add to the roll and 10,223 name be drop therefrom for various cause the system adopt for the detection of fraud against the government in the matter of pension have be productive of satisfactory result but legislation be need to provide if possible against the perpetration of such fraud in future the evidently increase interest in the cause of education be a most encouraging feature in the general progress and prosperity of the country and the bureau of education be earnest in its effort to give proper direction to the new appliance and increase facility which be be offer to aid the educator of the country in their great work the ninth census have be complete the report thereof publish and distribute and the work force of the bureau disband the secretary of the interior renew his recommendation for a census to be take in 1875 to which subject the attention of congress be invite the original suggestion in that behalf have meet with the general approval of the country and even if it be not deem advisable at present to provide for a regular quinquennial census a census take in 1875 the report of which could be complete and publish before the one hundredth anniversary of our national independence would be especially interesting and valuable as show the progress of the country during the first century of our national existence it be believe however that a regular census every five year would be of substantial benefit to the country inasmuch as our growth hitherto have be so rapid that the result of the decennial census be necessarily unreliable as a basis of estimate for the latter year of a decennial period district of columbia under the very efficient management of the governor and the board of public work of this district the city of washington be rapidly assume the appearance of a capital of which the nation may well be proud from be a most unsightly place three year ago disagreeable to pass through in summer in consequence of the dust arise from unpaved street and almost impassable in the winter from the mud it be now one of the most sightly city in the country and can boast of be the good paved the work have be do systematically the plan grade location of sewer water and gas main be determine upon before the work be commence thus secure permanency when complete i question whether so much have ever be accomplish before in any american city for the same expenditure the government have large reservation in the city and the nation at large have an interest in their capital i recommend a liberal policy toward the district of columbia and that the government should bear its just share of the expense of these improvement every citizen visit the capital feel a pride in its grow beauty and that he too be part owner in the investment make here i would suggest to congress the propriety of promote the establishment in this district of an institution of learning or university of the high class by the donation of land there be no place well suit for such an institution than the national capital there be no other place in which every citizen be so directly interested civil service reform in three successive message to congress i have call attention to the subject of civil service reform "action have be take so far as to authorize the appointment of a board to devise rule govern method of make appointment and promotion but there never have be any action make these rule or any rule bind or even entitle to observance where person desire the appointment of a friend or the removal of an official who may be disagreeable to they to have any rule effective they must have the acquiescence of congress as well as of the executive i commend therefore the subject to your attention and suggest that a special committee of congress might confer with the civil service board during the present session for the purpose of devise such rule as can be maintain and which will secure the service of honest and capable official and which will also protect they in a degree of independence while in office proper rule will protect congress as well as the executive from much needless persecution and will prove of great value to the public at large i would recommend for your favorable consideration the passage of an enable act for the admission of colorado as a state in the union it possess all the element of a prosperous state agricultural and mineral and i believe have a population now to justify such admission in connection with this i would also recommend the encouragement of a canal for purpose of irrigation from the eastern slope of the rocky mountains to the missouri river as a rule i be opposed to further donation of public land for internal improvement own and control by private corporation but in this instance i would make an exception between the missouri river and the rocky mountains there be an arid belt of public land from 300 to 500 mile in width perfectly valueless for the occupation of man for the want of sufficient rain to secure the growth of any product an irrigating canal would make productive a belt as wide as the supply of water could be make to spread over across this entire country and would secure a cordon of settlement connect the present population of the mountain and mining region with that of the old state all the land reclaim would be clear gain if alternate section be retain by the government i would suggest that the retain section be throw open to entry under the homestead law or sell to actual settler for a very low price i renew my previous recommendation to congress for general amnesty the number engage in the late rebellion yet labor under disability be very small but enough to keep up a constant irritation no possible danger can accrue to the government by restore they to eligibility to hold office i suggest for your consideration the enactment of a law to well secure the civil right which freedom should secure but have not effectually secure to the enfranchised slave
to the senate of the united states
 herewith i return senate bill no 617 entitle an act to fix the amount of united states note and the circulation of national bank and for other purpose without my approval
 in do so i must express my regret at not be able to give my assent to a measure which have receive the sanction of a majority of the legislator choose by the people to make law for their guidance and have studiously seek to find sufficient argument to justify such assent but unsuccessfully
 practically it be a question whether the measure under discussion would give an additional dollar to the irredeemable paper currency of the country or not and whether by require three fourth of the reserve to be retain by the bank and prohibit interest to be receive on the balance it might not prove a contraction
 but the fact can not be conceal that theoretically the bill increase the paper circulation $ 100,000,000 less only the amount of reserve restrain from circulation by the provision of the second section the measure have be support on the theory that it would give increase circulation it be a fair inference therefore that if in practice the measure should fail to create the abundance of circulation expect of it the friend of the measure particularly those out of congress would clamor for such inflation as would give the expected relief
 the theory in my belief be a departure from true principle of finance national interest national obligation to creditor congressional promise party pledge on the part of both political party and of personal view and promise make by i in every annual message send to congress and in each inaugural address
 in my annual message to congress in december 1869 the following passage appear
 among the evil grow out of the rebellion and not yet refer to be that of an irredeemable currency it be an evil which i hope will receive your most earnest attention it be a duty and one of the high duty of government to secure to the citizen a medium of exchange of fix unvarying value this imply a return to a specie basis and no substitute for it can be devise it should be commence now and reach at the early practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interest of the debtor class immediate resumption if practicable would not be desirable it would compel the debtor class to pay beyond their contract the premium on gold at the date of their purchase and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thousand fluctuation however in the paper value of the measure of all value gold be detrimental to the interest of trade it make the man of business an involuntary gambler for in all sale where future payment be to be make both party speculate as to what will be the value of the currency to be pay and receive i earnestly recommend to you then such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payment and put an immediate stop to fluctuation in the value of currency
 i still adhere to the view then express
 as early as december 4 1865 the house of representatives pass a resolution by a vote of 144 yea to 6 nay concur in the view of the secretary of the treasury in relation to the necessity of a contraction of the currency with a view to as early a resumption of specie payment as the business interest of the country will permit and pledge cooperative action to this end as speedily as possible
 the first act pass by the forty first congress approve on the 18th day of march 1869 be as follow
 an act to strengthen the public credit
 be it enact etc that in order to remove any doubt as to the purpose of the government to discharge all just obligation to the public creditor and to settle conflicting question and interpretation of the law by virtue of which such obligation have be contract it be hereby provide and declare that the faith of the united states be solemnly pledge to the payment in coin or its equivalent of all the obligation of the united states not bear interest know as united states note and all the interest bear obligation of the united states except in case where the law authorize the issue of any such obligation have expressly provide that the same may be pay in lawful money or in other currency than gold and silver but none of the say interest bear obligation not already due shall be redeem or pay before maturity unless at such time united states note shall be convertible into coin at the option of the holder or unless at such time bond of the united states bear a low rate of interest than the bond to be redeem can be sell at par in coin and the united states also solemnly pledge its faith to make provision at the early practicable period for the redemption of the united states note in coin
 this act still remain as a continue pledge of the faith of the united states to make provision at the early practicable period for the redemption of the united states note in coin
 a declaration contain in the act of june 30 1864 create an obligation that the total amount of united states note issue or to be issue should never exceed $ 400,000,000 the amount in actual circulation be actually reduce to $ 356,000,000 at which point congress pass the act of february 4 1868 suspend the further reduction of the currency the forty four million have ever be regard as a reserve to be use only in case of emergency such as have occur on several occasion and must occur when from any cause revenue suddenly fall below expenditure and such a reserve be necessary because the fractional currency amount to fifty million be redeemable in legal tender on call
 it may be say that such a return of fractional currency for redemption be impossible but let step be take for a return to a specie basis and it will be find that silver will take the place of fractional currency as rapidly as it can be supply when the premium on gold reach a sufficiently low point with the amount of united states note to be issue permanently fix within proper limit and the treasury so strengthen as to be able to redeem they in coin on demand it will then be safe to inaugurate a system of free banking with such provision as to make compulsory redemption of the circulate note of the bank in coin or in united states note themselves redeemable and make equivalent to coin
 as a measure preparatory to free banking and for place the government in a condition to redeem its note in coin at the early practicable period the revenue of the country should be increase so as to pay current expense provide for the sink fund require by law and also a surplus to be retain in the treasury in gold
 i be not a believer in any artificial method of make paper money equal to coin when the coin be not own or hold ready to redeem the promise to pay for paper money be nothing more than promise to pay and be valuable exactly in proportion to the amount of coin that it can be convert into while coin be not use as a circulate medium or the currency of the country be not convertible into it at par it become an article of commerce as much as any other product the surplus will seek a foreign market as will any other surplus the balance of trade have nothing to do with the question duty on import be require in coin create a limited demand for gold about enough to satisfy that demand remain in the country to increase this supply i see no way open but by the government hoarding through the mean above give and possibly by require the national bank to aid
 it be claim by the advocate of the measure herewith return that there be an unequal distribution of the banking capital of the country i be disposed to give great weight to this view of the question at first but on reflection it will be remember that there still remain $ 4,000,000 of authorize bank note circulation assign to states have less than their quota not yet take in addition to this the states have less than their quota of bank circulation have the option of twenty five million more to be take from those states have more than their proportion when this be all take up or when specie payment be fully restore or be in rapid process of restoration will be the time to consider the question of more currency

 hamilton fish secretary of state

to the senate and house of representatives since the convening of congress one year ago the nation have undergo a prostration in business and industry such as have not be witness with we for many year speculation as to the cause for this prostration might be indulge in without profit because as many theory would be advance as there would be independent writer those who express their own view without borrow upon the subject without indulge in theory as to the cause of this prostration therefore i will call your attention only to the fact and to some plain question as to which it would seem there should be no disagreement during this prostration two essential element of prosperity have be most abundant labor and capital both have be largely unemployed where security have be undoubted capital have be attainable at very moderate rate where labor have be want it have be find in abundance at cheap rate compare with what of necessary and comfort of life could be purchase with the wage demand two great element of prosperity therefore have not be deny we a third might be add our soil and climate be unequale within the limit of any contiguous territory under one nationality for its variety of product to feed and clothe a people and in the amount of surplus to spare to feed less favor people therefore with these fact in view it seem to i that wise statesmanship at this session of congress would dictate legislation ignore the past direct in proper channel these great element of prosperity to any people debt debt abroad be the only element that can with always a sound currency enter into our affair to cause any continue depression in the industry and prosperity of our people a great conflict for national existence make necessary for temporary purpose the raising of large sum of money from whatever source attainable it make it necessary in the wisdom of congress and i do not doubt their wisdom in the premise regard the necessity of the time to devise a system of national currency which it prove to be impossible to keep on a par with the recognize currency of the civilized world this beget a spirit of speculation involve an extravagance and luxury not require for the happiness or prosperity of a people and involve both directly and indirectly foreign indebtedness the currency be of fluctuate value and therefore unsafe to hold for legitimate transaction require money become a subject of speculation within itself these two cause however have involve we in a foreign indebtedness contract in good faith by borrower and lender which should be pay in coin and accord to the bond agree upon when the debt be contract gold or its equivalent the good faith of the government can not be violate toward creditor without national disgrace but our commerce should be encourage american shipbuilding and carrying capacity increase foreign market seek for product of the soil and manufactory to the end that we may be able to pay these debt where a new market can be create for the sale of our product either of the soil the mine or the manufactory a new mean be discover of utilize our idle capital and labor to the advantage of the whole people but in my judgment the first step toward accomplish this object be to secure a currency of fix stable value a currency good wherever civilization reign one which if it become superabundant with one people will find a market with some other a currency which have as its basis the labor necessary to produce it which will give to it its value gold and silver be now the recognize medium of exchange the civilized world over and to this we should return with the least practicable delay in view of the pledge of the american congress when our present legal tender system be adopt and debt contract there should be no delay certainly no unnecessary delay in fix by legislation a method by which we will return to specie to the accomplishment of this end i invite your special attention i believe firmly that there can be no prosperous and permanent revival of business and industry until a policy be adopt with legislation to carry it out look to a return to a specie basis it be easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative class may think it of value to they to make so call money abundant until they can throw a portion of their burden upon other but even these i believe would be disappoint in the result if a course should be pursue which will keep in doubt the value of the legal tender medium of exchange a revival of productive industry be need by all class by none more than the holder of property of whatever sort with debt to liquidate from realization upon its sale but admit that these two class of citizen be to be benefit by expansion would it be honest to give it would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief would it not be just as honest and prudent to authorize each debtor to issue his own legal tender to the extent of his liability than to do this would it not be safe for fear of overissue by unscrupulous creditor to say that all debt obligation be obliterate in the united states and now we commence anew each possess all he have at the time free from incumbrance these proposition be too absurd to be entertain for a moment by think or honest people yet every delay in preparation for final resumption partake of this dishonesty and be only less in degree as the hope be hold out that a convenient season will at last arrive for the good work of redeem our pledge to commence it will never come in my opinion except by positive action by congress or by national disaster which will destroy for a time at least the credit of the individual and the state at large a sound currency might be reach by total bankruptcy and discredit of the integrity of the nation and of individual i believe it be in the power of congress at this session to devise such legislation as will renew confidence revive all the industry start we on a career of prosperity to last for many year and to save the credit of the nation and of the people step toward the return to a specie basis be the great requisite to this devoutly to be seek for end there be other which i may touch upon hereafter a nation deal in a currency below that of specie in value labor under two great disadvantage first have no use for the world 's acknowledge medium of exchange gold and silver these be drive out of the country because there be no need for their use second the medium of exchange in use being of a fluctuating value for after all it be only worth just what it will purchase of gold and silver metal have an intrinsic value just in proportion to the honest labor it take to produce they a large margin must be allow for profit by the manufacturer and producer it be month from the date of production to the date of realization interest upon capital must be charge and risk of fluctuation in the value of that which be to be receive in payment add hence high price act as a protection to the foreign producer who receive nothing in exchange for the product of his skill and labor except a currency good at a stable value the world over it seem to i that nothing be clear than that the great part of the burden of exist prostration for the want of a sound financial system fall upon the work man who must after all produce the wealth and the salaried man who superintend and conduct business the burden fall upon they in two way by the deprivation of employment and by the decrease purchasing power of their salary it be the duty of congress to devise the method of correct the evil which be acknowledge to exist and not mine but i will venture to suggest two or three thing which seem to i as absolutely necessary to a return to specie payment the first great requisite in a return to prosperity the legal tender clause to the law authorize the issue of currency by the national government should be repeal to take effect as to all contract enter into after a day fix in the repeal act not to apply however to payment of salary by government or for other expenditure now provide by law to be pay in currency in the interval pende between repeal and final resumption provision should be make by which the secretary of the treasury can obtain gold as it may become necessary from time to time from the date when specie redemption commence to this might and should be add a revenue sufficiently in excess of expense to insure an accumulation of gold in the treasury to sustain permanent redemption i commend this subject to your careful consideration believe that a favorable solution be attainable and if reach by this congress that the present and future generation will ever gratefully remember it as their deliverer from a thraldom of evil and disgrace with resumption free banking may be authorize with safety give the same full protection to bill holder which they have under exist law indeed i would regard free banking as essential it would give proper elasticity to the currency as more currency should be require for the transaction of legitimate business new bank would be start and in turn bank would wind up their business when it be find that there be a superabundance of currency the experience and judgment of the people can well decide just how much currency be require for the transaction of the business of the country it be unsafe to leave the settlement of this question to congress the secretary of the treasury or the executive congress should make the regulation under which bank may exist but should not make banking a monopoly by limit the amount of redeemable paper currency that shall be authorize such importance do i attach to this subject and so earnestly do i commend it to your attention that i give it prominence by introduce it at the beginning of this message during the past year nothing have occur to disturb the general friendly and cordial relation of the united states with other power the correspondence submit herewith between this government and its diplomatic representative as also with the representative of other country show a satisfactory condition of all question between the united states and the most of those country and with few exception to which reference be hereafter make the absence of any point of difference to be adjust the notice direct by the resolution of congress of june 17 1874 to be give to terminate the convention of july 17 1858 between the united states and belgium have be give and the treaty will accordingly terminate on the 1st day of july 1875 this convention secure to certain belgian vessel enter the port of the united states exceptional privilege which be not accord to our own vessel other feature of the convention have prove satisfactory and have tend to the cultivation of mutually beneficial commercial intercourse and friendly relation between the two country i hope that negotiation which have be invite will result in the celebration of another treaty which may tend to the interest of both country our relation with china continue to be friendly during the past year the fear of hostility between china and japan grow out of the landing of an armed force upon the island of formosa by the latter have occasion uneasiness it be earnestly hope however that the difficulty arise from this cause will be adjust and that the advance of civilization in these empires may not be retard by a state of war in consequence of the part take by certain citizen of the united states in this expedition our representative in those country have be instruct to impress upon the government of china and japan the firm intention of this country to maintain strict neutrality in the event of hostility and to carefully prevent any infraction of law on the part of our citizen in connection with this subject i call the attention of congress to a generally concede fact that the great proportion of the chinese immigrant who come to our shore do not come voluntarily to make their home with we and their labor productive of general prosperity but come under contract with headman who own they almost absolutely in a bad form do this apply to chinese woman hardly a perceptible percentage of they perform any honorable labor but they be bring for shameful purpose to the disgrace of the community where settle and to the great demoralization of the youth of those locality if this evil practice can be legislate against it will be my pleasure as well as duty to enforce any regulation to secure so desirable an end it be hope that negotiation between the government of japan and the treaty power look to the further opening of the empire and to the removal of various restriction upon trade and travel may soon produce the result desire which can not fail to inure to the benefit of all the party having on previous occasion submit to the consideration of congress the propriety of the release of the japanese government from the further payment of the indemnity under the convention of october 22 1864 and as no action have be take thereon it become my duty to regard the obligation of the convention as in force and as the other power interested have receive their portion of the indemnity in full the minister of the united states in japan have in behalf of this government receive the remainder of the amount due to the united states under the convention of simonosaki i submit the propriety of apply the income of a part if not of the whole of this fund to the education in the japanese language of a number of young man to be under obligation to serve the government for a specify time as interpreter at the legation and the consulate in japan a limited number of japanese youth might at the same time be educate in our own vernacular and mutual benefit would result to both government the importance of have our own citizen competent and familiar with the language of japan to act as interpreter and in other capacity connect with the legation and the consulate in that country can not readily be overestimate the amount award to the government of great britain by the mixed commission organize under the provision of the treaty of washington in settlement of the claim of british subject arise from act commit between april 13 1861 and april 9 1865 become payable under the term of the treaty within the past year and be pay upon the 21st day of september 1874 in this connection i renew my recommendation make at the opening of the last session of congress that a special court be create to hear and determine all claim of alien against the united states arise from act commit against their person or property during the insurrection it appear equitable that opportunity should be offer to citizen of other state to present their claim as well as to those british subject whose claim be not admissible under the late commission to the early decision of some competent tribunal to this end i recommend the necessary legislation to organize a court to dispose of all claim of alien of the nature refer to in an equitable and satisfactory manner and to relieve congress and the departments from the consideration of these question the legislation necessary to extend to the colony of newfoundland certain article of the treaty of washington of the 8th day of may 1871 having be have a protocol to that effect be sign in behalf of the united states and of great britain on the 28th day of may last and be duly proclaim on the following day a copy of the proclamation be submit herewith a copy of the report of the commissioner appoint under the act of march 19 1872 for survey and mark the boundary between the united states and the british possession from the lake of the woods to the summit of the rocky mountains be herewith transmit i be happy to announce that the field work of the commission have be complete and the entire line from the northw corner of the lake of the woods to the summit of the rocky mountains have be run and mark upon the surface of the earth it be believe that the amount remain unexpended of the appropriation make at the last session of congress will be sufficient to complete the office work i recommend that the authority of congress be give to the use of the unexpended balance of the appropriation in the completion of the work of the commission in make its report and prepare the necessary map the court know as the court of commissioners of alabama claims create by an act of congress of the last session have organize and commence its work and it be to be hope that the claim admissible under the provision of the act may be speedily ascertain and pay it have be deem advisable to exercise the discretion confer upon the executive at the last session by accept the condition require by the government of turkey for the privilege of allow citizen of the united states to hold real estate in the former country and by assent to a certain change in the jurisdiction of court in the latter a copy of the proclamation upon these subject be herewith communicate there have be no material change in our relation with the independent states of this hemisphere which be formerly under the dominion of spain maraud on the frontier between mexico and texas still frequently take place despite the vigilance of the civil and military authority in that quarter the difficulty of check such trespass along the course of a river of such length as the rio grande and so often fordable be obvious it be hope that the effort of this government will be second by those of mexico to the effectual suppression of these act of wrong from a report upon the condition of the business before the american and mexican joint claims commission make by the agent on the part of the united states and date october 28 1874 it appear that of the 1,017 claim file on the part of citizen of the united states 483 have be finally decide and 75 be in the hand of the umpire leave 462 to be dispose of and of the 998 claim file against the united states 726 have be finally decide i be before the umpire and 271 remain to be dispose of since the date of such report other claim have be dispose of reduce somewhat the number still pende and other have be pass upon by the arbitrator it have become apparent in view of these figure and of the fact that the work devolving on the umpire be particularly laborious that the commission will be unable to dispose of the entire number of claim pende prior to the 1st day of february 1875 -the date fix for its expiration negotiation be pende look to the securing of the result of the decision which have be reach and to a further extension of the commission for a limited time which it be confidently hope will suffice to bring all the business now before it to a final close the strife in the argentine republic be to be deplore both on account of the party thereto and from the probable effect on the interest of those engage in the trade to that quarter of whom the united states be among the principal as yet so far as i be aware there have be no violation of our neutrality right which as well as our duty in that respect it shall be my endeavor to maintain and observe it be with regret i announce that no further payment have be receive from the government of venezuela on account of award in favor of citizen of the united states hope have be entertain that if that republic could escape both foreign and civil war for a few year its great natural resource would enable it to honor its obligation though it be now understand to be at peace with other country a serious insurrection be report to be in progress in an important region of that republic this may be take advantage of as another reason to delay the payment of the due of our citizen the deplorable strife in cuba continue without any marked change in the relative advantage of the contend force the insurrection continue but spain have gain no superiority six year of strife give to the insurrection a significance which can not be deny its duration and the tenacity of its adherence together with the absence of manifest power of suppression on the part of spain can not be controvert and may make some positive step on the part of other power a matter of self necessity i have confidently hope at this time to be able to announce the arrangement of some of the important question between this government and that of spain but the negotiation have be protract the unhappy intestine dissension of spain command our profound sympathy and must be accept as perhaps a cause of some delay an early settlement in part at least of the question between the government be hope in the meantime await the result of immediately pende negotiation i defer a further and full communication on the subject of the relation of this country and spain i have again to call the attention of congress to the unsatisfactory condition of the exist law with reference to expatriation and the election of nationality formerly amid conflicting opinion and decision it be difficult to exactly determine how far the doctrine of perpetual allegiance be applicable to citizen of the united states congress by the act of the 27th of july 1868 assert the abstract right of expatriation as a fundamental principle of this government notwithstanding such assertion and the necessity of frequent application of the principle no legislation have be have define what act or formality shall work expatriation or when a citizen shall be deem to have renounce or to have lose his citizenship the importance of such definition be obvious the representative of the united states in foreign country be continually call upon to lend their aid and the protection of the united states to person concern the good faith or the reality of whose citizenship there be at least great question in some case the provision of the treaty furnish some guide in other it seem leave to the person claim the benefit of citizenship while live in a foreign country contribute in no manner to the performance of the duty of a citizen of the united states and without intention at any time to return and undertake those duty to use the claim to citizenship of the united states simply as a shield from the performance of the obligation of a citizen elsewhere the status of child bear of american parent reside in a foreign country of american woman who have marry alien of american citizen reside abroad where such question be not regulate by treaty be all source of frequent difficulty and discussion legislation on these and similar question and particularly define when and under what circumstance expatriation can be accomplish or be to be presume be especially need in this connection i earnestly call the attention of congress to the difficulty arise from fraudulent naturalization the united states wisely freely and liberally offer its citizenship to all who may come in good faith to reside within its limit on their complying with certain prescribe reasonable and simple formality and condition among the high duty of the government be that to afford firm sufficient and equal protection to all its citizen whether native bear or naturalize care should be take that a right carrying with it such support from the government should not be fraudulently obtain and should be bestow only upon full proof of a compliance with the law and yet frequent instance be bring to the attention of the government of illegal and fraudulent naturalization and of the unauthorized use of certificate thus improperly obtain in some case the fraudulent character of the naturalization have appear upon the face of the certificate itself in other examination disclose that the holder have not comply with the law and in other certificate have be obtain where the person hold they not only be not entitle to be naturalize but have not even be within the united states at the time of the pretend naturalization instance of each of these class of fraud be discover at our legation where the certificate of naturalization be present either for the purpose of obtain passport or in demand the protection of the legation when the fraud be apparent on the face of such certificate they be take up by the representative of the government and forward to the department of state but even then the record of the court in which the fraudulent naturalization occur remain and duplicate certificate be readily obtainable upon the presentation of these for the issue of passport or in demand protection of the government the fraud sometimes escape notice and such certificate be not infrequently use in transaction of business to the deception and injury of innocent party without place any additional obstacle in the way of the obtainment of citizenship by the worthy and well intentione foreigner who come in good faith to cast his lot with ours i earnestly recommend further legislation to punish fraudulent naturalization and to secure the ready cancellation of the record of every naturalization make in fraud since my last annual message the exchange have be make of the ratification of treaty of extradition with belgium ecuador peru and salvador also of a treaty of commerce and navigation with peru and one of commerce and consular privilege with salvador all of which have be duly proclaim as have also a declaration with russia with reference to trade mark the report of the secretary of the treasury which by law be make directly to congress and form no part of this message will show the receipt and expenditure of the government for the last fiscal year the amount receive from each source of revenue and the amount pay out for each of the departments of government it will be observe from this report that the amount of receipt over expenditure have be but $ 2,344,882.30 for the fiscal year end june 30 1874 and that for the current fiscal year the estimate receipt over expenditure will not much exceed $ 9,000,000 in view of the large national debt exist and the obligation to add 1 per cent per annum to the sink fund a sum amount now to over $ 34,000,000 per annum i submit whether revenue should not be increase or expenditure diminish to reach this amount of surplus not to provide for the sink fund be a partial failure to comply with the contract and obligation of the government at the last session of congress a very considerable reduction be make in rate of taxation and in the number of article submit to taxation the question may well be ask whether or not in some instance unwisely in connection with this subject too i venture the opinion that the mean of collect the revenue especially from import have be so embarrassed by legislation as to make it questionable whether or not large amount be not lose by failure to collect to the direct loss of the treasury and to the prejudice of the interest of honest importer and taxpayer the secretary of the treasury in his report favor legislation look to an early return to specie payment thus support view previously express in this message he also recommend economy in appropriation call attention to the loss of revenue from repeal the tax on tea and coffee without benefit to the consumer recommend an increase of 10 cent a gallon on whisky and far that no modification be make in the banking and currency bill pass at the last session of congress unless modification should become necessary by reason of the adoption of measure for return to specie payment in these recommendation i cordially join i would suggest to congress the propriety of readjust the tariff so as to increase the revenue and at the same time decrease the number of article upon which duty be levied those article which enter into our manufacture and be not produce at home it seem to i should be enter free those article of manufacture which we produce a constituent part of but do not produce the whole that part which we do not produce should enter free also i will instance fine wool dye etc these article must be import to form a part of the manufacture of the high grade of woolen good chemical use as dye compound in medicine and use in various way in manufacture come under this class the introduction free of duty of such wool as we do not produce would stimulate the manufacture of good require the use of those we do produce and therefore would be a benefit to home production there be many article enter into home manufacture which we do not produce ourselves the tariff upon which increase the cost of produce the manufactured article all correction in this regard be in the direction of bring labor and capital in harmony with each other and of supply one of the element of prosperity so much need the report of the secretary of war herewith attach and form a part of this message give all the information concern the operation want and necessity of the army and contain many suggestion and recommendation which i commend to your special attention there be no class of government employee who be hard work than the army officer and man none who perform their task more cheerfully and efficiently and under circumstance of great privation and hardship legislation be desirable to render more efficient this branch of the public service all the recommendation of the secretary of war i regard as judicious and i especially commend to your attention the following the consolidation of government arsenal the restoration of mileage to officer travel under order the exemption of money receive from the sale of subsistence store from be cover into the treasury the use of appropriation for the purchase of subsistence store without wait for the beginning of the fiscal year for which the appropriation be make for additional appropriation for the collection of torpedo material for increase appropriation for the manufacture of arm for relieve the various states from indebtedness for arm charge to they during the rebellion for drop officer from the roll of the army without trial for the offense of draw pay more than once for the same period for the discouragement of the plan to pay soldier by cheek and for the establishment of a professorship of rhetoric and english literature at west point the reason for these recommendation be obvious and be set forth sufficiently in the report attach i also recommend that the status of the staff corps of the army be fix where this have not already be do so that promotion may be make and vacancy fill as they occur in each grade when reduce below the number to be fix by law the necessity for such legislation be specially feel now in the pay department the number of officer in that department be below the number adequate to the performance of the duty require of they by law the efficiency of the navy have be largely increase during the last year under the impulse of the foreign complication which threaten we at the commencement of the last session of congress most of our efficient wooden ship be put in condition for immediate service and the repair of our ironclad fleet be push with the utmost vigor the result be that most of these be now in an effective state and need only to be man and put in commission to go at once into service some of the new sloop authorize by congress be already in commission and most of the remainder be launch and wait only the completion of their machinery to enable they to take their place as part of our effective force two iron torpedo ship have be complete during the last year and four of our large double turrete ironclad be now undergo repair when these be finish everything that be useful of our navy as now authorize will be in condition for service and with the advance in the science of torpedo warfare the american navy comparatively small as it be will be find at any time powerful for the purpose of a peaceful nation much have be accomplish during the year in aid of science and to increase the sum of general knowledge and far the interest of commerce and civilization extensive and much need sounding have be make for hydrographic purpose and to fix the proper route of ocean telegraphs further survey of the great isthmus have be undertake and complete and two vessel of the navy be now employ in conjunction with those of england france germany and russia in observation connect with the transit of venus so useful and interesting to the scientific world the estimate for this branch of the public service do not differ materially from those of last year those for the general support of the service be somewhat less and those for permanent improvement at the various station rather large than the correspond estimate make a year ago the regular maintenance and a steady increase in the efficiency of this most important arm in proportion to the growth of our maritime intercourse and interest be recommend to the attention of congress the use of the navy in time of peace might be far utilize by a direct authorization of the employment of naval vessel in exploration and survey of the suppose navigable water of other nationality on this continent especially the tributary of the two great river of south america the orinoco and the amazon nothing prevent under exist law such exploration except that expenditure must be make in such expedition beyond those usually provide for in the appropriation the field designate be unquestionably one of interest and one capable of large development of commercial interest advantageous to the people reach and to those who may establish relation with they education of the people entitle to exercise the right of franchise i regard essential to general prosperity everywhere and especially so in republic where birth education or previous condition do not enter into account in give suffrage next to the public school the post office be the great agent of education over our vast territory the rapidity with which new section be be settle thus increase the carrying of mail in a more rapid ratio than the increase of receipt be not alarming the report of the postmaster general herewith attach show that there be an increase of revenue in his department in 1873 over the previous year of $ 1,674,411 and an increase of cost of carry the mail and pay employee of $ 3,041,468.91 the report of the postmaster general give interesting statistic of his department and compare they with the correspond statistic of a year ago show a growth in every branch of the department a postal convention have be conclude with new south

august an international postal congress be convene in berne switzerland in september last at which the united states be represent by an officer of the post office department of much experience and of qualification for the position a convention for the establishment of an international postal union be agree upon and sign by the delegate of the country represent subject to the approval of the proper authority of those country i respectfully direct your attention to the report of the postmaster general and to his suggestion in regard to an equitable adjustment of the question of compensation to railroad for carry the mail your attention will be draw to the unsettled condition of affair in some of the southern states on the 14th of september last the governor of louisiana call upon i as provide by the constitution and law of the united states to aid in suppress domestic violence in that state this call be make in view of a proclamation issue on that day by d. b. penn claim that he be elect lieutenant governor in 1872 and call upon the militia of the state to arm assemble and drive from power the usurper as he designate the officer of the state government on the next day i issue my proclamation command the insurgent to disperse within five day from the date thereof and subsequently learn that on that day they have take forcible possession of the statehouse step be take by i to support the exist and recognize state government but before the expiration of the five day the insurrectionary movement be practically abandon and the officer of the state government with some minor exception resume their power and duty consider that the present state administration of louisiana have be the only government in that state for nearly two year that it have be tacitly acknowledge and acquiesce in as such by congress and more than once expressly recognize by i i regard it as my clear duty when legally call upon for that purpose to prevent its overthrow by an armed mob under pretense of fraud and irregularity in the election of 1872 i have heretofore call the attention of congress to this subject state that on account of the fraud and forgery commit at say election and because it appear that the return thereof be never legally canvass it be impossible to tell thereby who be choose but from the good source of information at my command i have always believe that the present state officer receive a majority of the legal vote actually cast at that election i repeat what i say in my special message of february 23 1873 that in the event of no action by congress i must continue to recognize the government heretofore recognize by i i regret to say that with preparation for the late election decide indication appear in some locality in the southern states of a determination by act of violence and intimidation to deprive citizen of the freedom of the ballot because of their political opinion band of man mask and arm make their appearance white leagues and other society be form large quantity of arm and ammunition be import and distribute to these organization military drill with menacing demonstration be hold and with all these murder enough be commit to spread terror among those whose political action be to be suppress if possible by these intolerant and criminal proceeding in some place color laborer be compel to vote accord to the wish of their employer under threat of discharge if they act otherwise and there be too many instance in which when these threat be disregard they be remorselessly execute by those who make they i understand that the fifteenth amendment to the constitution be make to prevent this and a like state of thing and the act of may 31 1870 with amendment be pass to enforce its provision the object of both be to guarantee to all citizen the right to vote and to protect they in the free enjoyment of that right enjoin by the constitution to take care that the law be faithfully execute and convince by undoubted evidence that violation of say act have be commit and that a widespread and flagrant disregard of it be contemplate the proper officer be instruct to prosecute the offender and troop be station at convenient point to aid these officer if necessary in the performance of their official duty complaint be make of this interference by federal authority but if say amendment and act do not provide for such interference under the circumstance as above state then they be without meaning force or effect and the whole scheme of colored enfranchisement be bad than mockery and little well than a crime possibly congress may find it due to truth and justice to ascertain by mean of a committee whether the allege wrong to colored citizen for political purpose be real or the report thereof be manufacture for the occasion the whole number of troop in the states of louisiana alabama georgia florida south carolina north carolina kentucky tennessee arkansas mississippi maryland and virginia at the time of the election be 4,082 this embrace the garrison of all the fort from the delaware to the gulf of mexico another trouble have arise in arkansas article 13 of the constitution of that state which be adopt in 1868 and upon the approval of which by congress the state be restore to representation as one of the states of the union provide in effect that before any amendment propose to this constitution shall become a part thereof they shall be pass by two successive assembly and then submit to and ratify by a majority of the elector of the state voting thereon on the 11th of may 1874 the governor convene an extra session of the general assembly of the state which on the 18th of the same month pass an act provide for a convention to frame a new constitution pursuant to this act and at an election hold on the 30th of june 1874 the convention be approve and delegate be choose thereto who assemble on the 14th of last july and frame a new constitution the schedule of which provide for the election of an entire new set of state officer in a manner contrary to the then exist election law of the state on the 13th of october 1874 this constitution as therein provide be submit to the people for their approval or rejection and accord to the election return be approve by a large majority of those qualified to vote thereon and at the same election person be choose to fill all the state county and township office the governor elect in 1872 for the term of four year turn over his office to the governor choose under the new constitution whereupon the lieutenant governor also elect in 1872 for a term of four year claim to act as governor and allege that say proceeding by which the new constitution be make and a new set of officer elect be unconstitutional illegal and void call upon i as provide in section 4 article iv of the constitution to protect the state against domestic violence as congress be now investigate the political affair of arkansas i have decline to interfere the whole subject of executive interference with the affair of a state be repugnant to public opinion to the feeling of those who from their official capacity must be use in such interposition and to he or those who must direct unless most clearly on the side of law such interference become a crime with the law to support it it be condemn without a heating i desire therefore that all necessity for executive direction in local affair may become unnecessary and obsolete i invite the attention not of congress but of the people of the united states to the cause and effect of these unhappy question be there not a disposition on one side to magnify wrong and outrage and on the other side to belittle they or justify they if public opinion could be direct to a correct survey of what be and to rebuke wrong and aid the proper authority in punish it a well state of feeling would be inculcate and the soon we would have that peace which would leave the states free indeed to regulate their own domestic affair i believe on the part of our citizen of the southern states the well part of they there be a disposition to be law abide and to do no violence either to individual or to the law exist but do they do right in ignore the existence of violence and bloodshed in resistance to constitute authority i sympathize with their prostrate condition and would do all in my power to relieve they acknowledge that in some instance they have have most try government to live under and very oppressive one in the way of taxation for nominal improvement not give benefit equal to the hardship impose but can they proclaim themselves entirely irresponsible for this condition they can not violence have be rampant in some locality and have either be justify or deny by those who could have prevent it the theory be even raise that there be to be no further interference on the part of the general government to protect citizen within a state where the state authority fail to give protection this be a great mistake while i remain executive all the law of congress and the provision of the constitution include the recent amendment add thereto will be enforce with rigor but with regret that they should have add one jot or tittle to executive duty or power let there be fairness in the discussion of southern question the advocate of both or all political party give honest truthful report of occurrence condemn the wrong and uphold the tight and soon all will be well under existing condition the negro vote the republican ticket because he know his friend be of that party many a good citizen vote the opposite not because he agree with the great principle of state which separate party but because generally he be oppose to negro rule this be a most delusive cry treat the negro as a citizen and a voter as he be and must remain and soon party will be divide not on the color line but on principle then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference the report of the attorney general contain valuable recommendation relate to the administration of justice in the court of the united states to which i invite your attention i respectfully suggest to congress the propriety of increase the number of judicial district in the united states to eleven the present number be nine and the creation of two additional judgeship the territory to be traverse by the circuit judge be so great and the business of the court so steadily increase that it be grow more and more impossible for they to keep up with the business require their attention whether this would involve the necessity of add two more justice of the supreme court to the present number i submit to the judgment of congress the attention of congress be invite to the report of the secretary of the interior and to the legislation ask for by he the domestic interest of the people be more intimately connect with this department than with either of the other departments of government its duty have be add to from time to time until they have become so onerous that without the most perfect system and order it will be impossible for any secretary of the interior to keep trace of all official transaction have his sanction and do in his name and for which he be hold personally responsible the policy adopt for the management of indian affair know as the peace policy have be adhere to with most beneficial result it be confidently hope that a few year more will relieve our frontier from danger of indian depredation i commend the recommendation of the secretary for the extension of the homestead law to the indians and for some sort of territorial government for the indian territory a great majority of the indians occupy this territory be believe yet to be incapable of maintain their right against the more civilized and enlighten white man any territorial form of government give they therefore should protect they in their home and property for a period of at least twenty year and before its final adoption should be ratify by a majority of those affect the report of the secretary of the interior herewith attach give much interesting statistical information which i abstain from give an abstract of but refer you to the report itself the act of congress provide the oath which pensioner must subscribe to before draw their pension cut off from this bounty a few survivor of the war of 1812 reside in the southern states i recommend the restoration of this bounty to all such the number of person whose name would thus be restore to the list of pensioner be not large they be all old person who could have take no part in the rebellion and the service for which they be award pension be in defense of the whole country the report of the commissioner of agriculture herewith contain suggestion of much interest to the general public and refer to the sly approach centennial and the part his department be ready to take in it i feel that the nation at large be interested in have this exposition a success and commend to congress such action as will secure a great general interest in it already many foreign nation have signify their intention to be represent at it and it may be expect that every civilized nation will be represent the rule adopt to improve the civil service of the government have be adhere to as closely as have be practicable with the opposition with which they meet the effect i believe have be beneficial on the whole and have tend to the elevation of the service but it be impracticable to maintain they without direct and positive support of congress generally the support which this reform receive be from those who give it their support only to find fault when the rule be apparently depart from removal from office without prefer charge against party remove be frequently cite as departure from the rule adopt and the retention of those against whom charge be make by irresponsible person and without good ground be also often condemn as a violation of they under these circumstance therefore i announce that if congress adjourn without positive legislation on the subject of civil service reform i will regard such action as a disapproval of the system and will abandon it except so far as to require examination for certain appointee to determine their fitness competitive examination will be abandon the gentleman who have give their service without compensation as member of the board to devise rule and regulation for the government of the civil service of the country have show much zeal and earnestness in their work and to they as well as to myself it will be a source of mortification if it be to be throw away but i repeat that it be impossible to carry this system to a successful issue without general approval and assistance and positive law to support it i have state that three element of prosperity to the nation capital labor skilled and unskilled and product of the soil still remain with we to direct the employment of these be a problem deserve the most serious attention of congress if employment can be give to all the labor offer itself prosperity necessarily follow i have express the opinion and repeat it that the first requisite to the accomplishment of this end be the substitution of a sound currency in place of one of a fluctuating value this secure there be many interest that might be foster to the great profit of both labor and capital how to induce capital to employ labor be the question the subject of cheap transportation have occupy the attention of congress much new light on this question will without doubt be give by the committee appoint by the last congress to investigate and report upon this subject a revival of shipbuilding and particularly of iron steamship building be of vast importance to our national prosperity the united states be now pay over $ 100,000,000 per annum for freight and passage on foreign ship to be carry abroad and expend in the employment and support of other people beyond a fair percentage of what should go to foreign vessel estimate on the tonnage and travel of each respectively it be to be regret that this disparity in the carry trade exist and to correct it i would be willing to see a great departure from the usual course of government in support what might usually be term private enterprise i would not suggest as a remedy direct subsidy to american steamship line but i would suggest the direct offer of ample compensation for carry the mail between atlantic seaboard city and the continent on american own and american build steamer and would extend this liberality to vessel carry the mail to south american states and to central america and mexico and would pursue the same policy from our pacific seaport to foreign seaport on the pacific it might be demand that vessel build for this service should come up to a standard fix by legislation in tonnage speed and all other quality look to the possibility of government require they at some time for war purpose the right also of take possession of they in such emergency should be guard i offer these suggestion believe they worthy of consideration in all seriousness affect all section and all interest alike if anything well can be do to direct the country into a course of general prosperity no one will be more ready than i to second the plan forward herewith will be find the report of the commissioner appoint under an act of congress approve june 20 1874 to wind up the affair of the district government it will be see from the report that the net debt of the district of columbia less security on hand and available be bond debt issue prior to july 1 1874$8,883,940.933.65 bond act of congress june 20 18742,088,168.73certificates of the board of

be claim prefer against the government of the district amounting in the estimate aggregate report by the board of audit to $ 3,147,787.48 of which the great part will probably be reject this sum can with no more propriety be include in the debt account of the district government than can the thousand of claim against the general government be include as a portion of the national debt but the aggregate sum thus state include something more than the fund debt chargeable exclusively to the district of columbia the act of congress of june 20 1874 contemplate an apportionment between the united states government and the district of columbia in respect of the payment of the principal and interest of the 3.65 bond therefore in compute with precision the bond debt of the district the aggregate sum above state as respect 3.65 bond now issue the outstanding certificate of the board of audit and the unadjusted claim pende before that board should be reduce to the extent of the amount to be apportion to the united states government in the manner indicate in the act of congress of june 20 1874.i especially invite your attention to the recommendation of the commissioner of the sink fund relative to the ambiguity of the act of june 20 1874 the interest on the district bond and the consolidation of the indebtedness of the district i feel much indebted to the gentleman who consent to leave their private affair and come from a distance to attend to the business of this district and for the able and satisfactory manner in which it have be conduct i be sure their service will be equally appreciate by the entire country it will be see from the accompany full report of the board of health that the sanitary condition of the district be very satisfactory in my opinion the district of columbia should be regard as the ground of the national capital in which the entire people be interested i do not allude to this to urge generous appropriation to the district but to draw the attention of congress in frame a law for the government of the district to the magnificent scale on which the city be plan by the founder of the government the manner in which for ornamental purpose the reservation street and avenue be lay out and the proportion of the property actually possess by the general government i think the proportion of the expense of the government and improvement to be bear by the general government the city of washington and georgetown and the county should be carefully and equitably define in accordance with section 3 act approve june 23 1874 i appoint a board to make a survey of the mouth of the mississippi river with a view to determine the good method of obtain and maintain a depth of water sufficient for the purpose of commerce etc and in accordance with an act entitle an act to provide for the appointment of a commission of engineer to investigate and report a permanent plan for the reclamation of the alluvial basin of the mississippi river subject to inundation i appoint a commission of engineer neither board have yet complete its labor when their report be receive they will be forward to congress without delay
