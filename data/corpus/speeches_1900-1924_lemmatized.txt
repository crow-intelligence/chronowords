meanwhile foreign activity make itself feel in all quarter not alone on the coast but along the great river artery and in the remoter district carry new idea and introduce new association among a primitive people which have pursue for century a national policy of isolation the telegraph and the railway spread over their land the steamer ply on their waterway the merchant and the missionary penetrate year by year far to the interior become to the chinese mind type of an alien invasion change the course of their national life and fraught with vague foreboding of disaster to their belief and their self control for several year before the present trouble all the resource of foreign diplomacy back by moral demonstration of the physical force of fleet and arm have be need to secure due respect for the treaty right of foreigner and to obtain satisfaction from the responsible authority for the sporadic outrage upon the person and property of unoffending sojourner which from time to time occur at widely separate point in the northern province as in the case of the outbreak in sze chuen and shan tung posting of antiforeign placard become a daily occurrence which the repeat reprobation of the imperial power fail to check or punish these inflammatory appeal to the ignorance and superstition of the masse mendacious and absurd in their accusation and deeply hostile in their spirit could not but work cumulative harm they aim at no particular class of foreigner they be impartial in attack everything foreign an outbreak in shan tung in which german missionary be slay be the too natural result of these malevolent teaching the posting of seditious placard exhort to the utter destruction of foreigner and of every foreign thing continue unrebuked hostile demonstration toward the stranger gain strength by organization the sect commonly style the boxers develop greatly in the province north of the yang tse and with the collusion of many notable official include some in the

interested power on march 20 1900 i hopefully discern a potential factor for the abatement of the distrust of foreign purpose which for a year past have appear to inspire the policy of the imperial

testify confidence in the willingness and ability of the imperial administration to redress the wrong and prevent the evil we suffer and fear the marine guard which have be send to peking in the

chinese emperor have be considerately entertain the russian proposition look to the restoration of the imperial power in peking have be accept as in full consonance with our own desire for we have hold and hold that effective reparation for wrong suffer and an endure settlement that will make their recurrence impossible can well be bring about under an authority which the chinese nation reverence and obey while so do we forego no jot of our undoubted right to exact exemplary and deterrent punishment of the responsible author and abettor of the criminal act whereby we and other nation have suffer grievous injury for the real culprit the evil counselor who have mislead the imperial judgment and divert the sovereign authority to their own guilty end full expiation become imperative within the rational limit of retributive justice regard this as the initial condition of an acceptable settlement between china and the power i say in my message of october 18 to the chinese emperor i trust that negotiation may begin so soon as we and the other offend government shall be effectively satisfied of your majesty 's ability and power to treat with just sternness the principal offender who be doubly culpable not alone toward the foreigner but toward your majesty under whose rule the purpose of china to dwell in concord with the world have hitherto find expression in the welcome and

question involve assure foreign right of residence and intercourse on term of equality for all the world i regard as one of the essential factor of a durable adjustment the securement of adequate guarantee for liberty of faith since insecurity of those native who may embrace alien creed be a scarcely less effectual assault upon the right of foreign worship and teaching than would be the direct invasion thereof the matter of indemnity for our wronged citizen be a question of grave concern measure in money alone a sufficient reparation may prove to be beyond the ability of china to meet all the power concur in emphatic disclaimer of any purpose of aggrandizement through the dismemberment of the empire i be disposed to think that due compensation may be make in part by increase guarantee of security for foreign right and immunity and most important of all by the opening of china to the equal commerce of all the world these view have be and will be earnestly advocate by our representative the government of russia have put forward a suggestion that in the event of protract divergence of view in regard to indemnity the matter may be relegate to the court of arbitration at the hague i favorably incline to this believe that high tribunal could not fail to reach a solution no less conducive to the stability and enlarge prosperity of china itself than immediately beneficial to the power ratification of a treaty of extradition with the argentine republic be exchange on june 2 last while the austro hungarian government have in the many case that have be report

important question a condition unusual in international war be present in that while one belligerent have control of the sea the other have no port shipping or direct trade but be only accessible through the territory of a neutral vexatious question arise through great britain 's action in respect to neutral cargo not contraband in their own nature ship to portuguese south africa on the score of probable or suspect ultimate destination to the boer states such consignment in british ship by which alone direct trade be keep up between our port and southern africa be seize in application of a

alleged destination to enemy 's country appropriate representation on our part result in the british government agree to purchase outright all such good show to be the actual property of american

regulation for securing to our citizen the benefit of the reciprocal stipulation that the citizen or subject of either power find by that arrangement within the temporary jurisdiction of the other shall suffer no diminution of the right and privilege they have hitherto enjoy but however necessary such an expedient may have be to tide over the grave emergency of the situation it be at good but an unsatisfactory makeshift which should not be suffer to delay the speedy and complete establishment of the frontier line to which we be entitle under the russo american treaty for the cession of alaska in this relation i may refer again to the need of definitely mark the alaskan boundary where it follow the one hundred and forty first meridian a convention to that end have be before the senate for some two year but as no action have be take i contemplate negotiate a new convention for a joint determination of the meridian by telegraphic observation these it be believe will give more accurate and unquestionable result than the sidereal method heretofore independently follow which as be know prove discrepant at several point on the line although not vary at any place more than 700 feetthe pende claim of r. h. may against the guatemalan government have be settle by arbitration mr. george f. b. jenner british minister at guatemala who be choose as sole arbitrator having award $

offense against our civilization and the repeat inquest set on foot by the authority of the state of louisiana no punishment have follow successive grand jury have fail to indict the representation of the italian government in the face of this miscarriage have be most temperate and just set the principle at issue high above all consideration of merely pecuniary indemnification such as this government make in the three previous case italy have solemnly invoke the pledge of exist treaty and ask that the justice to which she be entitle shall be mete in regard to her unfortunate countryman in our territory with the same full measure she herself would give to any american be his reciprocal treaty right contemn i renew the urgent recommendation i make last year that the congress appropriately confer upon the federal court jurisdiction in this class of international case where the ultimate responsibility of the federal government may be involve and i invite action upon the bill to accomplish this which be introduce in the sen. eat and house it be incumbent upon we to remedy the statutory omission which have lead and may again lead to such untoward result i have point out the necessity and the precedent for legislation of this character its enactment be a simple measure of previsory justice toward the nation with which we as a sovereign equal make treaty require reciprocal observance while the italian government naturally regard such action as the primary and indeed the most essential element in the disposal of the tallulah incident i advise that in accordance with precedent and in view of the improbability of that particular case be reach by the bill now pende congress make gracious provision for indemnity to the italian sufferer in the same form and proportion as heretofore in my inaugural address i refer to the general subject of lynch in these word lynching must not be tolerate in a great and civilized country like the united states court not mob must execute the penalty of the law the preservation of public order the right of discussion the integrity of court and the orderly administration of justice must continue forever the rock of safety upon which our government securely rest this i most urgently reiterate and again invite the attention of my countryman to this reproach upon our civilization the closing year have

consumption which in 1900 form 15.17 per cent of the total import against 15.54 per cent in 1899 and 21.09 per cent in 1896.i recommend that the congress at its present session reduce the internal revenue taxis impose to meet the expense of the war with spain in the sum of thirty million of dollar this reduction should be secure by the remission of those taxis which experience have show to be the most burdensome to the industry of the people i specially urge that there be include in whatever reduction be make the legacy tax on bequest for public use of a literary educational or charitable character american vessel during the past three year have carry about 9 per cent of our export and import foreign ship should carry the least not the great part of american trade the remarkable growth of our steel industry the progress of shipbuilding for the domestic trade and our steadily maintain expenditure for the navy have create an opportunity to place the united states in the 6rst rank of commercial maritime power besides realize a proper national aspiration this will mean the establishment and healthy growth along all our coast of a distinctive national industry expand the field for the profitable employment of labor and capital it will increase the transportation facility and reduce freight charge on the vast volume of product bring from the interior to the seaboard for export and will strengthen an arm of the national defense upon which the founder of the government and their successor have rely in again urge immediate action by the congress on measure to promote american shipping and foreign trade i direct attention to the recommendation on the subject in previous message and particularly to the opinion express in the message of 1899 i be satisfied the judgment of the country favor the policy of aid to our merchant marine which will broaden our commerce and market and upbuild our sea carry capacity for the product of agriculture and manufacture which with the increase of our navy mean more work and wage to our countryman as well as a safeguard to american interest in every part of the world the attention of the congress be invite to the recommendation of the secretary of the treasury in his annual report for legislation in behalf of the revenue cutter service and favorable action be urge in my last annual message to the congress i call attention to the necessity for early action to remedy such evil as might be find to exist in connection with combination of capital organize into trust and again invite attention to my discussion of the subject at that time which conclude with these word it be apparent that uniformity of legislation upon this subject in the several states be much to be desire it be to be hope that such uniformity found in a wise and just discrimination between what be injurious and what be useful and necessary in business operation may be obtain and that mean may be find for the congress within the limitation of its constitutional power so to supplement an effective code of state legislation as to make a complete system of law throughout the united states adequate to compel a general observance of the salutary rule to which i have refer the whole question be so important and far reach that i be sure no part of it will be lightly consider but every phase of it will have the study deliberation of the congress result in wise and judicious action restraint upon such combination as be injurious and which be within federal jurisdiction should be promptly apply by the congress in my last annual message i dwelt at some length upon the condition of affair in the philippines while seek to impress upon you that the grave responsibility of the future government of those island rest with the congress of the united states i abstain from recommend at that time a specific and final form of government for the territory actually hold by the united states force and in which as long as insurrection continue the military arm must necessarily be supreme i state my purpose until the congress shall have make the formal expression of its will to use the authority vest in i by the constitution and the statute to uphold the sovereignty of the united states in those distant island as in all other place where our flag rightfully float place to that end at the disposal of the army and navy all the mean which the liberality of the congress and the people have provide no contrary expression of the will of the congress having be make i have steadfastly pursue the purpose so declare employ the civil arm as well toward the accomplishment of pacification and the institution of local government within the line of authority and law progress in the hope for direction have be favorable our force have successfully control the great part of the island overcome the organize force of the insurgent and carry order and administrative regularity to all quarter what opposition remain be for the most part scatter obey no concerted plan of strategic action operate only by the method common to the tradition of guerrilla warfare which while ineffective to alter the general control now establish be still sufficient to beget insecurity among the population that have feel the good result of our control and thus delay the conferment upon they of the full measure of local self government of education and of industrial and agricultural development which we stand ready to give to they by the spring of this year the effective opposition of the dissatisfied tagals to the authority of the united states be virtually end thus open the door for the extension of a stable administration over much of the territory of the archipelago desire to bring this about i appoint in march last a civil commission compose of the hon william h. taft of ohio prof. dean c. worcester of michigan the hon luke i. wright of tennessee the hon henry c. ide of vermont and prof. bernard moses of california the aim of their mission and the scope of their authority be clearly set forth in my instruction of april 7 1900 address to the secretary of war to be transmit to they in the message transmit to the congress on the 5th of december 1899 1 say sneaking of the philippine islands 11 as long as the insurrection continue the military arm must necessarily be supreme but there be no reason why step should not be take from time to time to inaugurate government essentially popular in their form as fast as territory be hold and control by our troop to this end i be consider the advisability of the return of the commission or such of the member thereof as can be secure to aid the exist authority and facilitate this work throughout the island "to give effect to the intention thus express i have appoint hon william h. taft of ohio prof. dean c. worcester of michigan non luke i. wright of tennessee hon henry c. ide of vermont and prof. bernard moses of california commissioners to the philippine islands to continue and perfect the work of organize and establish civil government already commence by the military authority subject in all respect to any law which congress may hereafter enact the commissioners name will meet and act as a board and the hon william h. taft t be designate as president of the board it be probable that the transfer of authority from military commander to civil officer will be gradual and will occupy a considerable period its successful accomplishment and the maintenance of peace and order in the meantime will require the most perfect co operation between the civil and military authority in the island and both should be direct during the transition period by the same executive department the commission will therefore report to the secretary of war and all their action will be subject to your approval and control you will instruct the commission to proceed to the city of manila where they will make their principal office and to communicate with the military governor of the philippine islands whom you will at the same time direct to render to they every assistance within his power in the performance of their duty without hamper they by too specific instruction they should in general be enjoin after make themselves familiar with the condition and need of the country to devote their attention in the first instance to the establishment of municipal government in which the native of the island both in the city and in the rural community shall be afford the opportunity to manage their own local affair to the full extent of which they be capable and subject to the least degree of supervision and control which a careful study of their capacity and observation of the working of native control show to be consistent with the maintenance of law order and loyalty the next

 do at the city of washington the fourteenth day of september a. d. 1901 and of the independence of the united states the one hundred and twenty sixth

 theodore roosevelt
 by the president
 john hay
 secretary of state
to the senate and house of representatives

 the congress assemble this year under the shadow of a great calamity on the sixth of september president mckinley be shoot by an anarchist while attend the pan american exposition at buffalo and die in that city on the fourteenth of that month

 of the last seven elect president he be the third who have be murder and the bare recital of this fact be sufficient to justify grave alarm among all loyal american citizen moreover the circumstance of this the third assassination of an american president have a peculiarly sinister significance both president lincoln and president garfield be kill by assassin of type unfortunately not uncommon in history president lincoln fall a victim to the terrible passion arouse by four year of civil war and president garfield to the revengeful vanity of a disappointed office seeker president mckinley be kill by an utterly deprave criminal belong to that body of criminal who object to all government good and bad alike who be against any form of popular liberty if it be guarantee by even the most just and liberal law and who be as hostile to the upright exponent of a free people&#39; sober will as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot

 it be not too much to say that at the time of president mckinley&#39;s death he be the most widely love man in all the united states while we have never have any public man of his position who have be so wholly free from the bitter animosity incident to public life his political opponent be the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature the sweetness and gentleness of character which so endear he to his close associate to a standard of lofty integrity in public life he unite the tender affection and home virtue which be all important in the make up of national character a gallant soldier in the great war for the union he also shine as an example to all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate of home relation there could be no personal hatred of he for he never act with aught but consideration for the welfare of other no one could fail to respect he who know he in public or private life the defender of those murderous criminal who seek to excuse their criminality by assert that it be exercise for political end inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power but for this assassination even this base apology can not be urge

 president mckinley be a man of moderate mean a man whose stock spring from the sturdy tiller of the soil who have himself belong among the wage worker who have enter the army as a private soldier wealth be not strike at when the president be assassinate but the honest toil which be content with moderate gain after a lifetime of unremitting labor largely in the service of the public still less be power strike at in the sense that power be irresponsible or center in the hand of any one individual the blow be not aim at tyranny or wealth it be aim at one of the strong champion the wage worker have ever have at one of the most faithful representative of the system of public right and representative government who have ever rise to public office president mckinley fill that political office for which the entire people vote and no president not even lincoln himself be ever more earnestly anxious to represent the well think out wish of the people his one anxiety in every crisis be to keep in close touch with the people to find out what they think and to endeavor to give expression to their thought after having endeavor to guide that thought aright he have just be reelect to the presidency because the majority of our citizen the majority of our farmer and wage worker believe that he have faithfully uphold their interest for four year they feel themselves in close and intimate touch with he they feel that he represent so well and so honorably all their ideal and aspiration that they wish he to continue for another four year to represent they

 and this be the man at whom the assassin strike that there might be nothing lack to complete the judas like infamy of his act he take advantage of an occasion when the president be meet the people generally and advance as if to take the hand out stretch to he in kindly and brotherly fellowship he turn the noble and generous confidence of the victim into an opportunity to strike the fatal blow there be no base deed in all the annal of crime

 the shock the grief of the country be bitter in the mind of all who see the dark day while the president yet hover between life and death at last the light be still in the kindly eye and the breath go from the lip that even in mortal agony utter no word save of forgiveness to his murderer of love for his friend and of falter trust in the will of the most high such a death crown the glory of such a life leave we with infinite sorrow but with such pride in what he have accomplish and in his own personal character that we feel the blow not as strike at he but as strike at the nation we mourn a good and great president who be dead but while we mourn we be lift up by the splendid achievement of his life and the grand heroism with which he meet his death

 when we turn from the man to the nation the harm do be so great as to excite our grave apprehension and to demand our wise and most resolute action this criminal be a profess anarchist inflame by the teaching of profess anarchist and probably also by the reckless utterance of those who on the stump and in the public press appeal to the dark and evil spirit of malice and greed envy and sullen hatred the wind be sow by the man who preach such doctrine and they can not escape their share of responsibility for the whirlwind that be reap this apply alike to the deliberate demagogue to the exploiter of sensationalism and to the crude and foolish visionary who for whatever reason apologize for crime or excite aimless discontent

 the blow be aim not at this president but at all president at every symbol of government president mckinley be as emphatically the embodiment of the popular will of the nation express through the form of law as a new england town meeting be in similar fashion the embodiment of the law abide purpose and practice of the people of the town on no conceivable theory could the murder of the president be accept as due to protest against inequality in the social order save as the murder of all the freeman engage in a town meeting could be accept as a protest against that social inequality which put a malefactor in jail anarchy be no more an expression of social discontent than pick pocket or wife beating

 the anarchist and especially the anarchist in the united states be merely one type of criminal more dangerous than any other because he represent the same depravity in a great degree the man who advocate anarchy directly or indirectly in any shape or fashion or the man who apologize for anarchist and their deed make himself morally accessory to murder before the fact the anarchist be a criminal whose perverted instinct lead he to prefer confusion and chaos to the most beneficent form of social order his protest of concern for workingmen be outrageous in its impudent falsity for if the political institution of this country do not afford opportunity to every honest and intelligent son of toil then the door of hope be forever close against he the anarchist be everywhere not merely the enemy of system and of progress but the deadly foe of liberty if ever anarchy be triumphant its triumph will last for but one red moment to be succeed for age by the gloomy night of despotism

 for the anarchist himself whether he preach or practice his doctrine we need not have one particle more concern than for any ordinary murderer he be not the victim of social or political injustice there be no wrong to remedy in his case the cause of his criminality be to be find in his own evil passion and in the evil conduct of those who urge he on not in any failure by other or by the state to do justice to he or his he be a malefactor and nothing else he be in no sense in no shape or way a product of social condition save as a highwayman be produce by the fact than an unarmed man happen to have a purse it be a travesty upon the great and holy name of liberty and freedom to permit they to be invoke in such a cause no man or body of man preach anarchistic doctrine should be allow at large any more than if preach the murder of some specified private individual anarchistic speech writing and meeting be essentially seditious and treasonable

 i earnestly recommend to the congress that in the exercise of its wise discretion it should take into consideration the come to this country of anarchist or person profess principle hostile to all government and justify the murder of those place in authority such individual as those who not long ago gather in open meeting to glorify the murder of king humbert of italy perpetrate a crime and the law should ensure their rigorous punishment they and those like they should be keep out of this country and if find here they should be promptly deport to the country whence they come and far reach provision should be make for the punishment of those who stay no matter call more urgently for the wise thought of the congress

 the federal court should be give jurisdiction over any man who kill or attempt to kill the president or any man who by the constitution or by law be in line of succession for the presidency while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportion to the enormity of the offense against our institution

 anarchy be a crime against the whole human race and all mankind should band against the anarchist his crime should be make an offense against the law of nation like piracy and that form of man stealing know as the slave trade for it be of far blacker infamy than either it should be so declare by treaty among all civilized power such treaty would give to the federal government the power of deal with the crime

 a grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist position be afford by the attitude of the law toward this very criminal who have just take the life of the president the people would have tear he limb from limb if it have not be that the law he defy be at once invoke in his behalf so far from his deed be commit on behalf of the people against the government the government be oblige at once to exert its full police power to save he from instant death at the hand of the people moreover his deed work not the slight dislocation in our governmental system and the danger of a recurrence of such deed no matter how great it might grow would work only in the direction of strengthen and give harshness to the force of order no man will ever be restrain from become president by any fear as to his personal safety if the risk to the president&#39;s life become great it would mean that the office would more and more come to be fill by man of a spirit which would make they resolute and merciless in deal with every friend of disorder this great country will not fall into anarchy and if anarchist should ever become a serious menace to its institution they would not merely be stamp out but would involve in their own ruin every active or passive sympathizer with their doctrine the american people be slow to wrath but when their wrath be once kindle it burn like a consume flame

 during the last five year business confidence have be restore and the nation be to be congratulate because of its present abound prosperity such prosperity can never be create by law alone although it be easy enough to destroy it by mischievous law if the hand of the lord be heavy upon any country if flood or drought come human wisdom be powerless to avert the calamity moreover no law can guard we against the consequence of our own folly the man who be idle or credulous the man who seek gain not by genuine work with head or hand but by gamble in any form be always a source of menace not only to themselves but to other if the business world lose its head it lose what legislation can not supply fundamentally the welfare of each citizen and therefore the welfare of the aggregate of citizen which make the nation must rest upon individual thrift and energy resolution and intelligence nothing can take the place of this individual capacity but wise legislation and honest and intelligent administration can give it the full scope the large opportunity to work to good effect

 the tremendous and highly complex industrial development which go on with ever accelerate rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth century bring we face to face at the beginning of the twentieth with very serious social problem the old law and the old custom which have almost the bind force of law be once quite sufficient to regulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth since the industrial change which have so enormously increase the productive power of mankind they be no long sufficient

 the growth of city have go on beyond comparison fast than the growth of the country and the upbuilding of the great industrial center have mean a startling increase not merely in the aggregate of wealth but in the number of very large individual and especially of very large corporate fortune the creation of these great corporate fortune have not be due to the tariff nor to any other governmental action but to natural cause in the business world operate in other country as they operate in our own

 the process have arouse much antagonism a great part of which be wholly without warrant it be not true that as the rich have grow rich the poor have grow poor on the contrary never before have the average man the wage worker the farmer the small trader be so well off as in this country and at the present time there have be abuse connect with the accumulation of wealth yet it remain true that a fortune accumulate in legitimate business can be accumulate by the person specially benefit only on condition of confer immense incidental benefit upon other successful enterprise of the type which benefit all mankind can only exist if the condition be such as to offer great prize as the reward of success

 the captain of industry who have drive the railway system across this continent who have build up our commerce who have develop our manufacture have on the whole do great good to our people without they the material development of which we be so justly proud could never have take place moreover we should recognize the immense importance of this material development of leave as unhampere as be compatible with the public good the strong and forceful man upon whom the success of business operation inevitably rest the slight study of business condition will satisfy anyone capable of form a judgment that the personal equation be the most important factor in a business operation that the business ability of the man at the head of any business concern big or little be usually the factor which fix the gulf between strike success and hopeless failure

 an additional reason for caution in deal with corporation be to be find in the international commercial condition of to day the same business condition which have produce the great aggregation of corporate and individual wealth have make they very potent factor in international commercial competition business concern which have the large mean at their disposal and be manage by the able man be naturally those which take the lead in the strife for commercial supremacy among the nation of the world america have only just begin to assume that command position in the international business world which we believe will more and more be her it be of the utmost importance that this position be not jeoparde especially at a time when the overflowing abundance of our own natural resource and the skill business energy and mechanical aptitude of our people make foreign market essential under such condition it would be most unwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our nation

 moreover it can not too often be point out that to strike with ignorant violence at the interest of one set of man almost inevitably endanger the interest of all the fundamental rule in our national life --the rule which underlie all other be that on the whole and in the long run we shall go up or down together there be exception and in time of prosperity some will prosper far more and in time of adversity some will suffer far more than other but speak generally a period of good time mean that all share more or less in they and in a period of hard time all feel the stress to a great or less degree it surely ought not to be necessary to enter into any proof of this statement the memory of the lean year which begin in 1893 be still vivid and we can contrast they with the condition in this very year which be now close disaster to great business enterprise can never have its effect limit to the man at the top it spread throughout and while it be bad for everybody it be bad for those farth down the capitalist may be shorn of his luxury but the wage worker may be deprive of even bare necessity

 the mechanism of modern business be so delicate that extreme care must be take not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance many of those who have make it their vocation to denounce the great industrial combination which be popularly although with technical inaccuracy know as trust appeal especially to hatred and fear these be precisely the two emotion particularly when combine with ignorance which unfit man for the exercise of cool and steady judgment in face new industrial condition the whole history of the world show that legislation will generally be both unwise and ineffective unless undertake after calm inquiry and with sober self restraint much of the legislation direct at the trust would have be exceedingly mischievous have it not also be entirely ineffective in accordance with a well know sociological law the ignorant or reckless agitator have be the really effective friend of the evil which he have be nominally opposing in deal with business interest for the government to undertake by crude and ill consider legislation to do what may turn out to be bad would be to incur the risk of such far reach national disaster that it would be preferable to undertake nothing at all the man who demand the impossible or the undesirable serve as the ally of the force with which they be nominally at war for they hamper those who would endeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrong really be and to what extent and in what manner it be practicable to apply remedy

 all this be true and yet it be also true that there be real and grave evil one of the chief be over capitalization because of its many baleful consequence and a resolute and practical effort must be make to correct these evil

 there be a widespread conviction in the mind of the american people that the great corporation know as trust be in certain of their feature and tendency hurtful to the general welfare this spring from no spirit of envy or uncharitableness nor lack of pride in the great industrial achievement that have place this country at the head of the nation struggle for commercial supremacy it do not rest upon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the necessity of meeting change and change condition of trade with new method nor upon ignorance of the fact that combination of capital in the effort to accomplish great thing be necessary when the world&#39;s progress demand that great thing be do it be base upon sincere conviction that combination and concentration should be not prohibit but supervise and within reasonable limit control and in my judgment this conviction be right

 it be no limitation upon property right or freedom of contract to require that when man receive from government the privilege of do business under corporate form which free they from individual responsibility and enable they to call into their enterprise the capital of the public they shall do so upon absolutely truthful representation as to the value of the property in which the capital be to be invest corporation engage in interstate commerce should be regulate if they be find to exercise a license work to the public injury it should be as much the aim of those who seek for social- betterment to rid the business world of crime of cunning as to rid the entire body politic of crime of violence great corporation exist only because they be create and safeguard by our institution and it be therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institution

 the first essential in determine how to deal with the great industrial combination be knowledge of the fact publicity in the interest of the public the government should have the right to inspect and examine the working of the great corporation engage in interstate business publicity be the only sure remedy which we can now invoke what further remedy be need in the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only be determine after publicity have be obtain by process of law and in the course of administration the first requisite be knowledge full and complete knowledge which may be make public to the world

 artificial body such as corporation and joint stock or other association depend upon any statutory law for their existence or privilege should be subject to proper governmental supervision and full and accurate information as to their operation should be make public regularly at reasonable interval

 the large corporation commonly call trust though organize in one state always do business in many state often do very little business in the state where they be incorporate there be utter lack of uniformity in the state law about they and as no state have any exclusive interest in or power over their act it have in practice prove impossible to get adequate regulation through state action therefore in the interest of the whole people the nation should without interfere with the power of the states in the matter itself also assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporation do an interstate business this be especially true where the corporation derive a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency in its business there would be no hardship in such supervision bank be subject to it and in their case it be now accept as a simple matter of course indeed it be probable that supervision of corporation by the national government need not go so far as be now the case with the supervision exercise over they by so conservative a state as massachusetts in order to produce excellent result

 when the constitution be adopt at the end of the eighteenth century no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping change alike in industrial and political condition which be to take place by the beginning of the twentieth century at that time it be accept as a matter of course that the several states be the proper authority to regulate so far as be then necessary the comparatively insignificant and strictly localize corporate body of the day the condition be now wholly different and wholly different action be call for i believe that a law can be frame which will enable the national government to exercise control along the line above indicate profit by the experience gain through the passage and administration of the interstate commerce act if however the judgment of the congress be that it lack the constitutional power to pass such an act then a constitutional amendment should be submit to confer the power

 there should be create a cabinet officer to be know as secretary of commerce and industries as provide in the bill introduce at the last session of the congress it should be his province to deal with commerce in its broad sense include among many other thing whatever concern labor and all matter affect the great business corporation and our merchant marine

 the course propose be one phase of what should be a comprehensive and far reach scheme of constructive statesmanship for the purpose of broaden our market secure our business interest on a safe basis and make firm our new position in the international industrial world while scrupulously safeguard the right of wage worker and capitalist of investor and private citizen so as to secure equity as between man and man in this republic

 with the sole exception of the farming interest no one matter be of such vital moment to our whole people as the welfare of the wage worker if the farmer and the wage worker be well off it be absolutely certain that all other will be well off too it be therefore a matter for hearty congratulation that on the whole wage be high to day in the united states than ever before in our history and far high than in any other country the standard of living be also high than ever before every effort of legislator and administrator should be bent to secure the permanency of this condition of thing and its improvement wherever possible not only must our labor be protect by the tariff but it should also be protect so far as it be possible from the presence in this country of any laborer bring over by contract or of those who come freely yet represent a standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our man in the labor market and drag they to a low level i regard it as necessary with this end in view to re enact immediately the law exclude chinese laborer and to strengthen it wherever necessary in order to make its enforcement entirely effective

 the national government should demand the high quality of service from its employee and in return it should be a good employer if possible legislation should be pass in connection with the interstate commerce law which will render effective the effort of different states to do away with the competition of convict contract labor in the open labor market so far as practicable under the condition of government work provision should be make to render the enforcement of the eight hour law easy and certain in all industry carry on directly or indirectly for the united states government woman and child should be protect from excessive hour of labor from night work and from work under unsanitary condition the government should provide in its contract that all work should be do under fair condition and in addition to set a high standard should uphold it by proper inspection extend if necessary to the subcontractor the government should forbid all night work for woman and child as well as excessive overtime for the district of columbia a good factory law should be pass and as a powerful indirect aid to such law provision should be make to turn the inhabited alley the existence of which be a reproach to our capital city into minor street where the inhabitant can live under condition favorable to health and moral

 american wage worker work with their head as well as their hand moreover they take a keen pride in what they be do so that independent of the reward they wish to turn out a perfect job this be the great secret of our success in competition with the labor of foreign country

 the most vital problem with which this country and for that matter the whole civilized world have to deal be the problem which have for one side the betterment of social condition moral and physical in large city and for another side the effort to deal with that tangle of far reach question which we group together when we speak of labor the chief factor in the success of each man wage worker farmer and capitalist alike must ever be the sum total of his own individual quality and ability second only to this come the power of act in combination or association with other very great good have be and will be accomplish by association or union of wage worker when manage with forethought and when they combine insistence upon their own right with law abide respect for the right of other the display of these quality in such body be a duty to the nation no less than to the association themselves finally there must also in many case be action by the government in order to safeguard the right and interest of all under our constitution there be much more scope for such action by the state and the municipality than by the nation but on point such as those touch on above the national government can act

 when all be say and do the rule of brotherhood remain as the indispensable prerequisite to success in the kind of national life for which we strive each man must work for himself and unless he so work no outside help can avail he but each man must remember also that he be indeed his brother&#39;s keeper and that while no man who refuse to walk can be carry with advantage to himself or anyone else yet that each at time stumble or halt that each at time need to have the help hand outstretche to he to be permanently effective aid must always take the form of help a man to help himself and we can all good help ourselves by join together in the work that be of common interest to all

 our present immigration law be unsatisfactory we need every honest and efficient immigrant fit to become an american citizen every immigrant who come here to stay who bring here a strong body a stout heart a good head and a resolute purpose to do his duty well in every way and to bring up his child as law abide and god fear member of the community but there should be a comprehensive law enact with the object of work a threefold improvement over our present system first we should aim to exclude absolutely not only all person who be know to be believer in anarchistic principle or member of anarchistic society but also all person who be of a low moral tendency or of unsavory reputation this mean that we should require a more thorough system of inspection abroad and a more rigid system of examination at our immigration port the former be especially necessary

 the second object of a proper immigration law ought to be to secure by a careful and not merely perfunctory educational test some intelligent capacity to appreciate american institution and act sanely as american citizen this would not keep out all anarchist for many of they belong to the intelligent criminal class but it would do what be also in point that is tend to decrease the sum of ignorance so potent in produce the envy suspicion malignant passion and hatred of order out of which anarchistic sentiment inevitably spring finally all person should be exclude who be below a certain standard of economic fitness to enter our industrial field as competitor with american labor there should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn an american living and enough money to insure a decent start under american condition this would stop the influx of cheap labor and the result competition which give rise to so much of bitterness in american industrial life and it would dry up the spring of the pestilential social condition in our great city where anarchistic organization have their great possibility of growth

 both the educational and economic test in a wise immigration law should be design to protect and elevate the general body politic and social a very close supervision should be exercise over the steamship company which mainly bring over the immigrant and they should be hold to a strict accountability for any infraction of the law

 there be general acquiescence in our present tariff system as a national policy the first requisite to our prosperity be the continuity and stability of this economic policy nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the business interest of the country by any general tariff change at this time doubt apprehension uncertainty be exactly what we most wish to avoid in the interest of our commercial and material well being our experience in the past have show that sweeping revision of the tariff be apt to produce condition closely approach panic in the business world yet it be not only possible but eminently desirable to combine with the stability of our economic system a supplementary system of reciprocal benefit and obligation with other nation such reciprocity be an incident and result of the firm establishment and preservation of our present economic policy it be specially provide for in the present tariff law

 reciprocity must be treat as the handmaiden of protection our first duty be to see that the protection grant by the tariff in every case where it be need be maintain and that reciprocity be seek for so far as it can safely be do without injury to our home industry just how far this be must be determine accord to the individual case remember always that every application of our tariff policy to meet our shift national need must be condition upon the cardinal fact that the duty must never be reduce below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad the well being of the wage worker be a prime consideration of our entire policy of economic legislation

 subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our industrial well being at home the principle of reciprocity must command our hearty support the phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasize the urgency of the need for wide market and for a liberal policy in deal with foreign nation whatever be merely petty and vexatious in the way of trade restriction should be avoid the customer to whom we dispose of our surplus product in the long run directly or indirectly purchase those surplus product by give we something in return their ability to purchase our product should as far as possible be secure by so arrange our tariff as to enable we to take from they those product which we can use without harm to our own industry and labor or the use of which will be of mark benefit to we

 it be most important that we should maintain the high level of our present prosperity we have now reach the point in the development of our interest where we be not only able to supply our own market but to produce a constantly grow surplus for which we must find market abroad to secure these market we can utilize exist duty in any case where they be no long need for the purpose of protection or in any case where the article be not produce here and the duty be no long necessary for revenue as give we something to offer in exchange for what we ask the cordial relation with other nation which be so desirable will naturally be promote by the course thus require by our own interest

 the natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in connection with those of our production which no long require all of the support once need to establish they upon a sound basis and with those other where either because of natural or of economic cause we be beyond the reach of successful competition

 i ask the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaty lay before it by my predecessor

 the condition of the american merchant marine be such as to call for immediate remedial action by the congress it be discreditable to we as a nation that our merchant marine should be utterly insignificant in comparison to that of other nation which we overtop in other form of business we should not long submit to condition under which only a trifling portion of our great commerce be carry in our own ship to remedy this state of thing would not .merely serve to build up our shipping interest but it would also result in benefit to all who be interested in the permanent establishment of a wide market for american product and would provide an auxiliary force for the navy ship work for their own country just as railroad work for their terminal point shipping line if establish to the principal country with which we have dealing would be of political as well as commercial benefit from every standpoint it be unwise for the united states to continue to rely upon the ship of compete nation for the distribution of our good it should be make advantageous to carry american good in american build ship

 at present american shipping be under certain great disadvantage when put in competition with the shipping of foreign country many of the fast foreign steamship at a speed of fourteen knot or above be subsidize and all our ship sailing vessel and steamer alike cargo carrier of slow speed and mail carrier of high speed have to meet the fact that the original cost of build american ship be great than be the case abroad that the wage pay american officer and seaman be very much high than those pay the officer and seaman of foreign compete country and that the standard of live on our ship be far superior to the standard of live on the ship of our commercial rival

 our government should take such action as will remedy these inequality the american merchant marine should be restore to the ocean

 the act of march 14 1900 intend unequivocally to establish gold as the standard money and to maintain at a parity therewith all form of money medium in use with we have be show to be timely and judicious the price of our government bond in the world&#39;s market when compare with the price of similar obligation issue by other nation be a flattering tribute to our public credit this condition it be evidently desirable to maintain

 in many respect the national banking law furnish sufficient liberty for the proper exercise of the banking function but there seem to be need of well safeguard against the deranging influence of commercial crisis and financial panic moreover the currency of the country should be make responsive to the demand of our domestic trade and commerce

 the collection from duty on import and internal taxis continue to exceed the ordinary expenditure of the government thank mainly to the reduced army expenditure the utmost care should be take not to reduce the revenue so that there will be any possibility of a deficit but after provide against any such contingency mean should be adopt which will bring the revenue more nearly within the limit of our actual need in his report to the congress the secretary of the treasury consider all these question at length and i ask your attention to the report and recommendation

 i call special attention to the need of strict economy in expenditure the fact that our national need forbid we to be niggardly in provide whatever be actually necessary to our well being should make we doubly careful to husband our national resource as each of we husband his private resource by scrupulous avoidance of anything like wasteful or reckless expenditure only by avoidance of spend money on what be needless or unjustifiable can we legitimately keep our income to the point require to meet our need that be genuine

 in 1887 a measure be enact for the regulation of interstate railway commonly know as the interstate commerce act the cardinal provision of that act be that railway rate should be just and reasonable and that all shipper locality and commodity should be accord equal treatment a commission be create and endow with what be suppose to be the necessary power to execute the provision of this act that law be largely an experiment experience have show the wisdom of its purpose but have also show possibly that some of its requirement be wrong certainly that the mean devise for the enforcement of its provision be defective those who complain of the management of the railway allege that establish rate be not maintain that rebate and similar device be habitually resort to that these preference be usually in favor of the large shipper that they drive out of business the small competitor that while many rate be too low many other be excessive and that gross preference be make affect both locality and commodity upon the other hand the railway assert that the law by its very term tend to produce many of these illegal practice by deprive carrier of that right of concerted action which they claim be necessary to establish and maintain non discriminating rate

 the act should be amend the railway be a public servant its rate should be just to and open to all shipper alike the government should see to it that within its jurisdiction this be so and should provide a speedy inexpensive and effective remedy to that end at the same time it must not be forget that our railway be the artery through which the commercial lifeblood of this nation flow nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the development and operation of these commercial agency the subject be one of great importance and call for the earnest attention of the congress

 the department of agriculture during the past fifteen year have steadily broaden its work on economic line and have accomplish result of real value in upbuilde domestic and foreign trade it have go into new field until it be now in touch with all section of our country and with two of the island group that have lately come under our jurisdiction whose people must look to agriculture as a livelihood it be search the world for grain grass fruit and vegetable specially fit for introduction into locality in the several states and territories where they may add materially to our resource by scientific attention to soil survey and possible new crop to breeding of new variety of plant to experimental shipment to animal industry and applied chemistry very practical aid have be give our farming and stock grow interest the product of the farm have take an unprecedented place in our export trade during the year that have just close

 public opinion throughout the united states have move steadily toward a just appreciation of the value of forest whether plant or of natural growth the great part play by they in the creation and maintenance of the national wealth be now more fully realize than ever before

 wise forest protection do not mean the withdrawal of forest resource whether of wood water or grass from contribute their full share to the welfare of the people but on the contrary give the assurance of large and more certain supply the fundamental idea of forestry be the perpetuation of forest by use forest protection be not an end of itself it be a means to increase and sustain the resource of our country and the industry which depend upon they the preservation of our forest be an imperative business necessity we have come to see clearly that whatever destroy the forest except to make way for agriculture threaten our well be

 the practical usefulness of the national forest reserve to the mining grazing irrigation and other interest of the region in which the reserve lie have lead to a widespread demand by the people of the west for their protection and extension the forest reserve will inevitably be of still great use in the future than in the past addition should be make to they whenever practicable and their usefulness should be increase by a thoroughly business like management

 at present the protection of the forest reserve rest with the general land office the mapping and description of their timber with the united states geological survey and the preparation of plan for their conservative use with the bureau of forestry which be also charge with the general advancement of practical forestry in the united states these various function should be unite in the bureau of forestry to which they properly belong the present diffusion of responsibility be bad from every standpoint it prevent that effective co operation between the government and the man who utilize the resource of the reserve without which the interest of both must suffer the scientific bureaus generally should be put under the department of agriculture the president should have by law the power of transfer land for use as forest reserve to the department of agriculture he already have such power in the case of land need by the departments of war and the navy

 the wise administration of the forest reserve will be not less helpful to the interest which depend on water than to those which depend on wood and grass the water supply itself depend upon the forest in the arid region it be water not land which measure production the western half of the united states would sustain a population great than that of our whole country to day if the water that now run to waste be save and use for irrigation the forest and water problem be perhaps the most vital internal question of the united states

 certain of the forest reserve should also be make preserve for the wild forest creature all of the reserve should be well protect from fire many of they need special protection because of the great injury do by live stock above all by sheep the increase in deer elk and other animal in the yellowstone park show what may be expect when other mountain forest be properly protect by law and properly guard some of these area have be so denuded of surface vegetation by overgraze that the ground breeding bird include grouse and quail and many mammal include deer have be exterminate or drive away at the same time the water store capacity of the surface have be decrease or destroy thus promote flood in time of rain and diminish the flow of stream between rain

 in case where natural condition have be restore for a few year vegetation have again carpet the ground bird and deer be come back and hundred of person especially from the immediate neighborhood come each summer to enjoy the privilege of camping some at least of the forest reserve should afford perpetual protection to the native fauna and flora safe haven of refuge to our rapidly diminish wild animal of the large kind and free camping ground for the ever increase number of man and woman who have learn to find rest health and recreation in the splendid forest and flower clothe meadow of our mountain the forest reserve should be set apart forever for the use and benefit of our people as a whole and not sacrifice to the shortsighted greed of a few

 the forest be natural reservoir by restrain the stream in flood and replenish they in drought they make possible the use of water otherwise waste they prevent the soil from washing and so protect the storage reservoir from fill up with silt forest conservation be therefore an essential condition of water conservation

 the forest alone can not however fully regulate and conserve the water of the arid region great storage work be necessary to equalize the flow of stream and to save the flood water their construction have be conclusively show to be an undertaking too vast for private effort nor can it be well accomplish by the individual states act alone far reach interstate problem be involve and the resource of single states would often be inadequate it be properly a national function at least in some of its feature it be as right for the national government to make the stream and river of the arid region useful by engineer work for water storage as to make useful the river and harbor of the humid region by engineering work of another kind the storing of the flood in reservoir at the headwater of our river be but an enlargement of our present policy of river control under which levee be build on the low reach of the same stream

 the government should construct and maintain these reservoir as it do other public work where their purpose be to regulate the flow of stream the water should be turn freely into the channel in the dry season to take the same course under the same law as the natural flow

 the reclamation of the unsettled arid public land present a different problem here it be not enough to regulate the flow of stream the object of the government be to dispose of the land to settler who will build home upon it to accomplish this object water must be bring within their reach

 the pioneer settler on the arid public domain choose their home along stream from which they could themselves divert the water to reclaim their holding such opportunity be practically go there remain however vast area of public land which can be make available for homestead settlement but only by reservoir and main line canal impracticable for private enterprise these irrigation work should be build by the national government the land reclaim by they should be reserve by the government for actual settler and the cost of construction should so far as possible be repay by the land reclaim the distribution of the water the division of the stream among irrigator should be leave to the settler themselves in conformity with state law and without interference with those law or with vested fight the policy of the national government should be to aid irrigation in the several states and territories in such manner as will enable the people in the local community to help themselves and as will stimulate need reform in the state law and regulation govern irrigation

 the reclamation and settlement of the arid land will enrich every portion of our country just as the settlement of the ohio and mississippi valley bring prosperity to the atlantic states the increase demand for manufacture article will stimulate industrial production while wide home market and the trade of asia will consume the large food supply and effectually prevent western competition with eastern agriculture indeed the product of irrigation will be consume chiefly in upbuilde local center of mining and other industry which would otherwise not come into existence at all our people as a whole will profit for successful home making be but another name for the upbuilding of the nation

 the necessary foundation have already be lay for the inauguration of the policy just describe it would be unwise to begin by do too much for a great deal will doubtless be learn both as to what can and what can not be safely attempt by the early effort which must of necessity be partly experimental in character at the very beginning the government should make clear beyond shadow of doubt its intention to pursue this policy on line of the broad public interest no reservoir or canal should ever be build to satisfy selfish personal or local interest but only in accordance with the advice of train expert after long investigation have show the locality where all the condition combine to make the work most need and fraught with the great usefulness to the community as a whole there should be no extravagance and the believer in the need of irrigation will most benefit their cause by see to it that it be free from the least taint of excessive or reckless expenditure of the public money

 whatever the nation do for the extension of irrigation should harmonize with and tend to improve the condition of those now live on irrigated land we be not at the starting point of this development over two hundred million of private capital have already be expend in the construction of irrigation work and many million acre of arid land reclaim a high degree of enterprise and ability have be show in the work itself but as much can not be say in reference to the law relate thereto the security and value of the home create depend largely on the stability of title to water but the majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation of court decision render in ordinary suit at law with a few creditable exception the arid states have fail to provide for the certain and just division of stream in time of scarcity lax and uncertain law have make it possible to establish right to water in excess of actual use or necessity and many stream have already pass into private ownership or a control equivalent to ownership

 whoever control a stream practically control the land it render productive and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart from land can not prevail without cause endure wrong the recognition of such ownership which have be permit to grow up in the arid region should give way to a more enlightened and large recognition of the right of the public in the control and disposal of the public water supply law found upon condition obtain in humid region where water be too abundant to justify hoard it have no proper application in a dry country

 in the arid states the only right to water which should be recognize be that of use in irrigation this right should attach to the land reclaim and be inseparable therefrom grant perpetual water right to other than user without compensation to the public be open to all the objection which apply to give away perpetual franchise to the public utility of city a few of the western states have already recognize this and have incorporate in their constitution the doctrine of perpetual state ownership of water

 the benefit which have follow the unaided development of the past justify the nation&#39;s aid and co operation in the more difficult and important work yet to be accomplish law so vitally affect home as those which control the water supply will only be effective when they have the sanction of the irrigator reform can only be final and satisfactory when they come through the enlightenment of the people most concerned the large development which national aid insure should however awaken in every arid state the determination to make its irrigation system equal in justice and effectiveness that of any country in the civilized world nothing could be more unwise than for isolated community to continue to learn everything experimentally instead of profit by what be already know elsewhere we be deal with a new and momentous question in the pregnant year while institution be form and what we do will affect not only the present but future generation

 our aim should be not simply to reclaim the large area of land and provide home for the large number of people but to create for this new industry the well possible social and industrial condition and this require that we not only understand the exist situation but avail ourselves of the good experience of the time in the solution of its problem a careful study should be make both by the nation and the states of the irrigation law and condition here and abroad ultimately it will probably be necessary for the nation to co operate with the several arid states in proportion as these states by their legislation and administration show themselves fit to receive it

 in hawaii our aim must be to develop the territory on the traditional american line we do not wish a region of large estate till by cheap labor we wish a healthy american community of man who themselves till the farm they own all our legislation for the island should be shape with this end in view the well being of the average home maker must afford the true test of the healthy development of the island the land policy should as nearly as possible be model on our homestead system

 it be a pleasure to say that it be hardly more necessary to report as to puerto rico than as to any state or territory within our continental limit the island be thrive as never before and it be be administer efficiently and honestly its people be now enjoy liberty and order under the protection of the united states and upon this fact we congratulate they and ourselves their material welfare must be as carefully and jealously consider as the welfare of any other portion of our country we have give they the great gift of free access for their product to the market of the united states i ask the attention of the congress to the need of legislation concern the public land of puerto rico

 in cuba such progress have be make toward put the independent government of the island upon a firm footing that before the present session of the congress close this will be an accomplished fact cuba will then start as her own mistress and to the beautiful queen of the antilles as she unfold this new page of her destiny we extend our heartiest greeting and good wish elsewhere i have discuss the question of reciprocity in the case of cuba however there be weighty reason of morality and of national interest why the policy should be hold to have a peculiar application and i most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom indeed to the vital need of provide for a substantial reduction in the tariff duty on cuban import into the united states cuba have in her constitution affirm what we desire that she should stand in international matter in close and more friendly relation with we than with any other power and we be bind by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measure in the interest of her material well being

 in the philippines our problem be large they be very rich tropical island inhabit by many vary tribe represent widely different stage of progress toward civilization our earnest effort be to help these people upward along the stony and difficult path that lead to self government we hope to make our administration of the island honorable to our nation by make it of the high benefit to the filipinos themselves and as an earnest of what we intend to do we point to what we have do already a great measure of material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency have be attain in the philippines than ever before in their history

 it be no light task for a nation to achieve the temperamental quality without which the institution of free government be but an empty mockery our people be now successfully govern themselves because for more than a thousand year they have be slowly fit themselves sometimes consciously sometimes unconsciously toward this end what have take we thirty generation to achieve we can not expect to have another race accomplish out of hand especially when large portion of that race start very far behind the point which our ancestor have reach even thirty generation ago in deal with the philippine people we must show both patience and strength forbearance and steadfast resolution our aim be high we do not desire to do for the islander merely what have elsewhere be do for tropic people by even the good foreign government we hope to do for they what have never before be do for any people of the tropic to make they fit for self government after the fashion of the really free nation

 history may safely be challenge to show a single instance in which a masterful race such as our having be force by the exigency of war to take possession of an alien land have behave to its inhabitant with the disinterested zeal for their progress that our people have show in the philippines to leave the island at this time would mean that they would fall into a welter of murderous anarchy such desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against humanity the character of governor taft and of his associate and subordinate be a proof if such be need of the sincerity of our effort to give the islander a constantly increase measure of self government exactly as fast as they show themselves fit to exercise it since the civil government be establish not an appointment have be make in the island with any reference to consideration of political influence or to aught else save the fitness of the man and the need of the service

 in our anxiety for the welfare and progress of the philippines may be that here and there we have go too rapidly in give they local self government it be on this side that our error if any have be commit no competent observer sincerely desirous of find out the fact and influence only by a desire for the welfare of the native can assert that we have not go far enough we have go to the very verge of safety in hasten the process to have take a single step far or fast in advance would have be folly and weakness and might well have be crime we be extremely anxious that the native shall show the power of govern themselves we be anxious first for their sake and next because it relieve we of a great burden there need not be the slight fear of our not continue to give they all the liberty for which they be fit

 the only fear be test in our overanxiety we give they a degree of independence for which they be unfit thereby invite reaction and disaster as fast as there be any reasonable hope that in a give district the people can govern themselves self government have be give in that district there be not a locality fit for self government which have not receive it but it may well be that in certain case it will have to be withdraw because the inhabitant show themselves unfit to exercise it such instance have already occur in other word there be not the slight chance of our fail to show a sufficiently humanitarian spirit the danger come in the opposite direction

 there be still trouble ahead in the island the insurrection have become an affair of local bandit and marauder who deserve no high regard than the brigand of portion of the old world encouragement direct or indirect to these insurrector stand on the same footing as encouragement to hostile indians in the day when we still have indian war exactly as our aim be to give to the indian who remain peaceful the full and amplest consideration but to have it understand that we will show no weakness if he go on the warpath so we must make it evident unless we be false to our own tradition and to the demand of civilization and humanity that while we will do everything in our power for the filipino who be peaceful we will take the stern measure with the filipino who follow the path of the insurrecto and the ladrone

 the heartiest praise be due to large number of the native of the island for their steadfast loyalty the macabebes have be conspicuous for their courage and devotion to the flag i recommend that the secretary of war be empower to take some systematic action in the way of aid those of these man who be crippled in the service and the family of those who be kill

 the time have come when there should be additional legislation for the philippines nothing well can be do for the island than to introduce industrial enterprise nothing would benefit they so much as throw they open to industrial development the connection between idleness and mischief be proverbial and the opportunity to do remunerative work be one of the sure preventative of war of course no business man will go into the philippines unless it be to his interest to do so and it be immensely to the interest of the island that he should go in it be therefore necessary that the congress should pass law by which the resource of the island can be develop so that franchise for limited term of year can be grant to company do business in they and every encouragement be give to the incoming of business man of every kind

 not to permit this be to do a wrong to the philippines the franchise must be grant and the business permit only under regulation which will guarantee the island against any kind of improper exploitation but the vast natural wealth of the island must be develop and the capital willing to develop it must be give the opportunity the field must be throw open to individual enterprise which have be the real factor in the development of every region over which our flag have fly it be urgently necessary to enact suitable law deal with general transportation mining banking currency homestead and the use and ownership of the land and timber these law will give free play to industrial enterprise and the commercial development which will surely follow will accord to the people of the island the good proof of the sincerity of our desire to aid they

 i call your attention most earnestly to the cry need of a cable to hawaii and the philippines to be continue from the philippines to point in asia we should not defer a day long than necessary the construction of such a cable it be demand not merely for commercial but for political and military consideration

 either the congress should immediately provide for the construction of a government cable or else an arrangement should be make by which like advantage to those accrue from a government cable may be secure to the government by contract with a private cable company

 no single great material work which remain to be undertake on this continent be of such consequence to the american people as the building of a canal across the isthmus connect north and south america its importance to the nation be by no mean limit merely to its material effect upon our business prosperity and yet with view to these effect alone it would be to the last degree important for we immediately to begin it while its beneficial effect would perhaps be most mark upon the pacific coast and the gulf and south atlantic states it would also greatly benefit other section it be emphatically a work which it be for the interest of the entire country to begin and complete as soon as possible it be one of those great work which only a great nation can undertake with prospect of success and which when do be not only permanent asset in the nation&#39;s material interest but stand monument to its constructive ability

 i be glad to be able to announce to you that our negotiation on this subject with great britain conduct on both side in a spirit of friendliness and mutual good will and respect have result in my be able to lay before the senate a treaty which if ratify will enable we to begin preparation for an isthmian canal at any time and which guarantee to this nation every right that it have ever ask in connection with the canal in this treaty the old clayton bulwer treaty so long recognize as inadequate to supply the base for the construction and maintenance of a necessarily american ship canal be abrogate it specifically provide that the united states alone shall do the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguard the canal and shall regulate its neutral use by all nation on term of equality without the guaranty or interference of any outside nation from any quarter the sign treaty will at once be lay before the senate and if approve the congress can then proceed to give effect to the advantage it secure we by provide for the building of the canal

 the true end of every great and free people should be self respect peace and this nation most earnestly desire sincere and cordial friendship with all other over the entire world of recent year war between the great civilized power have become less and less frequent war with barbarous or semi barbarous people come in an entirely different category be merely a most regrettable but necessary international police duty which must be perform for the sake of the welfare of mankind peace can only be keep with certainty where both side wish to keep it but more and more the civilized people be realize the wicked folly of war and be attain that condition of just and intelligent regard for the right of other which will in the end as we hope and believe make world wide peace possible the peace conference at the hague give definite expression to this hope and belief and mark a stride toward their attainment

 this same peace conference acquiesce in our statement of the monroe doctrine as compatible with the purpose and aim of the conference

 the monroe doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign policy of all the nation of the two americas as it be of the united states just seventy eight year have pass since president monroe in his annual message announce that the american continent be henceforth not to be consider as subject for future colonization by any european power in other word the monroe doctrine be a declaration that there must be no territorial aggrandizement by any non american power at the expense of any american power on american soil it be in no wise intend as hostile to any nation in the old world still less be it intend to give cover to any aggression by one new world power at the expense of any other it be simply a step and a long step toward assure the universal peace of the world by secure the possibility of permanent peace on this hemisphere

 during the past century other influence have establish the permanence and independence of the small state of europe through the monroe doctrine we hope to be able to safeguard like independence and secure like permanence for the less among the new world nation

 this doctrine have nothing to do with the commercial relation of any american power save that it in truth allow each of they to form such as it desire in other word it be really a guaranty of the commercial independence of the americas we do not ask under this doctrine for any exclusive commercial dealing with any other american state we do not guarantee any state against punishment if it misconduct itself provide that punishment do not take the form of the acquisition of territory by any non american power

 our attitude in cuba be a sufficient guaranty of our own good faith we have not the slight desire to secure any territory at the expense of any of our neighbor we wish to work with they hand in hand so that all of we may be uplifted together and we rejoice over the good fortune of any of they we gladly hail their material prosperity and political stability and be concerned and alarm if any of they fall into industrial or political chaos we do not wish to see any old world military power grow up on this continent or to be compel to become a military power ourselves the people of the americas can prosper good if leave to work out their own salvation in their own way

 the work of upbuilde the navy must be steadily continue no one point of our policy foreign or domestic be more important than this to the honor and material welfare and above all to the peace of our nation in the future whether we desire it or not we must henceforth recognize that we have international duty no less than international right even if our flag be haul down in the philippines and puerto rico even if we decide not to build the isthmian canal we should need a thoroughly train navy of adequate size or else be prepare definitely and for all time to abandon the idea that our nation be among those whose son go down to the sea in ship unless our commerce be always to be carry in foreign bottom we must have war craft to protect it

 inasmuch however as the american people have no thought of abandon the path upon which they have enter and especially in view of the fact that the building of the isthmian canal be fast become one of the matter which the whole people be unite in demand it be imperative that our navy should be put and keep in the high state of efficiency and should be make to answer to our grow need so far from be in any way a provocation to war an adequate and highly train navy be the good guaranty against war the cheap and most effective peace insurance the cost of build and maintain such a navy represent the very light premium for insure peace which this nation can possibly pay

 probably no other great nation in the world be so anxious for peace as we be there be not a single civilized power which have anything whatever to fear from aggressiveness on our part all we want be peace and toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same respect for our right from other which we be eager and anxious to extend to their right in return to insure fair treatment to we commercially and to guarantee the safety of the american people

 our people intend to abide by the monroe doctrine and to insist upon it as the one sure mean of secure the peace of the western hemisphere the navy offer we the only mean of make our insistence upon the monroe doctrine anything but a subject of derision to whatever nation choose to disregard it we desire the peace which come as of right to the just man arm not the peace grant on term of ignominy to the craven and the weakling

 it be not possible to improvise a navy after war break out the ship must be build and the man train long in advance some auxiliary vessel can be turn into makeshift which will do in default of any well for the minor work and a proportion of raw man can be mix with the highly train their shortcoming be make good by the skill of their fellow but the efficient fight force of the navy when pit against an equal opponent will be find almost exclusively in the war ship that have be regularly build and in the officer and man who through year of faithful performance of sea duty have be train to handle their formidable but complex and delicate weapon with the high efficiency in the late war with spain the ship that deal the decisive blow at manila and santiago have be launch from two to fourteen year and they be able to do as they do because the man in the con tower the gun turret and the engine room have through long year of practice at sea learn how to do their duty

 our present navy be begin in 1882 at that period our navy consist of a collection of antiquated wooden ship already almost as out of place against modern war vessel as the galley of alcibiades and hamilcar certainly as the ship of tromp and blake nor at that time do we have man fit to handle a modern man of war under the wise legislation of the congress and the successful administration of a succession of patriotic secretary of the navy belong to both political party the work of upbuilde the navy go on and ship equal to any in the world of their kind be continually add and what be even more important these ship be exercise at sea singly and in squadron until the man aboard they be able to get the good possible service out of they the result be see in the short war with spain which be decide with such rapidity because of the infinitely great preparedness of our navy than of the spanish navy

 while award the full honor to the man who actually command and man the ship which destroy the spanish sea force in the philippines and in cuba we must not forget that an equal meed of praise belong to those without whom neither blow could have be strike the congressman who vote year in advance the money to lay down the ship to build the gun to buy the armor plate the department official and the business man and wage worker who furnish what the congress have authorize the secretary of the navy who ask for and expend the appropriation and finally the officer who in fair weather and foul on actual sea service train and discipline the crew of the ship when there be no war in sight all be entitle to a full share in the glory of manila and santiago and the respect accord by every true american to those who work such signal triumph for our country it be forethought and preparation which secure we the overwhelming triumph of 1898 if we fail to show forethought and preparation now there may come a time when disaster will befall we instead of triumph and should this time come the fault will rest primarily not upon those whom the accident of event put in supreme command at the moment but upon those who have fail to prepare in advance

 there should be no cessation in the work of complete our navy so far ingenuity have be wholly unable to devise a substitute for the great war craft whose hammer gun beat out the mastery of the high sea it be unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several additional battle ship and heavy armored cruiser with auxiliary and light craft in proportion for the exact number and character i refer you to the report of the secretary of the navy but there be something we need even more than additional ship and this be additional officer and man to provide battle ship and cruiser and then lie they up with the expectation of leave they unmanned until they be need in actual war would be bad than folly it would be a crime against the nation

 to send any war ship against a competent enemy unless those aboard it have be train by year of actual sea service include incessant gunnery practice would be to invite not merely disaster but the bitter shame and humiliation four thousand additional seaman and one thousand additional marine should be provide and an increase in the officer should be provide by make a large addition to the class at annapolis there be one small matter which should be mention in connection with annapolis the pretentious and unmeaning title of naval cadet should be abolish the title of midshipman full of historic association should be restore

 even in time of peace a war ship should be use until it wear out for only so can it be keep fit to respond to any emergency the officer and man alike should be keep as much as possible on blue water for it be there only they can learn their duty as they should be learn the big vessel should be manoeuvre in squadron contain not merely battle ship but the necessary proportion of cruiser and scout the torpedo boat should be handle by the young officer in such manner as will well fit the latter to take responsibility and meet the emergency of actual warfare

 every detail ashore which can be perform by a civilian should be so perform the officer be keep for his special duty in the sea service above all gunnery practice should be unceasing it be important to have our navy of adequate size but it be even more important that ship for ship it should equal in efficiency any navy in the world this be possible only with highly drill crew and officer and this in turn imperatively demand continuous and progressive instruction in target practice ship handling squadron tactic and general discipline our ship must be assemble in squadron actively cruise away from harbor and never long at anchor the result wear upon engine and hull must be endure a battle ship wear out in long training of officer and man be well pay for by the result while on the other hand no matter in how excellent condition it be useless if the crew be not expert

 we now have seventeen battle ship appropriate for of which nine be complete and have be commission for actual service the remain eight will be ready in from two to four year but it will take at least that time to recruit and train the man to fight they it be of vast concern that we have train crew ready for the vessel by the time they be commission good ship and good gun be simply good weapon and the good weapon be useless save in the hand of man who know how to fight with they the man must be train and drill under a thorough and well plan system of progressive instruction while the recruiting must be carry on with still great vigor every effort must be make to exalt the main function of the officer the command of man the lead graduate of the naval academy should be assign to the combatant branch the line and marine

 many of the essential of success be already recognize by the general board which as the central office of a grow staff be move steadily toward a proper war efficiency and a proper efficiency of the whole navy under the secretary this general board by foster the creation of a general staff be provide for the official and then the general recognition of our altered condition as a nation and of the true meaning of a great war fleet which mean be first the good man and second the good ship the naval militia force be state organization and be train for coast service and in event of war they will constitute the inner line of defense they should receive hearty encouragement from the general government

 but in addition we should at once provide for a national naval reserve organize and train under the direction of the navy department and subject to the call of the chief executive whenever war become imminent it should be a real auxiliary to the naval seagoe peace establishment and offer material to be draw on at once for man our ship in time of war it should be compose of graduate of the naval academy graduate of the naval militia officer and crew of coast line steamer longshore schooner fishing vessel and steam yacht together with the coast population about such center as lifesave station and light house

 the american people must either build and maintain an adequate navy or else make up their mind definitely to accept a secondary position in international affair not merely in political but in commercial matter it have be well say that there be no surer way of court national disaster than to be opulent aggressive and unarmed

 it be not necessary to increase our army beyond its present size at this time but it be necessary to keep it at the high point of efficiency the individual unit who as officer and enlisted man compose this army be we have good reason to believe at least as efficient as those of any other army in the entire world it be our duty to see that their training be of a kind to insure the high possible expression of power to these unit when act in combination

 the condition of modern war be such as to make an infinitely heavy demand than ever before upon the individual character and capacity of the officer and the enlisted man and to make it far more difficult for man to act together with effect at present the fighting must be do in extended order which mean that each man must act for himself and at the same time act in combination with other with whom he be no long in the old fashioned elbow to elbow touch under such condition a few man of the high excellence be worth more than many man without the special skill which be only find as the result of special training apply to man of exceptional physique and morale but nowadays the most valuable fighting man and the most difficult to perfect be the rifleman who be also a skillful and daring rider

 the proportion of our cavalry regiment have wisely be increase the american cavalryman train to manoeuvre and fight with equal facility on foot and on horseback be the good type of soldier for general purpose now to be find in the world the ideal cavalryman of the present day be a man who can fight on foot as effectively as the good infantryman and who be in addition unsurpasse in the care and management of his horse and in his ability to fight on horseback

 a general staff should be create as for the present staff and supply department they should be fill by detail from the line the man so detailed return after a while to their line duty it be very undesirable to have the senior grade of the army compose of man who have come to fill the position by the mere fact of seniority a system should be adopt by which there shall be an elimination grade by grade of those who seem unfit to render the good service in the next grade justice to the veteran of the civil war who be still in the army would seem to require that in the matter of retirement they be give by law the same privilege accord to their comrade in the navy

 the process of elimination of the least fit should be conduct in a manner that would render it practically impossible to apply political or social pressure on behalf of any candidate so that each man may be judge purely on his own merit pressure for the promotion of civil official for political reason be bad enough but it be tenfold bad where apply on behalf of officer of the army or navy every promotion and every detail under the war department must be make solely with regard to the good of the service and to the capacity and merit of the man himself no pressure political social or personal of any kind will be permit to exercise the least effect in any question of promotion or detail and if there be reason to believe that such pressure be exercise at the instigation of the officer concern it will be hold to militate against he in our army we can not afford to have reward or duty distribute save on the simple ground that those who by their own merit be entitle to the reward get they and that those who be peculiarly fit to do the duty be choose to perform they

 every effort should be make to bring the army to a constantly increase state of efficiency when on actual service no work save that directly in the line of such service should be require the paper work in the army as in the navy should be greatly reduce what be need be prove power of command and capacity to work well in the field constant care be necessary to prevent dry rot in the transportation and commissary department

 our army be so small and so much scatter that it be very difficult to give the high officer as well as the low officer and the enlisted man a chance to practice manoeuvre in mass and on a comparatively large scale in time of need no amount of individual excellence would avail against the paralysis which would follow inability to work as a coherent whole under skillful and daring leadership the congress should provide mean whereby it will be possible to have field exercise by at least a division of regular and if possible also a division of national guardsman once a year these exercise might take the form of field manoeuvre or if on the gulf coast or the pacific or atlantic sea- board or in the region of the great lakes the army corps when assemble could be march from some inland point to some point on the water there embark disembark after a couple of days&#39 journey at some other point and again march inland only by actual handling and provide for man in masse while they be march camping embarking and disembarking will it be possible to train the high officer to perform their duty well and smoothly

 a great debt be owe from the public to the man of the army and navy they should be so treat as to enable they to reach the high point of efficiency so that they may be able to respond instantly to any demand make upon they to sustain the interest of the nation and the honor of the flag the individual american enlisted man be probably on the whole a more formidable fighting man than the regular of any other army every consideration should be show he and in return the high standard of usefulness should be exact from he it be well worth while for the congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted man upon second and subsequent enlistment should not be increase to correspond with the increase value of the veteran soldier

 much good have already come from the act reorganize the army pass early in the present year the three prime reform all of they of literally inestimable value be first the substitution of four year detail from the line for permanent appointment in the so call staff division second the establishment of a corps of artillery with a chief at the head third the establishment of a maximum and minimum limit for the army it would be difficult to overestimate the improvement in the efficiency of our army which these three reform be make and have in part already effect

 the reorganization provide for by the act have be substantially accomplish the improved condition in the philippines have enable the war department materially to reduce the military charge upon our revenue and to arrange the number of soldier so as to bring this number much near to the minimum than to the maximum limit establish by law there be however need of supplementary legislation thorough military education must be provide and in addition to the regular the advantage of this education should be give to the officer of the national guard and other in civil life who desire intelligently to fit themselves for possible military duty the officer should be give the chance to perfect themselves by study in the high branch of this art at west point the education should be of the kind most apt to turn out man who be good in actual field service too much stress should not be lay on mathematic nor should proficiency therein be hold to establish the right of entry to a corps d&#39;elite the typical american officer of the good kind need not be a good mathematician but he must be able to master himself to control other and to show boldness and fertility of resource in every emergency

 action should be take in reference to the militia and to the raising of volunteer force our militia law be obsolete and worthless the organization and armament of the national guard of the several states which be treat as militia in the appropriation by the congress should be make identical with those provide for the regular force the obligation and duty of the guard in time of war should be carefully define and a system establish by law under which the method of procedure of raise volunteer force should be prescribe in advance it be utterly impossible in the excitement and haste of impend war to do this satisfactorily if the arrangement have not be make long beforehand provision should be make for utilize in the first volunteer organization call out the training of those citizen who have already have experience under arm and especially for the selection in advance of the officer of any force which may be raise for careful selection of the kind necessary be impossible after the outbreak of war

 that the army be not at all a mere instrument of destruction have be show during the last three year in the philippines cuba and puerto rico it have prove itself a great constructive force a most potent implement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civilization

 no other citizen deserve so well of the republic as the veteran the survivor of those who save the union they do the one deed which if left undo would have mean that all else in our history go for nothing but for their steadfast prowess in the great crisis of our history all our annal would be meaningless and our great experiment in popular freedom and self government a gloomy failure moreover they not only leave we a united nation but they leave we also as a heritage the memory of the mighty deed by which the nation be keep united we be now indeed one nation one in fact as well as in name we be unite in our devotion to the flag which be the symbol of national greatness and unity and the very completeness of our union enable we all in every part of the country to glory in the valor show alike by the son of the north and the son of the south in the time that try men&#39;s soul

 the man who in the last three year have do so well in the east and the west indies and on the mainland of asia have show that this remembrance be not lose in any serious crisis the united states must rely for the great mass of its fight man upon the volunteer soldiery who do not make a permanent profession of the military career and whenever such a crisis arise the deathless memory of the civil war will give to americans the lift of lofty purpose which come to those whose father have stand valiantly in the forefront of the battle

 the merit system of make appointment be in its essence as democratic and american as the common school system itself it simply mean that in clerical and other position where the duty be entirely non political all applicant should have a fair field and no favor each stand on his merit as he be able to show they by practical test write competitive examination offer the only available mean in many case for apply this system in other case as where laborer be employ a system of registration undoubtedly can be widely extend there be of course place where the write competitive examination can not be apply and other where it offer by no mean an ideal solution but where under exist political condition it be though an imperfect mean yet the good present mean of get satisfactory result

 wherever the condition have permit the application of the merit system in its full and widest sense the gain to the government have be immense the navy yard and postal service illustrate probably well than any other branch of the government the great gain in economy efficiency and honesty due to the enforcement of this principle

 i recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classified service to the district of columbia or will at least enable the president thus to extend it in my judgment all law provide for the temporary employment of clerk should hereafter contain a provision that they be select under the civil service law

 it be important to have this system obtain at home but it be even more important to have it apply rigidly in our insular possession not an office should be fill in the philippines or puerto rico with any regard to the man&#39;s partisan affiliation or service with any regard to the political social or personal influence which he may have at his command in short heed should be pay to absolutely nothing save the man&#39;s own character and capacity and the need of the service

 the administration of these island should be as wholly free from the suspicion of partisan politic as the administration of the army and navy all that we ask from the public servant in the philippines or puerto rico be that he reflect honor on his country by the way in which he make that country&#39; rule a benefit to the people who have come under it this be all that we should ask and we can not afford to be content with less

 the merit system be simply one method of secure honest and efficient administration of the government and in the long run the sole justification of any type of government lie in its proving itself both honest and efficient

 the consular service be now organize under the provision of a law pass in 1856 which be entirely inadequate to exist condition the interest show by so many commercial body throughout the country in the reorganization of the service be heartily commend to your attention several bill provide for a new consular service have in recent year be submit to the congress they be base upon the just principle that appointment to the service should be make only after a practical test of the applicant&#39; fitness that promotion should be govern by trustworthiness adaptability and zeal in the performance of duty and that the tenure of office should be unaffected by partisan consideration

 the guardianship and foster of our rapidly expand foreign commerce the protection of american citizen resort to foreign country in lawful pursuit of their affair and the maintenance of the dignity of the nation abroad combine to make it essential that our consul should be man of character knowledge and enterprise it be true that the service be now in the main efficient but a standard of excellence can not be permanently maintain until the principle set forth in the bill heretofore submit to the congress on this subject be enact into law

 in my judgment the time have arrive when we should definitely make up our mind to recognize the indian as an individual and not as a member of a tribe the general allotment act be a mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass it act directly upon the family and the individual under its provision some sixty thousand indians have already become citizen of the united states we should now break up the tribal fund do for they what allotment do for the tribal land that is they should be divide into individual holding there will be a transition period during which the fund will in many case have to be hold in trust this be the case also with the land a stop should be put upon the indiscriminate permission to indians to lease their allotment the effort should be steadily to make the indian work like any other man on his own ground the marriage law of the indians should be make the same as those of the white

 to the senate and house of representatives
 i deem it important before the adjournment of the present session of congress to call attention to the follow expression in the message which in the discharge of the duty impose upon i by the constitution i send to congress on the first tuesday of december last
 elsewhere i have discuss the question of reciprocity in the case of cuba however there be weighty reason of morality and of national interest why the policy should be hold to have a peculiar application and i most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom indeed to the vital need of provide for a substantial reduction in the tariff duty on cuban import into the united states cuba have in her constitution affirm what we desire that she should stand in international matter in close and more friendly relation with we than with any other power and we be bind by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measure in the interest of her material well be
 this recommendation be merely give practical effect to president mckinley&#39;s word when in his message of december 5 1898 and december 5 1899 he write
 it be important that our relation with this people of cuba shall be of the most friendly character and our commercial relation close and reciprocal we have accept a trust the fulfillment of which call for the stern integrity of purpose and the exercise of the high wisdom the new cuba yet to arise from the ashe of the past must need be bind to we by tie of singular intimacy and strength if its endure welfare be to be assure the great blessing which can come to cuba be the restoration of her agricultural and industrial prosperity
 yesterday june 12 i receive by cable from the american minister in cuba a most earnest appeal from president palms for legislative relief before it be too late and his country financially ruin
 the granting of reciprocity with cuba be a proposition which stand entirely alone the reason for it far outweigh those for grant reciprocity with any other nation and be entirely consistent with preserve intact the protective system under which this country have thrive so marvelously the present tariff law be design to promote the adoption of such a reciprocity treaty and expressly provide for a reduction not to exceed 20 per cent upon good come from a particular country leave the tariff rate on the same article unchanged as regard all other country objection have be make to the granting of the reduction on the ground that the substantial benefit would not go to the agricultural producer of sugar but would inure to the american sugar refiner in my judgment provision can and should be make which will guarantee we against this possibility without having recourse to a measure of doubtful policy such as a bounty in the form of a rebate
 the question as to which if any of the different schedule of the tariff ought most properly to be revise do not enter into this matter in any way or shape we be concern with get a friendly reciprocal arrangement with cuba this arrangement apply to all the article that cuba grow or produce it be not in our power to determine what these article shall be and any discussion of the tariff as it affect special schedule or country other than cuba be wholly aside from the subject matter to which i call your attention
 some of our citizen oppose the lowering of the tariff on cuban product just as three year ago they oppose the admission of the hawaiian islands lest free trade with they might ruin certain of our interest here in the actual event their fear prove baseless as regard hawaii and their apprehension as to the damage to any industry of our own because of the propose measure of reciprocity with cuba seem to i equally baseless in my judgment no american industry will be hurt and many american industry will be benefit by the propose action it be to our advantage as a nation that the grow cuban market should be control by american producer
 the event follow the war with spain and the prospective building of the isthmian canal render it certain that we must take in the future a far great interest than hitherto in what happen throughout the west indies central america and the adjacent coast and water we expect cuba to treat we on an exceptional footing politically and we should put she in the same exceptional position economically the propose action be in line with the course we have pursue as regard all the island with which we have be bring into relation of vary intimacy by the spanish war puerto rico and hawaii have be include within our tariff line to their great benefit as well as ours and without any of the fear detriment to our own industry the philippines which stand in a different relation have be grant substantial tariff concession
 cuba be an independent republic but a republic which have assume certain special obligation as regard her international position in compliance with our request i ask for her certain special economic concession in return these economic concession to benefit we as well as she there be few bright page in american history than the page which tell of our dealing with cuba during the past four year on her behalf we wage a war of which the mainspring be generous indignation against oppression and we have keep faith absolutely it be earnestly to be hope that we will complete in the same spirit the record so well begun and show in our dealing with cuba that steady continuity of policy which it be essential for our nation to establish in foreign affair if we desire to play well our part as a world power
 we be a wealthy and powerful nation cuba be a young republic still weak who owe to we her birth whose whole future whose very life must depend on our attitude toward she i ask that we help she as she struggle upward along the painful and difficult road of self- govern independence i ask this aid for she because she be weak because she need it because we have already aid she i ask that open handed help of a kind which a serf respect people can accept be give to cuba for the very reason that we have give she such help in the past our soldier fight to give her freedom and for three year our representative civil and military have toil unceasingly face disease of a peculiarly sinister and fatal type with patient and uncomplaine fortitude to teach she how to use aright her new freedom never in history have any alien country be thus administer with such high integrity of purpose such wise judgment and such single minded devotion to the country&#39; interest now i ask that the cubans be give all possible chance to use to the good advantage the freedom of which americans have such right to be proud and for which so many american life have be sacrifice

to the senate and house of representatives

 we still continue in a period of unbounded prosperity this prosperity be not the creature of law but undoubtedly the law under which we work have be instrumental in create the condition which make it possible and by unwise legislation it would be easy enough to destroy it there will undoubtedly be period of depression the wave will recede but the tide will advance this nation be seat on a continent flank by two great ocean it be compose of man the descendant of pioneer or in a sense pioneer themselves of man winnow out from among the nation of the old world by the energy boldness and love of adventure find in their own eager heart such a nation so place will surely wrest success from fortune

 as a people we have play a large part in the world and we be bent upon make our future even large than the past in particular the event of the last four year have definitely decide that for woe or for weal our place must be great among the nation we may either fall greatly or succeed greatly but we can not avoid the endeavor from which either great failure or great success must come even if we would we can not play a small part if we should try all that would follow would be that we should play a large part ignobly and shamefully

 but our people the son of the man of the civil war the son of the man who have iron in their blood rejoice in the present and face the future high of heart and resolute of will ours be not the creed of the weakling and the coward ours be the gospel of hope and of triumphant endeavor we do not shrink from the struggle before we there be many problem for we to face at the outset of the twentieth century grave problem abroad and still graver at home but we know that we can solve they and solve they well provide only that we bring to the solution the quality of head and heart which be show by the man who in the day of washington round this government and in the day of lincoln preserve it

 no country have ever occupy a high plane of material well being than our at the present moment this well being be due to no sudden or accidental cause but to the play of the economic force in this country for over a century to our law our sustained and continuous policy above all to the high individual average of our citizenship great fortune have be win by those who have take the lead in this phenomenal industrial development and most of these fortune have be win not by do evil but as an incident to action which have benefit the community as a whole never before have material well being be so widely diffused among our people great fortune have be accumulate and yet in the aggregate these fortune be small indeed when compare to the wealth of the people as a whole the plain people be well off than they have ever be before the insurance company which be practically mutual benefit society especially helpful to man of moderate mean represent accumulation of capital which be among the large in this country there be more deposit in the saving bank more owner of farm more well pay wage worker in this country now than ever before in our history of course when the condition have favor the growth of so much that be good they have also favor somewhat the growth of what be evil it be eminently necessary that we should endeavor to cut out this evil but let we keep a due sense of proportion let we not in fix our gaze upon the less evil forget the great good the evil be real and some of they be menacing but they be the outgrowth not of misery or decadence but of prosperity of the progress of our gigantic industrial development this industrial development must not be check but side by side with it should go such progressive regulation as will diminish the evil we should fail in our duty if we do not try to remedy the evil but we shall succeed only if we proceed patiently with practical common sense as well as resolution separate the good from the bad and hold on to the former while endeavor to get rid of the latter

 in my message to the present congress at its first session i discuss at length the question of the regulation of those big corporation commonly do an interstate business often with some tendency to monopoly which be popularly know as trust the experience of the past year have emphasize in my opinion the desirability of the step i then propose a fundamental requisite of social efficiency be a high standard of individual energy and excellence but this be in no wise inconsistent with power to act in combination for aim which can not so well be achieve by the individual act alone a fundamental base of civilization be the inviolability of property but this be in no wise inconsistent with the right of society to regulate the exercise of the artificial power which it confer upon the owner of property under the name of corporate franchise in such a way as to prevent the misuse of these power corporation and especially combination of corporation should be manage under public regulation experience have show that under our system of government the necessary supervision can not be obtain by state action it must therefore be achieve by national action our aim be not to do away with corporation on the contrary these big aggregation be an inevitable development of modern industrialism and the effort to destroy they would be futile unless accomplish in way that would work the utmost mischief to the entire body politic we can do nothing of good in the way of regulate and supervise these corporation until we fix clearly in our mind that we be not attack the corporation but endeavor to do away with any evil in they we be not hostile to they we be merely determined that they shall be so handle as to subserve the public good we draw the line against misconduct not against wealth the capitalist who alone or in conjunction with his fellow perform some great industrial feat by which he win money be a welldoer not a wrongdoer provide only he work in proper and legitimate line we wish to favor such a man when he do well we wish to supervise and control his action only to prevent he from do ill publicity can do no harm to the honest corporation and we need not be over tender about spare the dishonest corporation

 in curb and regulate the combination of capital which be or may become injurious to the public we must be careful not to stop the great enterprise which have legitimately reduce the cost of production not to abandon the place which our country have win in the leadership of the international industrial world not to strike down wealth with the result of close factory and mine of turn the wage worker idle in the street and leave the farmer without a market for what he grow insistence upon the impossible mean delay in achieve the possible exactly as on the other hand the stubborn defense alike of what be good and what be bad in the exist system the resolute effort to obstruct any attempt at betterment betray blindness to the historic truth that wise evolution be the sure safeguard against revolution

 no more important subject can come before the congress than this of the regulation of interstate business this country can not afford to sit supine on the plea that under our peculiar system of government we be helpless in the presence of the new condition and unable to grapple with they or to cut out whatever of evil have arise in connection with they the power of the congress to regulate interstate commerce be an absolute and unqualified grant and without limitation other than those prescribe by the constitution the congress have constitutional authority to make all law necessary and proper for execute this power and i be satisfied that this power have not be exhaust by any legislation now on the statute book it be evident therefore that evil restrictive of commercial freedom and entail restraint upon national commerce fall within the regulative power of the congress and that a wise and reasonable law would be a necessary and proper exercise of congressional authority to the end that such evil should be eradicate

 i believe that monopoly unjust discrimination which prevent or cripple competition fraudulent overcapitalization and other evil in trust organization and practice which injuriously affect interstate trade can be prevent under the power of the congress to regulate commerce with foreign nation and among the several states through regulation and requirement operate directly upon such commerce the instrumentality thereof and those engage therein

 i earnestly recommend this subject to the consideration of the congress with a view to the passage of a law reasonable in its provision and effective in its operation upon which the question can be finally adjudicate that now raise doubt as to the necessity of constitutional amendment if it prove impossible to accomplish the purpose above set forth by such a law then assuredly we should not shrink from amend the constitution so as to secure beyond peradventure the power seek

 the congress have not heretofore make any appropriation for the well enforcement of the antitrust law as it now stand very much have be do by the department of justice in secure the enforcement of this law but much more could be do if the congress would make a special appropriation for this purpose to be expend under the direction of the attorney general

 one proposition advocate have be the reduction of the tariff as a means of reach the evil of the trust which fall within the category i have describe not merely would this be wholly ineffective but the diversion of our effort in such a direction would mean the abandonment of all intelligent attempt to do away with these evil many of the large corporation many of those which should certainly be include in any proper scheme of regulation would not be affect in the slight degree by a change in the tariff save as such change interfere with the general prosperity of the country the only relation of the tariff to big corporation as a whole be that the tariff make manufacture profitable and the tariff remedy propose would be in effect simply to make manufacture unprofitable to remove the tariff as a punitive measure direct against trust would inevitably result in ruin to the weak competitor who be struggle against they our aim should be not by unwise tariff change to give foreign product the advantage over domestic product but by proper regulation to give domestic competition a fair chance and this end can not be reach by any tariff change which would affect unfavorably all domestic competitor good and bad alike the question of regulation of the trust stand apart from the question of tariff revision

 stability of economic policy must always be the prime economic need of this country this stability should not be fossilization the country have acquiesce in the wisdom of the protective tariff principle it be exceedingly undesirable that this system should be destroy or that there should be violent and radical change therein our past experience show that great prosperity in this country have always come under a protective tariff and that the country can not prosper under fitful tariff change at short interval moreover if the tariff law as a whole work well and if business have prosper under they and be prosper it be well to endure for a time slight inconvenience and inequality in some schedule than to upset business by too quick and too radical change it be most earnestly to be wish that we could treat the tariff from the standpoint solely of our business need it be perhaps too much to hope that partisanship may be entirely exclude from consideration of the subject but at least it can be make secondary to the business interest of the country that be to the interest of our people as a whole unquestionably these business interest will well be serve if together with fixity of principle as regard the tariff we combine a system which will permit we from time to time to make the necessary reapplication of the principle to the shift national need we must take scrupulous care that the reapplication shall be make in such a way that it will not amount to a dislocation of our system the mere threat of which not to speak of the performance would produce paralysis in the business energy of the community the first consideration in make these change would of course be to preserve the principle which underlie our whole tariff system that is the principle of put american business interest at least on a full equality with interest abroad and of always allow a sufficient rate of duty to more than cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad the well being of the wage worker like the well being of the tiller of the soil should be treat as an essential in shape our whole economic policy there must never be any change which will jeopardize the standard of comfort the standard of wage of the american wage worker

 one way in which the readjustment seek can be reach be by reciprocity treaty it be greatly to be desire that such treaty may be adopt they can be use to widen our market and to give a great field for the activity of our producer on the one hand and on the other hand to secure in practical shape the lowering of duty when they be no long need for protection among our own people or when the minimum of damage do may be disregard for the sake of the maximum of good accomplished if it prove impossible to ratify the pende treaty and if there seem to be no warrant for the endeavor to execute other or to amend the pende treaty so that they can be ratify then the same end to secure reciprocity should be meet by direct legislation

 wherever the tariff condition be such that a need change can not with advantage be make by the application of the reciprocity idea then it can be make outright by a lowering of duty on a give product if possible such change should be make only after the full consideration by practical expert who should approach the subject from a business standpoint have in view both the particular interest affect and the commercial well being of the people as a whole the machinery for provide such careful investigation can readily be supply the executive department have already at its disposal method of collect fact and figure and if the congress desire additional consideration to that which will be give the subject by its own committee then a commission of business expert can be appoint whose duty it should be to recommend action by the congress after a deliberate and scientific examination of the various schedule as they be affect by the change and change condition the unhurried and unbiased report of this commission would show what change should be make in the various schedule and how far these change could go without also change the great prosperity which this country be now enjoy or upset its fix economic policy

 the case in which the tariff can produce a monopoly be so few as to constitute an inconsiderable factor in the question but of course if in any case it be find that a give rate of duty do promote a monopoly which work ill no protectionist would object to such reduction of the duty as would equalize competition

 in my judgment the tariff on anthracite coal should be remove and anthracite put actually where it now be nominally on the free list this would have no effect at all save in crisis but in crisis it might be of service to the people

 interest rate be a potent factor in business activity and in order that these rate may be equalize to meet the vary need of the season and of widely separate community and to prevent the recurrence of financial stringency which injuriously affect legitimate business it be necessary that there should be an element of elasticity in our monetary system bank be the natural servant of commerce and upon they should be place as far as practicable the burden of furnish and maintain a circulation adequate to supply the need of our diversify industry and of our domestic and foreign commerce and the issue of this should be so regulated that a sufficient supply should be always available for the business interest of the country

 it would be both unwise and unnecessary at this time to attempt to reconstruct our financial system which have be the growth of a century but some additional legislation be i think desirable the mere outline of any plan sufficiently comprehensive to meet these requirement would transgress the appropriate limit of this communication it be suggest however that all future legislation on the subject should be with the view of encourage the use of such instrumentality as will automatically supply every legitimate demand of productive industry and of commerce not only in the amount but in the character of circulation and of make all kind of money interchangeable and at the will of the holder convertible into the establish gold standard

 i again call your attention to the need of pass a proper immigration law cover the point outline in my message to you at the first session of the present congress substantially such a bill have already pass the house

 how to secure fair treatment alike for labor and for capital how to hold in check the unscrupulous man whether employer or employee without weaken individual initiative without hamper and cramp the industrial development of the country be a problem fraught with great difficulty and one which it be of the high importance to solve on line of sanity and far sight common sense as well as of devotion to the right this be an era of federation and combination exactly as business man find they must often work through corporation and as it be a constant tendency of these corporation to grow large so it be often necessary for labor man to work in federation and these have become important factor of modern industrial life both kind of federation capitalistic and labor can do much good and as a necessary corollary they can both do evil opposition to each kind of organization should take the form of opposition to whatever be bad in the conduct of any give corporation or union not of attack upon corporation as such nor upon union as such for some of the most far reach beneficent work for our people have be accomplish through both corporation and union each must refrain from arbitrary or tyrannous interference with the right of other organized capital and organized labor alike should remember that in the long run the interest of each must be bring into harmony with the interest of the general public and the conduct of each must conform to the fundamental rule of obedience to the law of individual freedom and of justice and fair deal toward all each should remember that in addition to power it must strive after the realization of healthy lofty and generous ideal every employer every wage worker must be guarantee his liberty and his right to do as he like with his property or his labor so long as he do not infringe upon the right of other it be of the high importance that employer and employee alike should endeavor to appreciate each the viewpoint of the other and the sure disaster that will come upon both in the long run if either grow to take as habitual an attitude of sour hostility and distrust toward the other few people deserve well of the country than those representative both of capital and labor and there be many such who work continually to bring about a good understanding of this kind base upon wisdom and upon broad and kindly sympathy between employer and employ above all we need to remember that any kind of class animosity in the political world be if possible even more wicked even more destructive to national welfare than sectional race or religious animosity we can get good government only upon condition that we keep true to the principle upon which this nation be found and judge each man not as a part of a class but upon his individual merit all that we have a right to ask of any man rich or poor whatever his creed his occupation his birthplace or his residence be that he shall act well and honorably by his neighbor and by his country we be neither for the rich man as such nor for the poor man as such we be for the upright man rich or poor so far as the constitutional power of the national government touch these matter of general and vital moment to the nation they should be exercise in conformity with the principle above set forth

 it be earnestly hope that a secretary of commerce may be create with a seat in the cabinet the rapid multiplication of question affect labor and capital the growth and complexity of the organization through which both labor and capital now find expression the steady tendency toward the employment of capital in huge corporation and the wonderful stride of this country toward leadership in the international business world justify an urgent demand for the creation of such a position substantially all the lead commercial body in this country have unite in request its creation it be desirable that some such measure as that which have already pass the senate be enact into law the creation of such a department would in itself be an advance toward deal with and exercise supervision over the whole subject of the great corporation do an interstate business and with this end in view the congress should endow the department with large power which could be increase as experience might show the need

 i hope soon to submit to the senate a reciprocity treaty with cuba on may 20 last the united states keep its promise to the island by formally vacate cuban soil and turn cuba over to those whom her own people have choose as the first official of the new republic

 cuba lie at our door and whatever affect she for good or for ill affect we also so much have our people feel this that in the platt amendment we definitely take the ground that cuba must hereafter have close political relation with we than with any other power thus in a sense cuba have become a part of our international political system this make it necessary that in return she should be give some of the benefit of become part of our economic system it be from our own standpoint a short sighted and mischievous policy to fail to recognize this need moreover it be unworthy of a mighty and generous nation itself the great and most successful republic in history to refuse to stretch out a help hand to a young and weak sister republic just enter upon its career of independence we should always fearlessly insist upon our right in the face of the strong and we should with ungrudge hand do our generous duty by the weak i urge the adoption of reciprocity with cuba not only because it be eminently for our own interest to control the cuban market and by every mean to foster our supremacy in the tropical land and water south of we but also because we of of the giant republic of the north should make all our sister nation of the american continent feel that whenever they will permit it we desire to show ourselves disinterestedly and effectively their friend

 a convention with great britain have be conclude which will be at once lay before the senate for ratification provide for reciprocal trade arrangement between the united states and newfoundland on substantially the line of the convention formerly negotiate by the secretary of state mr. blaine i believe reciprocal trade relation will be greatly to the advantage of both country

 as civilization grow warfare become less and less the normal condition of foreign relation the last century have see a marked diminution of war between civilized power war with uncivilized power be largely mere matter of international police duty essential for the welfare of the world wherever possible arbitration or some similar method should be employ in lieu of war to settle difficulty between civilized nation although as yet the world have not progress sufficiently to render it possible or necessarily desirable to invoke arbitration in every case the formation of the international tribunal which sit at the hague be an event of good oman from which great consequence for the welfare of all mankind may flow it be far well where possible to invoke such a permanent tribunal than to create special arbitrator for a give purpose

 it be a matter of sincere congratulation to our country that the united states and mexico should have be the first to use the good office of the hague court this be do last summer with most satisfactory result in the case of a claim at issue between we and our sister republic it be earnestly to be hope that this first case will serve as a precedent for other in which not only the united states but foreign nation may take advantage of the machinery already in existence at the hague

 i commend to the favorable consideration of the congress the hawaiian fire claim which be the subject of careful investigation during the last session

 the congress have wisely provide that we shall build at once an isthmian canal if possible at panama the attorney general report that we can undoubtedly acquire good title from the french panama canal company negotiation be now pende with colombia to secure her assent to our build the canal this canal will be one of the great engineering feat of the twentieth century a great engineering feat than have yet be accomplish during the history of mankind the work should be carry out as a continue policy without regard to change of administration and it should be begin under circumstance which will make it a matter of pride for all administration to continue the policy

 the canal will be of great benefit to america and of importance to all the world it will be of advantage to we industrially and also as improve our military position it will be of advantage to the country of tropical america it be earnestly to be hope that all of these country will do as some of they have already do with signal success and will invite to their shore commerce and improve their material condition by recognize that stability and order be the prerequisite of successful development no independent nation in america need have the slight fear of aggression from the united states it behove each one to maintain order within its own border and to discharge its just obligation to foreigner when this be do they can rest assure that be they strong or weak they have nothing to dread from outside interference more and more the increase interdependence and complexity of international political and economic relation render it incumbent on all civilized and orderly power to insist on the proper policing of the world

 during the fall of 1901 a communication be address to the secretary of state ask whether permission would be grant by the president to a corporation to lay a cable from a point on the california coast to the philippine islands by way of hawaii a statement of condition or term upon which such corporation would undertake to lay and operate a cable be volunteer

 inasmuch as the congress be shortly to convene and pacific cable legislation have be the subject of consideration by the congress for several year it seem to i wise to defer action upon the application until the congress have first an opportunity to act the congress adjourn without take any action leave the matter in exactly the same condition in which it stand when the congress convene

 meanwhile it appear that the commercial pacific cable company have promptly proceed with preparation for lay its cable it also make application to the president for access to and use of sounding take by the u. s. s. nero for the purpose of discover a practicable route for a trans pacific cable the company urge that with access to these sounding it could complete its cable much soon than if it be require to take sounding upon its own account pende consideration of this subject it appear important and desirable to attach certain condition to the permission to examine and use the sounding if it should be grant

 in consequence of this solicitation of the cable company certain condition be formulate upon which the president be willing to allow access to these sounding and to consent to the landing and laying of the cable subject to any alteration or addition thereto impose by the congress this be deem proper especially as it be clear that a cable connection of some kind with china a foreign country be a part of the company&#39;s plan this course be moreover in accordance with a line of precedent include president grant&#39;s action in the case of the first french cable explain to the congress in his annual message of december 1875 and the instance occur in 1879 of the second french cable from brest to st. pierre with a branch to cape cod

 these condition prescribe among other thing a maximum rate for commercial message and that the company should construct a line from the philippine islands to china there be at present as be well know a british line from manila to hongkong

 the representative of the cable company keep these condition long under consideration continue in the meantime to prepare for lay the cable they have however at length accede to they and an all american line between our pacific coast and the chinese empire by way of honolulu and the philippine islands be thus provide for and be expect within a few month to be ready for business

 among the condition be one reserve the power of the congress to modify or repeal any or all of they a copy of the condition be herewith transmit

 of porto rico it be only necessary to say that the prosperity of the island and the wisdom with which it have be govern have be such as to make it serve as an example of all that be good in insular administration

 on july 4 last on the one hundred and twenty sixth anniversary of the declaration of our independence peace and amnesty be promulgate in the philippine islands some trouble have since from time to time threaten with the mohammedan moros but with the late insurrectionary filipinos the war have entirely cease civil government have now be introduce not only do each filipino enjoy such right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as he have never before know during the record history of the island but the people take as a whole now enjoy a measure of self government great than that grant to any other orientals by any foreign power and great than that enjoy by any other orientals under their own government save the japanese alone we have not go too far in grant these right of liberty and self government but we have certainly go to the limit that in the interest of the philippine people themselves it be wise or just to go to hurry matter to go fast than we be now go would entail calamity on the people of the island no policy ever enter into by the american people have vindicate itself in more signal manner than the policy of hold the philippines the triumph of our arm above all the triumph of our law and principle have come soon than we have any right to expect too much praise can not be give to the army for what it have do in the philippines both in warfare and from an administrative standpoint in prepare the way for civil government and similar credit belong to the civil authority for the way in which they have plant the seed of self government in the ground thus make ready for they the courage the unflinche endurance the high soldierly efficiency and the general kind heartedness and humanity of our troop have be strikingly manifest there now remain only some fifteen thousand troop in the island all tell over one hundred thousand have be send there of course there have be individual instance of wrongdoing among they they war under fearful difficulty of climate and surrounding and under the strain of the terrible provocation which they continually receive from their foe occasional instance of cruel retaliation occur every effort have be make to prevent such cruelty and finally these effort have be completely successful every effort have also be make to detect and punish the wrongdoer after make all allowance for these misdeed it remain true that few indeed have be the instance in which war have be wage by a civilized power against semicivilized or barbarous force where there have be so little wrongdoing by the victor as in the philippine islands on the other hand the amount of difficult important and beneficent work which have be do be well nigh incalculable

 take the work of the army and the civil authority together it may be question whether anywhere else in modern time the world have see a well example of real constructive statesmanship than our people have give in the philippine islands high praise should also be give those filipinos in the aggregate very numerous who have accept the new condition and join with our representative to work with hearty good will for the welfare of the island

 the army have be reduce to the minimum allow by law it be very small for the size of the nation and most certainly should be keep at the high point of efficiency the senior officer be give scant chance under ordinary condition to exercise command commensurate with their rank under circumstance which would fit they to do their duty in time of actual war a system of maneuver our army in body of some little size have be begin and should be steadily continue without such maneuver it be folly to expect that in the event of hostility with any serious foe even a small army corp could be handle to advantage both our officer and enlisted man be such that we can take hearty pride in they no well material can be find but they must be thoroughly train both as individual and in the mass the marksmanship of the man must receive special attention in the circumstance of modern warfare the man must act far more on his own individual responsibility than ever before and the high individual efficiency of the unit be of the utmost importance formerly this unit be the regiment it be now not the regiment not even the troop or company it be the individual soldier every effort must be make to develop every workmanlike and soldierly quality in both the officer and the enlisted man

 i urgently call your attention to the need of pass a bill provide for a general staff and for the reorganization of the supply department on the line of the bill propose by the secretary of war last year when the young officer enter the army from west point they probably stand above their compeer in any other military service every effort should be make by training by reward of merit by scrutiny into their career and capacity to keep they of the same high relative excellence throughout their career the measure provide for the reorganization of the militia system and for secure the high efficiency in the national guard which have already pass the house should receive prompt attention and action it be of great importance that the relation of the national guard to the militia and volunteer force of the united states should be define and that in place of our present obsolete law a practical and efficient system should be adopt

 provision should be make to enable the secretary of war to keep cavalry and artillery horse wear out in long performance of duty such horse fetch but a trifle when sell and rather than turn they out to the misery await they when thus dispose of it would be well to employ they at light work around the post and when necessary to put they painlessly to death

 for the first time in our history naval maneuver on a large scale be be hold under the immediate command of the admiral of the navy constantly increase attention be be pay to the gunnery of the navy but it be yet far from what it should be i earnestly urge that the increase ask for by the secretary of the navy in the appropriation for improve the markmanship be grant in battle the only shot that count be the shot that hit it be necessary to provide ample fund for practice with the great gun in time of peace these fund must provide not only for the purchase of projectile but for allowance for prize to encourage the gun crew and especially the gun pointer and for perfect an intelligent system under which alone it be possible to get good practice

 there should be no halt in the work of build up the navy provide every year additional fighting craft we be a very rich country vast in extent of territory and great in population a country moreover which have an army diminutive indeed when compare with that of any other first class power we have deliberately make our own certain foreign policy which demand the possession of a first class navy the isthmian canal will greatly increase the efficiency of our navy if the navy be of sufficient size but if we have an inadequate navy then the building of the canal would be merely give a hostage to any power of superior strength the monroe doctrine should be treat as the cardinal feature of american foreign policy but it would be bad than idle to assert it unless we intend to back it up and it can be back up only by a thoroughly good navy a good navy be not a provocative of war it be the sure guaranty of peace

 each individual unit of our navy should be the most efficient of its kind as regard both material and personnel that be to be find in the world i call your special attention to the need of provide for the manning of the ship serious trouble threaten we if we can not do well than we be now do as regard secure the service of a sufficient number of the high type of sailorman of sea mechanic the veteran seaman of our war ship be of as high a type as can be find in any navy which ride the water of the world they be unsurpasse in daring in resolution in readiness in thorough knowledge of their profession they deserve every consideration that can be show they but there be not enough of they it be no more possible to improvise a crew than it be possible to improvise a war ship to build the fine ship with the deadly battery and to send it afloat with a raw crew no matter how brave they be individually would be to insure disaster if a foe of average capacity be encounter neither ship nor man can be improvise when war have begin

 we need a thousand additional officer in order to properly man the ship now provide for and under construction the class at the naval school at annapolis should be greatly enlarge at the same time that we thus add the officer where we need they we should facilitate the retirement of those at the head of the list whose usefulness have become impaired promotion must be foster if the service be to be keep efficient

 the lamentable scarcity of officer and the large number of recruit and of unskilled man necessarily put aboard the new vessel as they have be commission have throw upon our officer and especially on the lieutenant and junior grade unusual labor and fatigue and have gravely strain their power of endurance nor be there sign of any immediate let up in this strain it must continue for some time long until more officer be graduate from annapolis and until the recruit become trained and skillful in their duty in these difficulty incident upon the development of our war fleet the conduct of all our officer have be creditable to the service and the lieutenant and junior grade in particular have display an ability and a steadfast cheerfulness which entitle they to the ungrudge thank of all who realize the disheartening trial and fatigue to which they be of necessity subject

 there be not a cloud on the horizon at present there seem not the slight chance of trouble with a foreign power we most earnestly hope that this state of thing may continue and the way to insure its continuance be to provide for a thoroughly efficient navy the refusal to maintain such a navy would invite trouble and if trouble come would insure disaster fatuous self complacency or vanity or short sightedness in refuse to prepare for danger be both foolish and wicked in such a nation as our and past experience have show that such fatuity in refuse to recognize or prepare for any crisis in advance be usually succeed by a mad panic of hysterical fear once the crisis have actually arrive

 the striking increase in the revenue of the post office department show clearly the prosperity of our people and the increase activity of the business of the country

 the receipt of the post office department for the fiscal year end june 30 last amount to $ 121,848,047.26 an increase of $ 10,216,853.87 over the precede year the large increase know in the history of the postal service the magnitude of this increase will well appear from the fact that the entire postal receipt for the year 1860 amount to but $ 8,518,067

 rural free delivery service be no long in the experimental stage it have become a fix policy the result follow its introduction have fully justify the congress in the large appropriation make for its establishment and extension the average yearly increase in post office receipt in the rural district of the country be about two per cent we be now able by actual result to show that where rural free delivery service have be establish to such an extent as to enable we to make comparison the yearly increase have be upward of ten per cent

 on november 1 1902 11,650 rural free delivery route have be establish and be in operation cover about one third of the territory of the united states available for rural free delivery service there be now await the action of the department petition and application for the establishment of 10,748 additional route this show conclusively the want which the establishment of the service have meet and the need of far extend it as rapidly as possible it be justify both by the financial result and by the practical benefit to our rural population it bring the man who live on the soil into close relation with the active business world it keep the farmer in daily touch with the market it be a potential educational force it enhance the value of farm property make farm life far pleasanter and less isolated and will do much to check the undesirable current from country to city

 it be to be hope that the congress will make liberal appropriation for the continuance of the service already establish and for its further extension

 few subject of more importance have be take up by the congress in recent year than the inauguration of the system of nationally aid irrigation for the arid region of the far west a good beginning therein have be make now that this policy of national irrigation have be adopt the need of thorough and scientific forest protection will grow more rapidly than ever throughout the public land states

 legislation should be provide for the protection of the game and the wild creature generally on the forest reserve the senseless slaughter of game which can by judicious protection be permanently preserve on our national reserve for the people as a whole should be stop at once it be for instance a serious count against our national good sense to permit the present practice of butcher off such a stately and beautiful creature as the elk for its antler or tusk

 so far as they be available for agriculture and to whatever extent they may be reclaim under the national irrigation law the remain public land should be hold rigidly for the home builder the settler who live on his land and for no one else in their actual use the desert land law the timber and stone law and the commutation clause of the homestead law have be so pervert from the intention with which they be enact as to permit the acquisition of large area of the public domain for other than actual settler and the consequent prevention of settlement moreover the approach exhaustion of the public range have of late lead to much discussion as to the good manner of use these public land in the west which be suitable chiefly or only for graze the sound and steady development of the west depend upon the building up of home therein much of our prosperity as a nation have be due to the operation of the homestead law on the other hand we should recognize the fact that in the graze region the man who correspond to the homesteader may be unable to settle permanently if only allow to use the same amount of pasture land that his brother the homesteader be allow to use of arable land one hundred and sixty acre of fairly rich and well water soil or a much small amount of irrigated land may keep a family in plenty whereas no one could get a living from one hundred and sixty acre of dry pasture land capable of support at the outside only one head of cattle to every ten acre in the past great tract of the public domain have be fence in by person have no title thereto in direct defiance of the law forbid the maintenance or construction of any such unlawful inclosure of public land for various reason there have be little interference with such inclosure in the past but ample notice have now be give the trespasser and all the resource at the command of the government will hereafter be use to put a stop to such trespassing

 in view of the capital importance of these matter i commend they to the earnest consideration of the congress and if the congress find difficulty in deal with they from lack of thorough knowledge of the subject i recommend that provision be make for a commission of expert specially to investigate and report upon the complicated question involve

 i especially urge upon the congress the need of wise legislation for alaska it be not to our credit as a nation that alaska which have be ours for thirty five year should still have as poor a system of law as be the case no country have a more valuable possession-- in mineral wealth in fishery fur forest and also in land available for certain kind of farming and stockgrowing it be a territory of great size and varied resource well fit to support a large permanent population alaska need a good land law and such provision for homestead and pre emption as will encourage permanent settlement we should shape legislation with a view not to the exploiting and abandon of the territory but to the building up of home therein the land law should be liberal in type so as to hold out inducement to the actual settler whom we most desire to see take possession of the country the forest of alaska should be protect and as a secondary but still important matter the game also and at the same time it be imperative that the settler should be allow to cut timber under proper regulation for their own use law should be enact to protect the alaskan salmon fishery against the greed which would destroy they they should be preserve as a permanent industry and food supply their management and control should be turn over to the commission of fish and fishery alaska should have a delegate in the congress it would be well if a congressional committee could visit alaska and investigate its need on the ground

 in deal with the indians our aim should be their ultimate absorption into the body of our people but in many case this absorption must and should be very slow in portion of the indian territory the mixture of blood have go on at the same time with progress in wealth and education so that there be plenty of man with vary degree of purity of indian blood who be absolutely indistinguishable in point of social political and economic ability from their white associate there be other tribe which have as yet make no perceptible advance toward such equality to try to force such tribe too fast be to prevent their go forward at all moreover the tribe live under widely different condition where a tribe have make considerable advance and live on fertile farming soil it be possible to allot the member land in severalty much as be the case with white settler there be other tribe where such a course be not desirable on the arid prairie land the effort should be to induce the indians to lead pastoral rather than agricultural life and to permit they to settle in village rather than to force they into isolation

 the large indian school situate remote from any indian reservation do a special and peculiar work of great importance but excellent though these be an immense amount of additional work must be do on the reservation themselves among the old and above all among the young indians

 the first and most important step toward the absorption of the indian be to teach he to earn his living yet it be not necessarily to be assume that in each community all indians must become either tiller of the soil or stock raiser their industry may properly be diversify and those who show special desire or adaptability for industrial or even commercial pursuit should be encourage so far as practicable to follow out each his own bent

 every effort should be make to develop the indian along the line of natural aptitude and to encourage the exist native industry peculiar to certain tribe such as the various kind of basket weaving canoe building smith work and blanket work above all the indian boy and girl should be give confident command of colloquial english and should ordinarily be prepare for a vigorous struggle with the condition under which their people live rather than for immediate absorption into some more highly developed community

 the official who represent the government in deal with the indians work under hard condition and also under condition which render it easy to do wrong and very difficult to detect wrong consequently they should be amply pay on the one hand and on the other hand a particularly high standard of conduct should be demand from they and where misconduct can be prove the punishment should be exemplary

 in no department of governmental work in recent year have there be great success than in that of give scientific aid to the farming population thereby show they how most efficiently to help themselves there be no need of insist upon its importance for the welfare of the farmer be fundamentally necessary to the welfare of the republic as a whole in addition to such work as quarantine against animal and vegetable plague and war against they when here introduce much efficient help have be render to the farmer by the introduction of new plant specially fit for cultivation under the peculiar condition exist in different portion of the country new cereal have be establish in the semi arid west for instance the practicability of produce the good type of macaroni wheat in region of an annual rainfall of only ten inch or thereabout have be conclusively demonstrate through the introduction of new rice in louisiana and texas the production of rice in this country have be make to about equal the home demand in the south west the possibility of regrasse overstock range land have be demonstrate in the north many new forage crop have be introduce while in the east it have be show that some of our choicest fruit can be store and ship in such a way as to find a profitable market abroad

 i again recommend to the favorable consideration of the congress the plan of the smithsonian institution for make the museum under its charge worthy of the nation and for preserve at the national capital not only record of the vanish race of man but of the animal of this continent which like the buffalo will soon become extinct unless specimen from which their representative may be renew be seek in their native region and maintain there in safety

 the district of columbia be the only part of our territory in which the national government exercise local or municipal function and where in consequence the government have a free hand in reference to certain type of social and economic legislation which must be essentially local or municipal in their character the government should see to it for instance that the hygienic and sanitary legislation affect washington be of a high character the evil of slum dwelling whether in the shape of crowded and congested tenement house district or of the back alley type should never be permit to grow up in washington the city should be a model in every respect for all the city of the country the charitable and correctional system of the district should receive consideration at the hand of the congress to the end that they may embody the result of the most advanced thought in these field moreover while washington be not a great industrial city there be some industrialism here and our labor legislation while it would not be important in itself might be make a model for the rest of the nation we should pass for instance a wise employer&#39;s liability act for the district of columbia and we need such an act in our navy yard railroad company in the district ought to be require by law to block their frog

 the safety appliance law for the well protection of the life and limb of railway employee which be pass in 1893 go into full effect on august 1 1901 it have result in avert thousand of casualty experience show however the necessity of additional legislation to perfect this law a bill to provide for this pass the senate at the last session it be to be hope that some such measure may now be enact into law

 there be a grow tendency to provide for the publication of masse of document for which there be no public demand and for the printing of which there be no real necessity large number of volume be turn out by the government print press for which there be no justification nothing should be print by any of the departments unless it contain something of permanent value and the congress could with advantage cut down very materially on all the printing which it have now become customary to provide the excessive cost of government printing be a strong argument against the position of those who be incline on abstract ground to advocate the government&#39;s do any work which can with propriety be leave in private hand

 gratifying progress have be make during the year in the extension of the merit system of make appointment in the government service it should be extend by law to the district of columbia it be much to be desire that our consular system be establish by law on a basis provide for appointment and promotion only in consequence of prove fitness

 through a wise provision of the congress at its last session the white house which have become disfigure by incongruous addition and change have now be restore to what it be plan to be by washington in make the restoration the utmost care have be exercise to come as near as possible to the early plan and to supplement these plan by a careful study of such building as that of the university of virginia which be build by jefferson the white house be the property of the nation and so far as be compatible with live therein it should be keep as it originally be for the same reason that we keep mount vernon as it originally be the stately simplicity of its architecture be an expression of the character of the period in which it be build and be in accord with the purpose it be design to serve it be a good thing to preserve such building as historic monument which keep alive our sense of continuity with the nation&#39;s past

 to the senate and house of representatives
 i have convene the congress that it may consider the legislation necessary to put into operation the commercial treaty with cuba which be ratify by the senate at its last session and subsequently by the cuban government i deem such legislation demand not only by our interest but by our honor we can not with propriety abandon the course upon which we have so wisely embark when the acceptance of the platt amendment be require from cuba by the action of the congress of the united states this government thereby definitely commit itself to the policy of treat cuba as occupy a unique position as regard this country it be provide that when the island become a free and independent republic she should stand in such close relation with we as in certain respect to come within our system of international policy and it necessarily follow that she must also to a certain degree become include within the line of our economic policy situate as cuba be it would not be possible for this country to permit the strategic abuse of the island by any foreign military power it be for this reason that certain limitation have be impose upon her financial policy and that naval station have be concede by she to the united states the negotiation as to the detail of these naval station be on the eve of completion they be so situated as to prevent any idea that there be the intention ever to use they against cuba or otherwise than for the protection of cuba from the assault of foreign foe and for the well safeguarding of american interest in the water south of we
 these interest have be largely increase by the consequence of the war with spain and will be still far increase by the building of the isthmian canal they be both military and economic the granting to we by cuba of the naval station above allude to be of the utmost importance from a military standpoint and be proof of the good faith with which cuba be treat we cuba have make great progress since her independence be establish she have advance steadily in every way she already stand high among her sister republic of the new world she be loyally observe her obligation to we and she be entitle to like treatment by we
 the treaty submit to you for approval secure to the united states economic advantage as great as those give to cuba not an american interest be sacrifice by the treaty a large cuban market be secure to our producer it be a market which lie at our door which be already large which be capable of great expansion and which be especially important to the development of our export trade it would be indeed shortsighted for we to refuse to take advantage of such an opportunity and to force cuba into make arrangement with other country to our disadvantage
 this reciprocity treaty stand by itself it be demand on consideration of broad national policy as well as by our economic interest it will do harm to no industry it will benefit many industry it be in the interest of our people as a whole both because of its importance from the broad standpoint of international policy and because economically it intimately concern we to develop and secure the rich cuban market for our farmer artisan merchant and manufacturer finally it be desirable as a guaranty of the good faith of our nation towards her young sister republic to the south whose welfare must ever be closely bind with ours we give her liberty we be knit to she by the memory of the blood and the courage of our soldier who fight for she in war by the memory of the wisdom and integrity of our administrator who serve she in peace and who start she so well on the difficult path of self government we must help she onward and upward and in help she we shall help ourselves
 the foregoing consideration cause the negotiation of the treaty with cuba and its ratification by the senate they now with equal force support the legislation by the congress which by the term of the treaty be necessary to render it operative a failure to enact such legislation would come perilously near a repudiation of the pledge faith of the nation
 i transmit herewith the treaty as amend by the senate and ratify by the cuban government

arbitrary and tyrannous interference with the right of other whether corporation or individual then where the federal government have jurisdiction it will see to it that the misconduct be stop pay not the slight heed to the position or power of the corporation the union or the individual but only to one vital fact that is the question whether or not the conduct of the individual or aggregate of individual be in accordance with the law of the land every man must be guarantee his liberty and his right to do as he like with his property or his labor so long as he do not infringe the right of other no man be above the law and no man be below it nor do we ask any man 's permission when we require he to obey it obedience to the law be demand as a right not ask as a favor we have cause as a nation to be thankful for the step that have be so successfully take to put these principle into effect the progress have be by evolution not by revolution nothing radical have be do the action have be both moderate and resolute therefore the work will stand there shall be no backward step if in the working of the law it prove desirable that they shall at any point be expand or amplify the amendment can be make as its desirability be show meanwhile they be be administer with judgment but with insistence upon obedience to they and their need have be emphasize in signal fashion by the event of the past year from all source exclusive of the postal service the receipt of the government for the last fiscal year aggregate $ 560,396,674 the expenditure for the same period be $ 506,099,007 the surplus for the fiscal year be $ 54,297,667 the indication be that the surplus for the present fiscal year will be very small if indeed there be any surplus from july to november the receipt from custom be approximately nine million dollar less than the receipt from the same source for a corresponding portion of last year should this decrease continue at the same ratio throughout the fiscal year the surplus would be reduce by approximately thirty million dollar should the revenue from custom suffer much further decrease during the fiscal year the surplus would vanish a large surplus be certainly undesirable two year ago the war taxis be take off with the express intention of equalize the governmental receipt and expenditure and though the first year thereafter still show a surplus it now seem likely that a substantial equality of revenue and expenditure will be attain such be the case it be of great moment both to exercise care and economy in appropriation and to scan sharply any change in our fiscal revenue system which may reduce our income the need of strict economy in our expenditure be emphasize by the fact that we can not afford to be parsimonious in provide for what be essential to our national well being careful economy wherever possible will alone prevent our income from fall below the point require in order to meet our genuine need the integrity of our currency be beyond question and under present condition it would be unwise and unnecessary to attempt a reconstruction of our entire monetary system the same liberty should be grant the secretary of the treasury to deposit custom receipt as be grant he in the deposit of receipt from other source in my message of december 2 1902 i call attention to certain need of the financial situation and i again ask the consideration of the congress for these question during the last session of the congress at the suggestion of a joint note from the republic of mexico and the imperial government of china and in harmony with an act of the congress appropriating $ 25,000 to pay the expense thereof a commission be appoint to confer with the principal european country in the hope that some plan might be devise whereby a fixed rate of exchange could be assure between the gold standard country and the silver standard country this commission have file its preliminary report which have be make public i deem it important that the commission be continue and that a sum of money be appropriate sufficient to pay the expense of its further labor a majority of our people desire that step be take in the interest of american shipping so that we may once more resume our former position in the ocean carry trade but hitherto the difference of opinion as to the proper method of reach this end have be so wide that it have prove impossible to secure the adoption of any particular scheme have in view these fact i recommend that the congress direct the secretary of the navy the postmaster general and the secretary of commerce and labor associate with such a representation from the senate and house of representatives as the congress in its wisdom may designate to serve as a commission for the purpose of investigate and report to the congress at its next session what legislation be desirable or necessary for the development of the american merchant marine and american commerce and incidentally of a national ocean mail service of adequate auxiliary naval crusier and naval reserve while such a measure be desirable in any event it be especially desirable at this time in view of the fact that our present governmental contract for ocean mail with the american line will expire in 1905 our ocean mail act be pass in 1891 in 1895 our 20 knot transatlantic mail line be equal to any foreign line since then the germans have put on 23 knot steamer and the british have contract for 24 knot steamer our service should equal the good if it do not the commercial public will abandon it if we be to stay in the business it ought to be with a full understanding of the advantage to the country on one hand and on the other with exact knowledge of the cost and proper method of carry it on moreover line of cargo ship be of even more importance than fast mail line save so far as the latter can be depend upon to furnish swift auxiliary cruiser in time of war the establishment of new line of cargo ship to south america to asia and elsewhere would be much in the interest of our commercial expansion we can not have too much immigration of the right kind and we should have none at all of the wrong kind the need be to devise some system by which undesirable immigrant shall be keep out entirely while desirable immigrant be properly distribute throughout the country at present some district which need immigrant have none and in other where the population be already congest immigrant come in such number as to depress the condition of life for those already there during the last two year the immigration service at new york have be greatly improve and the corruption and inefficiency which formerly obtain there have be eradicate this service have just be investigate by a committee of new york citizen of high standing messrs. arthur v. briesen lee k. frankel eugene a. philbin thomas w. hynes and ralph trautman their report deal with the whole situation at length and conclude with certain recommendation for administrative and legislative action it be now receive the attention of the secretary of commerce and labor the special investigation of the subject of naturalization under the direction of the attorney general and the consequent prosecution reveal a condition of affair call for the immediate attention of the congress forgery and perjury of shameless and flagrant character have be perpetrate not only in the dense center of population but throughout the country and it be establish beyond doubt that very many so call citizen of the united states have no title whatever to that right and be assert and enjoy the benefit of the same through the gross fraud it be never to be forget that citizenship be to quote the word recently use by the supreme court of the united states an inestimable heritage whether it proceed from birth within the country or be obtain by naturalization and we poison the source of our national character and strength at the fountain if the privilege be claim and exercise without right and by mean of fraud and corruption the body politic can not be sound and healthy if many of its constituent member claim their standing through the prostitution of the high right and calling of citizenship it should mean something to become a citizen of the united states and in the process no loophole whatever should be leave open to fraud the method by which these fraud now under full investigation with a view to mete out punishment and provide adequate remedy be perpetrate include many variation of procedure by which false certificate of citizenship be forge in their entirety or genuine certificate fraudulently or collusively obtain in blank be fill in by the criminal conspirator or certificate be obtain on fraudulent statement as to the time of arrival and residence in this country or imposition and substitution of another party for the real petitioner occur in court or certificate be make the subject of barter and sale and transfer from the rightful holder to those not entitle to they or certificate be forge by erasure of the original name and the insertion of the name of other person not entitle to the same it be not necessary for i to refer here at large to the cause lead to this state of affair the desire for naturalization be heartily to be commend where it spring from a sincere and permanent intention to become citizen and a real appreciation of the privilege but it be a source of untold evil and trouble where it be traceable to selfish and dishonest motive such as the effort by artificial and improper mean in wholesale fashion to create voter who be ready make tool of corrupt politician or the desire to evade certain labor law create discrimination against alien labor all good citizen whether naturalized or native bear be equally interested in protect our citizenship against fraud in any form and on the other hand in afford every facility for naturalization to those who in good faith desire to share alike our privilege and our responsibility the federal grand jury lately in session in new york city deal with this subject and make a presentment which state the situation briefly and forcibly and contain important suggestion for the consideration of the congress this presentment be include as an appendix to the report of the attorney general in my last annual message in connection with the subject of the due regulation of combination of capital which be or may become injurious to the public i recommend a special appropriation for the well enforcement of the antitrust law as it now stand to be extend under the direction of the attorney general accordingly by the legislative executive and judicial appropriation act of february 25 1903 32 stat 854 904 the congress appropriate for the purpose of enforce the various federal trust and interstate commerce law the sum of five hundred thousand dollar to be expend under the direction of the attorney general in the employment of special counsel and agent in the department of justice to conduct proceeding and prosecution under say law in the court of the united states i now recommend as a matter of the utmost importance and urgency the extension of the purpose of this appropriation so that it may be available under the direction of the attorney general and until use for the due enforcement of the law of the united states in general and especially of the civil and criminal law relate to public land and the law relate to postal crime and offense and the subject of naturalization recent investigation have show a deplorable state of affair in these three matter of vital concern by various fraud and by forgery and perjury thousand of acre of the public domain embrace land of different character and extend through various section of the country have be dishonestly acquire it be hardly necessary to urge the importance of recover these dishonest acquisition steal from the people and of promptly and duly punish the offender i speak in another part of this message of the widespread crime by which the sacred right of citizenship be falsely assert and that inestimable heritage pervert to base end by similar mean that is through fraud forgery and perjury and by shameless bribery the law relate to the proper conduct of the public service in general and to the due administration of the post office department have be notoriously violate and many indictment have be find and the consequent prosecution be in course of hearing or on the eve thereof for the reason thus indicate and so that the government may be prepare to enforce promptly and with the great effect the due penalty for such violation of law and to this end may be furnish with sufficient instrumentality and competent legal assistance for the investigation and trial which will be necessary at many different point of the country i urge upon the congress the necessity of make the say appropriation available for immediate use for all such purpose to be expend under the direction of the attorney general step have be take by the state department look to the making of bribery an extraditable offense with foreign power the need of more effective treaty cover this crime be manif the exposure and prosecution of official corruption in st. louis mo. and other city and states have result in a number of giver and taker of bribe become fugitive in foreign land bribery have not be include in extradition treaty heretofore as the necessity for it have not arise while there may have be as much official corruption in former year there have be more developed and bring to light in the immediate past than in the precede century of our country 's history it should be the policy of the united states to leave no place on earth where a corrupt man flee from this country can rest in peace there be no reason why bribery should not be include in all treaty as extraditable the recent amend treaty with mexico whereby this crime be put in the list of extraditable offense have establish a salutary precedent in this regard under this treaty the state department have ask and mexico have grant the extradition of one of the st. louis bribe giver there can be no crime more serious than bribery other offense violate one law while corruption strike at the foundation of all law under our form of government all authority be vest in the people and by they delegate to those who represent they in official capacity there can be no offense heavy than that of he in whom such a sacred trust have be repose who sell it for his own gain and enrichment and no less heavy be the offense of the bribe giver he be bad than the thief for the thief rob the individual while the corrupt official plunder an entire city or state he be as wicked as the murderer for the murderer may only take one life against the law while the corrupt official and the man who corrupt the official alike aim at the assassination of the commonwealth itself government of the people by the people for the people will perish from the face of the earth if bribery be tolerate the giver and taker of bribe stand on an evil pre eminence of infamy the exposure and punishment of public corruption be an honor to a nation not a disgrace the shame lie in toleration not in correction no city or state still less the nation can be injure by the enforcement of law as long as public plunderer when detect can find a haven of refuge in any foreign land and avoid punishment just so long encouragement be give they to continue their practice if we fail to do all that in we lie to stamp out corruption we can not escape our share of responsibility for the guilt the first requisite of successful self government be unflinche enforcement of the law and the cutting out of corruption for several year past the rapid development of alaska and the establishment of grow american interest in region theretofore unsurveyed and imperfectly know bring into prominence the urgent necessity of a practical demarcation of the boundary between the jurisdiction of the united states and great britain although the treaty of 1825 between great britain and russia the provision of which be copy in the treaty of 1867 whereby russia convey alaska to the united states be positive as to the control first by russia and later by the united states of a strip of territory along the continental mainland from the western shore of portland canal to mount st. elias follow and surround the indentation of the coast and include the island to the westward its description of the landward margin of the strip be indefinite rest on the suppose existence of a continuous ridge or range of mountain skirt the coast as figure in the chart of the early navigator it have at no time be possible for either party in interest to lay down under the authority of the treaty a line so obviously exact accord to its provision as to command the assent of the other for nearly three fourth of a century the absence of tangible local interest demand the exercise of positive jurisdiction on either side of the border leave the question dormant in 1878 question of revenue administration on the stikine river lead to the establishment of a provisional demarcation cross the channel between two high peak on either side about twenty four mile above the river mouth in 1899 similar question grow out of the extraordinary development of mining interest in the region about the head of lynn canal bring about a temporary modus vivendi by which a convenient separation be make at the watershed divide of the white and chilkoot pass and to the north of klukwan on the klehini river these partial and tentative adjustment could not in the very nature of thing be satisfactory or lasting a permanent disposition of the matter become imperative after unavaile attempt to reach an understanding through a joint high commission follow by prolonged negotiation conduct in an amicable spirit a convention between the united states and great britain be sign january 24 1903 provide for an examination of the subject by a mixed tribunal of six member three on a side with a view to its final disposition ratification be exchange on march 3 last whereupon the two government appoint their respective member those on behalf of the united states be elihu root secretary of war henry cabot lodge a senator of the united states and george turner an ex senator of the united states while great britain name the right honourable lord alverstone lord chief justice of england sir louis amable jette k. c. m. g. retired judge of the supreme court of quebec and a. b. aylesworth k. c. of toronto this tribunal meet in london on september 3 under the presidency of lord alverstone the proceeding be expeditious and mark by a friendly and conscientious spirit the respective case counter case and argument present the issue clearly and fully on the 20th of october a majority of the tribunal reach and sign an agreement on all the question submit by the term of the convention by this award the right of the united states to the control of a continuous strip or border of the mainland shore skirt all the tide water inlet and sinuosity of the coast be confirm the entrance to portland canal concern which legitimate doubt appear be define as pass by tongass inlet and to the northwestward of wales and pearse island a line be draw from the head of portland canal to the fifty sixth degree of north latitude and the interior border line of the strip be fix by line connect certain mountain summit lie between portland canal and mount st. elias and run along the crest of the divide separate the coast slope from the inland watershed at the only part of the frontier where the drainage ridge approach the coast within the distance of ten marine league stipulate by the treaty as the extreme width of the strip around the head of lynn canal and its branch while the line so trace follow the provisional demarcation of 1878 at the crossing of the stikine river and that of 1899 at the summit of the white and chilkoot pass it run much far inland from the klehini than the temporary line of the later modus vivendi and leave the entire mining district of the porcupine river and glacier creek within the jurisdiction of the united states the result be satisfactory in every way it be of great material advantage to our people in the far northwest it have remove from the field of discussion and possible danger a question liable to become more acutely accentuate with each pass year finally it have furnish a signal proof of the fairness and good will with which two friendly nation can approach and determine issue involve national sovereignty and by their nature incapable of submission to a third power for adjudication the award be self execute on the vital point to make it effective as regard the other it only remain for the two government to appoint each on its own behalf one or more scientific expert who shall with all convenient speed proceed together to lay down the boundary line in accordance with the decision of the majority of the tribunal i recommend that the congress make adequate provision for the appointment compensation and expense of the member to serve on this joint boundary commission on the part of the united states it will be remember that during the second session of the last congress great britain germany and italy form an alliance for the purpose of blockade the port of venezuela and use such other mean of pressure as would secure a settlement of claim due as they allege to certain of their subject their employment of force for the collection of these claim be terminate by an agreement bring about through the office of the diplomatic representative of the united states at caracas and the government at washington thereby end a situation which be bind to cause increase friction and which jeoparde the peace of the continent under this agreement venezuela agree to set apart a certain percentage of the custom receipt of two of her port to be apply to the payment of whatever obligation might be ascertain by mixed commission appoint for that purpose to be due from she not only to the three power already mention whose proceeding against she have result in a state of war but also to the united states france spain belgium the netherlands sweden and norway and mexico who have not employ force for the collection of the claim allege to be due to certain of their citizen a demand be then make by the so call blockade power that the sum ascertain to be due to their citizen by such mixed commission should be accord payment in full before anything be pay upon the claim of any of the so call peace power venezuela on the other hand insist that all her creditor should be pay upon a basis of exact equality during the effort to adjust this dispute it be suggest by the power in interest that it should be refer to i for decision but i be clearly of the opinion that a far wise course would be to submit the question to the permanent court of arbitration at the hague it seem to i to offer an admirable opportunity to advance the practice of the peaceful settlement of dispute between nation and to secure for the hague tribunal a memorable increase of its practical importance the nation interested in the controversy be so numerous and in many instance so powerful as to make it evident that beneficent result would follow from their appearance at the same time before the bar of that august tribunal of peace our hope in that regard have be realize russia and austria be represent in the person of the learn and distinguished jurist who compose the tribunal while great britain germany france spain italy belgium the netherlands sweden and norway mexico the united states and venezuela be represent by their respective agent and counsel such an impose concourse of nation present their argument to and invoke the decision of that high court of international justice and international peace can hardly fail to secure a like submission of many future controversy the nation now appear there will find it far easy to appear there a second time while no nation can imagine its just pride will be lessen by follow the example now present this triumph of the principle of international arbitration be a subject of warm congratulation and offer a happy augury for the peace of the world there seem good ground for the belief that there have be a real growth among the civilized nation of a sentiment which will permit a gradual substitution of other method than the method of war in the settlement of dispute it be not pretend that as yet we be near a position in which it will be possible wholly to prevent war or that a just regard for national interest and honor will in all case permit of the settlement of international dispute by arbitration but by a mixture of prudence and firmness with wisdom we think it be possible to do away with much of the provocation and excuse for war and at least in many case to substitute some other and more rational method for the settlement of dispute the hague court offer so good an example of what can be do in the direction of such settlement that it should be encourage in every way further step should be take in president mckinley 's annual message of december 5 1898 he make the following recommendation:"the experience of the last year bring forcibly home to we a sense of the burden and the waste of war we desire in common with most civilized nation to reduce to the low possible point the damage sustain in time of war by peaceable trade and commerce it be true we may suffer in such case less than other community but all nation be damage more or less by the state of uneasiness and apprehension into which an outbreak of hostility throw the entire commercial world it should be our object therefore to minimize so far as practicable this inevitable loss and disturbance this purpose can probably well be accomplish by an international agreement to regard all private property at sea as exempt from capture or destruction by the force of belligerent power the united states government have for many year advocate this humane and beneficent principle and be now in a position to recommend it to other power without the imputation of selfish motive i therefore suggest for your consideration that the executive be authorize to correspond with the government of the principal maritime power with a view of incorporate into the permanent law of civilized nation the principle of the exemption of all private property at sea not contraband of war from capture or destruction by belligerent power "i cordially renew this recommendation the supreme court speak on december 11 1899 through peckham j. said:"it be we think historically accurate to say that this government have always be in its view among the most advanced of the government of the world in favor of mitigating as to all non combatant the hardship and horror of war to accomplish that object it have always advocate those rule which would in most case do away with the right to capture the private property of an enemy on the high sea "i advocate this as a matter of humanity and moral it be anachronistic when private property be respect on land that it should not be respect at sea moreover it should be bear in mind that shipping represent internationally speak a much more generalized specie of private property than be the case with ordinary property on land that is property find at sea be much less apt than be the case with property find on land really to belong to any one nation under the modern system of corporate ownership the flag of a vessel often differ from the flag which would mark the nationality of the real ownership and money control of the vessel and the cargo may belong to individual of yet a different nationality much american capital be now invest in foreign ship and among foreign nation it often happen that the capital of one be largely invest in the shipping of another furthermore as a practical matter it may be mention that while commerce destroy may cause serious loss and great annoyance it can never be more than a subsidiary factor in bring to term a resolute foe this be now well recognize by all of our naval expert the fighting ship not the commerce destroyer be the vessel whose feat add renown to a nation 's history and establish her place among the great power of the world last year the interparliamentary union for international arbitration meet at vienna six hundred member of the different legislature of civilized country attend it be provide that the next meeting should be in 1904 at st. louis subject to our congress extend an invitation like the hague tribunal this interparliamentary union be one of the force tend towards peace among the nation of the earth and it be entitle to our support i trust the invitation can be extend early in july having receive intelligence which happily turn out to be erroneous of the assassination of our vice consul at beirut i dispatch a small squadron to that port for such service as might be find necessary on arrival although the attempt on the life of our vice consul have not be successful yet the outrage be symptomatic of a state of excitement and disorder which demand immediate attention the arrival of the vessel have the happy result a feeling of security at once take the place of the former alarm and disquiet our officer be cordially welcome by the consular body and the lead merchant and ordinary business resume its activity the government of the sultan give a considerate hearing to the representation of our minister the official who be regard as responsible for the disturbed condition of affair be remove our relation with the turkish government remain friendly our claim round on inequitable treatment of some of our school and mission appear to be in process of amicable adjustment the signing of a new commercial treaty with china which take place at shanghai on the 8th of october be a cause for satisfaction this act the result of long discussion and negotiation place our commercial relation with the great oriental empire on a more satisfactory footing than they have ever heretofore enjoy it provide not only for the ordinary right and privilege of diplomatic and consular officer but also for an important extension of our commerce by increase facility of access to chinese port and for the relief of trade by the removal of some of the obstacle which have embarrass it in the past the chinese government engage on fair and equitable condition which will probably be accept by the principal commercial nation to abandon the levy of liken and other transit due throughout the empire and to introduce other desirable administrative reform large facility be to be give to our citizen who desire to carry on mining enterprise in china we have secure for our missionary a valuable privilege the recognition of their right to rent and lease in perpetuity such property as their religious society may need in all part of the empire and what be an indispensable condition for the advance and development of our commerce in manchuria china by treaty with we have open to foreign commerce the city of mukden the capital of the province of manchuria and an tung an important port on the yalu river on the road to korea the full measure of development which our commerce may rightfully expect can hardly be look for until the settlement of the present abnormal state of thing in the empire but the foundation for such development have at last be lay i call your attention to the reduce cost in maintain the consular service for the fiscal year end june 30 1903 as show in the annual report of the auditor for the state and other departments as compare with the year previous for the year under consideration the excess of expenditure over receipt on account of the consular service amount to $ 26,125.12 as against $ 96,972.50 for the year end june 30 1902 and $ 147,040.16 for the year end june 30 1901 this be the good showing in this respect for the consular service for the past fourteen year and the reduction in the cost of the service to the government have be make in spite of the fact that the expenditure for the year in question be more than $ 20,000 great than for the previous year the rural free delivery service have be steadily extend the attention of the congress be ask to the question of the compensation of the letter carrier and clerk engage in the postal service especially on the new rural free delivery route more route have be instal since the first of july last than in any like period in the department 's history while a due regard to economy must be keep in mind in the establishment of new route yet the extension of the rural free delivery system must be continue for reason of sound public policy no governmental movement of recent year have result in great immediate benefit to the people of the country district rural free delivery take in connection with the telephone the bicycle and the trolley accomplish much toward lessen the isolation of farm life and make it bright and more attractive in the immediate past the lack of just such facility as these have drive many of the more active and restless young man and woman from the farm to the city for they rebel at loneliness and lack of mental companionship it be unhealthy and undesirable for the city to grow at the expense of the country and rural free delivery be not only a good thing in itself but be good because it be one of the cause which check this unwholesome tendency towards the urban concentration of our population at the expense of the country district it be for the same reason that we sympathize with and approve of the policy of build good road the movement for good road be one fraught with the great benefit to the country district i trust that the congress will continue to favor in all proper way the louisiana purchase exposition this exposition commemorate the louisiana purchase which be the first great step in the expansion which make we a continental nation the expedition of lewis and clark across the continent follow thereon and mark the beginning of the process of exploration and colonization which thrust our national boundary to the pacific the acquisition of the oregon country include the present states of oregon and washington be a fact of immense importance in our history first give we our place on the pacific seaboard and make ready the way for our ascendency in the commerce of the great of the ocean the centennial of our establishment upon the western coast by the expedition of lewis and clark be to be celebrate at portland oregon by an exposition in the summer of 1905 and this event should receive recognition and support from the national government i call your special attention to the territory of alaska the country be develop rapidly and it have an assured future the mineral wealth be great and have as yet hardly be tap the fishery if wisely handle and keep under national control will be a business as permanent as any other and of the utmost importance to the people the forest if properly guard will form another great source of wealth portion of alaska be fit for farming and stock raising although the method must be adapt to the peculiar condition of the country alaska be situate in the far north but so be norway and sweden and finland and alaska can prosper and play its part in the new world just as those nation have prosper and play their part in the old world proper land law should be enact and the survey of the public land immediately begin coal land law should be provide whereby the coal land entryman may make his location and secure patent under method kindre to those now prescribe for homestead and mineral entryman salmon hatchery exclusively under government control should be establish the cable should be extend from sitka westward wagon road and trail should be build and the building of railroad promote in all legitimate way light house should be build along the coast attention should be pay to the need of the alaska indians provision should be make for an officer with deputy to study their need relieve their immediate want and help they adapt themselves to the new condition the commission appoint to investigate during the season of 1903 the condition and need of the alaskan salmon fishery have finish its work in the field and be prepare a detailed report thereon a preliminary report recite the measure immediately require for the protection and preservation of the salmon industry have already be submit to the secretary of commerce and labor for his attention and for the need action i recommend that an appropriation be make for build light house in hawaii and take possession of those already build the territory should be reimburse for whatever amount it have already expend for light house the governor should be empower to suspend or remove any official appoint by he without submit the matter to the legislature of our insular possession the philippines and porto rico it be gratify to say that their steady progress have be such as to make it unnecessary to spend much time in discuss they yet the congress should ever keep in mind that a peculiar obligation rest upon we to far in every way the welfare of these community the philippines should be knit close to we by tariff arrangement it would of course be impossible suddenly to raise the people of the island to the high pitch of industrial prosperity and of governmental efficiency to which they will in the end by degree attain and the caution and moderation show in develop they have be among the main reason why this development have hitherto go on so smoothly scrupulous care have be take in the choice of governmental agent and the entire elimination of partisan politic from the public service the condition of the islander be in material thing far well than ever before while their governmental intellectual and moral advance have keep pace with their material advance no one people ever benefit another people more than we have benefit the filipinos by take possession of the island the cash receipt of the general land office for the last fiscal year be $ 11,024,743.65 an increase of $ 4,762,816.47 over the precede year of this sum approximately $ 8,461,493 will go to the credit of the fund for the reclamation of arid land make the total of this fund up to the 30th of june 1903 approximately $ 16,191,836.a gratifying disposition have be evince by those have unlawful inclosure of public land to remove their fence nearly two million acre so inclosed have be throw open on demand in but comparatively few case have it be necessary to go into court to accomplish this purpose this work will be vigorously prosecute until all unlawful inclosure have be remove experience have show that in the western states themselves as well as in the rest of the country there be widespread conviction that certain of the public land law and the result administrative practice no long meet the present need the character and use of the remain public land differ widely from those of the public land which congress have especially in view when these law be pass the rapidly increase rate of disposal of the public land be not follow by a corresponding increase in home building there be a tendency to mass in large holding public land especially timber and grazing land and thereby to retard settlement i renew and emphasize my recommendation of last year that so far as they be available for agriculture in its broad sense and to whatever extent they may be reclaim under the national irrigation law the remain public land should be hold rigidly for the home builder the attention of the congress be especially direct to the timber and stone law the desert land law and the commutation clause of the homestead law which in their operation have in many respect conflict with wise public land policy the discussion in the congress and elsewhere have make it evident that there be a wide divergence of opinion between those hold opposite view on these subject and that the oppose side have strong and convinced representative of weight both within and without the congress the difference be not only as to matter of opinion but as to matter of fact in order that definite information may be available for the use of the congress i have appoint a commission compose of w. a. richards commissioner of the general land office gifford pinchot chief of the bureau of forestry of the department of agriculture and f. h. newell chief hydrographer of the geological survey to report at the early practicable moment upon the condition operation and effect of the present land law and on the use condition disposal and settlement of the public land the commission will report especially what change in organization law regulation and practice affect the public land be need to effect the large practicable disposition of the public land to actual settler who will build permanent home upon they and to secure in permanence the full and most effective use of the resource of the public land and it will make such other report and recommendation as its study of these question may suggest the commission be to report immediately upon those point concern which its judgment be clear on any point upon which it have doubt it will take the time necessary to make investigation and reach a final judgment the work of reclamation of the arid land of the west be progress steadily and satisfactorily under the term of the law set aside the proceed from the disposal of public land the corp of engineer know as the reclamation service which be conduct the survey and examination have be thoroughly organize especial pain be take to secure under the civil service rule a body of skilled experienced and efficient man survey and examination be progress throughout the arid states and territories plan for reclaim work be prepare and pass upon by board of engineer before approval by the secretary of the interior in arizona and nevada in locality where such work be pre eminently need construction have already be begin in other part of the arid west various project be well advanced towards the drawing up of contract these be delay in part by necessity of reach agreement or understanding as regard right of way or acquisition of real estate most of the work contemplate for construction be of national importance involve interstate question or the securing of stable self support community in the midst of vast tract of vacant land the nation as a whole be of course the gainer by the creation of these home add as they do to the wealth and stability of the country and furnish a home market for the product of the east and south the reclamation law while perhaps not ideal appear at present to answer the large need for which it be design further legislation be not recommend until the necessity of change be more apparent the study of the opportunity of reclamation of the vast extent of arid land show that whether this reclamation be do by individual corporation or the state the source of water supply must be effectively protect and the reservoir guard by the preservation of the forest at the headwater of the stream the engineer make the preliminary examination continually emphasize this need and urge that the remain public land at the headwater of the important stream of the west be reserve to insure permanency of water supply for irrigation much progress in forestry have be make during the past year the necessity for perpetuate our forest resource whether in public or private hand be recognize now as never before the demand for forest reserve have become insistent in the west because the west must use the water wood and summer range which only such reserve can supply progressive lumberman be strive through forestry to give their business permanence other great business interest be awaken to the need of forest preservation as a business matter the government 's forest work should receive from the congress hearty support and especially support adequate for the protection of the forest reserve against fire the forest reserve policy of the government have pass beyond the experimental stage and have reach a condition where scientific method be essential to its successful prosecution the administrative feature of forest reserve be at present unsatisfactory be divide between three bureaus of two department it be therefore recommend that all matter pertain to forest reserve except those involve or pertain to land title be consolidate in the bureau of forestry of the department of agriculture the cotton grow state have recently be invade by a weevil that have do much damage and threaten the entire cotton industry i suggest to the congress the prompt enactment of such remedial legislation as its judgment may approve in grant patent to foreigner the proper course for this country to follow be to give the same advantage to foreigner here that the country in which these foreigner dwell extend in return to our citizen that be to extend the benefit of our patent law on invention and the like where in return the article would be patentable in the foreign country concern where an american could get a corresponding patent in such country the indian agent should not be dependent for their appointment or tenure of office upon consideration of partisan politic the practice of appointing when possible ex army officer or bond superintendent to the vacancy that occur be work well attention be invite to the widespread illiteracy due to lack of public school in the indian territory prompt heed should be pay to the need of education for the child in this territory in my last annual message the attention of the congress be call to the necessity of enlarge the safety appliance law and it be gratify to note that this law be amend in important respect with the increase railway mileage of the country the great number of man employ and the use of large and heavy equipment the urgency for renewed effort to prevent the loss of life and limb upon the railroad of the country particularly to employee be apparent for the inspection of water craft and the life saving service upon the water the congress have build up an elaborate body of protective legislation and a thorough method of inspection and be annually spend large sum of money it be encouraging to observe that the congress be alive to the interest of those who be employ upon our wonderful artery of commerce the railroad who so safely transport million of passenger and billion of ton of freight the federal inspection of safety appliance for which the congress be now make appropriation be a service analogous to that which the government have uphold for generation in regard to vessel and it be believe will prove of great practical benefit both to railroad employee and the travel public as the great part of commerce be interstate and exclusively under the control of the congress the need safety and uniformity must be secure by national legislation no other class of our citizen deserve so well of the nation as those to whom the nation owe its very being the veteran of the civil war special attention be ask to the excellent work of the pension bureau in expedite and dispose of pension claim during the fiscal year end july 1 1903 the bureau settle 251,982 claim an average of 825 claim for each work day of the year the number of settlement since july 1 1903 have be in excess of last year 's average approach 1,000 claim for each work day and it be believe that the work of the bureau will be current at the close of the present fiscal year during the year end june 30 last 25,566 person be appoint through competitive examination under the civil service rule this be 12,672 more than during the precede year and 40 per cent of those who pass the examination this abnormal growth be largely occasion by the extension of classification to the rural

completion of the reform of the civil service be recognize by good citizen everywhere as a matter of the high public importance and the success of the merit system largely depend upon the effectiveness of the rule and the machinery provide for their enforcement a very gratifying spirit of friendly co operation exist in all the departments of the government in the enforcement and uniform observance of both the letter and spirit of the civil service act executive order of july 3 1902 march 26 1903 and july 8 1903 require that appointment of all unclassified laborer both in the departments at washington and in the field service shall be make with the assistance of the united states civil service commission under a system of registration to test the relative fitness of applicant for appointment or employment this system be competitive and be open to all citizen of the united states qualified in respect to age physical ability moral character industry and adaptability for manual labor except that in case of veteran of the civil war the element of age be omit this system of appointment be distinct from the classified service and do not classify position of mere laborer under the civil service act and rule regulation in aid thereof have be put in operation in several of the departments and be be gradually extend in other part of the service the result have be very satisfactory as extravagance have be check by decrease the number of unnecessary position and by increase the efficiency of the employee remain the congress as the result of a thorough investigation of the charity and reformatory institution in the district of columbia by a joint select committee of the two houses which make its report in march 1898 create in the act approve june 6 1900 a board of charity for the district of columbia to consist of five resident of the district appoint by the president of the united states by and with the advice and consent of the senate each for a term of three year to serve without compensation president mckinley appoint five man who have be active and prominent in the public charity in washington all of whom upon take office july 1 1900 resign from the different charity with which they have be connect the member of the board have be reappointe in successive year the board serve under the commissioners of the district of columbia the board give its first year to a careful and impartial study of the special problem before it and have continue that study every year in the light of the good practice in public charity elsewhere its recommendation in its annual report to the congress through the commissioners of the district of columbia for the economical and efficient administration of the charity and reformatory of the district of columbia as require by the act create it have be base upon the principle commend by the joint select committee of the congress in its report of march 1898 and approve by the good administrator of public charity and make for the desire systematization and improvement of the affair under its supervision they be worthy of favorable consideration by the congress the effect of the law provide a general staff for the army and for the more effective use of the national guard have be excellent great improvement have be make in the efficiency of our army in recent year such school as those erect at fort leavenworth and fort riley and the institution of fall maneuver work accomplish satisfactory result the good effect of these maneuver upon the national guard be mark and ample appropriation should be make to enable the guardsman of the several states to share in the benefit the government should as soon as possible secure suitable permanent camp site for military maneuver in the various section of the country the service thereby render not only to the regular army but to the national guard of the several states will be so great as to repay many time over the relatively small expense we should not rest satisfied with what have be do however the only people who be content with a system of promotion by mere seniority be those who be content with the triumph of mediocrity over excellence on the other hand a system which encourage the exercise of social or political favoritism in promotion would be even bad but it would surely be easy to devise a method of promotion from grade to grade in which the opinion of the high officer of the service upon the candidate should be decisive upon the standing and promotion of the latter just such a system now obtain at west point the quality of each year 's work determine the standing of that year 's class the man be drop or graduate into the next class in the relative position which his military superior decide to be warrant by his merit in other word ability energy fidelity and all other similar quality determine the rank of a man year after year in west point and his standing in the army when he graduate from west point but from that time on all effort to find which man be good or bad and reward or punish he accordingly be abandon no brilliancy no amount of hard work no eagerness in the performance of duty can advance he and no slackness or indifference that fall short of a court martial offense can retard he until this system be change we can not hope that our officer will be of as high grade as we have a right to expect consider the material upon which we draw moreover when a man render such service as captain pershing render last spring in the moro campaign it ought to be possible to reward he without at once jump he to the grade of brigadier general shortly after the enunciation of that famous principle of american foreign policy now know as the monroe doctrine president monroe in a special message to congress on january 30 1824 speak as follow the navy be the arm from which our government will always derive most aid in support of our right every power engage in war will know the strength of our naval power the number of our ship of each class their condition and the promptitude with which we may bring they into service and will pay due consideration to that argument "i heartily congratulate the congress upon the steady progress in build up the american navy we can not afford a let up in this great work to stand still mean to go back there should be no cessation in add to the effective unit of the fighting strength of the fleet meanwhile the navy department and the officer of the navy be do well their part by provide constant service at sea under condition akin to those of actual warfare our officer and enlisted man be learn to handle the battleship cruiser and torpedo boat with high efficiency in fleet and squadron formation and the standard of marksmanship be be steadily raise the good work ashore be indispensable but the high duty of a naval officer be to exercise command at sea the establishment of a naval base in the philippines ought not to be long postpone such a base be desirable in time of peace in time of war it would be indispensable and its lack would be ruinous without it our fleet would be helpless our naval expert be agree that subig bay be the proper place for the purpose the national interest require that the work of fortification and development of a naval station at subig bay be begin at an early date for under the good condition it be a work which will consume much time it be eminently desirable however that there should be provide a naval general staff on line similar to those of the general staff lately create for the army within the navy department itself the need of the service have bring about a system under which the duty of a general staff be partially perform for the bureau of navigation have under its direction the war college the office of naval intelligence and the board of inspection and have be in close touch with the general board of the navy but though under the excellent officer at their head these board and bureaus do good work they have not the authority of a general staff and have not sufficient scope to insure a proper readiness for emergency we need the establishment by law of a body of train officer who shall exercise a systematic control of the military affair of the navy and be authorize adviser of the secretary concern it by the act of june 28 1902 the congress authorize the president to enter into treaty with colombia for the building of the canal across the isthmus of panama it be provide that in the event of failure to secure such treaty after the lapse of a reasonable time recourse should be have to build a canal through nicaragua it have not be necessary to consider this alternative as i be enable to lay before the senate a treaty provide for the building of the canal across the isthmus of panama this be the route which commend itself to the deliberate judgment of the congress and we can now acquire by treaty the right to construct the canal over this route the question now therefore be not by which route the isthmian canal shall be build for that question have be definitely and irrevocably decide the question be simply whether or not we shall have an isthmian canal when the congress direct that we should take the panama route under treaty with colombia the essence of the condition of course refer not to the government which control that route but to the route itself to the territory across which the route lay not to the name which for the moment the territory bear on the map the purpose of the law be to authorize the president to make a treaty with the power in actual control of the isthmus of panama this purpose have be fulfil in the year 1846 this government enter into a treaty with new granada the predecessor upon the isthmus of the republic of colombia and of the present republic of panama by which treaty it be provide that the government and citizen of the united states should always have free and open right of way or transit across the isthmus of panama by any mode of communication that might be construct while in turn our government guarantee the perfect neutrality of the above mention isthmus with the view that the free transit from the one to the other sea might not be interrupt or embarrassed the treaty vest in the united states a substantial property right carve out of the right of sovereignty and property which new granada then have and possess over the said territory the name of new granada have pass away and its territory have be divide its successor the government of colombia have cease to own any property in the isthmus a new republic that of panama which be at one time a sovereign state and at another time a mere department of the successive confederation know as new granada and columbia have now succeed to the right which first one and then the other formerly exercise over the isthmus but as long as the isthmus endure the mere geographical fact of its existence and the peculiar interest therein which be require by our position perpetuate the solemn contract which bind the holder of the territory to respect our right to freedom of transit across it and bind we in return to safeguard for the isthmus and the world the exercise of that inestimable privilege the true interpretation of the obligation upon which the united states enter in this treaty of 1846 have be give repeatedly in the utterance of president and secretaries of state secretary cuss in 1858 officially state the position of this government as follows:"the progress of event have render the interoceanic route across the narrow portion of central america vastly important to the commercial world and especially to the united states whose possession extend along the atlantic and pacific coast and demand the speedy and easy mode of communication while the right of sovereignty of the state occupy this region should always be respect we shall expect that these right be exercise in a spirit befit the occasion and the want and circumstance that have arise sovereignty have its duty as well as its right and none of these local government even if administer with more regard to the just demand of other nation than they have be would be permit in a spirit of eastern isolation to close the gate of intercourse on the great highway of the world and justify the act by the pretension that these avenue of trade and travel belong to they and that they choose to shut they or what be almost equivalent to encumber they with such unjust relation as would prevent their general use "seven year later in 1865 mr. seward in different communication take the following position:"the united states have take and will take no interest in any question of internal revolution in the state of panama or any state of the united states of colombia but will maintain a perfect neutrality in connection with such domestic altercation the united states will nevertheless hold themselves ready to protect the transit trade across the isthmus against invasion of either domestic or foreign disturber of the peace of the state of panama neither the text nor the spirit of the stipulation in that article by which the united states engage to preserve the neutrality of the isthmus of panama impose an obligation on this government to comply with the requisition of the president of the united states of colombia for a force to protect the isthmus of panama from a body of insurgent of that country the purpose of the stipulation be to guarantee the isthmus against seizure or invasion by a foreign power only "attorney general speed under date of november 7 1865 advise secretary seward as follows:"from this treaty it can not be suppose that new granada invite the united states to become a party to the intestine trouble of that government nor do the united states become bound to take side in the domestic broil of new granada the united states do guarantee new granada in the sovereignty and property over the territory this be as against other and foreign government "for four hundred year ever since shortly after the discovery of this hemisphere the canal across the isthmus have be plan for two score year it have be work at when make it be to last for the age it be to alter the geography of a continent and the trade route of the world we have show by every treaty we have negotiate or attempt to negotiate with the people in control of the isthmus and with foreign nation in reference thereto our consistent good faith in observe our obligation on the one hand to the people of the isthmus and on the other hand to the civilized world whose commercial right we be safeguard and guarantee by our action we have do our duty to other in letter and in spirit and we have show the utmost forbearance in exact our own right last spring under the act above refer to a treaty conclude between the representative of the republic of colombia and of our government be ratify by the senate this treaty be enter into at the urgent solicitation of the people of colombia and after a body of expert appoint by our government especially to go into the matter of the route across the isthmus have pronounce unanimously in favor of the panama route in draw up this treaty every concession be make to the people and to the government of colombia we be more than just in deal with they our generosity be such as to make it a serious question whether we have not go too far in their interest at the expense of our own for in our scrupulous desire to pay all possible heed not merely to the real but even to the fancied right of our weak neighbor who already owe so much to our protection and forbearance we yield in all possible way to her desire in draw up the treaty nevertheless the government of colombia not merely repudiate the treaty but repudiate it in such manner as to make it evident by the time the colombian congress adjourn that not the scanty hope remain of ever get a satisfactory treaty from they the government of colombia make the treaty and yet when the colombian congress be call to ratify it the vote against ratification be unanimous it do not appear that the government make any real effort to secure ratification immediately after the adjournment of the congress a revolution break out in panama the people of panama have long be discontent with the republic of colombia and they have be keep quiet only by the prospect of the conclusion of the treaty which be to they a matter of vital concern when it become evident that the treaty be hopelessly lose the people of panama rise literally as one man not a shot be fire by a single man on the isthmus in the interest of the colombian government not a life be lose in the accomplishment of the revolution the colombian troop station on the isthmus who have long be unpaid make common cause with the people of panama and with astonishing unanimity the new republic be start the duty of the united states in the premise be clear in strict accordance with the principle lay down by secretaries cass and seward in the official document above quote the united states give notice that it would permit the landing of no expeditionary force the arrival of which would mean chaos and destruction along the line of the railroad and of the propose canal and an interruption of transit as an inevitable consequence the de facto government of panama be recognize in the follow telegram to mr. ehrman:"the people of panama have by apparently unanimous movement dissolve their political connection with the republic of colombia and resume their independence when you be satisfied that a de facto government republican in form and without substantial opposition from its own people have be establish in the state of panama you will enter into relation with it as the responsible government of the territory and look to it for all due action to protect the person and property of citizen of the united states and to keep open the isthmian transit in accordance with the obligation of exist treaty govern the relation of the united states to that territory "the government of colombia be notify of our action by the follow telegram to mr. beaupre:"the people of panama have by an apparently unanimous movement dissolve their political connection with the republic of colombia and resume their independence and having adopt a government of their own republican in form with which the government of the united states of america have enter into relation the president of the united states in accordance with the tie of friendship which have so long and so happily exist between the respective nation most earnestly commend to the government of colombia and of panama the peaceful and equitable settlement of all question at issue between they he hold that he be bind not merely by treaty obligation but by the interest of civilization to see that the peaceful traffic of the world across the isthmus of panama shall not long be disturb by a constant succession of unnecessary and wasteful civil war "when these event happen fifty seven year have elapse since the united states have enter into its treaty with new granada during that time the government of new granada and of its successor colombia have be in a constant state of flux the following be a partial list of the disturbance on the isthmus of panama during the period in question as report to we by our consul it be not possible to give a complete list and some of the report that speak of revolution must mean unsuccessful revolution may 22 1850.--outbreak two americans kill war vessel demand to quell outbreak october 1850.--revolutionary plot to bring about independence of the isthmus july 22

above be only a partial list of the revolution rebellion insurrection riot and other outbreak that have occur during the period in question yet they number 53 for the 57 year it will be note that one of they last for nearly three year before it be quell another for nearly a year in short the experience of over half a century have show colombia to be utterly incapable of keep order on the isthmus only the active interference of the united states have enable she to preserve so much as a semblance of sovereignty have it not be for the exercise by the united states of the police power in her interest her connection with the isthmus would have be sunder long ago in 1856 in 1860 in 1873 in 1885 in 1901 and again in 1902 sailor and marine from united states war ship be force to land in order to patrol the isthmus to protect life and property and to see that the transit across the isthmus be keep open in 1861 in 1862 in 1885 and in 1900 the colombian government ask that the united states government would land troop to protect its interest and maintain order on the isthmus perhaps the most extraordinary request be that which have just be receive and which run as follows:"knowing that revolution have already commence in panama an eminent colombian say that if the government of the united states will land troop to preserve colombian sovereignty and the transit if request by colombian charge d'affaires this government will declare martial law and by virtue of vested constitutional authority when public order be disturb will approve by decree ratification of the canal treaty as sign or if the government of the united states prefer will call extra session of the congress with new and friendly member next may to approve the treaty an eminent colombian have the perfect confidence of vice president he say and if it become necessary will go to the isthmus or send representative there to adjust matter along above line to the satisfaction of the people there "this dispatch be noteworthy from two standpoint its offer of immediately guarantee the treaty to we be in sharp contrast with the positive and contemptuous refusal of the congress which have just close its session to consider favorably such a treaty it show that the government which make the treaty really have absolute control over the situation but do not choose to exercise this control the dispatch far call on we to restore order and secure colombian supremacy in the isthmus from which the colombian government have just by its action decide to bar we by prevent the construction of the canal the control in the interest of the commerce and traffic of the whole civilized world of the mean of undisturbed transit across the isthmus of panama have become of transcendent importance to the united states we have repeatedly exercise this control by intervene in the course of domestic dissension and by protect the territory from foreign invasion in 1853 mr. everett assure the peruvian minister that we should not hesitate to maintain the neutrality of the isthmus in the case of war between peru and colombia in 1864 colombia which have always be vigilant to avail itself of its privilege confer by the treaty express its expectation that in the event of war between peru and spain the united states would carry into effect the guaranty of neutrality there have be few administration of the state department in which this treaty have not either by the one side or the other be use as a basis of more or less important demand it be say by mr. fish in 1871 that the department of state have reason to believe that an attack upon colombian sovereignty on the isthmus have on several occasion be avert by warn from this government in 1886 when colombia be under the menace of hostility from italy in the cerruti case mr. bayard express the serious concern that the united states could not but feel that a european power should resort to force against a sister republic of this hemisphere as to the sovereign and uninterrupted use of a part of whose territory we be guarantor under the solemn faith of a treaty the above recital of fact establishe beyond question first that the united states have for over half a century patiently and in good faith carry out its obligation under the treaty of 1846 second that when for the first time it become possible for colombia to do anything in requital of the service thus repeatedly render to it for fifty seven year by the united states the colombian government peremptorily and offensively refuse thus to do its part even though to do so would have be to its advantage and immeasurably to the advantage of the state of panama at that time under its jurisdiction third that throughout this period revolution riot and factional disturbance of every kind have occur one after the other in almost uninterrupted succession some of they last for month and even for year while the central government be unable to put they down or to make peace with the rebel fourth that these disturbance instead of show any sign of abate have tend to grow more numerous and more serious in the immediate past fifth that the control of colombia over the isthmus of panama could not be maintain without the armed intervention and assistance of the united states in other word the government of colombia though wholly unable to maintain order on the isthmus have nevertheless decline to ratify a treaty the conclusion of which open the only chance to secure its own stability and to guarantee permanent peace on and the construction of a canal across the isthmus under such circumstance the government of the united states would have be guilty of folly and weakness amount in their sum to a crime against the nation have it act otherwise than it do when the revolution of november 3 last take place in panama this great enterprise of build the interoceanic canal can not be hold up to gratify the whim or out of respect to the governmental impotence or to the even more sinister and evil political peculiarity of people who though they dwell afar off yet against the wish of the actual dweller on the isthmus assert an unreal supremacy over the territory the possession of a territory fraught with such peculiar capacity as the isthmus in question carry with it obligation to mankind the course of event have show that this canal can not be build by private enterprise or by any other nation than our own therefore it must be build by the united states every effort have be make by the government of the united states to persuade colombia to follow a course which be essentially not only to our interest and to the interest of the world but to the interest of colombia itself these effort have fail and colombia by her persistence in repulse the advance that have be make have force we for the sake of our own honor and of the interest and well being not merely of our own people but of the people of the isthmus of panama and the people of the civilized country of the world to take decisive step to bring to an end a condition of affair which have become intolerable the new republic of panama immediately offer to negotiate a treaty with we this treaty i herewith submit by it our interest be well safeguard than in the treaty with colombia which be ratify by the senate at its last session it be well in its term than the treaty offer to we by the republics of nicaragua and costa rica at last the right to begin this great undertaking be make available panama have do her part all that remain be for the american congress to do its part and forthwith this republic will enter upon the execution of a project colossal in its size and of well nigh incalculable possibility for the good of this country and the nation of mankind by the provision of the treaty the united states guarantee and will maintain the independence of the republic of panama there be grant to the united states in perpetuity the use occupation and control of a strip ten mile wide and extend three nautical mile into the sea at either terminal with all land lie outside of the zone necessary for the construction of the canal or for its auxiliary work and with the island in the bay of panama the city of panama and colon be not embrace in the canal zone but the united states assume their sanitation and in case of need the maintenance of order therein the united states enjoy within the grant limit all the right power and authority which it would possess be it the sovereign of the territory to the exclusion of the exercise of sovereign right by the republic all railway and canal property right belong to panama and need for the canal pass to the united states include any property of the respective company in the city of panama and colon the work property and personnel of the canal and railway be exempt from taxation as well in the city of panama and colon as in the canal zone and its dependency free immigration of the personnel and importation of supply for the construction and operation of the canal be grant provision be make for the use of military force and the building of fortification by the united states for the protection of the transit in other detail particularly as to the acquisition of the interest of the new panama canal company and the panama railway by the united states and the condemnation of private property for the use of the canal the stipulation of the hay herran treaty be closely follow while the compensation to be give for these enlarge grant remain the same be ten million of dollar payable on exchange of ratification and begin nine year from that date an annual payment of $ 250,000 during the life of the convention

 theodore roosevelt
 by the president
 john hay
 secretary of state
to the senate and house of representatives the nation continue to enjoy noteworthy prosperity such prosperity be of course primarily due to the high individual average of our citizenship take together with our great natural resource but an important factor therein be the working of our long continue governmental policy the people have emphatically express their approval of the principle underlie these policy and their desire that these principle be keep substantially unchanged although of course apply in a progressive spirit to meet change condition the enlargement of scope of the function of the national government require by our development as a nation involve of course increase of expense and the period of prosperity through which the country be pass justifie expenditure for permanent improvement far great than would be wise in hard time battle ship and fort public building and improve waterway be investment which should be make when we have the money but abundant revenue and a large surplus always invite extravagance and constant care should be take to guard against unnecessary increase of the ordinary expense of government the cost of do government business should be regulate with the same rigid scrutiny as the cost of do a private business in the vast and complicated mechanism of our modern civilized life the dominant note be the note of industralism and the relation of capital and labor and especially of organized capital and organized labor to each other and to the public at large come second in importance only to the intimate question of family life our peculiar form of government with its sharp division of authority between the nation and the several states have be on the whole far more advantageous to our development than a more strongly centralized government but it be undoubtedly responsible for much of the difficulty of meeting with adequate legislation the new problem present by the total change in industrial condition on this continent during the last half century in actual practice it have prove exceedingly difficult and in many case impossible to get unanimity of wise action among the various states on these subject from the very nature of the case this be especially true of the law affect the employment of capital in huge masse with regard to labor the problem be no less important but it be simple as long as the states retain the primary control of the police power the circumstance must be altogether extreme which require interference by the federal authority whether in the way of safeguard the right of labor or in the way of see that wrong be not do by unruly person who shield themselves behind the name of labor if there be resistance to the federal court interference with the mail or interstate commerce or molestation of federal property or if the state authority in some crisis which they be unable to face call for help then the federal government may interfere but though such interference may be cause by a condition of thing arise out of trouble connect with some question of labor the interference itself simply take the form of restore order without regard to the question which have cause the breach of order for to keep order be a primary duty and in a time of disorder and violence all other question sink into abeyance until order have be restore in the district of columbia and in the territories the federal law cover the entire field of government but the labor question be only acute in populous center of commerce manufacture or mining nevertheless both in the enactment and in the enforcement of law the federal government within its restricted sphere should set an example to the state government especially in a matter so vital as this affect labor i believe that under modern industrial condition it be often necessary and even where not necessary it be yet often wise that there should be organization of labor in order well to secure the right of the individual wage worker all encouragement should be give to any such organization so long as it be conduct with a due and decent regard for the right of other there be in this country some labor union which have habitually and other labor union which have often be among the most effective agent in work for good citizenship and for uplift the condition of those whose welfare should be close to our heart but when any labor union seek improper end or seek to achieve proper end by improper mean all good citizen and more especially all honorable public servant must oppose the wrongdoing as resolutely as they would oppose the wrongdoing of any great corporation of course any violence brutality or corruption should not for one moment be tolerate wage worker have an entire right to organize and by all peaceful and honorable mean to endeavor to persuade their fellow to join with they in organization they have a legal right which accord to circumstance may or may not be a moral right to refuse to work in company with man who decline to join their organization they have under no circumstance the right to commit violence upon these whether capitalist or wage worker who refuse to support their organization or who side with those with whom they be at odd for mob rule be intolerable in any form the wage worker be peculiarly entitle to the protection and the encouragement of the law from the very nature of their occupation railroad man for instance be liable to be maim in do the legitimate work of their profession unless the railroad company be require by law to make ample provision for their safety the administration have be zealous in enforce the exist law for this purpose that law should be amend and strengthen wherever the national government have power there should be a stringent employer 's liability law which should apply to the government itself where the government be an employer of labor in my message to the fifty seventh congress at its second session i urge the passage of an employer 's liability law for the district of columbia i now renew that recommendation and far recommend that the congress appoint a commission to make a comprehensive study of employer 's liability with the view of extend the provision of a great and constitutional law to all employment within the scope of federal power the government have recognize heroism upon the water and bestow medal of honor upon those person who by extreme and heroic daring have endanger their life in saving or endeavor to save live from the peril of the sea in the water over which the united states have jurisdiction or upon an american vessel this recognition should be extend to cover case of conspicuous bravery and self sacrifice in the saving of life in private employment under the jurisdiction of the united states and particularly in the land commerce of the nation the ever increase casualty list upon our railroad be a matter of grave public concern and urgently call for action by the congress in the matter of speed and comfort of railway travel our railroad give at least as good service as those of any other nation and there be no reason why this service should not also be as safe as human ingenuity can make it many of our lead road have be foremost in the adoption of the most approve safeguard for the protection of traveler and employee yet the list of clearly avoidable accident continue unduly large the passage of a law require the adoption of a block signal system have be propose to the congress i earnestly concur in that recommendation and would also point out to the congress the urgent need of legislation in the interest of the public safety limit the hour of labor for railroad employee in train service upon railroad engage in interstate commerce and provide that only trained and experienced person be employ in position of responsibility connect with the operation of train of course nothing can ever prevent accident cause by human weakness or misconduct and there should be drastic punishment for any railroad employee whether officer or man who by issuance of wrong order or by disobedience of order cause disaster the law of 1901 require interstate railroad to make monthly report of all accident to passenger and employee on duty should also be amend so as to empower the government to make a personal investigation through proper officer of all accident involve loss of life which seem to require investigation with a requirement that the result of such investigation be make public the safety appliance law as amend by the act of march 2 1903 have prove beneficial to railway employee and in order that its provision may be properly carry out the force of inspector provide for by appropriation should be largely increase this service be analogous to the steamboat inspection service and deal with even more important interest it have pass the experimental stage and demonstrate its utility and should receive generous recognition by the congress there be no objection to employee of the government form or belong to union but the government can neither discriminate for nor discriminate against nonunion man who be in its employment or who seek to be employ under it moreover it be a very grave impropriety for government employee to band themselves together for the purpose of extort improperly high salary from the government especially be this true of those within the classified service the letter carrier both municipal and rural be as a whole an excellent body of public servant they should be amply pay but their payment must be obtain by argue their claim fairly and honorably before the congress and not by band together for the defeat of those congressman who refuse to give promise which they can not in conscience give the administration have already take step to prevent and punish abuse of this nature but it will be wise for the congress to supplement this action by legislation much can be do by the government in labor matter merely by give publicity to certain condition the bureau of labor have do excellent work of this kind in many different direction i shall shortly lay before you in a special message the full report of the investigation of the bureau of labor into the colorado mining strike as this be a strike in which certain very evil force which be more or less at work everywhere under the condition of modern industrialism become startlingly prominent it be greatly to be wish that the department of commerce and labor through the labor bureau should compile and arrange for the congress a list of the labor law of the various states and should be give the mean to investigate and report to the congress upon the labor condition in the manufacturing and mining region throughout the country both as to wage as to hour of labor as to the labor of woman and child and as to the effect in the various labor center of immigration from abroad in this investigation especial attention should be pay to the condition of child labor and child labor legislation in the several states such an investigation must necessarily take into account many of the problem with which this question of child labor be connect these problem can be actually meet in most case only by the states themselves but the lack of proper legislation in one state in such a matter as child labor often render it excessively difficult to establish protective restriction upon the work in another state have the same industry so that the bad tend to drag down the well for this reason it would be well for the nation at least to endeavor to secure comprehensive information as to the condition of labor of child in the different state such investigation and publication by the national government would tend toward the securing of approximately uniform legislation of the proper character among the several states when we come to deal with great corporation the need for the government to act directly be far great than in the case of labor because great corporation can become such only by engage in interstate commerce and interstate commerce be peculiarly the field of the general government it be an absurdity to expect to eliminate the abuse in great corporation by state action it be difficult to be patient with an argument that such matter should be leave to the states because more than one state pursue the policy of create on easy term corporation which be never operate within that state at all but in other states whose law they ignore the national government alone can deal adequately with these great corporation to try to deal with they in an intemperate destructive or demagogic spirit would in all probability mean that nothing whatever would be accomplish and with absolute certainty that if anything be accomplish it would be of a harmful nature the american people need to continue to show the very quality that they have show that is moderation good sense the earnest desire to avoid do any damage and yet the quiet determination to proceed step by step without halt and without hurry in eliminate or at least in minimize whatever of mischief or evil there be to interstate commerce in the conduct of great corporation they be act in no spirit of hostility to wealth either individual or corporate they be not against the rich man any more than against the poor man on the contrary they be friendly alike toward rich man and toward poor man provide only that each act in a spirit of justice and decency toward his fellow great corporation be necessary and only man of great and singular mental power can manage such corporation successfully and such man must have great reward but these corporation should be manage with due regard to the interest of the public as a whole where this can be do under the present law it must be do where these law come short other should be enact to supplement they yet we must never forget the determine factor in every kind of work of head or hand must be the man 's own good sense courage and kindliness more important than any legislation be the gradual growth of a feeling of responsibility and forbearance among capitalist and wage worker alike a feeling of respect on the part of each man for the right of other a feeling of broad community of interest not merely of capitalist among themselves and of wage worker among themselves but of capitalist and wage worker in their relation to each other and of both in their relation to their fellow who with they make up the body politic there be many captain of industry many labor leader who realize this a recent speech by the president of one of our great railroad system to the employee of that system contain sound common sense it rim in part as follows:"it be my belief we can well serve each other well understand the man as well as his business when meeting face to face exchange view and realize from personal contact we serve but one interest that of our mutual prosperity "serious misunderstanding can not occur where personal good will exist and opportunity for personal explanation be present "in my early business life i have experience with man of affair of a character to make i desire to avoid create a like feeling of resentment to myself and the interest in my charge should fortune ever place i in authority and i be solicitous of a measure of confidence on the part of the public and our employee that i shall hope may be warrant by the fairness and good fellowship i intend shall prevail in our relationship "but do not feel i be disposed to grant unreasonable request spend the money of our company unnecessarily or without value receive nor expect the day of mistake be disappear or that cause for complaint will not continually occur simply to correct such abuse as may be discover to well condition as fast as reasonably may be expect constantly strive with vary success for that improvement we all desire to convince you there be a force at work in the right direction all the time make progress be the disposition with which i have come among you ask your good will and encouragement "the day have go by when a corporation can be handle successfully in defiance of the public will even though that will be unreasonable and wrong a public may be lead but not drive and i prefer to go with it and shape or modify in a measure its opinion rather than be sweep from my bearing with loss to myself and the interest in my charge "violent prejudice exist towards corporate activity and capital today much of it found in reason more in apprehension and a large measure be due to the personal trait of arbitrary unreasonable incompetent and offensive man in position of authority the accomplishment of result by indirection the endeavor to thwart the intention if not the express letter of the law the will of the people a disregard of the right of other a disposition to withhold what be due to force by main strength or inactivity a result not justify depend upon the weakness of the claimant and his indisposition to become involved in litigation have create a sentiment harmful in the extreme and a disposition to consider anything fair that give gain to the individual at the expense of the company "if corporation be to continue to do the world 's work as they be well fit to these quality in their representative that have result in the present prejudice against they must be relegate to the background the corporation must come out into the open and see and be see they must take the public into their confidence and ask for what they want and no more and be prepared to explain satisfactorily what advantage will accrue to the public if they be give their desire for they be permit to exist not that they may make money solely but that they may effectively serve those from whom they derive their power "publicity and not secrecy will win hereafter and law be construe by their intent and not by their letter otherwise public utility will be own and operate by the public which create they even though the service be less efficient and the result less satisfactory from a financial standpoint "the bureau of corporations have make careful preliminary investigation of many important corporation it will make a special report on the beef industry the policy of the bureau be to accomplish the purpose of its creation by co operation not antagonism by make constructive legislation not destructive prosecution the immediate object of its inquiry by conservative investigation of law and fact and by refusal to issue incomplete and hence necessarily inaccurate report its policy be thus one of open inquiry into and not attack upon business the bureau have be able to gain not only the confidence but well still the cooperation of man engage in legitimate business the bureau offer to the congress the mean of get at the cost of production of our various great staple of commerce of necessity the careful investigation of special corporation will afford the commissioner knowledge of certain business fact the publication of which might be an improper infringement of private right the method of make public the result of these investigation afford under the law a means for the protection of private right the congress will have all fact except such as would give to another corporation information which would injure the legitimate business of a competitor and destroy the incentive for individual superiority and thrift the bureau have also make exhaustive examination into the legal condition under which corporate business be carry on in the various states into all judicial decision on the subject and into the various system of corporate taxation in use i call special attention to the report of the chief of the bureau and i earnestly ask that the congress carefully consider the report and recommendation of the commissioner on this subject the business of insurance vitally affect the great mass of the people of the united states and be national and not local in its application it involve a multitude of transaction among the people of the different states and between american company and foreign government i urge that the congress carefully consider whether the power of the bureau of corporations can not constitutionally be extend to cover interstate transaction in insurance above all else we must strive to keep the highway of commerce open to all on equal term and to do this it be necessary to put a complete stop to all rebate whether the shipper or the railroad be to blame make no difference the rebate must be stop the abuse of the private car and private terminal track and side track system must be stop and the legislation of the fifty eighth congress which declare it to be unlawful for any person or corporation to offer gram give solicit accept or receive any rebate concession or discrimination in respect of the transportation of any property in interstate or foreign commerce whereby such property shall by any device whatever be transport at a less rate than that name in the tariff publish by the carrier must be enforce for some time after the enactment of the act to regulate commerce it remain a mooted question whether that act confer upon the interstate commerce commission the power after it have find a challenge rate to be unreasonable to declare what thereafter should prima facie be the reasonable maximum rate for the transportation in dispute the supreme court finally resolve that question in the negative so that as the law now stand the commission simply possess the bare power to denounce a particular rate as unreasonable while i be of the opinion that at present it would be undesirable if it be not impracticable finally to clothe the commission with general authority to fix railroad rate i do believe that as a fair security to shipper the commission should be vest with the power where a give rate have be challenge and after full hearing find to be unreasonable to decide subject to judicial review what shall be a reasonable rate to take its place the ruling of the commission to take effect immediately and to obtain unless and until it be reverse by the court of review the government must in increase degree supervise and regulate the working of the railway engage in interstate commerce and such increase supervision be the only alternative to an increase of the present evil on the one hand or a still more radical policy on the other in my judgment the most important legislative act now need as regard the regulation of corporation be this act to confer on the interstate commerce commission the power to revise rate and regulation the revise rate to at once go into effect and stay in effect unless and until the court of review reverse it steamship company engage in interstate commerce and protect in our coastwise trade should be hold to a strict observance of the interstate commerce act in pursue the set plan to make the city of washington an example to other american municipality several point should be keep in mind by the legislator in the first place the people of this country should clearly understand that no amount of industrial prosperity and above all no leadership in international industrial competition can in any way atone for the sapping of the vitality of those who be usually speak of as the working class the farmer the mechanic the skilled and unskilled laborer the small shop keeper make up the bulk of the population of any country and upon their well being generation after generation the well being of the country and the race depend rapid development in wealth and industrial leadership be a good thing but only if it go hand in hand with improvement and not deterioration physical and moral the over crowding of city and the draining of country district be unhealthy and even dangerous symptom in our modern life we should not permit overcrowding in city in certain european city it be provide by law that the population of town shall not be allow to exceed a very limited density for a give area so that the increase in density must be continually push back into a broad zone around the center of the town this zone have great avenue or park within it the death rate statistic show a terrible increase in mortality and especially in infant mortality in overcrowded tenement the poor family in tenement house live in one room and it appear that in these one room tenement the average death rate for a number of give city at home and abroad be about twice what it be in a two room tenement four time what it be in a three room tenement and eight time what it be in a tenement consisting of four room or over these figure vary somewhat for different city but they approximate in each city those give above and in all case the increase of mortality and especially of infant mortality with the decrease in the number of room use by the family and with the consequent overcrowding be startling the slum exact a heavy total of death from those who dwell therein and this be the case not merely in the great crowded slum of high building in new york and chicago but in the alley slum of washington in washington people can not afford to ignore the harm that this cause no christian and civilized community can afford to show a happy go lucky lack of concern for the youth of to day for if so the community will have to pay a terrible penalty of financial burden and social degradation in the to morrow there should be severe child labor and factory inspection law it be very desirable that married woman should not work in factory the prime duty of the man be to work to be the breadwinner the prime duty of the woman be to be the mother the housewife all question of tariff and finance sink into utter insignificance when compare with the tremendous the vital importance of try to shape condition so that these two duty of the man and of the woman can be fulfil under reasonably favorable circumstance if a race do not have plenty of child or if the child do not grow up or if when they grow up they be unhealthy in body and stunt or vicious in mind then that race be decadent and no heaping up of wealth no splendor of momentary material prosperity can avail in any degree as offset the congress have the same power of legislation for the district of columbia which the state legislature have for the various states the problem incident to our highly complex modern industrial civilization with its manifold and perplexing tendency both for good and for evil be far less sharply eccentuate in the city of washington than in most other city for this very reason it be easy to deal with the various phase of these problem in washington and the district of columbia government should be a model for the other municipal government of the nation in all such matter as supervision of the housing of the poor the creation of small park in the district inhabit by the poor in law affect labor in law provide for the taking care of the child in truant law and in provide school in the vital matter of take care of child much advantage could be gain by a careful study of what have be accomplish in such state as illinois and colorado by the juvenile court the work of the juvenile court be really a work of character building it be now generally recognize that young boy and young girl who go wrong should not be treat as criminal not even necessarily as need reformation but rather as need to have their character form and for this end to have they test and develop by a system of probation much admirable work have be do in many of our commonwealth by earnest man and woman who have make a special study of the need of those class of child which furnish the great number of juvenile offender and therefore the great number of adult offender and by their aid and by profit by the experience of the different state and city in these matter it would be easy to provide a good code for the district of columbia several consideration suggest the need for a systematic investigation into and improvement of housing condition in washington the hidden residential alley be breed ground of vice and disease and should be open into minor street for a number of year influential citizen have join with the district commissioners in the vain endeavor to secure law permit the condemnation of insanitary dwelling the local death rate especially from preventable disease be so unduly high as to suggest that the exceptional wholesomeness of washington 's well section be offset by bad condition in her poor neighborhood a special commission on housing and health conditions in the national capital would not only bring about the reformation of exist evil but would also formulate an appropriate building code to protect the city from mammoth brick tenement and other evil which threaten to develop here as they have in other city that the nation 's capital should be make a model for other municipality be an ideal which appeal to all patriotic citizen everywhere and such a special commission might map out and organize the city 's future development in line of civic social service just as major l'enfant and the recent park commission plan the arrangement of her street and park it be mortify to remember that washington have no compulsory school attendance law and that careful inquiry indicate the habitual absence from school of some twenty per cent of all child between the age of eight and fourteen it must be evident to all who consider the problem of neglect child life or the benefit of compulsory education in other city that one of the most urgent need of the national capital be a law require the school attendance of all child this law to be enforce by attendance agent direct by the board of education public play ground be necessary mean for the development of wholesome citizenship in modern city it be important that the work inaugurate here through voluntary effort should be take up and extend through congressional appropriation of fund sufficient to equip and maintain numerous convenient small play ground upon land which can be secure without purchase or rental it be also desirable that small vacant place be purchase and reserve as small park play ground in densely settle section of the city which now have no public open space and be destine soon to be build up solidly all these need should be meet immediately to meet they would entail expense but a corresponding saving could be make by stop the building of street and levelling of ground for purpose largely speculative in outlying part of the city there be certain offender whose criminality take the shape of brutality and cruelty towards the weak who need a special type of punishment the wife beater for example be inadequately punish by imprisonment for imprisonment may often mean nothing to he while it may cause hunger and want to the wife and child who have be the victim of his brutality probably some form of corporal punishment would be the most adequate way of meet this kind of crime the department of agriculture have grow into an educational institution with a faculty of two thousand specialist make research into all the science of production the congress appropriate directly and indirectly six million of dollar annually to carry on this work it reach every state and territory in the union and the island of the sea lately come under our flag co operation be have with the state experiment station and with many other institution and individual the world be carefully search for new variety of grain fruit grass vegetable tree and shrub suitable to various locality in our country and mark benefit to our producer have result the activity of our age in line of research have reach the tiller of the soil and inspire they with ambition to know more of the principle that

elapse since the passage of the reclamation act rapid progress have be make in the survey and examination of the opportunity for reclamation in the thirteen states and three territories of the arid west construction have already be begin on the large and most important of the irrigation work and plan be be complete for work which will utilize the fund now available the operation be be carry on by the reclamation service a corps of engineer select through competitive civil service examination this corps include experienced consulting and construct engineer as well as various expert in mechanical and legal matter and be compose largely of man who have spend most of their life in practical affair connect with irrigation the large problem have be solve and it now remain to execute with care economy and thoroughness the work which have be lay out all important detail be be carefully consider by board of consult engineer select for their thorough knowledge and practical experience each project be take up on the ground by competent man and view from the standpoint of the creation of prosperous home and of promptly refund to the treasury the cost of construction the reclamation act have be find to be remarkably complete and effective and so broad in its provision that a wide range of undertaking have be possible under it at the same time economy be guarantee by the fact that the fund must ultimately be return to be use over again it be the cardinal principle of the forest reserve policy of this administration that the reserve be for use whatever interfere with the use of their resource be to be avoid by every possible mean but these resource must be use in such a way as to make they permanent the forest policy of the government be just now a subject of vivid public interest throughout the west and to the people of the united states in general the forest reserve themselves be of extreme value to the present as well as to the future welfare of all the western public land states they powerfully affect the use and disposal of the public land they be of special importance because they preserve the water supply and the supply of timber for domestic purpose and so promote settlement under the reclamation act indeed they be essential to the welfare of every one of the great interest of the west forest reserve be create for two principal purpose the first be to preserve the water supply this be their most important use the principal user of the water thus preserve be irrigation rancher and settler city and town to whom their municipal water supply be of the very first importance user and furnisher of water power and the user of water for domestic manufacturing mining and other purpose all these be directly dependent upon the forest reserve the second reason for which forest reserve be create be to preserve the timber supply for various class of wood user among the more important of these be settler under the reclamation act and other act for whom a cheap and accessible supply of timber for domestic use be absolutely necessary miner and prospector who be in serious danger of lose their timber supply by fire or through export by lumber company when timber land adjacent to their mine pass into private ownership lumberman transportation company builder and commercial interest in general although the wisdom of create forest reserve be nearly everywhere heartily recognize yet in a few locality there have be misunderstand and complaint the follow statement be therefore desirable the forest reserve policy can be successful only when it have the full support of the people of the west it can not safely and should not in any case be impose upon they against their will but neither can we accept the view of those whose only interest in the forest be temporary who be anxious to reap what they have not sow and then move away leave desolation behind they on the contrary it be everywhere and always the interest of the permanent settler and the permanent business man the man with a stake in the country which must be consider and which must decide the making of forest reserve within railroad and wagon road land grant limit will hereafter as for the past three year be so manage as to prevent the issue under the act of june 4 1897 of base for exchange or lieu selection usually call scrip in all case where forest reserve within area cover by land grant appear to be essential to the prosperity of settler miner or other the government land within such propose forest reserve will as in the recent past be withdraw from sale or entry pende the completion of such negotiation with the owner of the land grant as will prevent the creation of so call scrip it be formerly the custom to make forest reserve without first get definite and detailed information as to the character of land and timber within their boundary this method of action often result in badly choose boundary and consequent injustice to settler and other therefore this administration adopt the present method of first withdraw the land from disposal follow by careful examination on the ground and the preparation of detailed map and description before any forest reserve be create i have repeatedly call attention to the confusion which exist in government forest matter because the work be scatter among three independent organization the united states be the only one of the great nation in which the forest work of the government be not concentrated under one department in consonance with the plainest dictate of good administration and common sense the present arrangement be bad from every point of view merely to mention it be to prove that it should be terminate at once as i have repeatedly recommend all the forest work of the government should be concentrate in the department of agriculture where the large part of that work be already do where practically all of the train forester of the government be employ where chiefly in washington there be comprehensive first class knowledge of the problem of the reserve acquire on the ground where all problem relate to growth from the soil be already gather and where all the science auxiliary to forestry be at hand for prompt and effective co operation these reason be decisive in themselves but it should be add that the great organization of citizen whose interest be affect by the forest reserve such as the national live stock association the national wool growers association the american mining congress the national irrigation congress and the national board of trade have uniformly emphatically and most of they repeatedly express themselves in favor of place all government forest work in the department of agriculture because of the peculiar adaptation of that department for it it be true also that the forest service of nearly all the great nation of the world be under the respective department of agriculture while in but two of the small nation and in one colony be they under the department of the interior this be the result of long and varied experience and it agree fully with the requirement of good administration in our own case the creation of a forest service in the department of agriculture will have for its important result first a well handling of all forest work because it will be under a single head and because the vast and indispensable experience of the department in all matter pertain to the forest reserve to forestry in general and to other form of production from the soil will be easily and rapidly accessible second the reserve themselves be handle from the point of view of the man in the field instead of the man in the office will be more easily and more widely useful to the people of the west than have be the case hitherto third within a comparatively short time the reserve will become self support this be important because continually and rapidly increase appropriation will be necessary for the proper care of this exceedingly important interest of the nation and they can and should he offset by return from the national forest under similar circumstance the forest possession of other great nation form an important source of revenue to their government every administrative officer concern be convince of the necessity for the propose consolidation of forest work in the department of agriculture and i myself have urge it more than once in former message again i commend it to the early and favorable consideration of the congress the interest of the nation at large and of the west in particular have suffer greatly because of the delay i call the attention of the congress again to the report and recommendation of the commission on the public lands forward by i to the second session of the present congress the commission have prosecute its investigation actively during the past season and a second report be now in an advanced stage of preparation in connection with the work of the forest reserve i desire again to urge upon the congress the importance of authorize the president to set aside certain portion of these reserve or other public land as game refuge for the preservation of the bison the wapiti and other large beast once so abundant in our wood and mountain and on our great plain and now tend toward extinction every support should be give to the authority of the yellowstone park in their successful effort at preserve the large creature therein and at very little expense portion of the public domain in other region which be wholly unsuited to agricultural settlement could be similarly utilize we owe it to future generation to keep alive the noble and beautiful creature which by their presence add such distinctive character to the american wilderness the limit of the yellowstone park should be extend southward the canyon of the colorado should be make a national park and the national park system should include the yosemite and as many as possible of the grove of giant tree in california the veteran of the civil war have a claim upon the nation such as no other body of our citizen possess the pension bureau have never in its history be manage in a more satisfactory manner than be now the case the progress of the indians toward civilization though not rapid be perhaps all that could be hope for in view of the circumstance within the past year many tribe have show in a degree great than ever before an appreciation of the necessity of work this change attitude be in part due to the policy recently pursue of reduce the amount of subsistence to the indians and thus force they through sheer necessity to work for a livelihood the policy though severe be a useful one but it be to be exercise only with judgment and with a full understanding of the condition which exist in each community for which it be intend on or near the indian reservation there be usually very little demand for labor and if the indians be to earn their living and when work can not be furnish from outside which be always preferable then it must be furnish by the government practical instruction of this kind would in a few year result in the forming of habit of regular industry which would render the indian a producer and would effect a great reduction in the cost of his maintenance it be commonly declare that the slow advance of the indians be due to the unsatisfactory character of the man appoint to take immediate charge of they and to some extent this be true while the standard of the employee in the indian service show great improvement over that of bygone year and while actual corruption or flagrant dishonesty be now the rare exception it be nevertheless the fact that the salary pay indian agent be not large enough to attract the good man to that field of work to achieve satisfactory result the official in charge of an indian tribe should possess the high qualification which be require in the manager of a large business but only in exceptional case be it possible to secure man of such a type for these position much well service however might be obtain from those now hold the place be it practicable to get out of they the good that be in they and this should be do by bring they constantly into close touch with their superior officer an agent who have be content to draw his salary give in return the least possible equivalent in effort and service may by proper treatment by suggestion and encouragement or persistent urging be stimulate to great effort and induce to take a more active personal interest in his work under existing condition an indian agent in the distant west may be wholly out of touch with the office of the indian bureau he may very well feel that no one take a personal interest in he or his effort certain routine duty in the way of report and account be require of he but there be no one with whom he may intelligently consult on matter vital to his work except after long delay such a man would be greatly encourage and aid by personal contact with some one whose interest in indian affair and whose authority in the indian bureau be great than his own and such contact would be certain to arouse and constantly increase the interest he take in his work the distance which separate the agent the worker in the field from the indian office in washington be a chief obstacle to indian progress whatever shall more closely unite these two branch of the indian service and shall enable they to co operate more heartily and more effectively will be for the increase efficiency of the work and the betterment of the race for whose improvement the indian bureau be establish the appointment of a field assistant to the commissioner of indian affairs would be certain to insure this good end such an official if possess of the requisite energy and deep interest in the work would be a most efficient factor in bring into close relationship and a more direct union of effort the bureau in washington and its agent in the field and with the co operation of its branch thus secure the indian bureau would in measure full than ever before lift up the savage toward that self help and self reliance which constitute the man in 1907 there will be hold at hampton roads the tricentennial celebration of the settlement at jamestown virginia with which the history of what have now become the united states really begin i commend this to your favorable consideration it be an event of prime historic significance in which all the people of the united states should feel and should show great and general interest in the post office department the service have increase in efficiency and condition as to revenue and expenditure continue satisfactory the increase of revenue during the year be $ 9,358,181.10 or 6.9 per cent the total receipt amount to $ 143,382,624.34 the expenditure be $ 152,362,116.70 an increase of about 9 per cent over the previous year be thus $ 8,979,492.36 in excess of the current revenue include in these expenditure be a total appropriation of $ 152,956,637.35 for the continuation and extension of the rural free delivery service which be an increase of $ 4,902,237.35 over the amount expend for this purpose in the precede fiscal year large as this expenditure have be the beneficent result attain in extend the free distribution of mail to the resident of rural district have justify the wisdom of the outlay statistic bring down to the 1st of october 1904 show that on that date there be 27,138 rural route establish serve approximately 12,000,000 of people in rural district remote from post office and that there be pende at that time 3,859 petition for the establishment of new rural route unquestionably some part of the general increase in receipt be due to the increase postal facility which the rural service have afford the revenue have also be aid greatly by amendment in the classification of mail matter and the curtailment of abuse of the second class mailing privilege the average increase in the volume of mail matter for the period begin with 1902 and end june 1905 that portion for 1905 be estimate be 40.47 per cent as compare with 25.46 per cent for the period immediately precede and 15.92 for the four year period immediately precede that our consular system need improvement salary should be substitute for fee and the proper classification grading and transfer of consular officer should be provide i be not prepared to say that a competitive system of examination for appointment would work well but by law it should be provide that consul should be familiar accord to place for which they apply with the french german or spanish language and should possess acquaintance with the resource of the united states the collection of object of art contemplate in section 5586 of the revised statutes should be designate and establish as a national gallery of art and the smithsonian institution should be authorize to accept any addition to say collection that may be receive by gift bequest or devise it be desirable to enact a proper national quarantine law it be most undesirable that a state should on its own initiative enforce quarantine regulation which be in effect a restriction upon interstate and international commerce the question should properly be assume by the government alone the surgeon general of the national public health and marine hospital service have repeatedly and convincingly set forth the need for such legislation i call your attention to the great extravagance in printing and bind government publication and especially to the fact that altogether too many of these publication be print there be a constant tendency to increase their number and their volume it be an understatement to say that no appreciable harm would be cause by and substantial benefit would accrue from decrease the amount of printing now do by at least one half probably the great majority of the government report and the like now print be never read at all and furthermore the printing of much of the material contain in many of the remain one serve no useful purpose whatever the attention of the congress should be especially give to the currency question and that the stand committee on the matter in the two houses charge with the duty take up the matter of our currency and see whether it be not possible to secure an agreement in the business world for better the system the committee should consider the question of the retirement of the greenback and the problem of securing in our currency such elasticity as be consistent with safety every silver dollar should be make by law redeemable in gold at the option of the holder i especially commend to your immediate attention the encouragement of our merchant marine by appropriate legislation the grow importance of the orient as a field for american export draw from my predecessor president mckinley an urgent request for its special consideration by the congress in his message of 1898 he stated:"in this relation as show the peculiar volume and value of our trade with china and the peculiarly favorable condition which exist for their expansion in the normal course of trade i refer to the communication address to the speaker of the house of representatives by the secretary of the treasury on the 14th of last june with its accompany letter of the secretary of state recommend an appropriation for a commission to study the industrial and commercial condition in the chinese empire and to report as to the opportunity for and the obstacle to the enlargement of market in china for the raw product and manufacture of the united states action be not take thereon during the last session i cordially urge that the recommendation receive at your hand the consideration which its importance and timeliness merit "in his annual message of 1889 he again call attention to this recommendation quote it and state further:"i now renew this recommendation as the importance of the subject have steadily grow since it be first submit to you and no time should be lose in study for ourselves the resource of this great field for american trade and enterprise "the importance of secure proper information and datum with a view to the enlargement of our trade with asia be undiminishe our consular representative in china have strongly urge a place for permanent display of american product in some prominent trade center of that empire under government control and management as an effective mean of advance our export trade therein i call the attention of the congress to the desirability of carry out these suggestion in deal with the question of immigration and naturalization it be indispensable to keep certain fact ever before the mind of those who share in enact the law first and foremost let we remember that the question of be a good american have nothing whatever to do with a man 's birthplace any more than it have to do with his creed in every generation from the time this government be found man of foreign birth have stand in the very foremost rank of good citizenship and that not merely in one but in every field of american activity while to try to draw a distinction between the man whose parent come to this country and the man whose ancestor come to it several generation back be a mere absurdity good americanism be a matter of heart of conscience of lofty aspiration of sound common sense but not of birthplace or of creed the medal of honor the high prize to be win by those who serve in the army and the navy of the united states decorate man bear here and it also decorate man bear in great britain and ireland in germany in scandinavia in france and doubtless in other country also in the field of statesmanship in the field of business in the field of philanthropic endeavor it be equally true that among the man of whom we be most proud as americans no distinction whatever can be draw between those who themselves or whose parent come over in sailing ship or steamer from across the water and those whose ancestor step ashore into the woode wilderness at plymouth or at the mouth of the hudson the delaware or the james nearly three century ago no fellow citizen of ours be entitle to any peculiar regard because of the way in which he worship his maker or because of the birthplace of himself or his parent nor should he be in any way discriminate against therefor each must stand on his worth as a man and each be entitle to be judge solely thereby there be no danger of have too many immigrant of the right kind it make no difference from what country they come if they be sound in body and in mind and above all if they be of good character so that we can rest assure that their child and grandchild will be worthy fellow citizen of our child and grandchild then we should welcome they with cordial hospitality but the citizenship of this country should not be debase it be vital that we should keep high the standard of well being among our wage worker and therefore we should not admit masse of man whose standard of living and whose personal custom and habit be such that they tend to lower the level of the american wage worker and above all we should not admit any man of an unworthy type any man concern whom we can say that he will himself be a bad citizen or that his child and grandchild will detract from instead of add to the sum of the good citizenship of the country similarly we should take the great care about naturalization fraudulent naturalization the naturalization of improper person be a curse to our government and it be the affair of every honest voter wherever bear to see that no fraudulent voting be allow that no fraud in connection with naturalization be permit in the past year the case of false fraudulent and improper naturalization of alien come to the attention of the executive branch of the government have increase to an alarming degree extensive sale of forge certificate of naturalization have be discover as well as many case of naturalization secure by perjury and fraud and in addition instance have accumulate show that many court issue certificate of naturalization carelessly and upon insufficient evidence under the constitution it be in the power of the congress to establish a uniform rule of naturalization and numerous law have from time to time be enact for that purpose which have be supplement in a few states by state law have special application the federal statute permit naturalization by any court of record in the united states have common law jurisdiction and a seal and clerk except the police court of the district of columbia and nearly all these court exercise this important function it result that where so many court of such vary grade have jurisdiction there be lack of uniformity in the rule apply in confer naturalization some court be strict and other lax an alien who may secure naturalization in one place might be deny it in another and the intent of the constitutional provision be in fact defeat furthermore the certificate of naturalization issue by the court differ widely in wording and appearance and when they be bring into use in foreign country be frequently subject to suspicion there should be a comprehensive revision of the naturalization law the court have power to naturalize should be definitely name by national authority the testimony upon which naturalization may be confer should be definitely prescribe publication of impend naturalization application should be require in advance of their hearing in court the form and wording of all certificate issue should be uniform throughout the country and the court should be require to make return to the secretary of state at state period of all naturalization confer not only be the law relate to naturalization now defective but those relate to citizenship of the united states ought also to be make the subject of scientific inquiry with a view to probable further legislation by what act expatriation may be assume to have be accomplish how long an american citizen may reside abroad and receive the protection of our passport whether any degree of protection should be extend to one who have make the declaration of intention to become a citizen of the united states but have not secure naturalization be question of serious import involve personal right and often produce friction between this government and foreign government yet upon these question our law be silent i recommend that an examination be make into the subject of citizenship expatriation and protection of americans abroad with a view to appropriate legislation the power of the government to protect the integrity of the election of its own official be inherent and have be recognize and affirm by repeat declaration of the supreme court there be no enemy of free government more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption of the electorate no one defend or excuse corruption and it would seem to follow that none would oppose vigorous measure to eradicate it i recommend the enactment of a law direct against bribery and corruption in federal election the detail of such a law may be safely leave to the wise discretion of the congress but it should go as far as under the constitution it be possible to go and should include severe penalty against he who give or receive a bribe intend to influence his act or opinion as an elector and provision for the publication not only of the expenditure for nomination and election of all candidate but also of all contribution receive and expenditure make by political committee no subject be well worthy the attention of the congress than that portion of the report of the attorney general deal with the long delay and the great obstruction to justice experience in the case of beavers green and gaynor and benson be these isolated and special case i should not call your attention to they but the difficulty encounter as regard these man who have be indict for criminal practice be not exceptional they be precisely similar in kind to what occur again and again in the case of criminal who have sufficient mean to enable they to take advantage of a system of procedure which have grow up in the federal court and which amount in effect to make the law easy of enforcement against the man who have no money and difficult of enforcement even to the point of sometimes secure immunity as regard the man who have money in criminal case the writ of the united states should run throughout its border the wheel of justice should not be clog as they have be clog in the case above mention where it have prove absolutely impossible to bring the accuse to the place appoint by the constitution for his trial of recent year there have be grave and increase complaint of the difficulty of bring to justice those criminal whose criminality instead of be against one person in the republic be against all person in the republic because it be against the republic itself under any circumstance and from the very nature of the case it be often exceedingly difficult to secure proper punishment of those who have be guilty of wrongdoing against the government by the time the offender can be bring into court the popular wrath against he have generally subside and there be in most instance very slight danger indeed of any prejudice exist in the mind of the jury against he at present the interest of the innocent man be amply safeguard but the interest of the government that is the interest of honest administration that be the interest of the people be not recognize as they should be no subject well warrant the attention of the congress indeed no subject well warrant the attention of the bench and the bar throughout the united states alaska like all our territorial acquisition have prove resourceful beyond the expectation of those who make the purchase it have become the home of many hardy industrious and thrifty american citizen town of a permanent character have be build the extent of its wealth in mineral timber fishery and agriculture while great be probably not comprehend yet in any just measure by our people we do know however that from a very small begin its product have grow until they be a steady and material contribution to the wealth of the nation owe to the immensity of alaska and its location in the far north it be a difficult matter to provide many thing essential to its growth and to the happiness and comfort of its people by private enterprise alone it should therefore receive reasonable aid from the government the government have already do excellent work for alaska in lay cable and building telegraph line this work have be do in the most economical and efficient way by the signal corps of the army in some respect it have outgrow its present law while in other those law have be find to be inadequate in order to obtain information upon which i could rely i cause an official of the department of justice in whose judgment i have confidence to visit alaska during the past summer for the purpose of ascertain how government be administer there and what legislation be actually need at present a statement of the condition find to exist together with some recommendation and the reason therefor in which i strongly concur will be find in the annual report of the attorney general in some instance i feel that the legislation suggest be so imperatively need that i be move briefly to emphasize the attorney general 's proposal under the code of alaska as it now stand many purely administrative power and duty include by far the most important devolve upon the district judge or upon the clerk of the district court act under the direction of the judge while the governor upon whom these power and duty should logically fall have nothing specific to do except to make annual report issue thanksgiving day proclamation and appoint indian policeman and notary public i believe it essential to good government in alaska and therefore recommend that the congress divest the district judge and the clerk of their court of the administrative or executive function that they now exercise and cast they upon the governor this would not be an innovation it would simply conform the government of alaska to fundamental principle make the governorship a real instead of a merely nominal office and leave the judge free to give their entire attention to their judicial duty and at the same time remove they from a great deal of the strife that now embarrass the judicial office in alaska i also recommend that the salary of the district judge and district attorney in alaska be increase so as to make they equal to those receive by correspond officer in the united states after deduct the difference in the cost of living that the district attorney should be prohibit from engage in private practice that united states commissioner be appoint by the governor of the territory instead of by the district judge and that a fix salary be provide for they to take the place of the discredited fee system which should be abolish in all office that a mount constabulary be create to police the territory outside the limit of incorporated town a vast section now wholly without police protection and that some provision be make to at least lessen the oppressive delay and cost that now attend the prosecution of appeal from the district court of alaska there should be a division of the exist judicial district and an increase in the number of judge alaska should have a delegate in the congress where possible the congress should aid in the construction of need wagon road additional light house should be provide in my judgment it be especially important to aid in such manner as seem just and feasible in the construction of a trunk line of railway to connect the gulf of alaska with the yukon river through american territory this would be most beneficial to the development of the resource of the territory and to the comfort and welfare of its people salmon hatchery should be establish in many different stream so as to secure the preservation of this valuable food fish salmon fishery and cannery should be prohibit on certain of the river where the mass of those indians dwell who live almost exclusively on fish the alaskan native be kindly intelligent anxious to learn and willing to work those who have come under the influence of civilization even for a limited period have prove their capability of become self support self respect citizen and ask only for the just enforcement of law and intelligent instruction and supervision other live in more remote region primitive simple hunter and fisher folk who know only the life of the wood and the water be daily be confront with twentieth century civilization with all of its complexity their country be be overrun by stranger the game slaughter and drive away the stream deplete of fish and hitherto unknown and fatal disease bring to they all of which combine to produce a state of abject poverty and want which must result in their extinction action in their interest be demand by every consideration of justice and humanity the need of these people be the abolition of the present fee system whereby the native be degrade impose upon and teach the injustice of law the establishment of hospital at central point so that contagious disease that be bring to they continually by incoming white may be localize and not allow to become epidemic to spread death and destitution over great area the development of the educational system in the form of practical training in such industry as will assure the indians self support under the change condition in which they will have to live the duty of the office of the governor should be extend to include the supervision of indian affair with necessary assistant in different district he should be provide with the mean and the power to protect and advise the native people to furnish medical treatment in time of epidemic and to extend material relief in period of famine and extreme destitution the alaskan native should be give the right to acquire hold and dispose of property upon the same condition as give other inhabitant and the privilege of citizenship should be give to such as may be able to meet certain definite requirement in hawaii congress should give the governor power to remove all the official appoint under he the harbor of honolulu should be dredge the marine hospital service should be empower to study leprosy in the island i ask special consideration for the report and recommendation of the governor of porto rico in treating of our foreign policy and of the attitude that this great nation should assume in the world at large it be absolutely necessary to consider the army and the navy and the congress through which the thought of the nation find its expression should keep ever vividly in mind the fundamental fact that it be impossible to treat our foreign policy whether this policy take shape in the effort to secure justice for other or justice for ourselves save as condition upon the attitude we be willing to take toward our army and especially toward our navy it be not merely unwise it be contemptible for a nation as for an individual to use high sound language to proclaim its purpose or to take position which be ridiculous if unsupported by potential force and then to refuse to provide this force if there be no intention of provide and of keep the force necessary to back up a strong attitude then it be far well not to assume such an attitude the steady aim of this nation as of all enlightened nation should be to strive to bring ever near the day when there shall prevail throughout the world the peace of justice there be kind of peace which be highly undesirable which be in the long run as destructive as any war tyrant and oppressor have many time make a wilderness and call it peace many time people who be slothful or timid or shortsighted who have be enervate by ease or by luxury or mislead by false teaching have shrink in unmanly fashion from do duty that be stern and that need self sacrifice and have seek to hide from their own mind their shortcoming their ignoble motive by call they love of peace the peace of tyrannous terror the peace of craven weakness the peace of injustice all these should be shun as we shun unrighteous war the goal to set before we as a nation the goal which should be set before all mankind be the attainment of the peace of justice of the peace which come when each nation be not merely safe guard in its own right but scrupulously recognize and perform its duty toward other generally peace tell for righteousness but if there be conflict between the two then our fealty be due first to the cause of righteousness unrighteous war be common and unrighteous peace be rare but both should be shun the right of freedom and the responsibility for the exercise of that right can not be divorce one of our great poet have well and finely say that freedom be not a gift that tarry long in the hand of coward neither do it tarry long in the hand of those too slothful too dishonest or too unintelligent to exercise it the eternal vigilance which be the price of liberty must be exercise sometimes to guard against outside foe although of course far more often to guard against our own selfish or thoughtless shortcoming if these self evident truth be keep before we and only if they be so keep before we we shall have a clear idea of what our foreign policy in its large aspect should be it be our duty to remember that a nation have no more right to do injustice to another nation strong or weak than an individual have to do injustice to another individual that the same moral law apply in one case as in the other but we must also remember that it be as much the duty of the nation to guard its own right and its own interest as it be the duty of the individual so to do within the nation the individual have now delegate this right to the state that be to the representative of all the individual and it be a maxim of the law that for every wrong there be a remedy but in international law we have not advance by any mean as far as we have advance in municipal law there be as yet no judicial way of enforce a right in international law when one nation wrong another or wrong many other there be no tribunal before which the wrongdoer can be bring either it be necessary supinely to acquiesce in the wrong and thus put a premium upon brutality and aggression or else it be necessary for the aggrieved nation valiantly to stand up for its right until some method be devise by which there shall be a degree of international control over offend nation it would be a wicked thing for the most civilized power for those with most sense of international obligation and with keenest and most generous appreciation of the difference between right and wrong to disarm if the great civilized nation of the present day should completely disarm the result would mean an immediate recrudescence of barbarism in one form or another under any circumstance a sufficient armament would have to be keep up to serve the purpose of international police and until international cohesion and the sense of international duty and right be far more advanced than at present a nation desirous both of secure respect for itself and of do good to other must have a force adequate for the work which it feel be allot to it as its part of the general world duty therefore it follow that a self respect just and far see nation should on the one hand endeavor by every mean to aid in the development of the various movement which tend to provide substitute for war which tend to render nation in their action toward one another and indeed toward their own people more responsive to the general sentiment of humane and civilized mankind and on the other hand that it should keep prepare while scrupulously avoid wrongdoe itself to repel any wrong and in exceptional case to take action which in a more advanced stage of international relation would come under the head of the exercise of the international police a great free people owe it to itself and to all mankind not to sink into helplessness before the power of evil we be in every way endeavor to help on with cordial good will every movement which will tend to bring we into more friendly relation with the rest of mankind in pursuance of this policy i shall shortly lay before the senate treaty of arbitration with all power which be willing to enter into these treaty with we it be not possible at this period of the world 's development to agree to arbitrate all matter but there be many matter of possible difference between we and other nation which can be thus arbitrate furthermore at the request of the interparliamentary union an eminent body compose of practical statesman from all country i have ask the powers to join with this government in a second hague conference at which it be hope that the work already so happily begin at the hague may be carry some step far toward completion this carry out the desire express by the first hague conference itself it be not true that the united states feel any land hunger or entertain any project as regard the other nation of the western hemisphere save such as be for their welfare all that this country desire be to see the neighboring country stable orderly and prosperous any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship if a nation show that it know how to act with reasonable efficiency and decency in social and political matter if it keep order and pay its obligation it need fear no interference from the united states chronic wrongdoing or an impotence which result in a general loosening of the tie of civilized society may in america as elsewhere ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation and in the western hemisphere the adherence of the united states to the monroe doctrine may force the united states however reluctantly in flagrant case of such wrongdoing or impotence to the exercise of an international police power if every country wash by the caribbean sea would show the progress in stable and just civilization which with the aid of the platt amendment cuba have show since our troop leave the island and which so many of the republic in both americas be constantly and brilliantly show all question of interference by this nation with their affair would be at an end our interest and those of our southern neighbor be in reality identical they have great natural rich and if within their border the reign of law and justice obtain prosperity be sure to come to they while they thus obey the primary law of civilized society they may rest assure that they will be treat by we in a spirit of cordial and helpful sympathy we would interfere with they only in the last resort and then only if it become evident that their inability or unwillingness to do justice at home and abroad have violate the right of the united states or have invite foreign aggression to the detriment of the entire body of american nation it be a mere truism to say that every nation whether in america or anywhere else which desire to maintain its freedom its independence must ultimately realize that the right of such independence can not be separate from the responsibility of make good use of it in assert the monroe doctrine in take such step as we have take in regard to cuba venezuela and panama and in endeavor to circumscribe the theater of war in the far east and to secure the open door in china we have act in our own interest as well as in the interest of humanity at large there be however case in which while our own interest be not greatly involve strong appeal be make to our sympathy ordinarily it be very much wise and more useful for we to concern ourselves with strive for our own moral and material betterment here at home than to concern ourselves with try to better the condition of thing in other nation we have plenty of sin of our own to war against and under ordinary circumstance we can do more for the general uplifting of humanity by strive with heart and soul to put a stop to civic corruption to brutal lawlessness and violent race prejudice here at home than by pass resolution about wrongdoe elsewhere nevertheless there be occasional crime commit on so vast a scale and of such peculiar horror as to make we doubt whether it be not our manifest duty to endeavor at least to show our disapproval of the deed and our sympathy with those who have suffer by it the case must be extreme in which such a course be justifiable there must be no effort make to remove the mote from our brother 's eye if we refuse to remove the beam from our own but in extreme case action may be justifiable and proper what form the action shall take must depend upon the circumstance of the case that is upon the degree of the atrocity and upon our power to remedy it the case in which we could interfere by force of arm as we interfere to put a stop to intolerable condition in cuba be necessarily very few yet it be not to be expect that a people like our which in spite of certain very obvious shortcoming nevertheless as a whole show by its consistent practice its belief in the principle of civil and religious liberty and of orderly freedom a people among whom even the bad crime like the crime of lynching be never more than sporadic so that individual and not class be molest in their fundamental right it be inevitable that such a nation should desire eagerly to give expression to its horror on an occasion like that of the massacre of the jews in kishenef or when it witness such systematic and long extend cruelty and oppression as the cruelty and oppression of which the armenians have be the victim and which have win for they the indignant pity of the civilized world even where it be not possible to secure in other nation the observance of the principle which we accept as axiomatic it be necessary for we firmly to insist upon the right of our own citizen without regard to their creed or race without regard to whether they be bear here or bear abroad it have prove very difficult to secure from russia the right for our jewish fellow citizen to receive passport and travel through russian territory such conduct be not only unjust and irritate toward we but it be difficult to see its wisdom from russia 's standpoint no conceivable good be accomplish by it if an american jew or an american christian misbehave himself in russia he can at once be drive out but the ordinary american jew like the ordinary american christian would behave just about as he behave here that is behave as any good citizen ought to behave and where this be the case it be a wrong against which we be entitle to protest to refuse he his passport without regard to his conduct and character merely on racial and religious ground in turkey our difficulty arise less from the way in which our citizen be sometimes treat than from the indignation inevitably excited in see such fearful misrule as have be witness both in armenia and macedonia the strong arm of the government in enforce respect for its just right in international matter be the navy of the united states i most earnestly recommend that there be no halt in the work of upbuilde the american navy there be no more patriotic duty before we a people than to keep the navy adequate to the need of this country 's position we have undertake to build the isthmian canal we have undertake to secure for ourselves our just share in the trade of the orient we have undertake to protect our citizen from proper treatment in foreign land we continue steadily to insist on the application of the monroe doctrine to the western hemisphere unless our attitude in these and all similar matter be to be a mere boastful sham we can not afford to abandon our naval programme our voice be now potent for peace and be so potent because we be not afraid of war but our protestation upon behalf of peace would neither receive nor deserve the slight attention if we be impotent to make they good the war which now unfortunately rage in the far east have emphasize in strike fashion the new possibility of naval warfare the lesson teach be both strategic and tactical and be political as well as military the experience of the war have show in conclusive fashion that while sea going and sea keep torpedo destroyer be indispensable and fast lightly armed and armored cruiser very useful yet that the main reliance the main standby in any navy worthy the name must be the great battle ship heavily armored and heavily gun not a russian or japanese battle ship have be sink by a torpedo boat or by gunfire while among the less protect ship cruiser after cruiser have be destroy whenever the hostile squadron have get within range of one another 's weapon there will always be a large field of usefulness for cruiser especially of the more formidable type we need to increase the number of torpedo boat destroyer pay less heed to their have a knot or two extra speed than to their capacity to keep the sea for week and if necessary for month at a time it be wise to build submarine torpedo boat as under certain circumstance they might be very useful but most of all we need to continue build our fleet of battle ship or ship so powerfully armed that they can inflict the maximum of damage upon our opponent and so well protect that they can suffer a severe hammering in return without fatal impairment of their ability to fight and maneuver of course ample mean must be provide for enable the personnel of the navy to be bring to the high point of efficiency our great fighting ship and torpedo boat must be ceaselessly train and maneuver in squadron the officer and man can only learn their trade thoroughly by ceaseless practice on the high sea in the event of war it would be far well to have no ship at all than to have ship of a poor and ineffective type or ship which however good be yet man by untrained and unskillful crew the good officer and man in a poor ship could do nothing against fairly good opponent and on the other hand a modern war ship be useless unless the officer and man aboard she have become adept in their duty the marksmanship in our navy have improve in an extraordinary degree during the last three year and on the whole the type of our battleship be improve but much remain to be do soon or later we shall have to provide for some method by which there will be promotion for merit as well as for seniority or else retirement all those who after a certain age have not advance beyond a certain grade while no effort must be spare to make the service attractive to the enlisted man in order that they may be keep as long as possible in it reservation public school should be provide wherever there be navy yard within the last three year the united states have set an example in disarmament where disarmament be proper by law our army be fix at a maximum of one hundred thousand and a minimum of sixty thousand man when there be insurrection in the philippines we keep the army at the maximum peace come in the philippines and now our army have be reduce to the minimum at which it be possible to keep it with due regard to its efficiency the gun now mounted require twenty eight thousand man if the coast fortification be to be adequately man relatively to the nation it be not now so large as the police force of new york or chicago relatively to the population of either city we need more officer there be not enough to perform the regular army work it be very important that the officer of the army should be accustom to handle their man in masse as it be also important that the national guard of the several states should be accustom to actual field maneuvering especially in connection with the regular for this reason we be to be congratulate upon the success of the field maneuver at manassas last fall maneuver in which a large number of regulars and national guard take part than be ever before assemble together in time of peace no other civilized nation have relatively to its population such a diminutive army as ours and while the army be so small we be not to be excuse if we fail to keep it at a very high grade of proficiency it must be incessantly practice the standard for the enlisted man should be keep very high while at the same time the service should be make as attractive as possible and the standard for the officer should be keep even high which as regard the upper rank can well be do by introduce some system of selection and rejection into the promotion we should be able in the event of some sudden emergency to put into the field one first class army corps which should be as a whole at least the equal of any body of troop of like number belong to any other nation great progress have be make in protect our coast by adequate fortification with sufficient gun we should however pay much more heed than at present to the development of an extensive system of float mine for use in all our more important harbor these mine have be prove to be a most formidable safeguard against hostile fleet i earnestly call the attention of the congress to the need of amend the exist law relate to the award of congressional medal of honor in the navy so as to provide that they may be award to commission officer and warrant officer as well as to enlisted man these justly prize medal be give in the army alike to the officer and the enlisted man and it be most unjust that the commission officer and warrant officer of the navy should not in this respect have the same right as their brother in the army and as the enlisted man of the navy in the philippine islands there have be during the past year a continuation of the steady progress which have obtain ever since our troop definitely get the upper hand of the insurgent the philippine people or to speak more accurately the many tribe and even race sunder from one another more or less sharply who go to make up the people of the philippine islands contain many element of good and some element which we have a right to hope stand for progress at present they be utterly incapable of exist in independence at all or of build up a civilization of their own i firmly believe that we can help they to rise higher and high in the scale of civilization and of capacity for self government and i most earnestly hope that in the end they will be able to stand if not entirely alone yet in some such relation to the united states as cuba now stand this end be not yet in sight and it may be indefinitely postpone if our people be foolish enough to turn the attention of the filipinos away from the problem of achieve moral and material prosperity of work for a stable orderly and just government and toward foolish and dangerous intrigue for a complete independence for which they be as yet totally unfit on the other hand our people must keep steadily before their mind the fact that the justification for our stay in the philippines must ultimately rest chiefly upon the good we be able to do in the island i do not overlook the fact that in the development of our interest in the pacific ocean and along its coast the philippines have play and will play an important part and that our interest have be serve in more than one way by the possession of the island but our chief reason for continue to hold they must be that we ought in good faith to try to do our share of the world 's work and this particular piece of work have be impose upon we by the result of the war with spain the problem present to we in the philippine islands be akin to but not exactly like the problem present to the other great civilized power which have possession in the orient there be point of resemblance in our work to the work which be be do by the british in india and egypt by the french in algiers by the dutch in java by the russians in turkestan by the japanese in formosa but more distinctly than any of these power we be endeavor to develop the native themselves so that they shall take an ever increase share in their own government and as far as be prudent we be already admit their representative to a governmental equality with our own there be commissioner judge and governor in the island who be filipinos and who have exactly the same share in the government of the island as have their colleague who be americans while in the low rank of course the great majority of the public servant be filipinos within two year we shall be try the experiment of an elective low house in the philippine legislature it may be that the filipinos will misuse this legislature and they certainly will misuse it if they be mislead by foolish person here at home into start an agitation for their own independence or into any factious or improper action in such case they will do themselves no good and will stop for the time be all further effort to advance they and give they a great share in their own government but if they act with wisdom and self restraint if they show that they be capable of elect a legislature which in its turn be capable of take a sane and efficient part in the actual work of government they can rest assure that a full and increase measure of recognition will be give they above all they should remember that their prime need be moral and industrial not political it be a good thing to try the experiment of give they a legislature but it be a far well thing to give they school good road railroad which will enable they to get their product to market honest court an honest and efficient constabulary and all that tend to produce order peace fair dealing as between man and man and habit of intelligent industry and thrift if they be safeguard against oppression and if their real want material and spiritual be study intelligently and in a spirit of friendly sympathy much more good will be do they than by any effort to give they political power though this effort may in its own proper time and place be proper enough meanwhile our own people should remember that there be need for the high standard of conduct among the americans send to the philippine islands not only among the public servant but among the private individual who go to they it be because i feel this so deeply that in the administration of these island i have positively refuse to permit any discrimination whatsoever for political reason and have insist that in choose the public servant consideration should be pay solely to the worth of the man choose and to the need of the island there be no high body of man in our public service than we have in the philippine islands under governor wright and his associate so far as possible these man should be give a free hand and their suggestion should receive the hearty backing both of the executive and of the congress there be need of a vigilant and disinterested support of our public servant in the philippines by good citizen here in the united states unfortunately hitherto those of our people here at home who have specially claim to be the champion of the filipinos have in reality be their bad enemy this will continue to be the case as long as they strive to make the filipinos independent and stop all industrial development of the island by cry out against the law which would bring it on the ground that capitalist must not exploit the island such proceeding be not only unwise but be most harmful to the filipinos who do not need independence at all but who do need good law good public servant and the industrial development that can only come if the investment of american and foreign capital in the island be favor in all legitimate way every measure take concern the island should be take primarily with a view to their advantage we should certainly give they low tariff rate on their export to the united states if this be not do it will be a wrong to extend our shipping law to they i earnestly hope for the immediate enactment into law of the legislation now pende to encourage american capital to seek investment in the island in railroad in factory in plantation and in lumber and mining
my fellow citizen no people on earth have more cause to be thankfulthan ours and this be say reverently in no spirit of boastfulness inour own strength but with gratitude to the giver of good who have blessedus with the condition which have enable we to achieve so large a measureof well being and of happiness to we as a people it have be grant tolay the foundation of our national life in a new continent we be theheir of the age and yet we have have to pay few of the penalty whichin old country be exact by the dead hand of a bygone civilization we have not be oblige to fight for our existence against any alien race;and yet our life have call for the vigor and effort without which themanlier and hardy virtue wither away under such condition it wouldbe our own fault if we fail and the success which we have have in thepast the success which we confidently believe the future will bring shouldcause in we no feeling of vainglory but rather a deep and abide realizationof all which life have offer we a full acknowledgment of the responsibilitywhich be ours and a fix determination to show that under a free governmenta mighty people can thrive good alike as regard the thing of the bodyand the thing of the soul much have be give we and much will rightfully be expect from we we have duty to other and duty to ourselves and we can shirk neither we have become a great nation force by the fact of its greatness intorelation with the other nation of the earth and we must behave as beseemsa people with such responsibility toward all other nation large andsmall our attitude must be one of cordial and sincere friendship we mustshow not only in our word but in our deed that we be earnestly desirousof secure their good will by act toward they in a spirit of just andgenerous recognition of all their right but justice and generosity ina nation as in an individual count most when show not by the weak butby the strong while ever careful to refrain from wrongdoe other wemust be no less insistent that we be not wrong ourselves we wish peace but we wish the peace of justice the peace of righteousness we wish itbecause we think it be right and not because we be afraid no weak nationthat act manfully and justly should ever have cause to fear we and nostrong power should ever be able to single we out as a subject for insolentaggression our relation with the other power of the world be important butstill more important be our relation among ourselves such growth inwealth in population and in power as this nation have see during thecentury and a quarter of its national life be inevitably accompany bya like growth in the problem which be ever before every nation that risesto greatness power invariably mean both responsibility and danger ourforefather face certain peril which we have outgrow we now face otherperil the very existence of which it be impossible that they shouldforesee modern life be both complex and intense and the tremendous changeswrought by the extraordinary industrial development of the last half centuryare feel in every fiber of our social and political being never beforehave man try so vast and formidable an experiment as that of administeringthe affair of a continent under the form of a democratic republic thecondition which have tell for our marvelous material well being whichhave develop to a very high degree our energy self reliance and individualinitiative have also bring the care and anxiety inseparable from theaccumulation of great wealth in industrial center upon the success ofour experiment much depend not only as regard our own welfare but asregard the welfare of mankind if we fail the cause of free self governmentthroughout the world will rock to its foundation and therefore our responsibilityis heavy to ourselves to the world as it be to day and to the generationsyet unborn there be no good reason why we should fear the future butthere be every reason why we should face it seriously neither hide fromourselve the gravity of the problem before we nor fear to approachthese problem with the unbending unflinche purpose to solve they aright yet after all though the problem be new though the task set beforeus differ from the task set before our father who found and preservedthis republic the spirit in which these task must be undertake and theseproblem face if our duty be to be well do remain essentially unchanged we know that self government be difficult we know that no people needssuch high trait of character as that people which seek to govern itsaffair aright through the freely express will of the freeman who composeit but we have faith that we shall not prove false to the memory ofthe man of the mighty past they do their work they leave we the splendidheritage we now enjoy we in our turn have an assured confidence that weshall be able to leave this heritage unwasted and enlarge to our childrenand our child 's child to do so we must show not merely in greatcrise but in the everyday affair of life the quality of practicalintelligence of courage of hardihood and endurance and above all thepower of devotion to a lofty ideal which make great the man who foundedthis republic in the day of washington which make great the man who preservedthis republic in the day of abraham lincoln
to the senate and house of representatives the people of this country continue to enjoy great prosperity undoubtedly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity and this ebb and flow will be feel more or less by all member of the community both by the deserving and the undeserving against the wrath of the lord the wisdom of man can not avail in time of flood or drought human ingenuity can but partially repair the disaster a general failure of crop would hurt all of we again if the folly of man mar the general well being then those who be innocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incur by those who be guilty of the folly a panic bring on by the speculative folly of part of the business community would hurt the whole business community but such stoppage of welfare though it might be severe would not be last in the long run the one vital factor in the permanent prosperity of the country be the high individual character of the average american worker the average american citizen no matter whether his work be mental or manual whether he be farmer or wage worker business man or professional man in our industrial and social system the interest of all man be so closely intertwine that in the immense majority of case a straight deal man who by his efficiency by his ingenuity and industry benefit himself must also benefit other normally the man of great productive capacity who become rich by guide the labor of many other man do so by enable they to produce more than they could produce without his guidance and both he and they share in the benefit which come also to the public at large the superficial fact that the sharing may be unequal must never blind we to the underlying fact that there be this sharing and that the benefit come in some degree to each man concern normally the wage worker the man of small mean and the average consumer as well as the average producer be all alike help by make condition such that the man of exceptional business ability receive an exceptional reward for his ability something can be do by legislation to help the general prosperity but no such help of a permanently beneficial character can be give to the less able and less fortunate save as the result of a policy which shall inure to the advantage of all industrious and efficient people who act decently and this be only another way of say that any benefit which come to the less able and less fortunate must of necessity come even more to the more able and more fortunate if therefore the less fortunate man be move by envy of his more fortunate brother to strike at the condition under which they have both though unequally prosper the result will assuredly be that while danger may come to the one strike at it will visit with an even heavy load the one who strike the blow take as a whole we must all go up or down together yet while not merely admit but insist upon this it be also true that where there be no governmental restraint or supervision some of the exceptional man use their energy not in way that be for the common good but in way which tell against this common good the fortune amass through corporate organization be now so large and vest such power in those that wield they as to make it a matter of necessity to give to the sovereign that be to the government which represent the people as a whole some effective power of supervision over their corporate use in order to insure a healthy social and industrial life every big corporation should be hold responsible by and be accountable to some sovereign strong enough to control its conduct i be in no sense hostile to corporation this be an age of combination and any effort to prevent all combination will be not only useless but in the end vicious because of the contempt for law which the failure to enforce law inevitably produce we should moreover recognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effect by corporate agency in a country such as ours and the wealth of intellect energy and fidelity devote to their service and therefore normally to the service of the public by their officer and director the corporation have come to stay just as the trade union have come to stay each can do and have do great good each should be favor so long as it do good but each should be sharply check where it act against law and justice so long as the finance of the nation be keep upon an honest basis no other question of internal economy with which the congress have the power to deal begin to approach in importance the matter of endeavor to secure proper industrial condition under which the individual and especially the great corporation do an interstate business be to act the maker of our national constitution provide especially that the regulation of interstate commerce should come within the sphere of the general government the argument in favor of their take this stand be even then overwhelming but they be far strong today in view of the enormous development of great business agency usually corporate in form experience have show conclusively that it be useless to try to get any adequate regulation and supervision of these great corporation by state action such regulation and supervision can only be effectively exercise by a sovereign whose jurisdiction be coextensive with the field of work of the corporation that be by the national government i believe that this regulation and supervision can be obtain by the enactment of law by the congress if this prove impossible it will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer in full form such power upon the national government by a proper amendment of the constitution it would obviously be unwise to endeavor to secure such an amendment until it be certain that the result can not be obtain under the constitution as it now be the law of the congress and of the several states hitherto as pass upon by the court have result more often in show that the states have no power in the matter than that the national government have power so that there at present exist a very unfortunate condition of thing under which these great corporation do an interstate business occupy the position of subject without a sovereign neither any state government nor the national government have effective control over they our steady aim should be by legislation cautiously and carefully undertake but resolutely persevere in to assert the sovereignty of the national government by affirmative action this be only in form an innovation in substance it be merely a restoration for from the early time such regulation of industrial activity have be recognize in the action of the lawmaking body and all that i propose be to meet the change condition in such manner as will prevent the commonwealth abdicate the power it have always possess not only in this country but also in england before and since this country become a separate nation it have be a misfortune that the national law on this subject have hitherto be of a negative or prohibitive rather than an affirmative kind and still more that they have in part seek to prohibit what could not be effectively prohibit and have in part in their prohibition confound what should be allow and what should not be allow it be generally useless to try to prohibit all restraint on competition whether this restraint be reasonable or unreasonable and where it be not useless it be generally hurtful event have show that it be not possible adequately to secure the enforcement of any law of this kind by incessant appeal to the court the department of justice have for the last four year devote more attention to the enforcement of the anti trust legislation than to anything else much have be accomplish particularly marked have be the moral effect of the prosecution but it be increasingly evident that there will be a very insufficient beneficial result in the way of economic change the successful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develop another device to accomplish the same purpose what be need be not sweep prohibition of every arrangement good or bad which may tend to restrict competition but such adequate supervision and regulation as will prevent any restriction of competition from be to the detriment of the public as well as such supervision and regulation as will prevent other abuse in no way connect with restriction of competition of these abuse perhaps the chief although by no mean the only one be overcapitalization generally itself the result of dishonest promotion because of the myriad evil it bring in its train for such overcapitalization often mean an inflation that invite business panic it always conceal the true relation of the profit earn to the capital actually invest and it create a burden of interest payment which be a fertile cause of improper reduction in or limitation of wage it damage the small investor discourage thrift and encourage gambling and speculation while perhaps bad of all be the trickiness and dishonesty which it imply for harm to moral be bad than any possible harm to material interest and the debauchery of politic and business by great dishonest corporation be far bad than any actual material evil they do the public until the national government obtain in some manner which the wisdom of the congress may suggest proper control over the big corporation engage in interstate commerce that be over the great majority of the big corporation it will be impossible to deal adequately with these evil i be well aware of the difficulty of the legislation that i be suggest and of the need of temperate and cautious action in secure it i should emphatically protest against improperly radical or hasty action the first thing to do be to deal with the great corporation engage in the business of interstate transportation as i say in my message of december 6 last the immediate and most pressing need so far as legislation be concern be the enactment into law of some scheme to secure to the agent of the government such supervision and regulation of the rate charge by the railroad of the country engage in interstate traffic as shall summarily and effectively prevent the imposition of unjust or unreasonable rate it must include put a complete stop to rebate in every shape and form this power to regulate rate like all similar power over the business world should be exercise with moderation caution and self restraint but it should exist so that it can be effectively exercise when the need arise the first consideration to be keep in mind be that the power should be affirmative and should be give to some administrative body create by the congress if give to the present interstate commerce commission or to a reorganize interstate commerce commission such commission should be make unequivocally administrative i do not believe in the government interfere with private business more than be necessary i do not believe in the government undertake any work which can with propriety be leave in private hand but neither do i believe in the government flinching from oversee any work when it become evident that abuse be sure to obtain therein unless there be governmental supervision it be not my province to indicate the exact term of the law which should be enact but i call the attention of the congress to certain exist condition with which it be desirable to deal in my judgment the most important provision which such law should contain be that confer upon some competent administrative body the power to decide upon the case be bring before it whether a give rate prescribe by a railroad be reasonable and just and if it be find to be unreasonable and unjust then after full investigation of the complaint to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go the maximum reasonable rate as it be commonly call this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward subject to review by the court it sometimes happen at present not that a rate be too high but that a favored shipper be give too low a rate in such case the commission would have the right to fix this already establish minimum rate as the maximum and it would need only one or two such decision by the commission to cure railroad company of the practice of give improper minimum rate i call your attention to the fact that my proposal be not to give the commission power to initiate or originate rate generally but to regulate a rate already fix or originate by the road upon complaint and after investigation a heavy penalty should be exact from any corporation which fail to respect an order of the commission i regard this power to establish a maximum rate as be essential to any scheme of real reform in the matter of railway regulation the first necessity be to secure it and unless it be grant to the commission there be little use in touch the subject at all illegal transaction often occur under the form of law it have often occur that a shipper have be tell by a traffic officer to buy a large quantity of some commodity and then after it have be buy an open reduction be make in the rate to take effect immediately the arrangement result to the profit of one shipper and the one railroad and to the damage of all their competitor for it must not be forget that the big shipper be at least as much to blame as any railroad in the matter of rebate the law should make it clear so that nobody can fail to understand that any kind of commission pay on freight shipment whether in this form or in the form of fictitious damage or of a concession a free pass reduce passenger rate or payment of brokerage be illegal it be worth while consider whether it would not be wise to confer on the government the right of civil action against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the value of the rebate this would help stop what be really blackmail elevator allowance should be stop for they have now grow to such an extent that they be demoralize and be use as rebate the well possible regulation of rate would of course be that regulation secure by an honest agreement among the railroad themselves to carry out the law such a general agreement would for instance at once put a stop to the effort of any one big shipper or big railroad to discriminate against or secure advantage over some rival and such agreement would make the railroad themselves agent for enforce the law the power vest in the government to put a stop to agreement to the detriment of the public should in my judgment be accompany by power to permit under specify condition and careful supervision agreement clearly in the interest of the public but in my judgment the necessity for give this further power be by no mean as great as the necessity for give the commission or administrative body the other power i have enumerate above and it may well be inadvisable to attempt to vest this particular power in the commission or other administrative body until it already possess and be exercise what i regard as by far the most important of all the power i recommend as indeed the vitally important power that to fix a give maximum rate which rate after the lapse of a reasonable time go into full effect subject to review by the court all private car line industrial road refrigerator charge and the like should be expressly put under the supervision of the interstate commerce commission or some similar body so far as rate and agreement practically affect rate be concern the private car owner and the owner of industrial railroad be entitle to a fair and reasonable compensation on their investment but neither private car nor industrial railroad nor spur track should be utilize as device for secure preferential rate a rebate in ice charge or in mileage or in a division of the rate for refrigerate charge be just as pernicious as a rebate in any other way no low rate should apply on good import than actually obtain on domestic good from the american seaboard to destination except in case where water competition be the control influence there should be publicity of the account of common carrier no common carrier engage in interstate business should keep any book or memoranda other than those report pursuant to law or regulation and these book or memoranda should be open to the inspection of the government only in this way can violation or evasion of the law be surely detect a system of examination of railroad account should be provide similar to that now conduct into the national bank by the bank examiner a few first class railroad accountant if they have proper direction and proper authority to inspect book and paper could accomplish much in prevent willful violation of the law it would not be necessary for they to examine into the account of any railroad unless for good reason they be direct to do so by the interstate commerce commission it be greatly to be desire that some way might be find by which an agreement as to transportation within a state intend to operate as a fraud upon the federal interstate commerce law could be bring under the jurisdiction of the federal authority at present it occur that large shipment of interstate traffic be control by concession on purely state business which of course amount to an evasion of the law the commission should have power to enforce fair treatment by the great trunk line of lateral and branch line i urge upon the congress the need of provide for expeditious action by the interstate commerce commission in all these matter whether in regulate rate for transportation or for store or for handle property or commodity in transit the history of the case litigate under the present commerce act show that its efficacy have be to a great degree destroy by the weapon of delay almost the most formidable weapon in the hand of those whose purpose it be to violate the law let i most earnestly say that these recommendation be not make in any spirit of hostility to the railroad on ethical ground on ground of right such hostility would be intolerable and on ground of mere national self interest we must remember that such hostility would tell against the welfare not merely of some few rich man but of a multitude of small investor a multitude of railway employe wage worker and most severely against the interest of the public as a whole i believe that on the whole our railroad have do well and not ill but the railroad man who wish to do well should not be expose to competition with those who have no such desire and the only way to secure this end be to give to some government tribunal the power to see that justice be do by the unwilling exactly as it be gladly do by the willing moreover if some government body be give increase power the effect will be to furnish authoritative answer on behalf of the railroad whenever irrational clamor against it be raise or whenever charge make against it be disprove i ask this legislation not only in the interest of the public but in the interest of the honest railroad man and the honest shipper alike for it be they who be chiefly jeoparde by the practice of their dishonest competitor this legislation should be enact in a spirit as remote as possible from hysteria and rancor if we of the american body politic be true to the tradition we have inherit we shall always scorn any effort to make we hate any man because he be rich just as much as we should scorn any effort to make we look down upon or treat contemptuously any man because he be poor we judge a man by his conduct that be by his character and not by his wealth or intellect if he make his fortune honestly there be no just cause of quarrel with he indeed we have nothing but the kindliest feeling of admiration for the successful business man who behave decently whether he have make his success by build or manage a railroad or by ship good over that railroad the big railroad man and big shipper be simply americans of the ordinary type who have develop to an extraordinary degree certain great business quality they be neither well nor bad than their fellow citizen of small mean they be merely more able in certain line and therefore expose to certain peculiarly strong temptation these temptation have not spring newly into being the exceptionally successful among mankind have always be expose to they but they have grow amazingly in power as a result of the extraordinary development of industrialism along new line and under these new condition which the law maker of old could not foresee and therefore could not provide against they have become so serious and menacing as to demand entirely new remedy it be in the interest of the good type of railroad man and the good type of shipper no less than of the public that there should be governmental supervision and regulation of these great business operation for the same reason that it be in the interest of the corporation which wish to treat its employe aright that there should be an effective employers liability act or an effective system of factory law to prevent the abuse of woman and child all such legislation free the corporation that wish to do well from be drive into do ill in order to compete with its rival which prefer to do ill we desire to set up a moral standard there can be no delusion more fatal to the nation than the delusion that the standard of profit of business prosperity be sufficient in judge any business or political question from rate legislation to municipal government business success whether for the individual or for the nation be a good thing only so far as it be accompany by and develop a high standard of conduct honor integrity civic courage the kind of business prosperity that blunt the standard of honor that put an inordinate value on mere wealth that make a man ruthless and conscienceless in trade and weak and cowardly in citizenship be not a good thing at all but a very bad thing for the nation this government stand for manhood first and for business only as an adjunct of manhood the question of transportation lie at the root of all industrial success and the revolution in transportation which have take place during the last half century have be the most important factor in the growth of the new industrial condition most emphatically we do not wish to see the man of great talent refuse the reward for his talent still less do we wish to see he penalize but we do desire to see the system of railroad transportation so handle that the strong man shall be give no advantage over the weak man we wish to insure as fair treatment for the small town as for the big city for the small shipper as for the big shipper in the old day the highway of commerce whether by water or by a road on land be open to all it belong to the public and the traffic along it be free at present the railway be this highway and we must do our good to see that it be keep open to all on equal term unlike the old highway it be a very difficult and complex thing to manage and it be far well that it should be manage by private individual than by the government but it can only be so manage on condition that justice be do the public it be because in my judgment public ownership of railroad be highly undesirable and would probably in this country entail far reach disaster but i wish to see such supervision and regulation of they in the interest of the public as will make it evident that there be no need for public ownership the opponent of government regulation dwell upon the difficulty to be encounter and the intricate and involved nature of the problem their contention be true it be a complicated and delicate problem and all kind of difficulty be sure to arise in connection with any plan of solution while no plan will bring all the benefit hope for by its more optimistic adherent moreover under any healthy plan the benefit will develop gradually and not rapidly finally we must clearly understand that the public servant who be to do this peculiarly responsible and delicate work must themselves be of the high type both as regard integrity and efficiency they must be well pay for otherwise able man can not in the long run be secure and they must possess a lofty probity which will revolt as quickly at the thought of pander to any gust of popular prejudice against rich man as at the thought of anything even remotely resemble subserviency to rich man but while i fully admit the difficulty in the way i do not for a moment admit that these difficulty warrant we in stop in our effort to secure a wise and just system they should have no other effect than to spur we on to the exercise of the resolution the even handed justice and the fertility of resource which we like to think of as typically american and which will in the end achieve good result in this as in other field of activity the task be a great one and underlie the task of deal with the whole industrial problem but the fact that it be a great problem do not warrant we in shrink from the attempt to solve it at present we face such utter lack of supervision such freedom from the restraint of law that excellent man have often be literally force into do what they deplore because otherwise they be leave at the mercy of unscrupulous competitor to rail at and assail the man who have do as they good could under such condition accomplish little what we need to do be to develop an orderly system and such a system can only come through the gradually increase exercise of the right of efficient government control in my annual message to the fifty eighth congress at its third session i call attention to the necessity for legislation require the use of block signal upon railroad engage in interstate commerce the number of serious collision upon unblocked road that have occur within the past year add force to the recommendation then make the congress should provide by appropriate legislation for the introduction of block signal upon all railroad engage in interstate commerce at the early practicable date as a measure of increase safety to the travel public through decision of the supreme court of the united states and the low federal court in case bring before they for adjudication the safety appliance law have be materially strengthen and the government have be enable to secure its effective enforcement in almost all case with the result that the condition of railroad equipment throughout the country be much improve and railroad employe perform their duty under safe condition than heretofore the government 's most effective aid in arrive at this result have be its inspection service and that these improve condition be not more general be due to the insufficient number of inspector employ the inspection service have fully demonstrate its usefulness and in appropriating for its maintenance the congress should make provision for an increase in the number of inspector the excessive hour of labor to which railroad employe in train service be in many case subject be also a matter which may well engage the serious attention of the congress the strain both mental and physical upon those who be engage in the movement and operation of railroad train under modern condition be perhaps great than that which exist in any other industry and if there be any reason for limit by law the hour of labor in any employment they certainly apply with peculiar force to the employment of those upon whose vigilance and alertness in the performance of their duty the safety of all who travel by rail depend in my annual message to the fifty seventh congress at its second session i recommend the passage of an employer liability law for the district of columbia and in our navy yard i renew that recommendation in my message to the fifty eighth congress at its second session and far suggest the appointment of a commission to make a comprehensive study of employer liability with a view to the enactment of a wise and constitutional law cover the subject applicable to all industry within the scope of the federal power i hope that such a law will be prepare and enact as speedily as possible the national government have as a rule but little occasion to deal with the formidable group of problem connect more or less directly with what be know as the labor question for in the great majority of case these problem must be deal with by the state and municipal authority and not by the national government the national government have control of the district of columbia however and it should see to it that the city of washington be make a model city in all respect both as regard park public playground proper regulation of the system of housing so as to do away with the evil of alley tenement a proper system of education a proper system of deal with truancy and juvenile offender a proper handling of the charitable work of the district moreover there should be proper factory law to prevent all abuse in the employment of woman and child in the district these will be useful chiefly as object lesson but even this limited amount of usefulness would be of real national value there have be demand for deprive court of the power to issue injunction in labor dispute such special limitation of the equity power of our court would be most unwise it be true that some judge have misuse this power but this do not justify a denial of the power any more than an improper exercise of the power to call a strike by a labor leader would justify the denial of the right to strike the remedy be to regulate the procedure by require the judge to give due notice to the adverse party before grant the writ the hearing to be ex parte if the adverse party do not appear at the time and place order what be due notice must depend upon the fact of the case it should not be use as a pretext to permit violation of law or the jeopardizing of life or property of course this would not authorize the issuing of a restraining order or injunction in any case in which it be not already authorize by exist law i renew the recommendation i make in my last annual message for an investigation by the department of commerce and labor of general labor condition especial attention to be pay to the condition of child labor and child labor legislation in the several states such an investigation should take into account the various problem with which the question of child labor be connect it be true that these problem can be actually meet in most case only by the states themselves but it would be well for the nation to endeavor to secure and publish comprehensive information as to the condition of the labor of child in the different state so as to spur up those that be behindhand and to secure approximately uniform legislation of a high character among the several states in such a republic as ours the one thing that we can not afford to neglect be the problem of turn out decent citizen the future of the nation depend upon the citizenship of the generation to come the child of today be those who tomorrow will shape the destiny of our land and we can not afford to neglect they the legislature of colorado have recommend that the national government provide some general measure for the protection from abuse of child and dumb animal throughout the united states i lie the matter before you for what i trust will be your favorable consideration the department of commerce and labor should also make a thorough investigation of the condition of woman in industry over five million american woman be now engage in gainful occupation yet there be an almost complete dearth of datum upon which to base any trustworthy conclusion as regard a subject as important as it be vast and complicated there be need of full knowledge on which to base action look toward state and municipal legislation for the protection of work woman the introduction of woman into industry be work change and disturbance in the domestic and social life of the nation the decrease in marriage and especially in the birth rate have be coincident with it we must face accomplished fact and the adjustment of factory condition must be make but surely it can be make with less friction and less harmful effect on family life than be now the case this whole matter in reality form one of the great sociological phenomenon of our time it be a social question of the first importance of far great importance than any merely political or economic question can be and to solve it we need ample datum gather in a sane and scientific spirit in the course of an exhaustive investigation in any great labor disturbance not only be employer and employe interested but a third party the general public every considerable labor difficulty in which interstate commerce be involve should be investigate by the government and the fact officially report to the public the question of secure a healthy self respecting and mutually sympathetic attitude as between employer and employe capitalist and wage worker be a difficult one all phase of the labor problem prove difficult when approach but the underlie principle the root principle in accordance with which the problem must be solve be entirely simple we can get justice and right deal only if we put as of paramount importance the principle of treat a man on his worth as a man rather than with reference to his social position his occupation or the class to which he belong there be selfish and brutal man in all rank of life if they be capitalist their selfishness and brutality may take the form of hard indifference to suffering greedy disregard of every moral restraint which interfere with the accumulation of wealth and cold blooded exploitation of the weak or if they be laborer the form of laziness of sullen envy of the more fortunate and of willingness to perform deed of murderous violence such conduct be just as reprehensible in one case as in the other and all honest and farseee man should join in war against it wherever it become manifest individual capitalist and individual wage worker corporation and union be alike entitle to the protection of the law and must alike obey the law moreover in addition to mere obedience to the law each man if he be really a good citizen must show broad sympathy for his neighbor and genuine desire to look at any question arise between they from the standpoint of that neighbor no less than from his own and to this end it be essential that capitalist and wage worker should consult freely one with the other should each strive to bring close the day when both shall realize that they be properly partner and not enemy to approach the question which inevitably arise between they solely from the standpoint which treat each side in the mass as the enemy of the other side in the mass be both wicked and foolish in the past the most direful among the influence which have bring about the downfall of republic have ever be the growth of the class spirit the growth of the spirit which tend to make a man subordinate the welfare of the public as a whole to the welfare of the particular class to which he belong the substitution of loyalty to a class for loyalty to the nation this inevitably bring about a tendency to treat each man not on his merit as an individual but on his position as belong to a certain class in the community if such a spirit grow up in this republic it will ultimately prove fatal to we as in the past it have prove fatal to every community in which it have become dominant unless we continue to keep a quick and lively sense of the great fundamental truth that our concern be with the individual worth of the individual man this government can not permanently hold the place which it have achieve among the nation the vital line of cleavage among our people do not correspond and indeed run at right angle to the line of cleavage which divide occupation from occupation which divide wage worker from capitalist farmer from banker man of small mean from man of large mean man who live in the town from man who live in the country for the vital line of cleavage be the line which divide the honest man who try to do well by his neighbor from the dishonest man who do ill by his neighbor in other word the standard we should establish be the standard of conduct not the standard of occupation of mean or of social position it be the man 's moral quality his attitude toward the great question which concern all humanity his cleanliness of life his power to do his duty toward himself and toward other which really count and if we substitute for the standard of personal judgment which treat each man accord to his merit another standard in accordance with which all man of one class be favor and all man of another class discriminate against we shall do irreparable damage to the body politic i believe that our people be too sane too self respect too fit for self government ever to adopt such an attitude this government be not and never shall be government by a plutocracy this government be not and never shall be government by a mob it shall continue to be in the future what it have be in the past a government base on the theory that each man rich or poor be to be treat simply and solely on his worth as a man that all his personal and property right be to be safeguard and that he be neither to wrong other nor to suffer wrong from other the noblest of all form of government be self government but it be also the most difficult we who possess this priceless boon and who desire to hand it on to our child and our child 's child should ever bear in mind the thought so finely express by burke man be qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chain upon their own appetite in proportion as they be disposed to listen to the counsel of the wise and good in preference to the flattery of knave society can not exist unless a control power upon will and appetite be place somewhere and the less of it there be within the more there must be without it be ordain in the eternal constitution of thing that man of intemperate mind can not be free their passion forge their fetter "the great insurance company afford strike example of corporation whose business have extend so far beyond the jurisdiction of the states which create they as to preclude strict enforcement of supervision and regulation by the parent states in my last annual message i recommend that the congress carefully consider whether the power of the bureau of corporations can not constitutionally be extend to cover interstate transaction in insurance "recent event have emphasize the importance of an early and exhaustive consideration of this question to see whether it be not possible to furnish well safeguard than the several states have be able to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which have be expose it have be only too clearly show that certain of the man at the head of these large corporation take but small note of the ethical distinction between honesty and dishonesty they draw the line only this side of what may be call law honesty the kind of honesty necessary in order to avoid fall into the clutch of the law of course the only complete remedy for this condition must be find in an arouse public conscience a high sense of ethical conduct in the community at large and especially among business man and in the great profession of the law and in the growth of a spirit which condemn all dishonesty whether in rich man or in poor man whether it take the shape of bribery or of blackmail but much can be do by legislation which be not only drastic but practical there be need of a far strict and more uniform regulation of the vast insurance interest of this country the united states should in this respect follow the policy of other nation by provide adequate national supervision of commercial interest which be clearly national in character my predecessor have repeatedly recognize that the foreign business of these company be an important part of our foreign commercial relation during the administration of presidents cleveland harrison and mckinley the state department exercise its influence through diplomatic channel to prevent unjust discrimination by foreign country against american insurance company these negotiation illustrate the propriety of the congress recognize the national character of insurance for in the absence of federal legislation the state department could only give expression to the wish of the authority of the several states whose policy be ineffective through want of uniformity i repeat my previous recommendation that the congress should also consider whether the federal government have any power or owe any duty with respect to domestic transaction in insurance of an interstate character that state supervision have prove inadequate be generally concede the burden upon insurance company and therefore their policy holder of conflicting regulation of many states be unquestione while but little effective check be impose upon any able and unscrupulous man who desire to exploit the company in his own interest at the expense of the policy holder and of the public the inability of a state to regulate effectively insurance corporation create under the law of other states and transact the large part of their business elsewhere be also clear as a remedy for this evil of conflicting ineffective and yet burdensome regulation there have be for many year a widespread demand for federal supervision the congress have already recognize that interstate insurance may be a proper subject for federal legislation for in create the bureau of corporations it authorize it to publish and supply useful information concern interstate corporation include corporation engage in insurance it be obvious that if the compilation of statistic be the limit of the federal power it be wholly ineffective to regulate this form of commercial intercourse between the states and as the insurance business have outgrow in magnitude the possibility of adequate state supervision the congress should carefully consider whether further legislation can be bad what be say above apply with equal force to fraternal and benevolent organization which contract for life insurance there be more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an ideal perfection in the method of raise revenue and the shock and strain to the business world certain to attend any serious change in these method render such change inadvisable unless for grave reason it be not possible to lay down any general rule by which to determine the moment when the reason for will outweigh the reason against such a change much must depend not merely on the need but on the desire of the people as a whole for need and desire be not necessarily identical of course no change can be make on line beneficial to or desire by one section or one state only there must be something like a general agreement among the citizen of the several states as represent in the congress that the change be need and desire in the interest of the people as a whole and there should then be a sincere intelligent and disinterested effort to make it in such shape as will combine so far as possible the maximum of good to the people at large with the minimum of necessary disregard for the special interest of locality or class but in time of peace the revenue must on the average take a series of year together equal the expenditure or else the revenue must be increase last year there be a deficit unless our expenditure can be keep within the revenue then our revenue law must be readjust it be as yet too early to attempt to outline what shape such a readjustment should take for it be as yet too early to say whether there will be need for it it should be consider whether it be not desirable that the tariff law should provide for apply as against or in favor of any other nation maximum and minimum tariff rate establish by the congress so as to secure a certain reciprocity of treatment between other nation and ourselves have in view even large consideration of policy than those of a purely economic nature it would in my judgment be well to endeavor to bring about close commercial connection with the other people of this continent i be happy to be able to announce to you that russia now treat we on the most favor nation basis i earnestly recommend to congress the need of economy and to this end of a rigid scrutiny of appropriation as example merely i call your attention to one or two specific matter all unnecessary office should be abolish the commissioner of the general land office recommend the abolishment of the office of receiver of public moneys for the united states land office this will effect a saving of about a quarter of a million dollar a year as the business of the nation grow it be inevitable that there should be from time to time a legitimate increase in the number of official and this fact render it all the more important that when office become unnecessary they should be abolish in the public printing also a large saving of public money can be make there be a constantly grow tendency to publish masse of unimportant information it be probably not unfair to say that many ten of thousand of volume be publish at which no human be ever look and for which there be no real demand whatever yet in speak of economy i must in no wise be understand as advocate the false economy which be in the end the bad extravagance to cut down on the navy for instance would be a crime against the nation to fail to push forward all work on the panama canal would be as great a folly in my message of december 2 1902 to the congress i said:"inter rate be a potent factor in business activity and in order that these rate may be equalize to meet the vary need of the season and of widely separate community and to prevent the recurrence of financial stringency which injuriously affect legitimate business it be necessary that there should be an element of elasticity in our monetary system bank be the natural servant of commerce and upon they should be place as far as practicable the burden of furnish and maintain a circulation adequate to supply the need of our diversify industry and of our domestic and foreign commerce and the issue of this should be so regulated that a sufficient supply should be always available for the business interest of the country "every consideration of prudence demand the addition of the element of elasticity to our currency system the evil do not consist in an inadequate volume of money but in the rigidity of this volume which do not respond as it should to the vary need of community and of season inflation must be avoid but some provision should be make that will insure a large volume of money during the fall and winter month than in the less active season of the year so that the currency will contract against speculation and will expand for the need of legitimate business at present the treasury department be at irregularly recur interval oblige in the interest of the business world that be in the interest of the american public to try to avert financial crisis by provide a remedy which should be provide by congressional action at various time i have institute investigation into the organization and conduct of the business of the executive department while none of these inquiry have yet progress far enough to warrant final conclusion they have already confirm and emphasize the general impression that the organization of the department be often faulty in principle and wasteful in result while many of their business method be antiquated and inefficient there be every reason why our executive governmental machinery should be at least as well plan economical and efficient as the good machinery of the great business organization which at present be not the case to make it so be a task of complex detail and essentially executive in its nature probably no legislative body no matter how wise and able could undertake it with reasonable prospect of success i recommend that the congress consider this subject with a view to provide by legislation for the transfer distribution consolidation and assignment of duty and executive organization or part of organization and for the change in business method within or between the several department that will well promote the economy efficiency and high character of the government work in my last annual message i said:"the power of the government to protect the integrity of the election of its own official be inherent and have be recognize and affirm by repeat declaration of the supreme court there be no enemy of free government more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption of the electorate no one defend or excuse corruption and it would seem to follow that none would oppose vigorous measure to eradicate it i recommend the enactment of a law direct against bribery and corruption in federal election the detail of such a law may be safely leave to the wise discretion of the congress but it should go as far as under the constitution it be possible to go and should include severe penalty against he who give or receive a bribe intend to influence his act or opinion as an elector and provision for the publication not only of the expenditure for nomination and election of all candidate but also of all contribution receive and expenditure make by political committee "i desire to repeat this recommendation in political campaign in a country as large and populous as ours it be inevitable that there should be much expense of an entirely legitimate kind this of course mean that many contribution and some of they of large size must be make and as a matter of fact in any big political contest such contribution be always make to both side it be entirely proper both to give and receive they unless there be an improper motive connect with either gift or reception if they be extort by any kind of pressure or promise express or imply direct or indirect in the way of favor or immunity then the giving or receiving become not only improper but criminal it will undoubtedly be difficult as a matter of practical detail to shape an act which shall guard with reasonable certainty against such misconduct but if it be possible to secure by law the full and verified publication in detail of all the sum contribute to and expend by the candidate or committee of any political party the result can not but be wholesome all contribution by corporation to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbid by law director should not be permit to use stockholder money for such purpose and moreover a prohibition of this kind would be as far as it go an effective method of stop the evil aim at in corrupt practice act not only should both the national and the several state legislatures forbid any officer of a corporation from use the money of the corporation in or about any election but they should also forbid such use of money in connection with any legislation save by the employment of counsel in public manner for distinctly legal service the first conference of nation hold at the hague in 1899 be unable to dispose of all the business before it recommend the consideration and settlement of a number of important question by another conference to be call subsequently and at an early date these question be the follow 1 the right and duty of neutral 2 the limitation of the armed force on land and sea and of military budget 3 the use of new type and calibre of military and naval gun 4 the inviolability of private property at sea in time of war 5 the bombardment of port city and village by naval force in october 1904 at the instance of the interparliamentary union which at a conference hold in the united states and attend by the lawmaker of fifteen different nation have reiterate the demand for a second conference of nation i issue invitation to all the power signatory to the hague convention to send delegate to such a conference and suggest that it be again hold at the hague in its note of december 16 1904 the united states government communicate to the representative of foreign government its belief that the conference could be well arrange under the provision of the present hague treaty from all the power acceptance be receive couple in some case with the condition that we should wait until the end of the war then wage between russia and japan the emperor of russia immediately after the treaty of peace which so happily terminate this war in a note present to the president on september 13 through ambassador rosen take the initiative in recommend that the conference be now call the united states government in response express its cordial acquiescence and state that it would as a matter of course take part in the new conference and endeavor to further its aim we assume that all civilized government will support the movement and that the conference be now an assured fact this government will do everything in its power to secure the success of the conference to the end that substantial progress may be make in the cause of international peace justice and good will this render it proper at this time to say something as to the general attitude of this government toward peace more and more war be come to be look upon as in itself a lamentable and evil thing a wanton or useless war or a war of mere aggression in short any war begin or carry on in a conscienceless spirit be to be condemn as a peculiarly atrocious crime against all humanity we can however do nothing of permanent value for peace unless we keep ever clearly in mind the ethical element which lie at the root of the problem our aim be righteousness peace be normally the hand maiden of rightousness but when peace and righteousness conflict then a great and upright people can never for a moment hesitate to follow the path which lead toward righteousness even though that path also lead to war there be person who advocate peace at any price there be other who follow a false analogy think that because it be no long necessary in civilized country for individual to protect their right with a strong hand it be therefore unnecessary for nation to be ready to defend their right these person would do irreparable harm to any nation that adopt their principle and even as it be they seriously hamper the cause which they advocate by tend to render it absurd in the eye of sensible and patriotic man there can be no bad foe of mankind in general and of his own country in particular than the demagogue of war the man who in mere folly or to serve his own selfish end continually rail at and abuse other nation who seek to excite his countryman against foreigner on insufficient pretext who excite and inflame a perverse and aggressive national vanity and who may on occasion wantonly bring on conflict between his nation and some other nation but there be demagogue of peace just as there be demagogue of war and in any such movement as this for the hague conference it be essential not to be mislead by one set of extremist any more than by the other whenever it be possible for a nation or an individual to work for real peace assuredly it be failure of duty not so to strive but if war be necessary and righteous then either the man or the nation shrink from it forfeit all title to self respect we have scant sympathy with the sentimentalist who dread oppression less than physical suffering who would prefer a shameful peace to the pain and toil sometimes lamentably necessary in order to secure a righteous peace as yet there be only a partial and imperfect analogy between international law and internal or municipal law because there be no sanction of force for execute the former while there be in the case of the latter the private citizen be protect in his right by the law because the law rest in the last resort upon force exercise through the form of law a man do not have to defend his right with his own hand because he can call upon the police upon the sheriff 's posse upon the militia or in certain extreme case upon the army to defend he but there be no such sanction of force for international law at present there could be no great calamity than for the free people the enlighten independent and peace love people to disarm while yet leave it open to any barbarism or despotism to remain armed so long as the world be as unorganized as now the army and navy of those people who on the whole stand for justice offer not only the good but the only possible security for a just peace for instance if the united states alone or in company only with the other nation that on the whole tend to act justly disarm we might sometimes avoid bloodshed but we would cease to be of weight in secure the peace of justice the real peace for which the most law abide and high minded man must at time be willing to fight as the world be now only that nation be equip for peace that know how to fight and that will not shrink from fight if ever the condition become such that war be demand in the name of the high morality so much it be emphatically necessary to say in order both that the position of the united states may not be misunderstood and that a genuine effort to bring near the day of the peace of justice among the nation may not be hamper by a folly which in strive to achieve the impossible would render it hopeless to attempt the achievement of the practical but while recognize most clearly all above set forth it remain our clear duty to strive in every practicable way to bring near the time when the sword shall not be the arbiter among nation at present the practical thing to do be to try to minimize the number of case in which it must be the arbiter and to offer at least to all civilized power some substitute for war which will be available in at least a considerable number of instance very much can be do through another hague conference in this direction and i most earnestly urge that this nation do all in its power to try to further the movement and to make the result of the decision of the hague conference effective i earnestly hope that the conference may be able to devise some way to make arbitration between nation the customary way of settle international dispute in all save a few class of case which should themselves be as sharply define and rigidly limit as the present governmental and social development of the world will permit if possible there should be a general arbitration treaty negotiate among all the nation represent at the conference neutral right and property should be protect at sea as they be protect on land there should be an international agreement to this purpose and a similar agreement define contraband of war during the last century there have be a distinct diminution in the number of war between the most civilized nation international relation have become close and the development of the hague tribunal be not only a symptom of this grow closeness of relationship but be a means by which the growth can be further our aim should be from time to time to take such step as may be possible toward create something like an organization of the civilized nation because as the world become more highly organized the need for navy and army will diminish it be not possible to secure anything like an immediate disarmament because it would first be necessary to settle what people be on the whole a menace to the rest of mankind and to provide against the disarmament of the rest being turn into a movement which would really chiefly benefit these obnoxious people but it may be possible to exercise some check upon the tendency to swell indefinitely the budget for military expenditure of course such an effort could succeed only if it do not attempt to do too much and if it be undertake in a spirit of sanity as far remove as possible from a merely hysterical pseudo philanthropy it be worth while point out that since the end of the insurrection in the philippines this nation have show its practical faith in the policy of disarmament by reduce its little army one third but disarmament can never be of prime importance there be more need to get rid of the cause of war than of the implement of war i have dwell much on the danger to be avoid by steer clear of any mere foolish sentimentality because my wish for peace be so genuine and earnest because i have a real and great desire that this second hague conference may mark a long stride forward in the direction of secure the peace of justice throughout the world no object be well worthy the attention of enlighten statesmanship than the establishment of a surer method than now exist of secure justice as between nation both for the protection of the little nation and for the prevention of war between the big nation to this aim we should endeavor not only to avert bloodshed but above all effectively to strengthen the force of right the golden rule should be and as the world grow in morality it will be the guide rule of conduct among nation as among individual though the golden rule must not be construe in fantastic manner as forbid the exercise of the police power this mighty and free republic should ever deal with all other states great or small on a basis of high honor respect their right as jealously as it safeguard its own one of the most effective instrument for peace be the monroe doctrine as it have be and be be gradually develop by this nation and accept by other nation no other policy could have be as efficient in promote peace in the western hemisphere and in give to each nation thereon the chance to develop along its own line if we have refuse to apply the doctrine to change condition it would now be completely outwear would not meet any of the need of the present day and indeed would probably by this time have sink into complete oblivion it be useful at home and be meet with recognition abroad because we have adapt our application of it to meet the grow and change need of the hemisphere when we announce a policy such as the monroe doctrine we thereby commit ourselves to the consequence of the policy and those consequence from time to time alter it be out of the question to claim a right and yet shirk the responsibility for its exercise not only we but all american republic who be benefit by the existence of the doctrine must recognize the obligation each nation be under as regard foreign people no less than its duty to insist upon its own right that our right and interest be deeply concerned in the maintenance of the doctrine be so clear as hardly to need argument this be especially true in view of the construction of the panama canal as a mere matter of self defense we must exercise a close watch over the approach to this canal and this mean that we must be thoroughly alive to our interest in the caribbean sea there be certain essential point which must never be forget as regard the monroe doctrine in the first place we must as a nation make it evident that we do not intend to treat it in any shape or way as an excuse for aggrandizement on our part at the expense of the republic to the south we must recognize the fact that in some south american country there have be much suspicion lest we should interpret the monroe doctrine as in some way inimical to their interest and we must try to convince all the other nation of this continent once and for all that no just and orderly government have anything to fear from we there be certain republic to the south of we which have already reach such a point of stability order and prosperity that they themselves though as yet hardly consciously be among the guarantor of this doctrine these republic we now meet not only on a basis of entire equality but in a spirit of frank and respectful friendship which we hope be mutual if all of the republic to the south of we will only grow as those to which i allude have already grow all need for we to be the especial champion of the doctrine will disappear for no stable and grow american republic wish to see some great non american military power acquire territory in its neighborhood all that this country desire be that the other republic on this continent shall be happy and prosperous and they can not be happy and prosperous unless they maintain order within their boundary and behave with a just regard for their obligation toward outsider it must be understand that under no circumstance will the united states use the monroe doctrine as a cloak for territorial aggression we desire peace with all the world but perhaps most of all with the other people of the american continent there be of course limit to the wrong which any self respect nation can endure it be always possible that wrong action toward this nation or toward citizen of this nation in some state unable to keep order among its own people unable to secure justice from outsider and unwilling to do justice to those outsider who treat it well may result in our have to take action to protect our right but such action will not be take with a view to territorial aggression and it will be take at all only with extreme reluctance and when it have become evident that every other resource have be exhaust moreover we must make it evident that we do not intend to permit the monroe doctrine to be use by any nation on this continent as a shield to protect it from the consequence of its own misdeed against foreign nation if a republic to the south of we commit a tort against a foreign nation such as an outrage against a citizen of that nation then the monroe doctrine do not force we to interfere to prevent punishment of the tort save to see that the punishment do not assume the form of territorial occupation in any shape the case be more difficult when it refer to a contractual obligation our own government have always refuse to enforce such contractual obligation on behalf of its citizen by an appeal to arm it be much to be wish that all foreign government would take the same view but they do not and in consequence we be liable at any time to be bring face to face with disagreeable alternative on the one hand this country would certainly decline to go to war to prevent a foreign government from collect a just debt on the other hand it be very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to take possession even temporarily of the custom house of an american republic in order to enforce the payment of its obligation for such temporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation the only escape from these alternative may at any time be that we must ourselves undertake to bring about some arrangement by which so much as possible of a just obligation shall be pay it be far well that this country should put through such an arrangement rather than allow any foreign country to undertake it to do so insure the default republic from have to pay debt of an improper character under duress while it also insure honest creditor of the republic from be pass by in the interest of dishonest or grasp creditor moreover for the united states to take such a position offer the only possible way of insure we against a clash with some foreign power the position be therefore in the interest of peace as well as in the interest of justice it be of benefit to our people it be of benefit to foreign people and most of all it be really of benefit to the people of the country concern this bring i to what should be one of the fundamental object of the monroe doctrine we must ourselves in good faith try to help upward toward peace and order those of our sister republic which need such help just as there have be a gradual growth of the ethical element in the relation of one individual to another so we be even though slowly more and more come to recognize the duty of bear one another 's burden not only as among individual but also as among nation santo domingo in her turn have now make an appeal to we to help she and not only every principle of wisdom but every generous instinct within we bid we respond to the appeal it be not of the slight consequence whether we grant the aid need by santo domingo as an incident to the wise development of the monroe doctrine or because we regard the case of santo domingo as stand wholly by itself and to be treat as such and not on general principle or with any reference to the monroe doctrine the important point be to give the need aid and the case be certainly sufficiently peculiar to deserve to be judge purely on its own merit the condition in santo domingo have for a number of year grow from bad to bad until a year ago all society be on the verge of dissolution fortunately just at this time a ruler spring up in santo domingo who with his colleague see the danger threaten their country and appeal to the friendship of the only great and powerful neighbor who possess the power and as they hope also the will to help they there be imminent danger of foreign intervention the previous ruler of santo domingo have recklessly incur debt and owe to her internal disorder she have cease to be able to provide mean of pay the debt the patience of her foreign creditor have become exhausted and at least two foreign nation be on the point of intervention and be only prevent from intervene by the unofficial assurance of this government that it would itself strive to help santo domingo in her hour of need in the case of one of these nation only the actual opening of negotiation to this end by our government prevent the seizure of territory in santo domingo by a european power of the debt incur some be just while some be not of a character which really render it obligatory on or proper for santo domingo to pay they in full but she could not pay any of they unless some stability be assure her government and people accordingly the executive department of our government negotiate a treaty under which we be to try to help the dominican people to straighten out their finance this treaty be pende before the senate in the meantime a temporary arrangement have be make which will last until the senate have have time to take action upon the treaty under this arrangement the dominican government have appoint americans to all the important position in the custom service and they be see to the honest collection of the revenue turn over 45 per cent to the government for run expense and put the other 55 per cent into a safe depository for equitable division in case the treaty shall be ratify among the various creditor whether european or american the custom houses offer well nigh the only source of revenue in santo domingo and the different revolution usually have as their real aim the obtaining of these custom houses the mere fact that the collector of customs be americans that they be perform their duty with efficiency and honesty and that the treaty be pende in the senate give a certain moral power to the government of santo domingo which it have not have before this have completely discourage all revolutionary movement while it have already produce such an increase in the revenue that the government be actually get more from the 45 per cent that the american collectors turn over to it than it get formerly when it take the entire revenue it be enable the poor harass people of santo domingo once more to turn their attention to industry and to be free from the cure of interminable revolutionary disturbance it offer to all bona fide creditor american and european the only really good chance to obtain that to which they be justly entitle while it in return give to santo domingo the only opportunity of defense against claim which it ought not to pay for now if it meet the view of the senate we shall ourselves thoroughly examine all these claim whether american or foreign and see that none that be improper be pay there be of course opposition to the treaty from dishonest creditor foreign and american and from the professional revolutionist of the island itself we have already reason to believe that some of the creditor who do not dare expose their claim to honest scrutiny be endeavor to stir up sedition in the island and opposition to the treaty in the meantime i have exercise the authority vest in i by the joint resolution of the congress to prevent the introduction of arm into the island for revolutionary purpose under the course take stability and order and all the benefit of peace be at last come to santo domingo danger of foreign intervention have be suspend and there be at last a prospect that all creditor will get justice no more and no less if the arrangement be terminate by the failure of the treaty chaos will follow and if chaos follow soon or later this government may be involve in serious difficulty with foreign government over the island or else may be force itself to intervene in the island in some unpleasant fashion under the propose treaty the independence of the island be scrupulously respect the danger of violation of the monroe doctrine by the intervention of foreign power vanishe and the interference of our government be minimize so that we shall only act in conjunction with the santo domingo authority to secure the proper administration of the custom and therefore to secure the payment of just debt and to secure the dominican government against demand for unjust debt the propose method will give the people of santo domingo the same chance to move onward and upward which we have already give to the people of cuba it will be doubly to our discredit as a nation if we fail to take advantage of this chance for it will be of damage to ourselves and it will be of incalculable damage to santo domingo every consideration of wise policy and above all every consideration of large generosity bid we meet the request of santo domingo as we be now try to meet it we can not consider the question of our foreign policy without at the same time treat of the army and the navy we now have a very small army indeed one well nigh infinitesimal when compare with the army of any other large nation of course the army we do have should be as nearly perfect of its kind and for its size as be possible i do not believe that any army in the world have a well average of enlisted man or a well type of junior officer but the army should be train to act effectively in a mass provision should be make by sufficient appropriation for manoeuver of a practical kind so that the troop may learn how to take care of themselves under actual service condition every march for instance be make with the soldier load exactly as he would be in active campaign the generals and colonels would thereby have opportunity of handle regiment brigade and division and the commissary and medical department would be test in the field provision should be make for the exercise at least of a brigade and by preference of a division in marching and embark at some point on our coast and disembark at some other point and continue its march the number of post in which the army be keep in time of peace should be materially diminish and the post that be leave make correspondingly large no local interest should be allow to stand in the way of assemble the great part of the troop which would at need form our field army in station of such size as will permit the good training to be give to the personnel of all grade include the high officer and staff officer to accomplish this end we must have not company or regimental garrison but brigade and division garrison promotion by mere seniority can never result in a thoroughly efficient corp of officer in the high rank unless there accompany it a vigorous weed out process such a weed out process that be such a process of selection be a chief feature of the four year course of the young officer at west point there be no good reason why it should stop immediately upon his graduation while at west point he be drop unless he come up to a certain standard of excellence and when he graduate he take rank in the army accord to his rank of graduation the result be good at west point and there should be in the army itself something that will achieve the same end after a certain age have be reach the average officer be unfit to do good work below a certain grade provision should be make for the promotion of exceptionally meritorious man over the head of their comrade and for the retirement of all man who have reach a give age without get beyond a give rank this age of retirement of course change from rank to rank in both the army and the navy there should be some principle of selection that be of promotion for merit and there should be a resolute effort to eliminate the aged officer of reputable character who possess no special efficiency there should be an increase in the coast artillery force so that our coast fortification can be in some degree adequately man there be special need for an increase and reorganization of the medical department of the army in both the army and navy there must be the same thorough training for duty in the staff corps as in the fight line only by such training in advance can we be sure that in actual war field operation and those at sea will be carry on successfully the importance of this be show conclusively in the spanish american and the russo japanese war the work of the medical department in the japanese army and navy be especially worthy of study i renew my recommendation of january 9 1905 as to the medical department of the army and call attention to the equal importance of the need of the staff corps of the navy in the medical department of the navy the first in importance be the reorganization of the hospital corps on the line of the gallinger bill s. 3,984 february 1 1904 and the reapportionment of the different grade of the medical officer to meet service requirement it seem advisable also that medical officer of the army and navy should have similar rank and pay in their respective grade so that their duty can be carry on without friction when they be bring together the base hospital of the navy should be put in condition to meet modern requirement and hospital ship be provide unless we now provide with ample forethought for the medical need of the army and navy appal suffering of a preventable kind be sure to occur if ever the country go to war it be not reasonable to expect successful administration in time of war of a department which lack a third of the number of officer necessary to perform the medical service in time of peace we need man who be not merely doctor they must be train in the administration of military medical service our navy must relatively to the navy of other nation always be of great size than our army we have most wisely continue for a number of year to build up our navy and it have now reach a fairly high standard of efficiency this standard of efficiency must not only be maintain but increase it do not seem to be necessary however that the navy should at least in the immediate future be increase beyond the present number of unit what be now clearly necessary be to substitute efficient for inefficient unit as the latter become wear out or as it become apparent that they be useless probably the result would be attain by add a single battleship to our navy each year the superseded or outworn vessel be lay up or break up as they be thus replace the four single turret monitor build immediately after the close of the spanish war for instance be vessel which would be of but little use in the event of war the money spend upon they could have be more usefully spend in other way thus it would have be far well never to have build a single one of these monitor and to have put the money into an ample supply of reserve gun most of the small cruiser and gunboat though they serve a useful purpose so far as they be need for international police work would not add to the strength of our navy in a conflict with a serious foe there be urgent need of provide a large increase in the number of officer and especially in the number of enlisted man recent naval history have emphasize certain lesson which ought not to but which do need emphasis seagoe torpedo boat or destroyer be indispensable not only for make night attack by surprise upon an enemy but even in battle for finish already crippled ship under exceptional circumstance submarine boat would doubtless be of use fast scout be need the main strength of the navy however lie and can only lie in the great battleship the heavily armor heavily gun vessel which decide the mastery of the sea heavy armed cruiser also play a most useful part and unarmed cruiser if swift enough be very useful as scout between antagonist of approximately equal prowess the comparative perfection of the instrument of war will ordinarily determine the fight but it be of course true that the man behind the gun the man in the engine room and the man in the con tower consider not only individually but especially with regard to the way in which they work together be even more important than the weapon with which they work the most formidable battleship be of course helpless against even a light cruiser if the man aboard it be unable to hit anything with their gun and thoroughly well handle cruiser may count seriously in an engagement with much superior vessel if the man aboard the latter be ineffective whether from lack of training or from any other cause modern warship be most formidable mechanism when well handle but they be utterly useless when not well handle and they can not be handle at all without long and careful training this training can under no circumstance be give when once war have break out no fighting ship of the first class should ever be lay up save for necessary repair and her crew should be keep constantly exercise on the high sea so that she may stand at the high point of perfection to put a new and untrained crew upon the most powerful battleship and send it out to meet a formidable enemy be not only to invite but to insure disaster and disgrace to improvise crew at the outbreak of a war so far as the serious fighting craft be concern be absolutely hopeless if the officer and man be not thoroughly skilled in and have not be thoroughly train to their duty it would be far well to keep the ship in port during hostility than to send they against a formidable opponent for the result could only be that they would be either sink or capture the marksmanship of our navy be now on the whole in a gratifying condition and there have be a great improvement in fleet practice we need additional seaman we need a large store of reserve gun we need sufficient money for ample target practice ample practice of every kind at sea we should substitute for comparatively inefficient type the old third class battleship texas the single turrete monitor above mention and indeed all the monitor and some of the old cruiser efficient modern seagoe vessel seagoe torpedo boat destroyer should be substitute for some of the small torpedo boat during the present congress there need be no addition to the aggregate number of unit of the navy our navy though very small relatively to the navy of other nation be for the present sufficient in point of number for our need and while we must constantly strive to make its efficiency high there need be no addition to the total of ship now build and build save in the way of substitution as above outline i recommend the report of the secretary of the navy to the careful consideration of the congress especially with a view to the legislation therein advocate during the past year evidence have accumulate to confirm the expression contain in my last two annual message as to the importance of revise by appropriate legislation our system of naturalize alien i appoint last march a commission to make a careful examination of our naturalization law and to suggest appropriate measure to avoid the notorious abuse result from the improvident of unlawful granting of citizenship this commission compose of an officer of the department of state of the department of justice and of the department of commerce and labor have discharge the duty impose upon it and have submit a report which will be transmit to the congress for its consideration and i hope for its favor able action the distinguish recommendation of the commission be first a federal bureau of naturalization to be establish in the department of commerce and labor to supervise the administration of the naturalization law and to receive return of naturalization pende and accomplish second uniformity of naturalization certificate fee to be charge and procedure third more exact qualification for citizenship fourth the preliminary declaration of intention to be abolish and no alien to be naturalize until at least ninety day after the filing of his petition fifth jurisdiction to naturalize alien to be confine to united states district court and to such state court as have jurisdiction in civil action in which the amount in controversy be unlimited in city of over 100,000 inhabitant the united states district court to have exclusive jurisdiction in the naturalization of the alien resident of such city in my last message i ask the attention of the congress to the urgent need of action to make our criminal law more effective and i most earnestly request that you pay heed to the report of the attorney general on this subject century ago it be especially needful to throw every safeguard round the accuse the danger then be lest he should be wrong by the state the danger be now exactly the reverse our law and custom tell immensely in favor of the criminal and against the interest of the public he have wrong some antiquated and outworn rule which once safeguard the threaten right of private citizen now merely work harm to the general body politic the criminal law of the united states stand in urgent need of revision the criminal process of any court of the united states should run throughout the entire territorial extent of our country the delay of the criminal law no less than of the civil now amount to a very great evil there seem to be no statute of the united states which provide for the punishment of a united states attorney or other officer of the government who corruptly agree to wrongfully do or wrongfully refrain from do any act when the consideration for such corrupt agreement be other than one possess money value this ought to be remedie by appropriate legislation legislation should also be enact to cover explicitly unequivocally and beyond question breach of trust in the shape of prematurely divulge official secret by an officer or employe of the united states and to provide a suitable penalty therefor such officer or employe owe the duty to the united states to guard carefully and not to divulge or in any manner use prematurely information which be accessible to the officer or employe by reason of his official position most breach of public trust be already cover by the law and this one should be it be impossible no matter how much care be use to prevent the occasional appointment to the public service of a man who when tempt prove unfaithful but every mean should be provide to detect and every effort make to punish the wrongdoer so far as in my power see each and every such wrongdoer shall be relentlessly hunt down in no instance in the past have he be spare in no instance in the future shall he be spare his crime be a crime against every honest man in the nation for it be a crime against the whole body politic yet in dwell on such misdeed it be unjust not to add that they be altogether exceptional and that on the whole the employe of the government render upright and faithful service to the people there be exception notably in one or two branch of the service but at no time in the nation 's history have the public service of the nation take as a whole stand on a high plane than now alike as regard honesty and as regard efficiency once again i call your attention to the condition of the public land law recent development have give new urgency to the need for such change as will fit these law to actual present condition the honest disposal and right use of the remain public land be of fundamental importance the iniquitous method by which the monopolizing of the public land be be bring about under the present law be become more generally know but the exist law do not furnish effective remedy the recommendation of the public lands commission upon this subject be wise and should be give effect the creation of small irrigated farm under the reclamation act be a powerful offset to the tendency of certain other law to foster or permit monopoly of the land under that act the construction of great irrigation work have be proceed rapidly and successfully the land reclaim be eagerly take up and the prospect that the policy of national irrigation will accomplish all that be expect of it be bright the act should be extend to include the state of texas the reclamation act derive much of its value from the fact that it tend to secure the great possible number of home on the land and to create community of freeholder in part by settlement on public land in part by force the subdivision of large private holding before they can get water from government irrigation work the law require that no right to the use of water for land in private ownership shall be sell for a tract exceed 160 acre to any one land owner this provision have excite active and powerful hostility but the success of the law itself depend on the wise and firm enforcement of it we can not afford to substitute tenant for freeholder on the public domain the great part of the remain public land can not be irrigate they be at present and will probably always be of great value for graze than for any other purpose this fact have lead to the graze homestead of 640 acre in nebraska and to the propose extension of it to other states it be argue that a family can not be support on 160 acre of arid grazing land this be obviously true but neither can a family be support on 640 acre of much of the land to which it be propose to apply the graze homestead to establish universally any such arbitrary limit would be unwise at the present time it would probably result on the one hand in enlarge the holding of some of the great land owner and on the other in needless suffering and failure on the part of a very considerable proportion of the bona fide settler who give faith to the imply assurance of the government that such an area be sufficient the good use of the public graze land require the careful examination and classification of these land in order to give each settler land enough to support his family and no more while this work be be do and until the land be settle the government should take control of the open range under reasonable regulation suit to local need follow the general policy already in successful operation on the forest reserve it be probable that the present grazing value of the open public range be scarcely more than half what it once be or what it might easily be again under careful regulation the forest policy of the administration appear to enjoy the unbroken support of the people the great user of timber be themselves forward the movement for forest preservation all organized opposition to the forest preserve in the west have disappear since the consolidation of all government forest work in the national forest service there have be a rapid and notable gain in the usefulness of the forest reserve to the people and in public appreciation of their value the national park within or adjacent to forest reserve should be transfer to the charge of the forest service also the national government already do something in connection with the construction and maintenance of the great system of levee along the low course of the mississippi in my judgment it should do much more to the spread of our trade in peace and the defense of our flag in war a great and prosperous merchant marine be indispensable we should have ship of our own and seaman of our own to convey our good to neutral market and in case of need to reinforce our battle line it can not but be a source of regret and uneasiness to we that the line of communication with our sister republic of south america should be chiefly under foreign control it be not a good thing that american merchant and manufacturer should have to send their good and letter to south america via europe if they wish security and dispatch even on the pacific where our ship have hold their own well than on the atlantic our merchant flag be now threaten through the liberal aid bestow by other government on their own steam line i ask your earnest consideration of the report with which the merchant marine commission have follow its long and careful inquiry i again heartily commend to your favorable consideration the tercentennial celebration at jamestown va. appreciate the desirability of this commemoration the congress pass an act march 3 1905 authorize in the year 1907 on and near the water of hampton roads in the state of virginia an international naval marine and military celebration in honor of this event by the authority vest in i by this act i have make proclamation of say celebration and have issue in conformity with its instruction invitation to all the nation of the earth to participate by send their naval vessel and such military organization as may be practicable this celebration would fail of its full purpose unless it be endure in its result and commensurate with the importance of the event to be celebrate the event from which our nation date its birth i earnestly hope that this celebration already indorse by the congress of the united states and by the legislatures of sixteen state since the action of the congress will receive such additional aid at your hand as will make it worthy of the great event it be intend to celebrate and thereby enable the government of the united states to make provision for the exhibition of its own resource and likewise enable our people who have undertake the work of such a celebration to provide suitable and proper entertainment and instruction in the historic event of our country for all who may visit the exposition and to whom we have tender our hospitality it be a matter of unmixed satisfaction once more to call attention to the excellent work of the pension bureau for the veteran of the civil war have a great claim upon we than any other class of our citizen to they first of all among our people honor be due seven year ago my lamented predecessor president mckinley state that the time have come for the nation to care for the grave of the confederate dead i recommend that the congress take action toward this end the first need be to take charge of the grave of the confederate dead who die in northern prison the question of immigration be of vital interest to this country in the year end june 30 1905 there come to the united states 1,026,000 alien immigrant in other word in the single year that have just elapse there come to this country a great number of people than come here during the one hundred and sixty nine year of our colonial life which intervene between the first landing at jamestown and the declaration of independence it be clearly show in the report of the commissioner general of immigration that while much of this enormous immigration be undoubtedly healthy and natural a considerable proportion be undesirable from one reason or another moreover a considerable proportion of it probably a very large proportion include most of the undesirable class do not come here of its own initiative but because of the activity of the agent of the great transportation company these agent be distribute throughout europe and by the offer of all kind of inducement they wheedle and cajole many immigrant often against their good interest to come here the most serious obstacle we have to encounter in the effort to secure a proper regulation of the immigration to these shore arise from the determined opposition of the foreign steamship line who have no interest whatever in the matter save to increase the return on their capital by carry masse of immigrant hither in the steerage quarter of their ship as i say in my last message to the congress we can not have too much immigration of the right sort and we should have none whatever of the wrong sort of course it be desirable that even the right kind of immigration should be properly distribute in this country we need more of such immigration for the south and special effort should be make to secure it perhaps it would be possible to limit the number of immigrant allow to come in any one year to new york and other northern city while leave unlimited the number allow to come to the south always provide however that a strict effort be make to see that only immigrant of the right kind come to our country anywhere in actual practice it have prove so difficult to enforce the migration law where long stretch of frontier mark by an imaginary line alone intervene between we and our neighbor that i recommend that no immigrant be allow to come in from canada and mexico save native of the two country themselves as much as possible should be do to distribute the immigrant upon the land and keep they away from the contest tenement house district of the great city but distribution be a palliative not a cure the prime need be to keep out all immigrant who will not make good american citizen the law now exist for the exclusion of undesirable immigrant should be strengthen adequate mean should be adopt enforce by sufficient penalty to compel steamship company engage in the passenger business to observe in good faith the law which forbid they to encourage or solicit immigration to the united states moreover there should be a sharp limitation impose upon all vessel come to our port as to the number of immigrant in ratio to the tonnage which each vessel can carry this ratio should be high enough to insure the come hither of as good a class of alien as possible provision should be make for the surer punishment of those who induce alien to come to this country under promise or assurance of employment it should be make possible to inflict a sufficiently heavy penalty on any employer violate this law to deter he from take the risk it seem to i wise that there should be an international conference hold to deal with this question of immigration which have more than a merely national significance such a conference could among other thing enter at length into the method for secure a thorough inspection of would be immigrant at the port from which they desire to embark before permit they to embark in deal with this question it be unwise to depart from the old american tradition and to discriminate for or against any man who desire to come here and become a citizen save on the ground of that man 's fitness for citizenship it be our right and duty to consider his moral and social quality his standard of living should be such that he will not by pressure of competition low the standard of living of our own wage worker for it must ever be a prime object of our legislation to keep high their standard of living if the man who seek to come here be from the moral and social standpoint of such a character as to bid fair to add value to the community he should be heartily welcome we can not afford to pay heed to whether he be of one creed or another of one nation or another we can not afford to consider whether he be catholic or protestant jew or gentile whether he be englishman or irishman frenchman or german japanese italian scandinavian slav or magyar what we should desire to find out be the individual quality of the individual man in my judgment with this end in view we shall have to prepare through our own agent a far more rigid inspection in the country from which the immigrant come it will be a great deal well to have few immigrant but all of the right kind than a great number of immigrant many of whom be necessarily of the wrong kind as far as possible we wish to limit the immigration to this country to person who propose to become citizen of this country and we can well afford to insist upon adequate scrutiny of the character of those who be thus propose for future citizenship there should be an increase in the stringency of the law to keep out insane idiotic epileptic and pauper immigrant but this be by no means enough not merely the anarchist but every man of anarchistic tendency all violent and disorderly people all people of bad character the incompetent the lazy the vicious the physically unfit defective or degenerate should be keep out the stock out of which american citizenship be to be build should be strong and healthy sound in body mind and character if it be object that the government agent would not always select well the answer be that they would certaintly select well than do the agent and broker of foreign steamship company the people who now do whatever selection be do the question arise in connection with chinese immigration stand by themselves the condition in china be such that the entire chinese coolie class that is the class of chinese laborer skilled and unskilled legitimately come under the head of undesirable immigrant to this country because of their number the low wage for which they work and their low standard of living not only be it to the interest of this country to keep they out but the chinese authority do not desire that they should be admit at present their entrance be prohibit by law amply adequate to accomplish this purpose these law have be be be and will be thoroughly enforce the violation of they be so few in number as to be infinitesimal and can be entirely disregarded this be no serious proposal to alter the immigration law as regard the chinese laborer skilled or unskille and there be no excuse for any man feel or affect to feel the slight alarm on the subject but in the effort to carry out the policy of exclude chinese laborer chinese coolie grave injustice and wrong have be do by this nation to the people of china and therefore ultimately to this nation itself chinese student business and professional man of all kind not only merchant but banker doctor manufacturer professor traveler and the like should be encourage to come here and treat on precisely the same footing that we treat student business man traveler and the like of other nation our law and treaty should be frame not so as to put these people in the excepted class but to state that we will admit all chinese except chinese of the coolie class chinese skilled or unskilled laborer there would not be the least danger that any such provision would result in any relaxation of the law about laborer these will under all condition be keep out absolutely but it will be more easy to see that both justice and courtesy be show as they ought to be show to other chinese if the law or treaty be frame as above suggest examination should be complete at the port of departure from china for this purpose there should be provide a more adequate consular service in china than we now have the appropriation both for the office of the consuls and for the office force in the consulate should be increase as a people we have talk much of the open door in china and we expect and quite rightly intend to insist upon justice be show we by the chinese but we can not expect to receive equity unless we do equity we can not ask the chinese to do to we what we be unwilling to do to they they would have a perfect right to exclude our labor man if our labor man threaten to come into their country in such number as to jeopardize the well being of the chinese population and as mutatis mutandis these be the condition with which chinese immigration actually bring this people face to face we have and have a perfect right which the chinese government in no way contest to act as we have act in the matter of restrict coolie immigration that this right exist for each country be explicitly acknowledge in the last treaty between the two country but we must treat the chinese student traveler and business man in a spirit of the broad justice and courtesy if we expect similar treatment to be accord to our own people of similar rank who go to china much trouble have come during the past summer from the organize boycott against american good which have be start in china the main factor in produce this boycott have be the resentment feel by the student and business people of china by all the chinese leader against the harshness of our law toward educated chinamen of the professional and business class this government have the friendly feeling for china and desire china 's well being we cordially sympathize with the announce purpose of japan to stand for the integrity of china such an attitude tend to the peace of the world the civil service law have be on the statute book for twenty two year every president and a vast majority of head of department who have be in office during that period have favor a gradual extension of the merit system the more thoroughly its principle have be understand the great have be the favor with which the law have be regard by administration officer any attempt to carry on the great executive department of the government without this law would inevitably result in chaos the civil service commissioners be do excellent work and their compensation be inadequate consider the service they perform the statement that the examination be not practical in character be base on a misapprehension of the practice of the commission the department be invariably consult as to the requirement desire and as to the character of question that shall be ask general invitation be frequently send out to all head of department ask whether any change in the scope or character of examination be require in other word the department prescribe the requirement and qualification desire and the civil service commission co operate with they in secure person with these qualification and insure open and impartial competition in a large number of examination as for example those for trade position there be no educational requirement whatever and a person who can neither read nor write may pass with a high average vacancy in the service be fill with reasonable expedition and the machinery of the commission which reach every part of the country be the good agency that have yet be devise for find people with the most suitable qualification for the various office to be fill write competitive examination do not make an ideal method for fill position but they do represent an immeasurable advance upon the spoil method under which outside politician really make the appointment nominally make by the executive officer the appointee be choose by the politician in question in the great majority of case for reason totally unconnected with the need of the service or of the public statistic gather by the census bureau show that the tenure of office in the government service do not differ materially from that enjoy by employe of large business corporation head of executive department and member of the commission have call my attention to the fact that the rule require a filing of charge and three day notice before an employe could be separate from the service for inefficiency have serve no good purpose whatever because that be not a matter upon which a hearing of the employe find to be inefficient can be of any value and in practice the rule provide for such notice and hearing have merely result in keep in a certain number of incompetent because of the reluctance of the head of department and bureau chief to go through the require procedure experience have show that this rule be wholly ineffective to save any man if a superior for improper reason wish to remove he and be mischievous because it sometimes serve to keep in the service incompetent man not guilty of specific wrongdoing have these fact in view the rule have be amend by provide that where the inefficiency or incapacity come within the personal knowledge of the head of a department the removal may be make without notice the reason therefor be file and make a record of the department the absolute right of the removal rest where it always have rest with the head of a department any limitation of this absolute right result in grave injury to the public service the change be merely one of procedure it be much need and it be produce good result the civil service law be be energetically and impartially enforce and in the large majority of case complaint of violation of either the law or rule be discover to be unfounded in this respect this law compare very favorably with any other federal statute the question of politic in the appointment and retention of the man engage in merely ministerial work have be practically eliminate in almost the entire field of government employment cover by the civil service law the action of the congress in provide the commission with its own force instead of require it to rely on detailed clerk have be justify by the increase work do at a small cost to the government i urge upon the congress a careful consideration of the recommendation contain in the annual report of the commission our copyright law urgently need revision they be imperfect in definition confused and inconsistent in expression they omit provision for many article which under modern reproductive process be entitle to protection they impose hardship upon the copyright proprietor which be not essential to the fair protection of the public they be difficult for the court to interpret and impossible for the copyright office to administer with satisfaction to the public attempt to improve they by amendment have be frequent no less than twelve act for the purpose having be pass since the revised statutes to perfect they by further amendment seem impracticable a complete revision of they be essential such a revision to meet modern condition have be find necessary in germany austria sweden and other foreign country and bill embody it be pende in england and the australian colony it have be urge here and proposal for a commission to undertake it have from time to time be press upon the congress the inconvenience of the present condition be so great an attempt to frame appropriate legislation have be make by the copyright office which have call conference of the various interest especially and practically concerned with the operation of the copyright law it have secure from they suggestion as to the change necessary it have add from its own experience and investigation and it have draft a bill which embody such of these change and addition as after full discussion and expert criticism appear to be sound and safe in form this bill would replace the exist insufficient and inconsistent law by one general copyright statute it will be present to the congress at the come session it deserve prompt consideration i recommend that a law be enact to regulate inter state commerce in misbrande and adulterate food drink and drug such law would protect legitimate manufacture and commerce and would tend to secure the health and welfare of the consume public traffic in food stuff which have be debase or adulterate so as to injure health or to deceive purchaser should be forbid the law forbid the emission of dense black or gray smoke in the city of washington have be sustain by the court something have be accomplish under it but much remain to be do if we would preserve the capital city from defacement by the smoke nuisance repeat prosecution under the law have not have the desire effect i recommend that it be make more stringent by increase both the minimum and maximum fine by provide for imprisonment in case of repeat violation and by afford the remedy of injunction against the continuation of the operation of plant which be persistent offender i recommend also an increase in the number of inspector whose duty it shall be to detect violation of the act i call your attention to the generous act of the state of california in confer upon the united states government the ownership of the yosemite valley and the mariposa big tree grove there should be no delay in accept the gift and appropriation should be make for the include thereof in the yosemite national park and for the care and policing of the park california have act most wisely as well as with great magnanimity in the matter there be certain mighty natural feature of our land which should be preserve in perpetuity for our child and our child 's child in my judgment the grand canyon of the colorado should be make into a national park it be greatly to be wish that the state of new york should copy as regard niagara what the state of california have do as regard the yosemite nothing should be allow to interfere with the preservation of niagara falls in all their beauty and majesty if the state can not see to this then it be earnestly to be wish that she should be willing to turn it over to the national government which should in such case if possible in conjunction with the canadian government assume the burden and responsibility of preserve unharmed niagara falls just as it should gladly assume a similar burden and responsibility for the yosemite national park and as it have already assume they for the yellowstone national park adequate provision should be make by the congress for the proper care and supervision of all these national park the boundary of the yellowstone national park should be extend to the south and east to take in such portion of the abutting forest reservation as will enable the government to protect the elk on their winter range the most characteristic animal of the western plain be the great shaggy man wild ox the bison commonly know as buffalo small fragment of herd exist in a domesticated state here and there a few of they in the yellowstone park such a herd as that on the flat head reservation should not be allow to go out of existence either on some reservation or on some forest reserve like the wichita reserve and game refuge provision should be make for the preservation of such a herd i believe that the scheme would be of economic advantage for the robe of the buffalo be of high market value and the same be true of the robe of the crossbred animal i call your especial attention to the desirability of give to the member of the life saving service pension such as be give to fireman and policeman in all our great city the man in the life saving service continually and in the most matter of fact way do deed such as make americans proud of their country they have no political influence and they live in such remote place that the really heroic service they continually render receive the scanty recognition from the public it be unjust for a great nation like this to permit these man to become totally disabled or to meet death in the performance of their hazardous duty and yet to give they no sort of reward if one of they serve thirty year of his life in such a position he should surely be entitle to retire on half pay as a fireman or policeman do and if he becomes totally incapacitate through accident or sickness or lose his health in the discharge of his duty he or his family should receive a pension just as any soldier should i call your attention with especial earnestness to this matter because it appeal not only to our judgment but to our sympathy for the people on whose behalf i ask it be comparatively few in number render incalculable service of a particularly dangerous kind and have no one to speak for they during the year just past the phase of the indian question which have be most sharply bring to public attention be the large legal significance of the indian 's induction into citizenship this have make itself manifest not only in a great access of litigation in which the citizen indian figure as a party defendant and in a more widespread disposition to levy local taxation upon his personalty but in a decision of the united states supreme court which strike away the main prop on which have hitherto rest the government 's benevolent effort to protect he against the evil of intemperance the court hold in effect that when an indian become by virtue of an allotment of land to he a citizen of the state in which his land be situate he pass from under federal control in such matter as this and the act of the congress prohibit the sale or gift to he of intoxicant become substantially inoperative it be gratify to note that the states and municipality of the west which have most at stake in the welfare of the indians be take up this subject and be try to supply in a measure at least the abdication of its trusteeship force upon the federal government nevertheless i would urgently press upon the attention of the congress the question whether some amendment of the internal revenue law might not be of aid in prosecute those malefactor know in the indian country as bootlegger who be engage at once in defraud the united states treasury of taxis and what be far more important in debauch the indians by carry liquor illicitly into territory still completely under federal jurisdiction among the cry present need of the indians be more day school situate in the midst of their settlement more effective instruction in the industry pursue on their own farm and a more liberal tension of the field matron service which mean the education of the indian woman in the art of home making until the mother be well start in the right direction we can not reasonably expect much from the child who be soon to form an integral part of our american citizenship moreover the excuse continually advance by male adult indians for refuse offer of remunerative employment at a distance from their home be that they dare not leave their family too long out of their sight one effectual remedy for this state of thing be to employ the mind and strengthen the moral fibre of the indian woman the end to which the work of the field matron be especially direct i trust that the congress will make its appropriation for indian day school and field matron as generous as may consist with the other press demand upon its providence during the last year the philippine islands have be slowly recover from the series of disaster which since american occupation have greatly reduce the amount of agricultural product below what be produce in spanish time the war the rinderpest the locust the drought and the cholera have be unite as cause to prevent a return of the prosperity much need in the island the most serious be the destruction by the rinderpest of more than 75 per cent of the draught cattle because it will take several year of breeding to restore the necessary number of these indispensable aid to agriculture the commission attempt to supply by purchase from adjoining country the needed cattle but the experiment make be unsuccessful most of the cattle import be unable to withstand the change of climate and the rigor of the voyage and die from other disease than rinderpest the income of the philippine government have necessarily be reduce by reason of the business and agricultural depression in the island and the government have be oblige to exercise great economy to cut down its expense to reduce salary and in every way to avoid a deficit it have adopt an internal revenue law impose taxis on cigar cigarette and distilled liquor and abolish the old spanish industrial taxis the law have not operate as smoothly as be hope and although its principle be undoubtedly correct it may need amendment for the purpose of reconcile the people to its provision the income derive from it have partly make up for the reduction in custom revenue there have be a marked increase in the number of filipinos employ in the civil service and a corresponding decrease in the number of americans the government in every one of its department have be render more efficient by elimination of undesirable material and the promotion of deserve public servant improvement of harbor road and bridge continue although the cutting down of the revenue forbid the expenditure of any great amount from current income for these purpose step be be take by advertisement for competitive bid to secure the construction and maintenance of 1,000 mile of railway by private corporation under the recent enable legislation of the congress the transfer of the friar land in accordance with the contract make some two year ago have be completely effect and the purchase money pay provision have just be make by statute for the speedy settlement in a special proceeding in the supreme court of controversy over the possession and title of church building and rectory arise between the roman catholic church and schismatic claim under ancient municipality negotiation and hearing for the settlement of the amount due to the roman catholic church for rent and occupation of church and rectory by the army of the united states be in progress and it be hope a satisfactory conclusion may be submit to the congress before the end of the session tranquillity have exist during the past year throughout the archipelago except in the province of cavite the province of batangas and the province of samar and in the island of jolo among the moro the jolo disturbance be put an end to by several sharp and short engagement and now peace prevail in the moro province cavite the mother of ladrone in the spanish time be so permeate with the traditional sympathy of the people for ladronism as to make it difficult to stamp out the disease batangas be only disturb by reason of the fugitive ladrone from cavite samar be throw into disturbance by the uneducated and partly savage people live in the mountain who having be give by the municipal code more power than they be able to exercise discreetly elect municipal officer who abuse their trust compel the people raise hemp to sell it at a much less price than it be worth and by their abuse drive their people into resistance to constitute authority cavite and samar be instance of repose too much confidence in the self govern power of a people the disturbance have all now be suppress and it be hope that with these lesson local government can be form which will secure quiet and peace to the deserve inhabitant the incident be another proof of the fact that if there have be any error as regard give self government in the philippines it have be in the direction of give it too quickly not too slowly a year from next april the first legislative assembly for the island will be hold on the sanity and self restraint of this body much will depend so far as the future self government of the island be concern the most encouraging feature of the whole situation have be the very great interest take by the common people in education and the great increase in the number of enrol student in the public school the increase be from 300,000 to half a million pupil the average attendance be about 70 per cent the only limit upon the number of pupil seem to be the capacity of the government to furnish teacher and school house the agricultural condition of the island enforce more strongly than ever the argument in favor of reduce the tariff on the product of the philippine islands enter the united states i earnestly recommend that the tariff now impose by the dingley bill upon the product of the philippine islands be entirely remove except the tariff on sugar and tobacco and that that tariff be reduce to 25 per cent of the present rate under the dingley act that after july 1 1909 the tariff upon tobacco and sugar produce in the philippine islands be entirely remove and that free trade between the island and the united states in the product of each country then be provide for by law a statute in force enact april 15 1904 suspend the operation of the coastwise law of the united states upon the trade between the philippine islands and the united states until july 1 1906 i earnestly recommend that this suspension be postpone until july 1 1909 i think it of doubtful utility to apply the coastwise law to the trade between the united states and the philippines under any circumstance because i be convinced that it will do no good whatever to american bottom and will only interfere and be an obstacle to the trade between the philippines and the united states but if the coastwise law must be thus apply certainly it ought not to have effect until free trade be enjoy between the people of the united states and the people of the philippine islands in their respective product i do not anticipate that free trade between the island and the united states will produce a revolution in the sugar and tobacco production of the philippine islands so primitive be the method of agriculture in the philippine islands so slow be capital in go to the island so many difficulty surround a large agricultural enterprise in the island that it will be many many year before the product of those island will have any effect whatever upon the market of the united states the problem of labor be also a formidable one with the sugar and tobacco producer in the island the good friend of the filipino people and the people themselves be utterly oppose to the admission of chinese coolie labor hence the only solution be the training of filipino labor and this will take a long time the enactment of a law by the congress of the united states make provision for free trade between the island and the united states however will be of great importance from a political and sentimental standpoint and while its actual benefit have doubtless be exaggerate by the people of the island they will accept this measure of justice as an indication that the people of the united states be anxious to aid the people of the philippine islands in every way and especially in the agricultural development of their archipelago it will aid the filipinos without injure interest in america in my judgment immediate step should be take for the fortification of hawaii this be the most important point in the pacific to fortify in order to conserve the interest of this country it would be hard to overstate the importance of this need hawaii be too heavily tax law should be enact set aside for a period of say twenty year 75 per cent of the internal revenue and custom receipt from hawaii as a special fund to be expend in the island for educational and public building and for harbor improvement and military and naval defense it can not be too often repeat that our aim must be to develop the territory of hawaii on traditional american line that territory have serious commercial and industrial problem to reckon with but no measure of relief can be consider which look to legislation admit chinese and restrict they by statute to field labor and domestic service the status of servility can never again be tolerate on american soil we can not concede that the proper solution of its problem be special legislation admit to hawaii a class of laborer deny admission to the other states and territories there be obstacle and great obstacle in the way of build up a representative american community in the hawaiian islands but it be not in the american character to give up in the face of difficulty many an american commonwealth have be build up against odd equal to those that now confront hawaii no merely half hearted effort to meet its problem as other american community have meet theirs can be accept as final hawaii shall never become a territory in which a govern class of rich planter exist by mean of coolie labor even if the rate of growth of the territory be thereby render slow the growth must only take place by the admission of immigrant fit in the end to assume the duty and burden of full american citizenship our aim must be to develop the territory on the same basis of stable citizenship as exist on this continent i earnestly advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicitly confer american citizenship on all citizen of porto rico there be in my judgment no excuse for failure to do this the harbor of san juan should be dredge and improve the expense of the federal court of porto rico should be meet from the federal treasury and not from the porto rican treasury the election in porto rico should take place every four year and the legislature should meet in session every two year the present form of government in porto rico which provide for the appointment by the president of the member of the executive council or upper house of the legislature have prove satisfactory and have inspire confidence in property owner and investor i do not deem it advisable at the present time to change this form in any material feature the problem and need of the island be industrial and commercial rather than political i wish to call the attention of the congress to one question which affect our insular possession generally namely the need of an increase liberality in the treatment of the whole franchise question in these island in the proper desire to prevent the island be exploit by speculator and to have they develop in the interest of their own people an error have be make in refuse to grant sufficiently liberal term to induce the investment of american capital in the philippines and in porto rico elsewhere in this message i have speak strongly against the jealousy of mere wealth and especially of corporate wealth as such but it be particularly regrettable to allow any such jealousy to be develop when we be deal either with our insular or with foreign affair the big corporation have achieve its present position in the business world simply because it be the most effective instrument in business competition in foreign affair we can not afford to put our people at a disadvantage with their competitor by in any way discriminate against the efficiency of our business organization in the same way we can not afford to allow our insular possession to lag behind in industrial development from any twisted jealousy of business success it be of course a mere truism to say that the business interest of the island will only be develop if it become the financial interest of somebody to develop they yet this development be one of the thing most earnestly to be wish for in the interest of the island themselves we have be pay all possible heed to the political and educational interest of the island but important though these object be it be not less important that we should favor their industrial development the government can in certain way help this directly as by build good road but the fundamental and vital help must be give through the development of the industry of the island and a most efficient mean to this end be to encourage big american corporation to start industry in they and this mean to make it advantageous for they to do so to limit the ownership of mining claim as have be do in the philippines be absurd in both the philippines and porto rico the limit of holding of land should be largely raise i earnestly ask that alaska be give an elective delegate some person should be choose who can speak with authority of the need of the territory the government should aid in the construction of a railroad from the gulf of alaska to the yukon river in american territory in my last two message i advocate certain additional action on behalf of alaska i shall not now repeat those recommendation but i shall lay all my stress upon the one recommendation of give to alaska some one authorize to speak for it i should prefer that the delegate be make elective but if this be not deem wise then make he appointive at any rate give alaska some person whose business it shall be to speak with authority on her behalf to the congress the natural resource of alaska be great some of the chief need of the peculiarly energetic self reliant and typically american white population of alaska be set forth in my last message i also earnestly ask your attention to the need of the alaskan indians all indians who be competent should receive the full right of american citizenship it be for instance a gross and indefensible wrong to deny to such hard work decent live indians as the metlakahtlas the right to obtain license as captain pilot and engineer the right to enter mining claim and to profit by the homestead law these particular indians be civilized and be competent and entitle to be put on the same basis with the white man round about they i recommend that indian territory and oklahoma be admit as one state and that new mexico and arizona be admit as one state there be no obligation upon we to treat territorial subdivision which be matter of convenience only as bind we on the question of admission to statehood nothing have take up more time in the congress during the past few year than the question as to the statehood to be grant to the four territories above mention and after careful consideration of all that have be develop in the discussion of the question i recommend that they be immediately admit as two state there be no justification for further delay and the advisability of make the four territories into two states have be clearly establish in some of the territories the legislative assembly issue license for gambling the congress should by law forbid this practice the harmful result of which be obvious at a glance the treaty between the united states and the republic of panama under which the construction of the panama canal be make possible go into effect with its ratification by the united states senate on february 23 1904 the canal property of the french canal company be transfer to the united states on april 23 1904 on payment of $ 40,000,000 to that company on april 1 1905 the commission be reorganize and it now consist of theodore p. shonts chairman charles e. magoon benjamin m. harrod rear admiral mordecai t. endicott brig gen. peter c. hains and col oswald h. ernst john f. stevens be appoint chief engineer on july 1 last active work in canal construction mainly preparatory have be in progress for less than a year and a half during that period two point about the canal have cease to be open to debate first the question of route the canal will be build on the isthmus of panama second the question of feasibility there be no physical obstacle on this route that american engineering skill will not be able to overcome without serious difficulty or that will prevent the completion of the canal within a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost this be virtually the unanimous testimony of the engineer who have investigate the matter for the government the point which remain unsettled be the question of type whether the canal shall be one of several lock above sea level or at sea level with a single tide lock on this point i hope to lay before the congress at an early day the finding of the advisory board of american and european engineers that at my invitation have be consider the subject together with the report of the commission thereon and such comment thereon or recommendation in reference thereto as may seem necessary the american people be pledge to the speediest possible construction of a canal adequate to meet the demand which the commerce of the world will make upon it and i appeal most earnestly to the congress to aid in the fulfillment of the pledge gratifying progress have be make during the past year and especially during the past four month the great part of the necessary preliminary work have be do actual work of excavation could be begin only on a limited scale till the canal zone be make a healthful place to live in and to work in the isthmus have to be sanitate first this task have be so thoroughly accomplish that yellow fever have be virtually extirpate from the isthmus and general health condition vastly improve the same method which convert the island of cuba from a p hole which menace the health of the world into a healthful place of abode have be apply on the isthmus with satisfactory result there be no reason to doubt that when the plan for water supply paving and sewerage of panama and colon and the large labor camp have be fully carry out the isthmus will be for the tropic an unusually healthy place of abode the work be so far advanced now that the health of all those employ in canal work be as well guard as it be on similar work in this country and elsewhere in addition to sanitate the isthmus satisfactory quarter be be provide for employe and an adequate system of supply they with wholesome food at reasonable price have be create hospital have be establish and equip that be without their superior of their kind anywhere the country have thus be make fit to work in and provision have be make for the welfare and comfort of those who be to do the work during the past year a large portion of the plant with which the work be to be do have be order it be confidently believe that by the middle of the approach year a sufficient proportion of this plant will have be instal to enable we to resume the work of excavation on a large scale what be need now and without delay be an appropriation by the congress to meet the current and accruing expense of the commission the first appropriation of $ 10,000,000 out of the $ 135,000,000 authorize by the spooner act be make three year ago it be nearly exhausted there be barely enough of it remain to carry the commission to the end of the year unless the congress shall appropriate before that time all work must cease to arrest progress for any length of time now when matter be advance so satisfactorily would be deplorable there will be no money with which to meet pay roll obligation and none with which to meet bill come due for material and supply and there will be demoralization of the force here and on the isthmus now work so harmoniously and effectively if there be delay in grant an emergency appropriation estimate of the amount necessary will be find in the accompany report of the secretary of war and the commission i recommend more adequate provision than have be make heretofore for the work of the department of state within a few year there have be a very great increase in the amount and importance of the work to be do by that department both in washington and abroad this have be cause by the great increase of our foreign trade the increase of wealth among our people which enable they to travel more generally than heretofore the increase of american capital which be seek investment in foreign country and the growth of our power and weight in the council of the civilized world there have be no corresponding increase of facility for do the work afford to the department have charge of our foreign relation neither at home nor abroad be there a sufficient work force to do the business properly in many respect the system which be adequate to the work of twenty five year or even ten year ago be inadequate now and should be change our consular force should be classify and appointment should be make to the several class with authority to the executive to assign the member of each class to duty at such post as the interest of the service require instead of the appointment be make as at present to specify post there should be an adequate inspection service so that the department may be able to inform itself how the business of each consulate be be do instead of depend upon casual private information or rumor the fee system should be entirely abolish and a due equivalent make in salary to the officer who now eke out their subsistence by mean of fee sufficient provision should be make for a clerical force in every consulate compose entirely of americans instead of the insufficient provision now make which compel the employment of great number of citizen of foreign country whose service can be obtain for less money at a large part of our consulates the office quarter and the clerical force be inadequate to the performance of the onerous duty impose by the recent provision of our immigration law as well as by our increase trade in many part of the world the lack of suitable quarter for our embassy legation and consulate detract from the respect in which our officer ought to be hold and seriously impairs their weight and influence suitable provision should be make for the expense of keep our diplomatic officer more fully informed of what be be do from day to day in the progress of our diplomatic affair with other country the lack of such information cause by insufficient appropriation available for cable toll and for clerical and messenger service frequently put our officer at a great disadvantage and detract from their usefulness the salary list should be readjust it do not now correspond either to the importance of the service to be render and the degree of ability and experience require in the different position or to the difference in the cost of living in many case the salary be quite inadequate
to the senate and house of representatives
 i inclose herewith the annual report of the isthmian canal commission the annual report of the panama railroad company and the secretary of war&#39;s letter transmit the same together with certain paper
 the work on the isthmus be be admirably do and great progress have be make especially during the last nine month the plant be be make ready and the organization perfect the first work to be do be the work of sanitation the necessary preliminary to the work of actual construction and this have be push forward with the utmost energy and mean in a short while i shall lay before you the recommendation of the commission and of the board of consult engineer as to the proper plan to be adopt for the canal itself together with my own recommendation thereon all the work so far have be do not only with the utmost expedition but in the most careful and thorough manner and what have be accomplish give we good reason to believe that the canal will be dig in a short time than have be anticipate and at an expenditure within the estimate amount all our citizen have a right to congratulate themselves upon the high standard of efficiency and integrity which have be hitherto maintain by the representative of the government in do this great work if this high standard of efficiency and integrity can be maintain in the future at the same level which it have now reach the construction of the panama canal will be one of the feat to which the people of this republic will look back with the high pride
 from time to time various publication have be make and from time to time in the future various similar publication doubtless will be make purport to give an account of jobbery or immorality or inefficiency or misery as obtain on the isthmus i have carefully examine into each of these accusation which seem worthy of attention in every instance the accusation have prove to be without foundation in any shape or form they spring from several source sometimes they take the shape of statement by irresponsible investigator of a sensational habit of mind incapable of observe or repeat with accuracy what they see and desirous of obtain notoriety by widespread slander more often they originate with or be give currency by individual with a personal grievance the sensation monger both those who stay at home and those who visit the isthmus may ground their accusation on false statement by some engineer who having apply for service on the commission and be refuse such service now endeavor to discredit his successful competitor or by some lessee or owner of real estate who have seek action or inaction by the commission to increase the value of his lot and be bitter because the commission can not be use for such purpose or on the tale of disappointed bidder for contract or of office holder who have prove incompetent or who have be suspect of corruption and dismiss or who have be overcome by panic and have flee from the isthmus every specific charge relate to jobbery to immorality or to inefficiency from whatever source it have come have be immediately investigate and in no single instance have the statement of these sensation monger and the interested complainant behind they prove true the only discredit inhering in these false accusation be to those who originate and give they currency and who to the extent of their ability thereby hamper and obstruct the completion of the great work in which both the honor and the interest of america be so deeply involved it matter not whether those guilty of these false accusation utter they in mere wanton recklessness and folly or in spirit of sinister malice to gratify some personal or political grudge
 any attempt to cut down the salary of the official of the isthmian commission or of their subordinate who be do important work would be ruinous from the standpoint of accomplish the work effectively to quote the word of one of the good observer on the isthmus demoralization of the service be certain if the reward for successful endeavor be a reduction of pay we be undertake in panama a gigantic task the large piece of engineering ever do the employment of the man engage thereon be only temporary and yet it will require the high order of ability if it be to be do economically honestly and efficiently to attempt to secure man to do this work on insufficient salary would amount to put a premium upon inefficiency and corruption man fit for the work will not undertake it unless they be well pay in the end the man who do undertake it will be leave to seek other employment with as their chief reward the reputation they achieve their work be infinitely more difficult than any private work both because of the peculiar condition of the tropical land in which it be lay and because it be impossible to free they from the peculiar limitation inseparably connect with government employment while it be unfortunately true that man engage in public work no matter how devoted and disintereste their service must expect to be make the object of misrepresentation and attack at well therefore the position be not attractive in proportion to their importance and among the man fit to do the task only those with a genuine sense of public spirit and eager to do the great work for the work&#39;s sake can be obtain and such man can not be keep if they be to be treat with niggardliness and parsimony in addition to the certainty that false accusation will continually be bring against they
 i repeat that the work on the isthmus have be do and be be do admirably the organization be good the mistake be extraordinarily few and these few have be of practically no consequence the zeal intelligence and efficient public service of the isthmian commission and its subordinate have be noteworthy i court the full most exhaustive and most search investigation of any act of theirs and if any one of they be ever show to have do wrong his punishment shall be exemplary but i ask that they be decently pay and that their hand be uphold as long as they act decently on any other condition we shall not be able to get man of the right type to do the work and this mean that on any other condition we shall insure if not failure at least delay scandal and inefficiency in the task of dig the giant canal

to the senate and house of representatives
 i transmit herewith the report of mr. james bronson reynolds and commissioner charles p. neill the special committee whom i appoint to investigate into the condition in the stock yard of chicago and report thereon to i this report be of a preliminary nature i submit it to you now because it show the urgent need of immediate action by the congress in the direction of provide a drastic and thoroughgoing inspection by the federal government of all stockyard and pack house and of their product so far as the latter enter into interstate or foreign commerce the condition show by even this short inspection to exist in the chicago stock yard be revolt it be imperatively necessary in the interest of health and of decency that they should be radically change under the exist law it be wholly impossible to secure satisfactory result
 when my attention be first direct to this matter an investigation be make under the bureau of animal industry of the department of agriculture when the preliminary statement of this investigation be bring to my attention they show such defect in the law and such wholly unexpected condition that i deem it well to have a further immediate investigation by man not connect with the bureau and accordingly appoint messrs. reynolds and neill it be impossible under exist law that satisfactory work should be do by the bureau of animal industry i be now however examine the way in which the work actually be do
 before i have receive the report of messrs. reynolds and neill i have direct that label place upon any package of meat food product should state only that the carcass of the animal from which the meat be take have be inspect at the time of slaughter if inspection of meat food product at all stage of preparation be not secure by the passage of the legislation recommend i shall feel compel to order that inspection label and certificate on can product shall not be use hereafter
 the report show that the stock yard and pack house be not keep even reasonably clean and that the method of handle and prepare food product be uncleanly and dangerous to health under exist law the national government have no power to enforce inspection of the many form of prepare meat food product that be daily go from the packing house into interstate commerce owe to an inadequate appropriation the department of agriculture be not even able to place inspector in all establishment desire they the present law prohibit the shipment of uninspected meat to foreign country but there be no provision forbid the shipment of uninspected meat in interstate commerce and thus the avenue of interstate commerce be leave open to traffic in diseased or spoiled meat
 if as have be allege on seemingly good authority further evil exist such as the improper use of chemical and dye the government lack power to remedy they
 a law be need which will enable the inspector of the general government to inspect and supervise from the hoof to the can the preparation of the meat food product the evil seem to be much less in the sale of dress carcase than in the sale of canned and other prepared product and very much less as regard product send abroad than as regard those use at home
 in my judgment the expense of the inspection should be pay by a fee levy on each animal slaughter if this be not do the whole purpose of the law can at any time be defeat through an insufficient appropriation and whenever there be no particular public interest in the subject it would be not only easy but natural thus to make the appropriation insufficient if it be not for this consideration i should favor the government pay for the inspection
 the alarm express in certain quarter concern this feature should be allay by a realization of the fact that in no case under such a law will the cost of inspection exceed 8 cent per head
 i call special attention to the fact that this report be preliminary and that the investigation be still unfinished it be not yet possible to report on the allege abuse in the use of deleterious chemical compound in connection with canning and preserve meat product nor on the alleged doctoring in this fashion of tainted meat and of product return to the packer as having grow unsalable or unusable from age or from other reason grave allegation be make in reference to abuse of this nature
 let i repeat that under the present law there be practically no method of stop these abuse if they should be discover to exist legislation be need in order to prevent the possibility of all abuse in the future if no legislation be pass then the excellent result accomplish by the work of this special committee will endure only so long as the memory of the committee&#39; work be fresh and a recrudescence of the abuse be absolutely certain
 i urge the immediate enactment into law of provision which will enable the department of agriculture adequately to inspect the meat and meat food product enter into interstate commerce and to supervise the method of prepare the same and to prescribe the sanitary condition under which the work shall be perform i therefore commend to your favorable consideration and urge the enactment of substantially the provision know as senate amendment no 29 to the act make appropriation for the department of agriculture for the fiscal year end june 30 1907 as pass by the senate this amendment be commonly know as the beveridge amendment

to the senate and house of representatives as a nation we still continue to enjoy a literally unprecedented prosperity and it be probable that only reckless speculation and disregard of legitimate business method on the part of the business world can materially mar this prosperity no congress in our time have do more good work of importance than the present congress there be several matter leave unfinished at your last session however which i most earnestly hope you will complete before your adjournment i again recommend a law prohibit all corporation from contribute to the campaign expense of any party such a bill have already past one house of congress let individual contribute as they desire but let we prohibit in effective fashion all corporation from make contribution for any political purpose directly or indirectly another bill which have just past one house of the congress and which it be urgently necessary should be enact into law be that confer upon the government the right of appeal in criminal case on question of law this right exist in many of the states it exist in the district of columbia by act of the congress it be of course not propose that in any case a verdict for the defendant on the merit should be set aside recently in one district where the government have indict certain person for conspiracy in connection with rebate the court sustain the defendant 's demurrer while in another jurisdiction an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebate have be sustain by the court conviction obtain under it and two defendant sentence to imprisonment the two case refer to may not be in real conflict with each other but it be unfortunate that there should even be an apparent conflict at present there be no way by which the government can cause such a conflict when it occur to be solve by an appeal to a high court and the wheel of justice be block without any real decision of the question i can not too strongly urge the passage of the bill in question a failure to pass it will result in seriously hamper the government in its effort to obtain justice especially against wealthy individual or corporation who do wrong and may also prevent the government from obtain justice for wage worker who be not themselves able effectively to contest a case where the judgment of an inferior court have be against they i have specifically in view a recent decision by a district judge leave railway employee without remedy for violation of a certain so call labor statute it seem an absurdity to permit a single district judge against what may be the judgment of the immense majority of his colleague on the bench to declare a law solemnly enact by the congress to be unconstitutional and then to deny to the government the right to have the supreme court definitely decide the question it be well to recollect that the real efficiency of the law often depend not upon the passage of act as to which there be great public excitement but upon the passage of act of this nature as to which there be not much public excitement because there be little public understanding of their importance while the interested party be keenly alive to the desirability of defeat they the importance of enact into law the particular bill in question be far increase by the fact that the government have now definitely begin a policy of resort to the criminal law in those trust and interstate commerce case where such a course offer a reasonable chance of success at first as be proper every effort be make to enforce these law by civil proceeding but it have become increasingly evident that the action of the government in finally decide in certain case to undertake criminal proceeding be justifiable and tho there have be some conspicuous failure in these case we have have many success which have undoubtedly have a deterrent effect upon evil doer whether the penalty inflict be in the shape of fine or imprisonment and penalty of both kind have already be inflict by the court of course where the judge can see his way to inflict the penalty of imprisonment the deterrent effect of the punishment on other offender be increase but sufficiently heavy fine accomplish much judge holt of the new york district court in a recent decision admirably state the need for treat with just severity offender of this kind his opinion run in part as follows:'the government 's evidence to establish the defendant 's guilt be clear conclusive and undisputed the case be a flagrant one the transaction which take place under this illegal contract be very large the amount of rebate return be considerable and the amount of the rebate itself be large amount to more than one fifth of the entire tariff charge for the transportation of merchandise from this city to detroit it be not too much to say in my opinion that if this business be carry on for a considerable time on that basis that be if this discrimination in favor of this particular shipper be make with an 18 instead of a 23 cent rate and the tariff rate be maintain as against their competitor the result might be and not improbably would be that their competitor would be drive out of business this crime be one which in its nature be deliberate and premeditate i think over a fortnight elapse between the date of palmer 's letter request the reduce rate and the answer of the railroad company decide to grant it and then for month afterwards this business be carry on and these claim for rebate submit month after month and check in payment of they draw month after month such a violation of the law in my opinion in its essential nature be a very much more heinous act than the ordinary common vulgar crime which come before criminal court constantly for punishment and which arise from sudden passion or temptation this crime in this case be commit by man of education and of large business experience whose stand in the community be such that they might have be expect to set an example of obedience to law upon the maintenance of which alone in this country the security of their property depend it be commit on behalf of a great railroad corporation which like other railroad corporation have receive gratuitously from the state large and valuable privilege for the public 's convenience and its own which perform quasi public function and which be charge with the high obligation in the transaction of its business to treat the citizen of this country alike and not to carry on its business with unjust discrimination between different citizen or different class of citizen this crime in its nature be one usually do with secrecy and proof of which it be very difficult to obtain the interstate commerce act be past in 1887 nearly twenty year ago ever since that time complaint of the granting of rebate by railroad have be common urgent and insistent and altho the congress have repeatedly past legislation endeavor to put a stop to this evil the difficulty of obtain proof upon which to bring prosecution in these case be so great that this be the first case that have ever be bring in this court and as i be form this case and one recently bring in philadelphia be the only case that have ever be bring in the eastern part of this country in fact but few case of this kind have ever be bring in this country east or west now under these circumstance i be force to the conclusion in a case in which the proof be so clear and the fact be so flagrant it be the duty of the court to fix a penalty which shall in some degree be commensurate with the gravity of the offense as between the two defendant in my opinion the principal penalty should be impose on the corporation the traffic manager in this case presumably act without any advantage to himself and without any interest in the transaction either by the direct authority or in accordance with what he understand to be the policy or the wish of his employer "the sentence of this court in this case be that the defendant pomeroy for each of the six offense upon which he have be convict be fine the sum of $ 1,000 make six fine amount in all to the sum of $ 6,000 and the defendant the new york central and hudson river railroad company for each of the six crime of which it have be convict be fine the sum of $ 18,000 make six fine amount in the aggregate to the sum of $ 108,000 and judgment to that effect will be enter in this case "in connection with this matter i would like to call attention to the very unsatisfactory state of our criminal law result in large part from the habit of set aside the judgment of inferior court on technicality absolutely unconnected with the merit of the case and where there be no attempt to show that there have be any failure of substantial justice it would be well to enact a law provide something to the effect that no judgment shall be set aside or new trial grant in any cause civil or criminal on the ground of misdirection of the jury or the improper admission or rejection of evidence or for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure unless in the opinion of the court to which the application be make after an examination of the entire cause it shall affirmatively appear that the error complain of have result in a miscarriage of justice in my last message i suggest the enactment of a law in connection with the issuance of injunction attention having be sharply draw to the matter by the demand that the right of apply injunction in labor case should be wholly abolish it be at least doubtful whether a law abolish altogether the use of injunction in such case would stand the test of the court in which case of course the legislation would be ineffective moreover i believe it would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use of injunction it be criminal to permit sympathy for criminal to weaken our hand in uphold the law and if man seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no impairment of the power of the court to deal with they in the most summary and effective way possible but so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provide against by some such law as i advocate last year in this matter of injunction there be lodge in the hand of the judiciary a necessary power which be nevertheless subject to the possibility of grave abuse it be a power that should be exercise with extreme care and should be subject to the jealous scrutiny of all man and condemnation should be mete out as much to the judge who fail to use it boldly when necessary as to the judge who use it wantonly or oppressively of course a judge strong enough to be fit for his office will enjoin any resort to violence or intimidation especially by conspiracy no matter what his opinion may be of the right of the original quarrel there must be no hesitation in deal with disorder but there must likewise be no such abuse of the injunctive power as be imply in forbid labor man to strive for their own betterment in peaceful and lawful way nor must the injunction be use merely to aid some big corporation in carry out scheme for its own aggrandizement it must be remember that a preliminary injunction in a labor case if grant without adequate proof even when authority can be find to support the conclusion of law on which it be found may often settle the dispute between the party and therefore if improperly grant may do irreparable wrong yet there be many judge who assume a matter of course granting of a preliminary injunction to be the ordinary and proper judicial disposition of such case and there have undoubtedly be flagrant wrong commit by judge in connection with labor dispute even within the last few year altho i think much less often than in former year such judge by their unwise action immensely strengthen the hand of those who be strive entirely to do away with the power of injunction and therefore such careless use of the injunctive process tend to threaten its very existence for if the american people ever become convinced that this process be habitually abuse whether in matter affect labor or in matter affect corporation it will be well nigh impossible to prevent its abolition it may be the high duty of a judge at any give moment to disregard not merely the wish of individual of great political or financial power but the overwhelming tide of public sentiment and the judge who do thus disregard public sentiment when it be wrong who brush aside the plea of any special interest when the pleading be not round on righteousness perform the high service to the country such a judge be deserve of all honor and all honor can not be pay to this wise and fearless judge if we permit the growth of an absurd convention which would forbid any criticism of the judge of another type who show himself timid in the presence of arrogant disorder or who on insufficient ground grant an injunction that do grave injustice or who in his capacity as a construer and therefore in part a maker of the law in flagrant fashion thwart the cause of decent government the judge have a power over which no review can be exercise he himself sit in review upon the act of both the executive and legislative branch of the government save in the most extraordinary case he be amenable only at the bar of public opinion and it be unwise to maintain that public opinion in reference to a man with such power shall neither be expr nor lead the good judge have ever be foremost to disclaim any immunity from criticism this have be true since the day of the great english lord chancellor parker who say let all people be at liberty to know what i find my judgment upon that so when i have give it in any cause other may be at liberty to judge of i the propriety of the case be set forth with singular clearness and good temper by judge w. h. taft when a united states circuit judge eleven year ago in 1895:"the opportunity freely and publicly to criticize judicial action be of vastly more importance to the body politic than the immunity of court and judge from unjust aspersion and attack nothing tend more to render judge careful in their decision and anxiously solicitous to do exact justice than the consciousness that every act of theirs be to be subject to the intelligent scrutiny and candid criticism of their fellow man such criticism be beneficial in proportion as it be fair dispassionate discriminating and base on a knowledge of sound legal principle the comment make by learn text writer and by the acute editor of the various law review upon judicial decision be therefore highly useful such critic constitute more or less impartial tribunal of professional opinion before which each judgment be make to stand or fall on its merit and thus exert a strong influence to secure uniformity of decision but non professional criticism also be by no mean without its use even if accompany as it often be by a direct attack upon the judicial fairness and motive of the occupant of the bench for if the law be but the essence of common sense the protest of many average man may evidence a defect in a judicial conclusion tho base on the nice legal reasoning and profoundest learning the two important element of moral character in a judge be an earnest desire to reach a just conclusion and courage to enforce it in so far as fear of public comment do not affect the courage of a judge but only spur he on to search his conscience and to reach the result which approve itself to his inmost heart such comment serve a useful purpose there be few man whether they be judge for life or for a short term who do not prefer to earn and hold the respect of all and who can not be reach and make to pause and deliberate by hostile public criticism in the case of judge have a life tenure indeed their very independence make the right freely to comment on their decision of great importance because it be the only practical and available instrument in the hand of a free people to keep such judge alive to the reasonable demand of those they serve "on the other hand the danger of destroy the proper influence of judicial decision by create unfounded prejudice against the court justifie and require that unjust attack shall be meet and answer court must ultimately rest their defense upon the inherent strength of the opinion they deliver as the ground for their conclusion and must trust to the calm and deliberate judgment of all the people as their good vindication "there be one consideration which should be take into account by the good people who carry a sound proposition to an excess in object to any criticism of a judge 's decision the instinct of the american people as a whole be sound in this matter they will not subscribe to the doctrine that any public servant be to be above all criticism if the good citizen those most competent to express their judgment in such matter and above all those belong to the great and honorable profession of the bar so profoundly influential in american life take the position that there shall be no criticism of a judge under any circumstance their view will not be accept by the american people as a whole in such event the people will turn to and tend to accept as justifiable the intemperate and improper criticism utter by unworthy agitator surely it be a misfortune to leave to such critic a function right in itself which they be certain to abuse just and temperate criticism when necessary be a safeguard against the acceptance by the people as a whole of that intemperate antagonism towards the judiciary which must be combat by every right thinking man and which if it become widespread among the people at large would constitute a dire menace to the republic in connection with the delay of the law i call your attention and the attention of the nation to the prevalence of crime among we and above all to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that spring up now in one part of our country now in another each section north south east or west have its own fault no section can with wisdom spend its time jeer at the fault of another section it should be busy try to amend its own shortcoming to deal with the crime of corruption it be necessary to have an awakened public conscience and to supplement this by whatever legislation will add speed and certainty in the execution of the law when we deal with lynching even mote be necessary a great many white man be lynch but the crime be peculiarly frequent in respect to black man the great exist cause of lynching be the perpetration especially by black man of the hideous crime of rape the most abominable in all the category of crime even bad than murder mobs frequently avenge the commission of this crime by themselves torture to death the man commit it thus avenge in bestial fashion a bestial deed and reduce themselves to a level with the criminal lawlessness grow by what it feed upon and when mob begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operation and lynch for many other kind of crime so that two third of the lynching be not for rape at all while a considerable proportion of the individual lynch be innocent of all crime governor candler of georgia state on one occasion some year ago i can say of a verity that i have within the last month save the life of half a dozen innocent negroes who be pursue by the mob and bring they to trial in a court of law in which they be acquit as bishop galloway of mississippi have finely say when the rule of a mob obtain that which distinguish a high civilization be surrender the mob which lynch a negro charge with rape will in a little while lynch a white man suspect of crime every christian patriot in america need to lift up his voice in loud and eternal protest against the mob spirit that be threaten the integrity of this republic governor jelks of alabama have recently speak as follow the lynching of any person for whatever crime be inexcusable anywhere it be a defiance of orderly government but the killing of innocent people under any provocation be infinitely more horrible and yet innocent people be likely to die when a mob 's terrible lust be once arouse the lesson be this no good citizen can afford to countenance a defiance of the statute no matter what the provocation the innocent frequently suffer and it be my observation more usually suffer than the guilty the white people of the south indict the whole colored race on the ground that even the well element lend no assistance whatever in ferret out criminal of their own color the respectable colored people must learn not to harbor their criminal but to assist the officer in bring they to justice this be the large crime and it provoke such atrocious offense as the one at atlanta the two race can never get on until there be an understanding on the part of both to make common cause with the law abide against criminal of any color "moreover where any crime commit by a member of one race against a member of another race be avenge in such fashion that it seem as if not the individual criminal but the whole race be attack the result be to exasperate to the high degree race feeling there be but one safe rule in deal with black man as with white man it be the same rule that must be apply in deal with rich man and poor man that be to treat each man whatever his color his creed or his social position with even handed justice on his real worth as a man white people owe it quite as much to themselves as to the colored race to treat well the colored man who show by his life that he deserve such treatment for it be surely the high wisdom to encourage in the colored race all those individual who be honest industrious law abide and who therefore make good and safe neighbor and citizen reward or punish the individual on his merit as an individual evil will surely come in the end to both race if we substitute for this just rule the habit of treat all the member of the race good and bad alike there be no question of social equality or negro domination involve only the question of relentlessly punish bad man and of securing to the good man the right to his life his liberty and the pursuit of his happiness as his own quality of heart head and hand enable he to achieve it every colored man should realize that the bad enemy of his race be the negro criminal and above all the negro criminal who commit the dreadful crime of rape and it should be feel as in the high degree an offense against the whole country and against the colored race in particular for a colored man to fail to help the officer of the law in hunt down with all possible earnestness and zeal every such infamous offender moreover in my judgment the crime of rape should always be punish with death as be the case with murder assault with intent to commit rape should be make a capital crime at least in the discretion of the court and provision should be make by which the punishment may follow immediately upon the heel of the offense while the trial should be so conduct that the victim need not be wantonly shame while give testimony and that the least possible publicity shall be give to the detail the member of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represent by just so much a loosening of the band of civilization that the spirit of lynching inevitably throw into prominence in the community all the foul and evil creature who dwell therein no man can take part in the torture of a human being without have his own moral nature permanently lower every lynching mean just so much moral deterioration in all the child who have any knowledge of it and therefore just so much additional trouble for the next generation of americans let justice be both sure and swift but let it be justice under the law and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob there be another matter which have a direct bearing upon this matter of lynching and of the brutal crime which sometimes call it forth and at other time merely furnish the excuse for its existence it be out of the question for our people as a whole permanently to rise by treading down any of their own number even those who themselves for the moment profit by such maltreatment of their fellow will in the long run also suffer no more shortsighted policy can be imagine than in the fancied interest of one class to prevent the education of another class the free public school the chance for each boy or girl to get a good elementary education lie at the foundation of our whole political situation in every community the poor citizen those who need the school most would be deprive of they if they only receive school facility proportion to the taxis they pay this be as true of one portion of our country as of another it be as true for the negro as for the white man the white man if he be wise will decline to allow the negroes in a mass to grow to manhood and womanhood without education unquestionably education such as be obtain in our public school do not do everything towards make a man a good citizen but it do much the low and most brutal criminal those for instance who commit the crime of rape be in the great majority man who have have either no education or very little just as they be almost invariably man who own no property for the man who put money by out of his earning like the man who acquire education be usually lift above mere brutal criminality of course the good type of education for the colored man take as a whole be such education as be confer in school like hampton and tuskegee where the boy and girl the young man and young woman be train industrially as well as in the ordinary public school branch the graduate of these school turn out well in the great majority of case and hardly any of they become criminal while what little criminality there be never take the form of that brutal violence which invite lynch law every graduate of these school and for the matter of that every other colored man or woman who lead a life so useful and honorable as to win the good will and respect of those white whose neighbor he or she be thereby help the whole colored race as it can be help in no other way for next to the negro himself the man who can do most to help the negro be his white neighbor who live near he and our steady effort should be to well the relation between the two great tho the benefit of these school have be to their colored pupil and to the colored people it may well be question whether the benefit have not be at least as great to the white people among whom these colored pupil live after they graduate be it remember furthermore that the individual who whether from folly from evil temper from greed for office or in a spirit of mere base demagogy indulge in the inflammatory and incendiary speech and writing which tend to arouse mob and to bring about lynching not only thus excite the mob but also tend by what criminologist call suggestion greatly to increase the likelihood of a repetition of the very crime against which they be inveigh when the mob be compose of the people of one race and the man lynch be of another race the man who in their speech and writing either excite or justify the action tend of course to excite a bitter race feeling and to cause the people of the opposite race to lose sight of the abominable act of the criminal himself and in addition by the prominence they give to the hideous deed they undoubtedly tend to excite in other brutal and depraved nature thought of commit it swift relentless and orderly punishment under the law be the only way by which criminality of this type can permanently be suppr in deal with both labor and capital with the question affect both corporation and trade union there be one matter more important to remember than aught else and that be the infinite harm do by preacher of mere discontent these be the man who seek to excite a violent class hatred against all man of wealth they seek to turn wise and proper movement for the well control of corporation and for do away with the abuse connect with wealth into a campaign of hysterical excitement and falsehood in which the aim be to inflame to madness the brutal passion of mankind the sinister demagog and foolish visionary who be always eager to undertake such a campaign of destruction sometimes seek to associate themselves with those work for a genuine reform in governmental and social method and sometimes masquerade as such reformer in reality they be the bad enemy of the cause they profess to advocate just as the purveyor of sensational slander in newspaper or magazine be the bad enemy of all man who be engage in an honest effort to better what be bad in our social and governmental condition to preach hatred of the rich man as such to carry on a campaign of slander and invective against he to seek to mislead and inflame to madness honest man whose life be hard and who have not the kind of mental training which will permit they to appreciate the danger in the doctrine preach all this be to commit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every worthy principle and tradition of american national life moreover while such preaching and such agitation may give a livelihood and a certain notoriety to some of those who take part in it and may result in the temporary political success of other in the long run every such movement will either fail or else will provoke a violent reaction which will itself result not merely in undo the mischief work by the demagog and the agitator but also in undo the good that the honest reformer the true upholder of popular right have painfully and laboriously achieve corruption be never so rife as in community where the demagog and the agitator bear full sway because in such community all moral band become loosened and hysteria and sensationalism replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as between man and man in sheer revolt against the squalid anarchy thus produce man be sure in the end to turn toward any leader who can restore order and then their relief at be free from the intolerable burden of class hatred violence and demagogy be such that they can not for some time be arouse to indignation against misdeed by man of wealth so that they permit a new growth of the very abuse which be in part responsible for the original outbreak the one hope for success for our people lie in a resolute and fearless but sane and cool headed advance along the path mark out last year by this very congress there must be a stern refusal to be mislead into follow either that base creature who appeal and pander to the low instinct and passion in order to arouse one set of americans against their fellow or that other creature equally base but no baser who in a spirit of greed or to accumulate or add to an already huge fortune seek to exploit his fellow americans with callous disregard to their welfare of soul and body the man who debauch other in order to obtain a high office stand on an evil equality of corruption with the man who debauch other for financial profit and when hatred be sow the crop which spring up can only be evil the plain people who think the mechanic farmer merchant worker with head or hand the man to whom american tradition be dear who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbor owe it to themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be give popular government be to elect an unworthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy whenever such an issue be raise in this country nothing can be gain by flinch from it for in such case democracy be itself on trial popular self government under republican form be itself on trial the triumph of the mob be just as evil a thing as the triumph of the plutocracy and to have escape one danger avail nothing whatever if we succumb to the other in the end the honest man whether rich or poor who earn his own living and try to deal justly by his fellow have as much to fear from the insincere and unworthy demagog promise much and perform nothing or else perform nothing but evil who would set on the mob to plunder the rich as from the crafty corruptionist who for his own end would permit the common people to be exploit by the very wealthy if we ever let this government fall into the hand of man of either of these two class we shall show ourselves false to america 's past moreover the demagog and the corruptionist often work hand in hand there be at this moment wealthy reactionary of such obtuse morality that they regard the public servant who prosecute they when they violate the law or who seek to make they bear their proper share of the public burden as be even more objectionable than the violent agitator who hound on the mob to plunder the rich there be nothing to choose between such a reactionary and such an agitator fundamentally they be alike in their selfish disregard of the right of other and it be natural that they should join in opposition to any movement of which the aim be fearlessly to do exact and even justice to all i call your attention to the need of pass the bill limit the number of hour of employment of railroad employee the measure be a very moderate one and i can conceive of no serious objection to it indeed so far as it be in our power it should be our aim steadily to reduce the number of hour of labor with as a goal the general introduction of an eight hour day there be industry in which it be not possible that the hour of labor should be reduce just as there be community not far enough advance for such a movement to be for their good or if in the tropics so situate that there be no analogy between their need and our in this matter on the isthmus of panama for instance the condition be in every way so different from what they be here that an eight hour day would be absurd just as it be absurd so far as the isthmus be concern where white labor can not be employ to bother as to whether the necessary work be do by alien black man or by alien yellow man but the wageworker of the united states be of so high a grade that alike from the merely industrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint it should be our object to do what we can in the direction of secure the general observance of an eight hour day until recently the eight hour law on our federal statute book have be very scantily observe now however largely thru the instrumentality of the bureau of labor it be be rigidly enforce and i shall speedily be able to say whether or not there be need of further legislation in reference thereto .for our purpose be to see it obey in spirit no less than in letter half holiday during summer should be establish for government employee it be as desirable for wageworker who toil with their hand as for salaried official whose labor be mental that there should be a reasonable amount of holiday the congress at its last session wisely provide for a truant court for the district of columbia a marked step in advance on the path of properly care for the child let i again urge that the congress provide for a thoro investigation of the condition of child labor and of the labor of woman in the united states more and more our people be grow to recognize the fact that the question which be not merely of industrial but of social importance outweigh all other and these two question most emphatically come in the category of those which affect in the most far reach way the home life of the nation the horror incident to the employment of young child in factory or at work anywhere be a blot on our civilization it be true that each state must ultimately settle the question in its own way but a thoro official investigation of the matter with the result publish broadcast would greatly help toward arouse the public conscience and secure unity of state action in the matter there be however one law on the subject which should be enact immediately because there be no need for an investigation in reference thereto and the failure to enact it be discreditable to the national government a drastic and thorogoe child labor law should be enact for the district of columbia and the territories among the excellent law which the congress past at the last session be an employer liability law it be a marked step in advance to get the recognition of employer liability on the statute book but the law do not go far enough in spite of all precaution exercise by employer there be unavoidable accident and even death involve in nearly every line of business connect with the mechanic art this inevitable sacrifice of life may be reduce to a minimum but it can not be completely eliminate it be a great social injustice to compel the employee or rather the family of the killed or disabled victim to bear the entire burden of such an inevitable sacrifice in other word society shirk its duty by lay the whole cost on the victim whereas the injury come from what may be call the legitimate risk of the trade compensation for accident or death due in any line of industry to the actual condition under which that industry be carry on should be pay by that portion of the community for the benefit of which the industry be carry on that is by those who profit by the industry if the entire trade risk be place upon the employer he will promptly and properly add it to the legitimate cost of production and assess it proportionately upon the consumer of his commodity it be therefore clear to my mind that the law should place this entire risk of a trade upon the employer neither the federal law nor as far as i be inform the state law deal with the question of employer liability be sufficiently thorogoe the federal law should of course include employee in navy yard arsenal and the like the commission appoint by the president october 16 1902 at the request of both the anthracite coal operator and miner to inquire into consider and pass upon the question in controversy in connection with the strike in the anthracite region of pennsylvania and the cause out of which the controversy arise in their report finding and award expr the belief that the state and federal government should provide the machinery for what may be call the compulsory investigation of controversy between employer and employee when they arise this expression of belief be deserve of the favorable consideration of the congress and the enactment of its provision into law a bill have already be introduce to this end record show that during the twenty year from january 1 1881 to december 31 1900 there be strike affect 117,509 establishment and 6,105,694 employee be throw out of employment during the same period there be 1,005 lockout involve nearly 10,000 establishment throw over one million people out of employment these strike and lockout involve an estimate loss to employee of $ 307,000,000 and to employer of $ 143,000,000 a total of $ 450,000,000 the public suffer directly and indirectly probably as great additional loss but the money loss great as it be do not measure the anguish and suffering endure by the wife and child of employee whose pay stopt when their work stopt or the disastrous effect of the strike or lockout upon the business of employer or the increase in the cost of product and the inconvenience and loss to the public many of these strike and lockout would not have occur have the party to the dispute be require to appear before an unprejudiced body represent the nation and face to face state the reason for their contention in most instance the dispute would doubtless be find to be due to a misunderstanding by each of the other 's right aggravate by an unwillingness of either party to accept as true the statement of the other as to the justice or injustice of the matter in dispute the exercise of a judicial spirit by a disinterested body represent the federal government such as would be provide by a commission on conciliation and arbitration would tend to create an atmosphere of friendliness and conciliation between contend party and the give each side an equal opportunity to present fully its case in the presence of the other would prevent many dispute from develop into serious strike or lockout and in other case would enable the commission to persuade the oppose party to come to term in this age of great corporate and labor combination neither employer nor employee should be leave completely at the mercy of the strong party to a dispute regardless of the righteousness of their respective claim the propose measure would be in the line of secure recognition of the fact that in many strike the public have itself an interest which can not wisely be disregard an interest not merely of general convenience for the question of a just and proper public policy must also be consider in all legislation of this kind it be well to advance cautiously test each step by the actual result the step propose can surely be safely take for the decision of the commission would not bind the party in legal fashion and yet would give a chance for public opinion to crystallize and thus to exert its full force for the right it be not wise that the nation should alienate its remain coal land i have temporarily withdraw from settlement all the land which the geological survey have indicate as contain or in all probability contain coal the question however can be properly settle only by legislation which in my judgment should provide for the withdrawal of these land from sale or from entry save in certain especial circumstance the ownership would then remain in the united states which should not however attempt to work they but permit they to be work by private individual under a royalty system the government keep such control as to permit it to see that no excessive price be charge consumer it would of course be as necessary to supervise the rate charge by the common carrier to transport the product as the rate charge by those who mine it and the supervision must extend to the conduct of the common carrier so that they shall in no way favor one competitor at the expense of another the withdrawal of these coal land would constitute a policy analogous to that which have be follow in withdraw the forest land from ordinary settlement the coal like the forest should be treat as the property of the public and its disposal should be under condition which would inure to the benefit of the public as a whole the present congress have take long stride in the direction of secure proper supervision and control by the national government over corporation engage in interstate business and the enormous majority of corporation of any size be engage in interstate business the passage of the railway rate bill and only to a less degree the passage of the pure food bill and the provision for increase and render more effective national control over the beef pack industry mark an important advance in the proper direction in the short session it will perhaps be difficult to do much far along this line and it may be good to wait until the law have be in operation for a number of month before endeavor to increase their scope because only operation will show with exactness their merit and their shortcoming and thus give opportunity to define what further remedial legislation be need yet in my judgment it will in the end be advisable in connection with the packing house inspection law to provide for put a date on the label and for charge the cost of inspection to the packer all these law have already justify their enactment the interstate commerce law for instance have rather amusingly falsify the prediction both of those who assert that it would ruin the railroad and of those who assert that it do not go far enough and would accomplish nothing during the last five month the railroad have show increase earning and some of they unusual dividend while during the same period the mere take effect of the law have produce an unprecedented a hitherto unheard of number of voluntary reduction in freight and fare by the railroad since the founding of the commission there have never be a time of equal length in which anything like so many reduced tariff have be put into effect on august 27 for instance two day before the new law go into effect the commission receive notice of over five thousand separate tariff which represent reduction from previous rate it must not be suppose however that with the passage of these law it will be possible to stop progress along the line of increase the power of the national government over the use of capital interstate commerce for example there will ultimately be need of enlarge the power of the interstate commerce commission along several different line so as to give it a large and more efficient control over the railroad it can not too often be repeat that experience have conclusively show the impossibility of securing by the action of nearly half a hundred different state legislature anything but ineffective chaos in the way of deal with the great corporation which do not operate exclusively within the limit of any one state in some method whether by a national license law or in other fashion we must exercise and that at an early date a far more complete control than at present over these great corporation a control that will among other thing prevent the evil of excessive overcapitalization and that will compel the disclosure by each big corporation of its stockholder and of its property and business whether own directly or thru subsidiary or affiliated corporation this will tend to put a stop to the securing of inordinate profit by favor individual at the expense whether of the general public the stockholder or the wageworker our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such but so to supervise and control it as to see that it result in no harm to the people the reactionary or ultraconservative apologist for the misuse of wealth assail the effort to secure such control as a step toward socialism as a matter of fact it be these reactionary and ultraconservative who be themselves most potent in increase socialistic feeling one of the most efficient method of avert the consequence of a dangerous agitation which be 80 per cent wrong be to remedy the 20 per cent of evil as to which the agitation be well rounded the good way to avert the very undesirable move for the government ownership of railway be to secure by the government on behalf of the people as a whole such adequate control and regulation of the great interstate common carrier as will do away with the evil which give rise to the agitation against they so the proper antidote to the dangerous and wicked agitation against the man of wealth as such be to secure by proper legislation and executive action the abolition of the grave abuse which actually do obtain in connection with the business use of wealth under our present system or rather no system of failure to exercise any adequate control at all some person speak as if the exercise of such governmental control would do away with the freedom of individual initiative and dwarf individual effort this be not a fact it would be a veritable calamity to fail to put a premium upon individual initiative individual capacity and effort upon the energy character and foresight which it be so important to encourage in the individual but as a matter of fact the deadening and degrading effect of pure socialism and especially of its extreme form communism and the destruction of individual character which they would bring about be in part achieve by the wholly unregulated competition which result in a single individual or corporation rise at the expense of all other until his or its rise effectually check all competition and reduce former competitor to a position of utter inferiority and subordination in enact and enforce such legislation as this congress already have to its credit we be work on a coherent plan with the steady endeavor to secure the need reform by the joint action of the moderate man the plain man who do not wish anything hysterical or dangerous but who do intend to deal in resolute common sense fashion with the real and great evil of the present system the reactionary and the violent extremist show symptom of join hand against we both assert for instance that if logical we should go to government ownership of railroad and the like the reactionary because on such an issue they think the people would stand with they while the extremist care rather to preach discontent and agitation than to achieve solid result as a matter of fact our position be as remote from that of the bourbon reactionary as from that of the impracticable or sinister visionary we hold that the government should not conduct the business of the nation but that it should exercise such supervision as will insure its being conduct in the interest of the nation our aim be so far as may be to secure for all decent hard work man equality of opportunity and equality of burden the actual working of our law have show that the effort to prohibit all combination good or bad be noxious where it be not ineffective combination of capital like combination of labor be a necessary element of our present industrial system it be not possible completely to prevent it and if it be possible such complete prevention would do damage to the body politic what we need be not vainly to try to prevent all combination but to secure such rigorous and adequate control and supervision of the combination as to prevent their injure the public or exist in such form as inevitably to threaten injury for the mere fact that a combination have secure practically complete control of a necessary of life would under any circumstance show that such combination be to be presume to be adverse to the public interest it be unfortunate that our present law should forbid all combination instead of sharply discriminate between those combination which do good and those combination which do evil rebate for instance be as often due to the pressure of big shipper as be show in the investigation of the standard oil company and as have be show since by the investigation of the tobacco and sugar trust as to the initiative of big railroad often railroad would like to combine for the purpose of prevent a big shipper from maintain improper advantage at the expense of small shipper and of the general public such a combination instead of be forbid by law should be favor in other word it should be permit to railroad to make agreement provide these agreement be sanction by the interstate commerce commission and be publish with these two condition comply with it be impossible to see what harm such a combination could do to the public at large it be a public evil to have on the statute book a law incapable of full enforcement because both judge and jury realize that its full enforcement would destroy the business of the country for the result be to make decent railroad man violator of the law against their will and to put a premium on the behavior of the wilful wrongdoer such a result in turn tend to throw the decent man and the wilful wrongdoer into close association and in the end to drag down the former to the latter 's level for the man who become a lawbreaker in one way unhappily tend to lose all respect for law and to be willing to break it in many way no more scathing condemnation could be visit upon a law than be contain in the word of the interstate commerce commission when in comment upon the fact that the numerous joint traffic association do technically violate the law they say the decision of the united states supreme court in the trans missouri case and the joint traffic association case have produce no practical effect upon the railway operation of the country such association in fact exist now as they do before these decision and with the same general effect in justice to all party we ought probably to add that it be difficult to see how our interstate railway could be operate with due regard to the interest of the shipper and the railway without concerted action of the kind afford thru these association "this mean that the law as construe by the supreme court be such that the business of the country can not be conduct without break it i recommend that you give careful and early consideration to this subject and if you find the opinion of the interstate commerce commission justify that you amend the law so as to obviate the evil disclose the question of taxation be difficult in any country but it be especially difficult in our with its federal system of government some taxis should on every ground be levy in a small district for use in that district thus the taxation of real estate be peculiarly one for the immediate locality in which the real estate be find again there be no more legitimate tax for any state than a tax on the franchise confer by that state upon street railroad and similar corporation which operate wholly within the state boundary sometimes in one and sometimes in several municipality or other minor division of the state but there be many kind of taxis which can only be levy by the general government so as to produce the good result because among other reason the attempt to impose they in one particular state too often result merely in drive the corporation or individual affect to some other locality or other state the national government have long derive its chief revenue from a tariff on import and from an internal or excise tax in addition to these there be every reason why when next our system of taxation be revise the national government should impose a graduated inheritance tax and if possible a graduated income tax the man of great wealth owe a peculiar obligation to the state because he derive special advantage from the mere existence of government not only should he recognize this obligation in the way he lead his daily life and in the way he earn and spend his money but it should also be recognize by the way in which he pay for the protection the state give he on the one hand it be desirable that he should assume his full and proper share of the burden of taxation on the other hand it be quite as necessary that in this kind of taxation where the man who vote the tax pay but little of it there should be clear recognition of the danger of inaugurate any such system save in a spirit of entire justice and moderation whenever we as a people undertake to remodel our taxation system along the line suggest we must make it clear beyond peradventure that our aim be to distribute the burden of support the government more equitably than at present that we intend to treat rich man and poor man on a basis of absolute equality and that we regard it as equally fatal to true democracy to do or permit injustice to the one as to do or permit injustice to the other i be well aware that such a subject as this need long and careful study in order that the people may become familiar with what be propose to be do may clearly see the necessity of proceed with wisdom and self restraint and may make up their mind just how far they be willing to go in the matter while only train legislator can work out the project in necessary detail but i feel that in the near future our national legislator should enact a law provide for a graduated inheritance tax by which a steadily increase rate of duty should be put upon all money or other valuable come by gift bequest or devise to any individual or corporation it may be well to make the tax heavy in proportion as the individual benefit be remote of kin in any event in my judgment the pro rata of the tax should increase very heavily with the increase of the amount leave to any one individual after a certain point have be reach it be most desirable to encourage thrift and ambition and a potent source of thrift and ambition be the desire on the part of the breadwinner to leave his child well off this object can be attain by make the tax very small on moderate amount of property left because the prime object should be to put a constantly increase burden on the inheritance of those swollen fortune which it be certainly of no benefit to this country to perpetuate there can be no question of the ethical propriety of the government thus determine the condition upon which any gift or inheritance should be receive exactly how far the inheritance tax would as an incident have the effect of limit the transmission by devise or gift of the enormous fortune in question it be not necessary at present to discuss it be wise that progress in this direction should be gradual at first a permanent national inheritance tax while it might be more substantial than any such tax have hitherto be need not approximate either in amount or in the extent of the increase by graduation to what such a tax should ultimately be this species of tax have again and again be impose altho only temporarily by the national government it be first impose by the act of july 6 1797 when the maker of the constitution be alive and at the head of affair it be a graduated tax tho small in amount the rate be increase with the amount leave to any individual exception be make in the case of certain close kin a similar tax be again impose by the act of july 1 1862 a minimum sum of one thousand dollar in personal property be except from taxation the tax then become progressive accord to the remoteness of kin the war revenue act of june 13 1898 provide for an inheritance tax on any sum exceed the value of ten thousand dollar the rate of the tax increase both in accordance with the amount leave and in accordance with the legatee 's remoteness of kin the supreme court have hold that the succession tax impose at the time of the civil war be not a direct tax but an impost or excise which be both constitutional and valid more recently the court in an opinion deliver by mr. justice white which contain an exceedingly able and elaborate discussion of the power of the congress to impose death duty sustain the constitutionality of the inheritance tax feature of the war revenue act of 1898.in its incident and apart from the main purpose of raise revenue an income tax stand on an entirely different footing from an inheritance tax because it involve no question of the perpetuation of fortune swell to an unhealthy size the question be in its essence a question of the proper adjustment of burden to benefit as the law now stand it be undoubtedly difficult to devise a national income tax which shall be constitutional but whether it be absolutely impossible be another question and if possible it be most certainly desirable the first purely income tax law be past by the congress in 1861 but the most important law deal with the subject be that of 1894 this the court hold to be unconstitutional the question be undoubtedly very intricate delicate and troublesome the decision of the court be only reach by one majority it be the law of the land and of course be accept as such and loyally obey by all good citizen nevertheless the hesitation evidently feel by the court as a whole in come to a conclusion when consider together with the previous decision on the subject may perhaps indicate the possibility of devise a constitutional income tax law which shall substantially accomplish the result aim at the difficulty of amend the constitution be so great that only real necessity can justify a resort thereto every effort should be make in deal with this subject as with the subject of the proper control by the national government over the use of corporate wealth in interstate business to devise legislation which without such action shall attain the desire end but if this fail there will ultimately be no alternative to a constitutional amendment it would be impossible to overstate tho it be of course difficult quantitatively to measure the effect upon a nation 's growth to greatness of what may be call organize patriotism which necessarily include the substitution of a national feeling for mere local pride with as a resultant a high ambition for the whole country no country can develop its full strength so long as the part which make up the whole each put a feeling of loyalty to the part above the feeling of loyalty to the whole this be true of section and it be just as true of class the industrial and agricultural class must work together capitalist and wageworker must work together if the good work of which the country be capable be to be do it be probable that a thoroly efficient system of education come next to the influence of patriotism in bring about national success of this kind our federal form of government so fruitful of advantage to our people in certain way in other way undoubtedly limit our national effectiveness it be not possible for instance for the national government to take the lead in technical industrial education to see that the public school system of this country develop on all its technical industrial scientific and commercial side this must be leave primarily to the several states nevertheless the national government have control of the school of the district of columbia and it should see that these school promote and encourage the full development of the scholar in both commercial and industrial training the commercial training should in one of its branch deal with foreign trade the industrial training be even more important it should be one of our prime object as a nation so far as feasible constantly to work toward put the mechanic the wageworker who work with his hand on a high plane of efficiency and reward so as to increase his effectiveness in the economic world and the dignity the remuneration and the power of his position in the social world unfortunately at present the effect of some of the work in the public school be in the exactly opposite direction if boy and girl be train merely in literary accomplishment to the total exclusion of industrial manual and technical training the tendency be to unfit they for industrial work and to make they reluctant to go into it or unfit to do well if they do go into it this be a tendency which should be strenuously combat our industrial development depend largely upon technical education include in this term all industrial education from that which fit a man to be a good mechanic a good carpenter or blacksmith to that which fit a man to do the great engineering feat the skilled mechanic the skilled workman can well become such by technical industrial education the far reach usefulness of institute of technology and school of mine or of engineering be now universally acknowledge and no less far reach be the effect of a good building or mechanical trade school a textile or watch making or engrave school all such training must develop not only manual dexterity but industrial intelligence in international rivalry this country do not have to fear the competition of pauper labor as much as it have to fear the educate labor of specially train competitor and we should have the education of the hand eye and brain which will fit we to meet such competition in every possible way we should help the wageworker who toil with his hand and who must we hope in a constantly increase measure also toil with his brain under the constitution the national legislature can do but little of direct importance for his welfare save where he be engage in work which permit it to act under the interstate commerce clause of the constitution and this be one reason why i so earnestly hope that both the legislative and judicial branch of the government will construe this clause of the constitution in the broad possible manner we can however in such a matter as industrial training in such a matter as child labor and factory law set an example to the states by enact the most advanced legislation that can wisely be enact for the district of columbia the only other person whose welfare be as vital to the welfare of the whole country as be the welfare of the wageworker be the tiller of the soil the farmer it be a mere truism to say that no growth of city no growth of wealth no industrial development can atone for any fall off in the character and standing of the farming population during the last few decade this fact have be recognize with ever increase clearness there be no long any failure to realize that farming at least in certain branch must become a technical and scientific profession this mean that there must be open to farmer the chance for technical and scientific training not theoretical merely but of the most severely practical type the farmer represent a peculiarly high type of american citizenship and he must have the same chance to rise and develop as other american citizen have moreover it be exactly as true of the farmer as it be of the business man and the wageworker that the ultimate success of the nation of which he form a part must be found not alone on material prosperity but upon high moral mental and physical development this education of the farmer self education by preference but also education from the outside as with all other man be peculiarly necessary here in the united states where the frontier condition even in the new states have now nearly vanish where there must be a substitution of a more intensive system of cultivation for the old wasteful farm management and where there must be a well business organization among the farmer themselves several factor must cooperate in the improvement of the farmer 's condition he must have the chance to be educate in the wide possible sense in the sense which keep ever in view the intimate relationship between the theory of education and the fact of life in all education we should widen our aim it be a good thing to produce a certain number of train scholar and student but the education superintend by the state must seek rather to produce a hundred good citizen than merely one scholar and it must be turn now and then from the class book to the study of the great book of nature itself this be especially true of the farmer as have be point out again and again by all observer most competent to pass practical judgment on the problem of our country life all student now realize that education must seek to train the executive power of young people and to confer more real significance upon the phrase dignity of labor and to prepare the pupil so that in addition to each develop in the high degree his individual capacity for work they may together help create a right public opinion and show in many way social and cooperative spirit organization have become necessary in the business world and it have accomplish much for good in the world of labor it be no less necessary for farmer such a movement as the grange movement be good in itself and be capable of a well nigh infinite further extension for good so long as it be keep to its own legitimate business the benefit to be derive by the association of farmer for mutual advantage be partly economic and partly sociological moreover while in the long run voluntary effort will prove more efficacious than government assistance while the farmer must primarily do most for themselves yet the government can also do much the department of agriculture have break new ground in many direction and year by year it find how it can improve its method and develop fresh usefulness its constant effort be to give the governmental assistance in the most effective way that is thru association of farmer rather than to or thru individual farmer it be also strive to coordinate its work with the agricultural department of the several states and so far as its own work be educational to coordinate it with the work of other educational authority agricultural education be necessarily base upon general education but our agricultural educational institution be wisely specialize themselves make their course relate to the actual teaching of the agricultural and kindre science to young country people or young city people who wish to live in the country great progress have already be make among farmer by the creation of farmer institute of dairy association of breeder association horticultural association and the like a striking example of how the government and the farmer can cooperate be show in connection with the menace offer to the cotton grower of the southern states by the advance of the boll weevil the department be do all it can to organize the farmer in the threatened district just as it have be do all it can to organize they in aid of its work to eradicate the cattle fever tick in the south the department can and will cooperate with all such association and it must have their help if its own work be to be do in the most efficient style much be now be do for the states of the rocky mountains and great plains thru the development of the national policy of irrigation and forest preservation no government policy for the betterment of our internal condition have be more fruitful of good than this the forest of the white mountains and southern appalachian region should also be preserve and they can not be unless the people of the states in which they lie thru their representative in the congress secure vigorous action by the national government i invite the attention of the congress to the estimate of the secretary of war for an appropriation to enable he to begin the preliminary work for the construction of a memorial amphitheater at arlington the grand army of the republic in its national encampment have urge the erection of such an amphitheater as necessary for the proper observance of memorial day and as a fitting monument to the soldier and sailor dead bury there in this i heartily concur and commend the matter to the favorable consideration of the congress i be well aware of how difficult it be to pass a constitutional amendment nevertheless in my judgment the whole question of marriage and divorce should be relegate to the authority of the national congress at present the wide difference in the law of the different state on this subject result in scandal and abuse and surely there be nothing so vitally essential to the welfare of the nation nothing around which the nation should so bend itself to throw every safeguard as the home life of the average citizen the change would be good from every standpoint in particular it would be good because it would confer on the congress the power at once to deal radically and efficiently with polygamy and this should be do whether or not marriage and divorce be deal with it be neither safe nor proper to leave the question of polygamy to be deal with by the several states power to deal with it should be confer on the national government when home tie be loosen when man and woman cease to regard a worthy family life with all its duty fully perform and all its responsibility live up to as the life well worth living then evil day for the commonwealth be at hand there be region in our land and class of our population where the birth rate have sink below the death rate surely it should need no demonstration to show that wilful sterility be from the standpoint of the nation from the standpoint of the human race the one sin for which the penalty be national death race death a sin for which there be no atonement a sin which be the more dreadful exactly in proportion as the man and woman guilty thereof be in other respect in character and bodily and mental power those whom for the sake of the state it would be well to see the father and mother of many healthy child well bring up in home make happy by their presence no man no woman can shirk the primary duty of life whether for love of ease and pleasure or for any other cause and retain his or her self respect let i once again call the attention of the congress to two subject concern which i have frequently before communicate with they one be the question of develop american shipping i trust that a law embody in substance the view or a major part of the view expr in the report on this subject lay before the house at its last session will be past i be well aware that in former year objectionable measure have be propose in reference to the encouragement of american shipping but it seem to i that the propose measure be as nearly unobjectionable as any can be it will of course benefit primarily our seaboard states such as maine louisiana and washington but what benefit part of our people in the end benefit all just as government aid to irrigation and forestry in the west be really of benefit not only to the rocky mountain states but to all our country if it prove impracticable to enact a law for the encouragement of ship generally then at least provision should be make for well communication with south america notably for fast mail line to the chief south american port it be discreditable to we that our business people for lack of direct communication in the shape of line of steamer with south america should in that great sister continent be at a disadvantage compare to the business people of europe i especially call your attention to the second subject the condition of our currency law the national bank act have ably serve a great purpose in aid the enormous business development of the country and within ten year there have be an increase in circulation per capita from $ 21.41 to $ 33.08 for several year evidence have be accumulate that additional legislation be need the recurrence of each crop season emphasize the defect of the present law there must soon be a revision of they because to leave they as they be means to incur liability of business disaster since your body adjourn there have be a fluctuation in the interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30 per cent and the fluctuation be even great during the precede six month the secretary of the treasury have to step in and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation even bad than such fluctuation be the advance in commercial rate and the uncertainty feel in the sufficiency of credit even at high rate all commercial interest suffer during each crop period excessive rate for call money in new york attract money from the interior bank into the speculative field this deplete the fund that would otherwise be available for commercial use and commercial borrower be force to pay abnormal rate so that each fall a tax in the shape of increase interest charge be place on the whole commerce of the country the mere statement of these have show that our present system be seriously defective there be need of a change unfortunately however many of the propose change must be rule from consideration because they be complicated be not easy of comprehension and tend to disturb exist right and interest we must also rule out any plan which would materially impair the value of the united states 2 per cent bond now pledge to secure circulation the issue of which be make under condition peculiarly creditable to the treasury i do not press any especial plan various plan have recently be propose by expert committee of banker among the plan which be possibly feasible and which certainly should receive your consideration be that repeatedly bring to your attention by the present secretary of the treasury the essential feature of which have be approve by many prominent banker and business man accord to this plan national bank should be permit to issue a specify proportion of their capital in note of a give kind the issue to be tax at so high a rate as to drive the note back when not want in legitimate trade this plan would not permit the issue of currency to give bank additional profit but to meet the emergency present by time of stringency i do not say that this be the right system i only advance it to emphasize my belief that there be need for the adoption of some system which shall be automatic and open to all sound bank so as to avoid all possibility of discrimination and favoritism such a plan would tend to prevent the spasm of high money and speculation which now obtain in the new york market for at present there be too much currency at certain season of the year and its accumulation at new york tempt banker to lend it at low rate for speculative purpose whereas at other time when the crop be be move there be urgent need for a large but temporary increase in the currency supply it must never be forget that this question concern business man generally quite as much as banker especially be this true of stockman farmer and business man in the west for at present at certain season of the year the difference in interest rate between the east and the west be from 6 to 10 per cent whereas in canada the correspond difference be but 2 per cent any plan must of course guard the interest of western and southern banker as carefully as it guard the interest of new york or chicago banker and must be draw from the standpoint of the farmer and the merchant no less than from the standpoint of the city banker and the country banker the law should be amend so as specifically to provide that the fund derive from custom duty may be treat by the secretary of the treasury as he treat fund obtain under the internal revenue law there should be a considerable increase in bill of small denomination permission should be give bank if necessary under settle restriction to retire their circulation to a large amount than three million a month i most earnestly hope that the bill to provide a low tariff for or else absolute free trade in philippine product will become a law no harm will come to any american industry and while there will be some small but real material benefit to the filipinos the main benefit will come by the showing make as to our purpose to do all in our power for their welfare so far our action in the philippines have be abundantly justify not mainly and indeed not primarily because of the add dignity it have give we as a nation by prove that we be capable honorably and efficiently to bear the international burden which a mighty people should bear but even more because of the immense benefit that have come to the people of the philippine islands in these island we be steadily introduce both liberty and order to a great degree than their people have ever before know we have secure justice we have provide an efficient police force and have put down ladronism only in the island of leyte and samar be the authority of our government resist and this by wild mountain tribe under the superstitious inspiration of fakir and pseudo religion leader we be constantly increase the measure of liberty accord the islander and next spring if condition warrant we shall take a great stride forward in test their capacity for self government by summon the first filipino legislative assembly and the way in which they stand this test will largely determine whether the self government thus grant will be increase or decrease for if we have err at all in the philippines it have be in proceed too rapidly in the direction of grant a large measure of self government we be build road we have for the immeasurable good of the people arrange for the building of railroad let we also see to it that they be give free access to our market this nation owe no more imperative duty to itself and mankind than the duty of manage the affair of all the island under the american flag the philippines porto rico and hawaii so as to make it evident that it be in every way to their advantage that the flag should fly over they american citizenship should be confer on the citizen of porto rico the harbor of san juan in porto rico should be dredge and improve the expense of the federal court of porto rico should be meet from the federal treasury the administration of the affair of porto rico together with those of the philippines hawaii and our other insular possession should all be direct under one executive department by preference the department of state or the department of war the need of hawaii be peculiar every aid should be give the island and our effort should be unceasing to develop they along the line of a community of small freeholder not of great planter with coolie till estate situate as this territory be in the middle of the pacific there be duty impose upon this small community which do not fall in like degree or manner upon any other american community this warrant our treat it differently from the way in which we treat territories contiguous to or surround by sister territories or other states and justify the setting aside of a portion of our revenue to be expend for educational and internal improvement therein hawaii be now make an effort to secure immigration fit in the end to assume the duty and burden of full american citizenship and whenever the leader in the various industry of those island finally adopt our ideal and heartily join our administration in endeavor to develop a middle class of substantial citizen a way will then be find to deal with the commercial and industrial problem which now appear to they so serious the good americanism be that which aim for stability and permanency of prosperous citizenship rather than immediate return on large masse of capital alaska 's need have be partially meet but there must be a complete reorganization of the governmental system as i have before indicate to you i ask your especial attention to this our fellow citizen who dwell on the shore of puget sound with characteristic energy be arrange to hold in seattle the alaska yukon pacific exposition its special aim include the upbuilding of alaska and the development of american commerce on the pacific ocean this exposition in its purpose and scope should appeal not only to the people of the pacific slope but to the people of the united states at large alaska since it be buy have yield to the government eleven million of dollar of revenue and have produce nearly three hundred million of dollar in gold fur and fish when properly develop it will become in large degree a land of home the country border the pacific ocean have a population more numerous than that of all the country of europe their annual foreign commerce amount to over three billion of dollar of which the share of the united states be some seven hundred million of dollar if this trade be thoroly understand and push by our manufacturer and producer the industry not only of the pacific slope but of all our country and particularly of our cotton grow state would be greatly benefit of course in order to get these benefit we must treat fairly the country with which we trade it be a mistake and it betray a spirit of foolish cynicism to maintain that all international governmental action be and must ever be base upon mere selfishness and that to advance ethical reason for such action be always a sign of hypocrisy this be no more necessarily true of the action of government than of the action of individual it be a sure sign of a base nature always to ascribe base motive for the action of other unquestionably no nation can afford to disregard proper consideration of self interest any more than a private individual can so do but it be equally true that the average private individual in any really decent community do many action with reference to other man in which he be guide not by self interest but by public spirit by regard for the right of other by a disintereste purpose to do good to other and to raise the tone of the community as a whole similarly a really great nation must often act and as a matter of fact often do act toward other nation in a spirit not in the least of mere self interest but pay heed chiefly to ethical reason and as the century go by this disinterestedness in international action this tendency of the individual comprise a nation to require that nation to act with justice toward its neighbor steadily grow and strengthen it be neither wise nor right for a nation to disregard its own need and it be foolish and may be wicked to think that other nation will disregard theirs but it be wicked for a nation only to regard its own interest and foolish to believe that such be the sole motive that actuate any other nation it should be our steady aim to raise the ethical standard of national action just as we strive to raise the ethical standard of individual action not only must we treat all nation fairly but we must treat with justice and good will all immigrant who come here under the law whether they be catholic or protestant jew or gentile whether they come from england or germany russia japan or italy matter nothing all we have a right to question be the man 's conduct if he be honest and upright in his dealing with his neighbor and with the state then he be entitle to respect and good treatment especially do we need to remember our duty to the stranger within our gate it be the sure mark of a low civilization a low morality to abuse or discriminate against or in any way humiliate such stranger who have come here lawfully and who be conduct himself properly to remember this be incumbent on every american citizen and it be of course peculiarly incumbent on every government official whether of the nation or of the several states i be prompt to say this by the attitude of hostility here and there assume toward the japanese in this country this hostility be sporadic and be limit to a very few place nevertheless it be most discreditable to we as a people and it may be fraught with the grave consequence to the nation the friendship between the united states and japan have be continuous since the time over half a century ago when commodore perry by his expedition to japan first open the island to western civilization since then the growth of japan have be literally astounding there be not only nothing to parallel it but nothing to approach it in the history of civilized mankind japan have a glorious and ancient past her civilization be old than that of the nation of northern europe the nation from whom the people of the united states have chiefly spring but fifty year ago japan 's development be still that of the middle ages during that fifty year the progress of the country in every walk in life have be a marvel to mankind and she now stand as one of the great of civilized nation great in the art of war and in the art of peace great in military in industrial in artistic development and achievement japanese soldier and sailor have show themselves equal in combat to any of whom history makes note she have produce great general and mighty admiral her fight man afloat and ashore show all the heroic courage the unquestioning unfaltere loyalty the splendid indifference to hardship and death which mark the loyal ronin and they show also that they possess the high ideal of patriotism japanese artist of every kind see their product eagerly seek for in all land the industrial and commercial development of japan have be phenomenal great than that of any other country during the same period at the same time the advance in science and philosophy be no less marked the admirable management of the japanese red cross during the late war the efficiency and humanity of the japanese official nurse and doctor win the respectful admiration of all acquaint with the fact thru the red cross the japanese people send over $ 100,000 to the sufferer of san francisco and the gift be accept with gratitude by our people the courtesy of the japanese nationally and individually have become proverbial to no other country have there be such an increase number of visitor from this land as to japan in return japanese have come here in great number they be welcome socially and intellectually in all our college and institution of high learning in all our professional and social body the japanese have win in a single generation the right to stand abreast of the foremost and most enlightened people of europe and america they have win on their own merit and by their own exertion the right to treatment on a basis of full and frank equality the overwhelming mass of our people cherish a lively regard and respect for the people of japan and in almost every quarter of the union the stranger from japan be treat as he deserve that is he be treat as the stranger from any part of civilized europe be and deserve to be treat but here and there a most unworthy feeling have manifest itself toward the japanese the feeling that have be show in shut they out from the common school in san francisco and in muttering against they in one or two other place because of their efficiency as worker to shut they out from the public school be a wicked absurdity when there be no first class college in the land include the university and college of california which do not gladly welcome japanese student and on which japanese student do not reflect credit we have as much to learn from japan as japan have to learn from we and no nation be fit to teach unless it be also willing to learn thruout japan americans be well treat and any failure on the part of americans at home to treat the japanese with a like courtesy and consideration be by just so much a confession of inferiority in our civilization our nation front on the pacific just as it front on the atlantic we hope to play a constantly grow part in the great ocean of the orient we wish as we ought to wish for a great commercial development in our dealing with asia and it be out of the question that we should permanently have such development unless we freely and gladly extend to other nation the same measure of justice and good treatment which we expect to receive in return it be only a very small body of our citizen that act badly where the federal government have power it will deal summarily with any such where the several states have power i earnestly ask that they also deal wisely and promptly with such conduct or else this small body of wrongdoer may bring shame upon the great mass of their innocent and right think fellow that is upon our nation as a whole good manner should be an international no less than an individual attribute i ask fair treatment for the japanese as i would ask fair treatment for germans or englishmen frenchmen russians or italians i ask it as due to humanity and civilization i ask it as due to ourselves because we must act uprightly toward all man i recommend to the congress that an act be past specifically provide for the naturalization of japanese who come here intend to become american citizen one of the great embarrassment attend the performance of our international obligation be the fact that the statutes of the united states be entirely inadequate they fail to give to the national government sufficiently ample power thru united states court and by the use of the army and navy to protect alien in the right secure to they under solemn treaty which be the law of the land i therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statute of the united states be so amend and add to as to enable the president act for the united states government which be responsible in our international relation to enforce the right of alien under treaty even as the law now be something can be do by the federal government toward this end and in the matter now before i affect the japanese everything that it be in my power to do will be do and all of the force military and civil of the united states which i may lawfully employ will be so employ there should however be no particle of doubt as to the power of the national government completely to perform and enforce its own obligation to other nation the mob of a single city may at any time perform act of lawless violence against some class of foreigner which would plunge we into war that city by itself would be powerless to make defense against the foreign power thus assault and if independent of this government it would never venture to perform or permit the performance of the act complain of the entire power and the whole duty to protect the offend city or the offend community lie in the hand of the united states government it be unthinkable that we should continue a policy under which a give locality may be allow to commit a crime against a friendly nation and the united states government limit not to prevent the commission of the crime but in the last resort to defend the people who have commit it against the consequence of their own wrongdoing last august an insurrection break out in cuba which it speedily grow evident that the exist cuban government be powerless to quell this government be repeatedly ask by the then cuban government to intervene and finally be notify by the president of cuba that he intend to resign that his decision be irrevocable that none of the other constitutional officer would consent to carry on the government and that he be powerless to maintain order it be evident that chaos be impending and there be every probability that if step be not immediately take by this government to try to restore order the representative of various european nation in the island would apply to their respective government for armed intervention in order to protect the life and property of their citizen thank to the preparedness of our navy i be able immediately to send enough ship to cuba to prevent the situation from become hopeless and i furthermore dispatch to cuba the secretary of war and the assistant secretary of state in order that they might grapple with the situation on the ground all effort to secure an agreement between the contending faction by which they should themselves come to an amicable understanding and settle upon some modus vivendi some provisional government of their own fail finally the president of the republic resign the quorum of congress assemble fail by deliberate purpose of its member so that there be no power to act on his resignation and the government come to a halt in accordance with the so call platt amendment which be embody in the constitution of cuba i thereupon proclaim a provisional government for the island the secretary of war act as provisional governor until he could be replace by mr. magoon the late minister to panama and governor of the canal zone on the isthmus troop be send to support they and to relieve the navy the expedition be handle with most satisfactory speed and efficiency the insurgent chief immediately agree that their troop should lay down their arm and disband and the agreement be carry out the provisional government have leave the personnel of the old government and the old law so far as might be unchanged and will thus administer the island for a few month until tranquillity can be restore a new election properly hold and a new government inaugurate peace have come in the island and the harvesting of the sugar cane crop the great crop of the island be about to proceed when the election have be hold and the new government inaugurate in peaceful and orderly fashion the provisional government will come to an end i take this opportunity of express upon behalf of the american people with all possible solemnity our most earnest hope that the people of cuba will realize the imperative need of preserve justice and keep order in the island the united states wish nothing of cuba except that it shall prosper morally and materially and wish nothing of the cubans save that they shall be able to preserve order among themselves and therefore to preserve their independence if the election become a farce and if the insurrectionary habit becomes confirm in the island it be absolutely out of the question that the island should continue independent and the united states which have assume the sponsorship before the civilized world for cuba 's career as a nation would again have to intervene and to see that the government be manage in such orderly fashion as to secure the safety cf life and property the path to be tread by those who exercise self government be always hard and we should have every charity and patience with the cubans as they tread this difficult path i have the utmost sympathy with and regard for they but i most earnestly adjure they solemnly to weigh their responsibility and to see that when their new government be start it shall run smoothly and with freedom from flagrant denial of right on the one hand and from insurrectionary disturbance on the other the second international conference of american republics hold in mexico in the year 1901 2 provide for the holding of the third conference within five year and commit the fixing of the time and place and the arrangement for the conference to the governing board of the bureau of american republics compose of the representative of all the american nation in washington that board discharge the duty impose upon it with marked fidelity and painstaking care and upon the courteous invitation of the united states of brazil the conference be hold at rio de janeiro continue from the 23d of july to the 29th of august last many subject of common interest to all the american nation be discust by the conference and the conclusion reach embody in a series of resolution and proposed convention will be lay before you upon the come in of the final report of the american delegate they contain many matter of importance relate to the extension of trade the increase of communication the smoothing away of barrier to free intercourse and the promotion of a well knowledge and good understanding between the different country represent the meeting of the conference be harmonious and the conclusion be reach with substantial unanimity it be interesting to observe that in the successive conference which have be hold the representative of the different american nation have be learn to work together effectively for while the first conference in washington in 1889 and the second conference in mexico in 1901 2 occupy many month with much time waste in an unregulated and fruitless discussion the third conference at rio exhibit much of the facility in the practical dispatch of business which characterize permanent deliberative body and complete its labor within the period of six week originally allot for its session quite apart from the specific value of the conclusion reach by the conference the example of the representative of all the american nation engage in harmonious and kindly consideration and discussion of subject of common interest be itself of great and substantial value for the promotion of reasonable and considerate treatment of all international question the thank of this country be due to the government of brazil and to the people of rio de janeiro for the generous hospitality with which our delegate in common with the other be receive entertain and facilitate in their work incidentally to the meeting of the conference the secretary of state visit the city of rio de janeiro and be cordially receive by the conference of which he be make an honorary president the announcement of his intention to make this visit be follow by most courteous and urgent invitation from nearly all the country of south america to visit they as the guest of their government it be deem that by the acceptance of these invitation we might appropriately express the real respect and friendship in which we hold our sister republics of the southern continent and the secretary accordingly visit brazil uruguay argentina chile peru panama and colombia he refrain from visit paraguay bolivia and ecuador only because the distance of their capital from the seaboard make it impracticable with the time at his disposal he carry with he a message of peace and friendship and of strong desire for good understanding and mutual helpfulness and he be everywhere receive in the spirit of his message the member of government the press the learn profession the man of business and the great masse of the people unite everywhere in emphatic response to his friendly expression and in do honor to the country and cause which he represent in many part of south america there have be much misunderstanding of the attitude and purpose of the united states towards the other american republics an idea have become prevalent that our assertion of the monroe doctrine imply or carry with it an assumption of superiority and of a right to exercise some kind of protectorate over the country to whose territory that doctrine apply nothing could be far from the truth yet that impression continue to be a serious barrier to good understanding to friendly intercourse to the introduction of american capital and the extension of american trade the impression be so widespread that apparently it could not be reach by any ordinary mean it be part of secretary root 's mission to dispel this unfounded impression and there be just cause to believe that he have succeed in an address to the third conference at rio on the 31st of july an address of such note that i send it in together with this message he said:"we wish for no victory but those of peace for no territory except our own for no sovereignty except the sovereignty over ourselves we deem the independence and equal right of the small and weak member of the family of nation entitle to as much respect as those of the great empire and we deem the observance of that respect the chief guaranty of the weak against the oppression of the strong we neither claim nor desire any right or privilege or power that we do not freely concede to every american republic we wish to increase our prosperity to extend our trade to grow in wealth in wisdom and in spirit but our conception of the true way to accomplish this be not to pull down other and profit by their ruin but to help all friend to a common prosperity and a common growth that we may all become great and strong together within a few month for the first time the recognize possessor of every foot of soil upon the american continent can be and i hope will be represent with the acknowledge right of equal sovereign state in the great world congress at the hague this will be the world 's formal and final acceptance of the declaration that no part of the american continent be to be deem subject to colonization let we pledge ourselves to aid each other in the full performance of the duty to humanity which that accept declaration imply so that in time the weak and most unfortunate of our republic may come to march with equal step by the side of the strong and more fortunate let we help each other to show that for all the race of man the liberty for which we have fight and labor be the twin sister of justice and peace let we unite in create and maintain and make effective an all american public opinion whose power shall influence international conduct and prevent international wrong and narrow the cause of war and forever preserve our free land from the burden of such armament as be mass behind the frontier of europe and bring we ever near to the perfection of order liberty so shall come security and prosperity production and trade wealth learning the art and happiness for we all "these word appear to have be receive with acclaim in every part of south america they have my hearty approval as i be sure they will have your and i can not be wrong in the conviction that they correctly represent the sentiment of the whole american people i can not well characterize the true attitude of the united states in its assertion of the monroe doctrine than in the word of the distinguished former minister of foreign affair of argentina doctor drago in his speech welcome mr. root at buenos ayres he speak of--"the traditional policy of the united states which without accentuate superiority or seek preponderance condemn the oppression of the nation of this part of the world and the control of their destiny by the great powers of europe "it be gratify to know that in the great city of buenos ayres upon the arch which span the street entwine with argentine and american flag for the reception of our representative there be emblazon not only the name of washington and jefferson and marshall but also in appreciative recognition of their service to the cause of south american independence the name of james monroe john quincy adams henry clay and richard rush we take especial pleasure in the graceful courtesy of the government of brazil which have give to the beautiful and stately building first use for the meeting of the conference the name of palacio monroe our grateful acknowledgment be due to the governments and the people of all the country visit by the secretary of state for the courtesy the friendship and the honor show to our country in their generous hospitality to he in my message to you on the 5th of december 1905 i call your attention to the embarrassment that might be cause to this government by the assertion by foreign nation of the right to collect by force of arm contract debt due by american republic to citizen of the collect nation and to the danger that the process of compulsory collection might result in the occupation of territory tend to become permanent i then said:"our own government have always refuse to enforce such contractual obligation on behalf of its citizen by an appeal to arm it be much to be wisht that all foreign government would take the same view "this subject be one of the topic of consideration at the conference at rio and a resolution be adopt by that conference recommend to the respective government represent to consider the advisability of ask the second peace conference at the hague to examine the question of the compulsory collection of public debt and in general mean tend to diminish among nation conflict of purely pecuniary origin "this resolution be support by the representative of the united states in accordance with the following instructions:"it have long be the establish policy of the united states not to use its armed force for the collection of ordinary contract debt due to its citizen by other government we have not consider the use of force for such a purpose consistent with that respect for the independent sovereignty of other member of the family of nation which be the most important principle of international law and the chief protection of weak nation against the oppression of the strong it seem to we that the practise be injurious in its general effect upon the relation of nation and upon the welfare of weak and disordered state whose development ought to be encourage in the interest of civilization that it offer frequent temptation to bullying and oppression and to unnecessary and unjustifiable warfare we regret that other power whose opinion and sense of justice we esteem highly have at time take a different view and have permit themselves tho we believe with reluctance to collect such debt by force it be doubtless true that the non payment of public debt may be accompany by such circumstance of fraud and wrongdoing or violation of treaty as to justify the use of force this government would be glad to see an international consideration of the subject which shall discriminate between such case and the simple nonperformance of a contract with a private person and a resolution in favor of reliance upon peaceful mean in case of the latter class "it be not feel however that the conference at rio should undertake to make such a discrimination or to resolve upon such a rule most of the american country be still debtor nation while the country of europe be the creditor if the rio conference therefore be to take such action it would have the appearance of a meeting of debtor resolve how their creditor should act and this would not inspire respect the true course be indicate by the term of the program which propose to request the second hague conference where both creditor and debtor will be assemble to consider the subject "last june trouble which have exist for some time between the republics of salvador guatemala and honduras culminate in war a war which threaten to be ruinous to the country involve and very destructive to the commercial interest of americans mexicans and other foreigner who be take an important part in the development of these country the thoroly good understanding which exist between the united states and mexico enable this government and that of mexico to unite in effective mediation between the war republic which mediation result not without long continue and patient effort in bring about a meeting of the representative of the hostile power on board a united states warship as neutral territory and peace be there conclude a peace which result in the saving of thousand of life and in the prevention of an incalculable amount of misery and the destruction of property and of the mean of livelihood the rio conference past the follow resolution in reference to this action:"that the third international american conference shall address to the president of the united states of america and of the united states of mexico a note in which the conference which be be hold at rio express its satisfaction at the happy result of their mediation for the celebration of peace between the republics of guatemala honduras and salvador "this afford an excellent example of one way in which the influence of the united states can properly be exercise for the benefit of the people of the western hemisphere that be by action take in concert with other american republic and therefore free from those suspicion and prejudice which might attach if the action be take by one alone in this way it be possible to exercise a powerful influence toward the substitution of considerate action in the spirit of justice for the insurrectionary or international violence which have hitherto be so great a hindrance to the development of many of our neighbor repeat example of united action by several or many american republic in favor of peace by urge cool and reasonable instead of excited and belligerent treatment of international controversy can not fail to promote the growth of a general public opinion among the american nation which will elevate the standard of international action strengthen the sense of international duty among government and tell in favor of the peace of mankind i have just return from a trip to panama and shall report to you at length later on the whole subject of the panama canal the algeciras convention which be sign by the united states as well as by most of the power of europe supersede the previous convention of 1880 which be also sign both by the united states and a majority of the european power this treaty confer upon we equal commercial right with all european country and do not entail a single obligation of any kind upon we and i earnestly hope it may be speedily ratify to refuse to ratify it would merely mean that we forfeit our commercial right in morocco and would not achieve another object of any kind in the event of such refusal we would be leave for the first time in a hundred and twenty year without any commercial treaty with morocco and this at a time when we be everywhere seek new market and outlet for trade the destruction of the pribilof islands fur seal by pelagic sealing still continue the herd which accord to the survey make in 1874 by direction of the congress number 4,700,000 and which accord to the survey of both american and canadian commissioner in 1891 amount to 1,000,000 have now be reduce to about 180,000 this result have be bring about by canadian and some other sealing vessel kill the female seal while in the water during their annual pilgrimage to and from the south or in search of food as a rule the female seal when kill be pregnant and also have an unweaned pup on land so that for each skin take by pelagic sealing as a rule three life be destroy the mother the unborn offspring and the nursing pup which be leave to starve to death no damage whatever be do to the herd by the carefully regulate kill on land the custom of pelagic sealing be solely responsible for all of the present evil and be alike indefensible from the economic standpoint and from the standpoint of humanity in 1896 over 16,000 young seal be find dead from starvation on the pribilof islands in 1897 it be estimate that since pelagic sealing begin upward of 400,000 adult female seal have be kill at sea and over 300,000 young seal have die of starvation as the result the revolt barbarity of such a practise as well as the wasteful destruction which it involve need no demonstration and be its own condemnation the bering sea tribunal which sit in paris in 1893 and which decide against the claim of the united states to exclusive jurisdiction in the water of bering sea and to a property right in the fur seal when outside of the three mile limit determine also upon certain regulation which the tribunal consider sufficient for the proper protection and preservation of the fur seal in or habitually resort to the bering sea the tribunal by its regulation establish a close season from the 1st of may to the 31st of july and exclude all killing in the water within 60 mile around the pribilof islands they also provide that the regulation which they have determine upon with a view to the protection and preservation of the seal should be submit every five year to new examination so as to enable both interested government to consider whether in the light of past experience there be occasion for any modification thereof the regulation have prove plainly inadequate to accomplish the object of protection and preservation of the fur seal and for a long time this government have be try in vain to secure from great britain such revision and modification of the regulation as be contemplate and provide for by the award of the tribunal of paris the process of destruction have be accelerate during recent year by the appearance of a number of japanese vessel engage in pelagic sealing as these vessel have not be bind even by the inadequate limitation prescribe by the tribunal of paris they have pay no attention either to the close season or to the sixty mile limit impose upon the canadians and have prosecute their work up to the very island themselves on july 16 and 17 the crew from several japanese vessel make raid upon the island of st. paul and before they be beat off by the very meager and insufficiently armed guard they succeed in kill several hundred seal and carry off the skin of most of they nearly all the seal kill be female and the work be do with frightful barbarity many of the seal appear to have be skin alive and many be find half skinned and still alive the raid be repel only by the use of firearm and five of the raider be kill two be wound and twelve capture include the two wound those capture have since be try and sentence to imprisonment an attack of this kind have be wholly unlookt for but such provision of vessel arm and ammunition will now be make that its repetition will not be find profitable suitable representation regard the incident have be make to the government of japan and we be assure that all practicable measure will be take by that country to prevent any recurrence of the outrage on our part the guard on the island will be increase and well equip and organize and a well revenue cutter patrol service about the island will be establish next season a united states war vessel will also be send there we have not relax our effort to secure an agreement with great britain for adequate protection of the seal herd and negotiation with japan for the same purpose be in progress the law for the protection of the seal within the jurisdiction of the united states need revision and amendment only the island of st. paul and st. george be now in term include in the government reservation and the other island be also to be include the landing of alien as well as citizen upon the island without a permit from the department of commerce and labor for any purpose except in case of stress of weather or for water should be prohibit under adequate penalty the approach of vessel for the excepted purpose should be regulate the authority of the government agent on the island should be enlarge and the chief agent should have the power of a commit magistrate the entrance of a vessel into the territorial water surround the island with intent to take seal should be make a criminal offense and cause of forfeiture authority for seizure in such case should be give and the presence on any such vessel of seal or sealskin or the paraphernalia for take they should be make prima facie evidence of such intent i recommend what legislation be need to accomplish these end and i commend to your attention the report of mr. sims of the department of commerce and labor on this subject in case we be compel to abandon the hope of make arrangement with other government to put an end to the hideous cruelty now incident to pelagic sealing it will be a question for your serious consideration how far we should continue to protect and maintain the seal herd on land with the result of continue such a practise and whether it be not well to end the practice by exterminate the herd ourselves in the most humane way possible in my last message i advise you that the emperor of russia have take the initiative in bring about a second peace conference at the hague under the guidance of russia the arrangement of the preliminary for such a conference have be progress during the past year progress have necessarily be slow owe to the great number of country to be consult upon every question that have arise it be a matter of satisfaction that all of the american republics have now for the first time be invite to join in the propose conference the close connection between the subject to be take up by the red cross conference hold at geneva last summer and the subject which naturally would come before the hague conference make it apparent that it be desirable to have the work of the red cross conference complete and consider by the different power before the meeting at the hague the red cross conference end its labor on the 6th day of july and the revised and amend convention which be sign by the american delegate will be promptly lay before the senate by the special and highly appreciated courtesy of the government of russia and the netherlands a proposal to call the hague conference together at a time which would conflict with the conference of the american republics at rio de janeiro in august be lay aside no other date have yet be suggest a tentative program for the conference have be propose by the government of russia and the subject which it enumerate be undergo careful examination and consideration in preparation for the conference it must ever be keep in mind that war be not merely justifiable but imperative upon honorable man upon an honorable nation where peace can only be obtain by the sacrifice of conscientious conviction or of national welfare peace be normally a great good and normally it coincide with righteousness but it be righteousness and not peace which should bind the conscience of a nation as it should bind the conscience of an individual and neither a nation nor an individual can surrender conscience to another 's keeping neither can a nation which be an entity and which do not die as individual die refrain from take thought for the interest of the generation that be to come no less than for the interest of the generation of to day and no public man have a right whether from shortsightedness from selfish indifference or from sentimentality to sacrifice national interest which be vital in character a just war be in the long run far well for a nation 's soul than the most prosperous peace obtain by acquiescence in wrong or injustice moreover tho it be criminal for a nation not to prepare for war so that it may escape the dreadful consequence of be defeat in war yet it must always be remember that even to be defeat in war may be far well than not to have fight at all as have be well and finely say a beat nation be not necessarily a disgrace nation but the nation or man be disgrace if the obligation to defend right be shirk we should as a nation do everything in our power for the cause of honorable peace it be morally as indefensible for a nation to commit a wrong upon another nation strong or weak as for an individual thus to wrong his fellow we should do all in our power to hasten the day when there shall be peace among the nation a peace base upon justice and not upon cowardly submission to wrong we can accomplish a good deal in this direction but we can not accomplish everything and the penalty of attempt to do too much would almost inevitably be to do bad than nothing for it must be remember that fantastic extremist be not in reality leader of the cause which they espouse but be ordinarily those who do most to hamper the real leader of the cause and to damage the cause itself as yet there be no likelihood of establish any kind of international power of whatever sort which can effectively check wrongdoing and in these circumstance it would be both a foolish and an evil thing for a great and free nation to deprive itself of the power to protect its own right and even in exceptional case to stand up for the right of other nothing would more promote iniquity nothing would far defer the reign upon earth of peace and righteousness than for the free and enlightened people which tho with much stumbling and many shortcoming nevertheless strive toward justice deliberately to render themselves powerless while leave every despotism and barbarism armed and able to work their wicked will the chance for the settlement of dispute peacefully by arbitration now depend mainly upon the possession by the nation that mean to do right of sufficient armed strength to make their purpose effective the united states navy be the sure guarantor of peace which this country possess it be earnestly to be wisht that we would profit by the teaching of history in this matter a strong and wise people will study its own failure no less than its triumph for there be wisdom to be learn from the study of both of the mistake as well as of the success for this purpose nothing could be more instructive than a rational study of the war of 1812 as it be tell for instance by captain mahan there be only one way in which that war could have be avoid if during the precede twelve year a navy relatively as strong as that which this country now have have be build up and an army provide relatively as good as that which the country now have there never would have be the slight necessity of fight the war and if the necessity have arise the war would under such circumstance have end with our speedy and overwhelming triumph but our people during those twelve year refuse to make any preparation whatever regard either the army or the navy they save a million or two of dollar by so do and in mere money pay a hundredfold for each million they thus save during the three year of war which follow a war which bring untold suffering upon our people which at one time threaten the grave national disaster and which in spite of the necessity of wage it result merely in what be in effect a draw battle while the balance of defeat and triumph be almost even i do not ask that we continue to increase our navy i ask merely that it be maintain at its present strength and this can be do only if we replace the obsolete and outworn ship by new and good one the equal of any afloat in any navy to stop build ship for one year mean that for that year the navy go back instead of forward the old battle ship texas for instance would now be of little service in a stand up fight with a powerful adversary the old double turret monitor have outwear their usefulness while it be a waste of money to build the modern single turret monitor all these ship should be replace by other and this can be do by a well settle program of provide for the building each year of at least one first class battle ship equal in size and speed to any that any nation be at the same time building the armament presumably to consist of as large a number as possible of very heavy gun of one caliber together with small gun to repel torpedo attack while there should be heavy armor turbine engine and in short every modern device of course from time to time cruiser collier torpedo boat destroyer or torpedo boat will have to be build also all this be it remember would not increase our navy but would merely keep it at its present strength equally of course the ship will be absolutely useless if the man aboard they be not so train that they can get the good possible service out of the formidable but delicate and complicated mechanism intrust to their care the marksmanship of our man have so improve during the last five year that i deem it within bound to say that the navy be more than twice as efficient ship for ship as half a decade ago the navy can only attain proper efficiency if enough officer and man be provide and if these officer and man be give the chance and require to take advantage of it to stay continually at sea and to exercise the fleet singly and above all in squadron the exercise to be of every kind and to include uncease practise at the gun conduct under condition that will test marksmanship in time of war in both the army and the navy there be urgent need that everything possible should be do to maintain the high standard for the personnel alike as regard the officer and the enlisted man i do not believe that in any service there be a fine body of enlisted man and of junior officer than we have in both the army and the navy include the marine corps all possible encouragement to the enlisted man should be give in pay and otherwise and everything practicable do to render the service attractive to man of the right type they should be hold to the strict discharge of their duty and in they a spirit should be encourage which demand not the mere performance of duty but the performance of far more than duty if it conduce to the honor and the interest of the american nation and in return the ample consideration should be theirs west point and annapolis already turn out excellent officer we do not need to have these school make more scholastic on the contrary we should never lose sight of the fact that the aim of each school be to turn out a man who shall be above everything else a fight man in the army in particular it be not necessary that either the cavalry or infantry officer should have special mathematical ability probably in both school the good part of the education be the high standard of character and of professional morale which it confer but in both service there be urgent need for the establishment of a principle of selection which will eliminate man after a certain age if they can not be promote from the subordinate rank and which will bring into the high rank few man and these at an early age this principle of selection will be object to by good man of mediocre capacity who be fit to do well while young in the low position but who be not fit to do well when at an advanced age they come into position of command and of great responsibility but the desire of these man to be promote to position which they be not competent to fill should not weigh against the interest of the navy and the country at present our man especially in the navy be keep far too long in the junior grade and then at much too advanced an age be put quickly thru the senior grade often not attain to these senior grade until they be too old to be of real use in they and if they be of real use be put thru they so quickly that little benefit to the navy come from their having be in they at all the navy have one great advantage over the army in the fact that the officer of high rank be actually train in the continual performance of their duty that be in the management of the battle ship and armored cruiser gather into fleet this be not true of the army officer who rarely have correspond chance to exercise command over troop under service condition the conduct of the spanish war show the lamentable loss of life the useless extravagance and the inefficiency certain to result if during peace the high official of the war and navy departments be praise and reward only if they save money at no matter what cost to the efficiency of the service and if the high officer be give no chance whatever to exercise and practise command for year prior to the spanish war the secretaries of war be praise chiefly if they practise economy which economy especially in connection with the quartermaster commissary and medical department be directly responsible for most of the mismanagement that occur in the war itself and parenthetically be it observe that the very people who clamor for the misdirect economy in the first place be foremost to denounce the mismanagement loss and suffering which be primarily due to this same misdirect economy and to the lack of preparation it involve there should soon be an increase in the number of man for our coast defense these man should be of the right type and properly train and there should therefore be an increase of pay for certain skilled grade especially in the coast artillery money should be appropriate to permit troop to be mass in body and exercise in maneuver particularly in marching such exercise during the summer just past have be of incalculable benefit to the army and should under no circumstance be discontinue if on these practise marche and in these maneuver elderly officer prove unable to bear the strain they should be retire at once for the fact be conclusive as to their unfitness for war that be for the only purpose because of which they should be allow to stay in the service it be a real misfortune to have score of small company or regimental post scatter thruout the country the army should be gather in a few brigade or division post and the general should be practise in handle the man in masse neglect to provide for all of this mean to incur the risk of future disaster and disgrace the readiness and efficiency of both the army and navy in deal with the recent sudden crisis in cuba illustrate afresh their value to the nation this readiness and efficiency would have be very much less have it not be for the existence of the general staff in the army and the general board in the navy both be essential to the proper development and use of our military force afloat and ashore the troop that be send to cuba be handle flawlessly it be the swift mobilization and dispatch of troop over sea ever accomplish by our government the expedition land completely equipped and ready for immediate service several of its organization hardly remain in havana over night before split up into detachment and go to their several post it be a fine demonstration of the value and efficiency of the general staff similarly it be owe in large part to the general board that the navy be able at the outset to meet the cuban crisis with such instant efficiency ship after ship appear on the short notice at any threatened point while the marine corps in particular performed indispensable service the army and navy war colleges be of incalculable value to the two service and they cooperate with constantly increase efficiency and importance the congress have most wisely provide for a national board for the promotion of rifle practise excellent result have already come from this law but it do not go far enough our regular army be so small that in any great war we should have to trust mainly to volunteer and in such event these volunteer should already know how to shoot for if a soldier have the fighting edge and ability to take care of himself in the open his efficiency on the line of battle be almost directly proportionate to excellence in marksmanship we should establish shoot gallery in all the large public and military school should maintain national target range in different part of the country and should in every way encourage the formation of rifle club thruout all part of the land the little republic of switzerland offer we an excellent example in all matter connect with build up an efficient citizen soldiery
to the senate and house of representatives
 on november 21st i visit the island of porto rico land at ponce cross by the old spanish road by cayey to san juan and return next morning over the new american road from arecibo to ponce the scenery be wonderfully beautiful especially among the mountain of the interior which constitute a veritable tropic switzerland i could not embark at san juan because the harbor have not be dredge out and can not receive an american battleship i do not think this fact creditable to we as a nation and i earnestly hope that immediate provision will be make for dredge san juan harbor
 i doubt whether our people as a whole realize the beauty and fertility of porto rico and the progress that have be make under its admirable government we have just cause for pride in the character of our representative who have administer the tropic island which come under our flag as a result of the war with spain and of no one of they be this more true than of porto rico it would be impossible to wish a more faithful a more efficient and a more disintereste public service than that now be render in the island of porto rico by those in control of the insular government
 i stop at a dozen town all tell and one of the notable feature in every town be the gathering of the school child the work that have be do in porto rico for education have be noteworthy the main emphasis as be eminently wise and proper have be put upon primary education but in addition to this there be a normal school an agricultural school three industrial and three high school every effort be be make to secure not only the benefit of elementary education to all the porto ricans of the next generation but also as far as mean will permit to train they so that the industrial agricultural and commercial opportunity of the island can be utilize to the good possible advantage it be evident at a glance that the teacher both americans and native porto ricans be devoted to their work take the great pride in it and be endeavor to train their pupil not only in mind but in what count for far more than mind in citizenship that is in character
 i be very much strike by the excellent character both of the insular police and of the porto rican regiment they be both of they body that reflect credit upon the american administration of the island the insular police be under the local porto rican government the porto rican regiment of troop must be appropriate for by the congress i earnestly hope that this body will be keep permanent there should certainly be troop in the island and it be wise that these troop should be themselves native porto ricans it would be from every standpoint a mistake not to perpetuate this regiment
 in traverse the island even the most cursory survey leave the beholder strike with the evident rapid growth in the culture both of the sugar cane and tobacco the fruit industry be also grow last year be the most prosperous year that the island have ever know before or since the american occupation the total of export and import of the island be forty five million of dollar as against eighteen million in 1901 this be the large in the island&#39; history prior to the american occupation the great trade for any one year be that of 1896 when it reach nearly $ 23,000,000 last year therefore there be double the trade that there be in the most prosperous year under the spanish regime there be 210,273 ton of sugar export last year of the value of $ 14,186,319 $ 3,555,163 of tobacco and 28,290,322 pound of coffee of the value of $ 3,181,102 unfortunately what use to be porto rico&#39;s prime cup coffee have not share this prosperity it have never recover from the disaster of the hurricane and moreover the benefit of throw open our market to it have not compensate for the loss inflict by the closing of the market to it abroad i call your attention to the accompany memorial on this subject of the board of trade of san juan and i earnestly hope that some measure will be take for the benefit of the excellent and high grade porto rican coffee
 in addition to delegation from the board of trade and chamber of commerce of san juan i also receive delegation from the porto rican federation of labor and from the coffee growers&#39 association
 there be a matter to which i wish to call your special attention and that be the desirability of confer full american citizenship upon the people of porto rico i most earnestly hope that this will be do i can not see how any harm can possibly result from it and it seem to i a matter of right and justice to the people of porto rico they be loyal they be glad to be under our flag they be make rapid progress along the path of orderly liberty surely we should show our appreciation of they our pride in what they have do and our pleasure in extend recognition for what have thus be do by grant they full american citizenship
 under the wise administration of the present governor and council marked progress have be make in the difficult matter of grant to the people of the island the large measure of self government that can with safety be give at the present time it would have be a very serious mistake to have go any fast than we have already go in this direction the porto ricans have complete and absolute autonomy in all their municipal government the only power over they possess by the insular government be that of remove corrupt or incompetent municipal official this power have never be exercise save on the clear proof of corruption or of incompetence such as to jeopardize the interest of the people of the island and under such circumstance it have be fearlessly use to the immense benefit of the people it be not a power with which it would be safe for the sake of the island itself to dispense at present the low house be absolutely elective while the upper house be appointive this scheme be work well no injustice of any kind result from it and great benefit to the island and it should certainly not be change at this time the machinery of the election be administer entirely by the porto rican people themselves the governor and council keep only such supervision as be necessary in order to insure an orderly election any protest as to electoral fraud be settle in the court
 here again it would not be safe to make any change in the present system the election this year be absolutely orderly unaccompanie by any disturbance and no protest have be make against the management of the election although three contest be threaten where the majority be very small and error be claim the contest of course to be settle in the court in short the governor and council be co operate with all of the most enlightened and most patriotic of the people of porto rico in educate the citizen of the island in the principle of orderly liberty they be provide a government base upon each citizen&#39;s self respect and the mutual respect of all citizen that be base upon a rigid observance of the principle of justice and honesty it have not be easy to instill into the mind of the people unaccustomed to the exercise of freedom the two basic principle of our american system the principle that the majority must rule and the principle that the minority have right which must not be disregard or trample upon yet real progress have be make in have these principle accept as elementary as the foundation of successful self government
 i transmit herewith the report of the governor of porto rico send to the president through the secretary of state
 all the insular government should be place in one bureau either in the department of war or the department of state it be a mistake not so to arrange our handling of these island at washington as to be able to take advantage of the experience gain in one when deal with the problem that from time to time arise in another
 in conclusion let i express my admiration for the work do by the congress when it enact the law under which the island be now be administer after see the island personally and after five years&#39 experience in connection with its administration it be but fair to those who devise this law to say that it would be well nigh impossible to have devise any other which in the actual working would have accomplish well result

 on saturday morning we start at 8 o&#39;clock from the hotel we go through the culebra cut stop off to see the marine and also to investigate certain town one of white employee as to which in certain respect complaint have be make to i and another town where i want to see certain house of the colored employee we go over the site of the propose gatun dam have on the first day inspect the site of the propose la boca and sosa dam we go out on a little toy railway to the reservoir which have be build to supply the people of colon with water for their house there we take lunch at the engineers&#39 mess we then go through the store and shop of cristobal inspect carefully the house of both the white and colored employee married and unmarried together with the other building we then go to colon and see the fire department at work in four minute from the signal the engine have come down to front street and twenty one 2 1/2 inch hose pipe be raise stream of water about 75 foot high we ride about colon through the various street pave unpaved and in process of pave look at the ditch sewer curb and the light i then go over the colon hospital in order to compare it with the temporary town or field receive hospital which i have already see and inspect i also inspect some of the dwelling of the employee in the evening i attend a reception give by the american employee on the isthmus which take place on one of the dock in colon and from there go aboard the louisiana

 at the outset i wish to pay a tribute to the amount of work do by the french canal company under very difficult circumstance many of the building they put up be excellent and be still in use though naturally the house be now get out of repair and be be use as dwelling only until other house can be build and much of the work they do in the culebra cut and some of the work they do in dig have be of direct and real benefit this country have never make a well investment than the $ 40,000,000 which it pay to the french company for work and betterment include especially the panama railroad
 an inspection on the ground at the height of the rainy season serve to convince i of the wisdom of congress in refuse to adopt either a high level or a sea level canal there seem to be a universal agreement among all people competent to judge that the panama route the one actually choose be much superior to both the nicaragua and darien route
 the wisdom of the canal management have be show in nothing more clearly than in the way in which the foundation of the work have be lay to have yield to the natural impatience of ill inform outsider and begin all kind of experiment in work prior to a thorough sanitation of the isthmus and to a fairly satisfactory work out of the problem of get and keep a sufficient labor supply would have be disastrous the various preliminary measure have to be take first and these could not be take so as to allow we to begin the real work of construction prior to january 1 of the present year it then become necessary to have the type of the canal decide and the only delay have be the necessary delay until the 29th day of june the date when the congress definitely and wisely settle that we should have an 85 foot level canal immediately after that the work begin in hard earnest and have be continue with increase vigor ever since and it will continue so to progress in the future when the contract be let the condition will be such as to insure a constantly increase amount of performance
 the first great problem to be solve upon the solution of which the success of the rest of the work depend be the problem of sanitation this be from the outset under the direction of dr. w. c. gorgas who be to be make a full member of the commission it must be remember that his work be not mere sanitation as the term be understand in our ordinary municipal work throughout the zone and in the two city of panama and colon in addition to the sanitation work proper he have have to do all the work that the marine hospital service do as regard the nation that the health department officer do in the various state and city and that colonel waring do in new york when he clean its street the result have be astounding the isthmus have be a by word for deadly unhealthfulness now after two year of our occupation the condition as regard sickness and the death rate compare favorably with reasonably healthy locality in the united states especial care have be devote to minimize the risk due to the presence of those specie of mosquito which have be find to propagate malarial and yellow fever in all the settlement the little temporary town or city compose of the white and black employee which grow up here and there in the tropic jungle as the need of the work dictate the utmost care be exercise to keep the condition healthy everywhere be to be see the drainage ditch which in remove the water have remove the breed place of the mosquito while the whole jungle be cut away for a considerable space around the habitation thus destroy the place in which the mosquito take shelter these drainage ditch and clearing be in evidence in every settlement and together with the invariable presence of mosquito screen around the piazzas and of mosquito door to the house not to speak of the careful fumigation that have go on in all infected house doubtless explain the extraordinary absence of mosquito as a matter of fact but a single mosquito and this not of the dangerous specie be see by any member of our party during my three day on the isthmus equal care be take by the inspector of the health department to secure cleanliness in the house and proper hygienic condition of every kind i inspect between twenty and thirty water closet both those use by the white employee and those use by the colored laborer in almost every case i find the condition perfect in but one case do i find they really bad in this case affect a settlement of unmarried white employee i find they very bad indeed but the building be all inherit from the french company and be be use temporarily while other building be in the course of construction and right near the defective water closet a new and excellent closet with a good sewer pipe be in process of construction and nearly finish nevertheless this do not excuse the fact that the bad condition have be allow to prevail temporary accommodation even if only such as soldier use when camp in the field should have be provide order to this effect be issue i append the report of dr. gorgas on the incident i be strike however by the fact that in this instance as in almost every other where a complaint be make which prove to have any justification whatever it appear that step have already be take to remedy the evil complain of and that the trouble be mainly due to the extreme difficulty and often impossibility of provide in every place for the constant increase in the number of employee generally the provision be make in advance but it be not possible that this should always be the case when it be not there ensue a period of time during which the condition be unsatisfactory until a remedy can be provide but i never find a case where the remedy be not be provide as speedily as possible
 i inspect the large hospital at ancon and colon which be excellent example of what tropical hospital should be i also inspect the receive hospital in various settlement i go through a number of the ward in which the colored man be treat a number of those in which the white man be treat americans and spaniards both white man and black man be treat exactly alike and their treatment be as good as that which could be obtain in our first class hospital at home all the patient that i see with one or two exception be laborer or other employee on the canal work and railway most of they be color man of the ordinary laborer stamp not only be the man carefully care for whenever they apply for care but so far as practicable a watch be keep to see that if they need it they be send to the hospital whether they desire to go or not from no responsible source do any complaint come to i as to the management of the hospital service although occasionally a very ignorant west india negro when he be first bring into the hospital become frightened by the ordinary hospital routine
 just at present the health showing on the isthmus be remarkably good so much well than in most section of the united states that i do not believe that it can possibly continue at quite its present average thus early in the present year a band of several hundred spaniards be bring to the isthmus as laborer and addition to their number have be make from time to time yet since their arrival in february last but one of those spaniards thus bring over to work on the canal have die of disease and he of typhoid fever two other be kill one in a railroad accident and one by a dynamite explosion there have be for the last six month a well nigh steady decline in the death rate for the population of the zone this be largely due to the decrease in death from pneumonia which have be the most fatal disease on the isthmus in october there be ninety nine death of every kind among the employee of the isthmus there be then on the roll 5,500 white seven eighth of they be americans of these white but two die of disease and as it happen neither man be an american of the 6,000 white americans include some 1,200 woman and child not a single death have occur in the past three month whereas in an average city in the united states the number of death for a similar number of people in that time would have be about thirty from disease this very remarkable showing can not of course permanently obtain but it certainly go to prove that if good care be take the isthmus be not a particularly unhealthy place in october of the 19,000 negro on the roll 86 die from disease pneumonia be the most destructive disease and malarial fever come second the difficulty of exercise a thorough supervision over the colored laborer be of course great than be the case among the white and they be also less competent to take care of themselves which account for the fact that their death rate be so much high than that of the white in spite of the fact that they have be use to similar climatic condition even among the colored employee it will be see that the death rate be not high
 in panama and colon the death rate have also be greatly reduce this be directly due to the vigorous work of the special brigade of employee who have be inspect house where the stegomyia mosquito be to be find and destroy its larvae and breed place and do similar work in exterminate the malarial mosquito in short in perform all kind of hygienic labor a little over a year ago all kind of mosquito include the two fatal specie be numerous about the culebra cut in this cut during last october every room of every house be carefully examine and only two mosquito neither of they of the two fatal specie be find unfaltere energy in inspection and in disinfect and in the work of drain and of clearing brush be responsible for the change i append dr. gorgas&#39;s report on the health condition also a letter from surgeon general rixey to dr. gorgas the surgeon general report to i that the hygienic condition on the isthmus be about as good as for instance those in the norfolk navy yard
 corozal some four mile from la boca be formerly one of the most unsanitary place on the isthmus probably the most unsanitary there be a marsh with a pond in the middle dr. gorgas have both the marsh and pond drain and the brush clear off so that now when i go over the ground it appear like a smooth meadow intersect by drainage ditch the breeding place and shelter spot of the dangerous mosquito have be completely destroy the result be that corozal for the last six month like la boca which formerly also have a very unsanitary record show one of the good sick rate in the zone have less than 1 per cent a week admit to the hospital at corozal there be a big hotel fill with employee of the isthmian canal commission some of they with their wife and family yet this healthy and attractive spot be stigmatize as a hog wallow by one of the least scrupulous and most foolish of the professional scandal monger who from time to time have write about the commission&#39;s work
 the sanitation work in the city of panama and colon have be just as important as in the zone itself and in many respect much more difficult because it be necessary to deal with the already exist population which naturally have scant sympathy with revolutionary change the value of which they be for a long time not able to perceive in colon the population consist largely of colored laborer who having come over from the west indies to work on the canal abandon the work and either take to the brush or lie idle in colon itself thus people colon with the least desirable among the import laborer for the good and steady man of course continue at the work yet astonishing progress have be make in both city in panama 90 per cent of the street that be to be pave at all be already pave with an excellent brick pavement lay in heavy concrete a few of the street be still in process of pave the sewer and water service in the city be of the most modern hygienic type some of the service having just be complete
 in colon the condition be peculiar and it be as regard colon that most of the very bitter complaint have be make colon be build on a low coral island cover at more or less shallow depth with vegetable accumulation or mold which afford sustenance and strength to many variety of low lie tropical plant one half of the surface of the island be cover with water at high tide the average height of the land be 1 1/2 foot above low tide the slight undulation furnish shallow natural reservoir or fresh water breeding place for every variety of mosquito and the ground tend to be low in the middle when the town be originally build no attempt be make to fill the low ground either in the street or on the building site so that the entire surface be practically a quagmire when the quagmire become impassable certain of the street be crudely improve by fill especially bad mud hole with soft rock or other material in september 1905 a systematic effort be begin to formulate a general plan for the proper sanitation of the city in february last temporary relief measure be take while in july the prosecution of the work be begin in good earnest the result be already visible in the sewering drain gutter and pave of the street some four month will be require before the work of sewerage and street improvement will be complete but the progress already make be very marked ditch have be dig through the town connect the salt water on both side and into these the pond which have serve as breed place for the mosquito be drain these ditch have answer their purpose for they be probably the chief cause of the astonishing diminution in the number of mosquito more ditch of the kind be be construct
 it be not practicable with the force at the commission&#39;s disposal and in view of the need that the force should be use in the large town of panama to begin this work before early last winter water main be then lay in the town and water be furnish to the people early in march from a temporary reservoir this reservoir prove to be of insufficient capacity before the end of the dry season and the shortage be make up by haul water over the panama railroad so that there be at all time an ample supply of the very good water since that time the new reservoir back of mount hope have be practically complete i visit this reservoir it be a lake over a mile long and half a mile broad it now carry some 500,000,000 gallon of first class water i forward herewith a photograph of this lake together with certain other photograph of what i see while i be on the isthmus nothing but a cataclysm will hereafter render it necessary in the dry season to haul water for the use of colon and cristobal
 one of the most amusing as well as dishonest attack make upon the commission be in connection with this reservoir the writer in question usually confine himself to vague general mendacity but in this case he specifically state that there be no water in the vicinity fit for a reservoir i drink it and it be excellent and that this particular reservoir would never hold water anyway accompany this message as i have say above be a photograph of the reservoir as i myself see it and as it have be in existence ever since the article in question be publish with typical american humor the engineering corps still at work at the reservoir have christen a large boat which be now use on the reservoir by the name of the individual who thus deny the possibility of the reservoir&#39; existence
 i ride through the street of colon see they at the height of the rainy season after two day of almost unexampled downpour when they be at their very bad take as a whole they be undoubtedly very bad as bad as pennsylvania avenue in washington before grant&#39;s administration front street be already in thoroughly satisfactory shape however some of the side street be also in good condition in other the change in the street be rapidly go on through three fourth of the town it be now possible to walk even during the period of tremendous rain in low shoe without wet one&#39;s foot owe to the rapidity with which the surface water be carry away in the ditch in the remain one fourth of the street the mud be very deep about as deep as in the ordinary street of a low lie prairie river town of the same size in the united states during early spring all man to whom i speak be a unit in say that the condition of the colon street be 100 per cent well than a year ago the most superficial examination of the town show the progress that have be make and be be make in macadamize the street complaint be make to i by an entirely reputable man as to the character of some of the material use for repair certain street on investigation the complaint prove well rounded but it also appear that the use of the material in question have be abandon the commission after having try it in one or two street find it not appropriate
 the result of the investigation of this honest complaint be typical of what occur when i investigate most of the other honest complaint make to i that is where the complaint be not make wantonly or maliciously they almost always prove due to failure to appreciate the fact that time be necessary in the creation and completion of this titanic work in a tropic wilderness it be impossible to avoid some mistake in build a giant canal through jungle cover mountain and swamp while at the same time sanitate tropic city and provide for the feeding and general care of from twenty to thirty thousand worker the complaint bring to i either of insufficient provision in care for some of the laborer or of failure to finish the pavement of colon or of failure to supply water or of failure to build wooden sidewalk for the use of the laborer in the rainy season on investigation prove almost without exception to be due merely to the utter inability of the commission to do everything at once
 for instance it be imperative that panama which have the high death rate and where the chance of a yellow fever epidemic be strong should be care for first yet most of the complaint as to the delay in take care of colon be due to the inability or unwillingness to appreciate this simple fact again as the thousand of laborer be bring over and house it be not always possible at the outset to supply wooden walk and bath house because other more vital necessity have to be meet and in consequence while most of the settlement have good bath house and to a large extent at least wooden walk there be plenty of settlement where wooden walk have not yet be lay down and i visit one where the bath house have not be provide but in this very settlement the frame of the bath house be already up and in every case the utmost effort be be make to provide the wooden walk of course in some of the new camp tent be use pende the building of house where possible i think detach house would be preferable to the semi detached house now in general use
 care and forethought have be exercise by the commission and nothing have reflect more credit upon they than their refusal either to go ahead too fast or to be deter by the fear of criticism from not go ahead fast enough it be curious to note the fact that many of the most severe critic of the commission criticize they for precisely opposite reason some complain bitterly that the work be not in a more advanced condition while the other complain that it have be rush with such haste that there have be insufficient preparation for the hygiene and comfort of the employee as a matter of fact neither criticism be just it would have be impossible to go quick than the commission have go for such quickness would have mean insufficient preparation on the other hand to refuse to do anything until every possible future contingency have be meet would have cause wholly unwarranted delay the right course to follow be exactly the course which have be follow every reasonable preparation be make in advance the hygienic condition in especial be make as nearly perfect as possible while on the other hand there have be no timid refusal to push forward the work because of inability to anticipate every possible emergency for of course many defect can only be show by the working of the system in actual practice
 in addition to attend to the health of the employee it be of course necessary to provide for police the zone this be do by a police force which at present number over 200 man under captain shanton about one fifth of the man be white and the other black in different place i question some twenty or thirty of these man take they at random they be a fine set physically and in discipline with one exception all the white man i question have serve in the american army usually in the philippines and belong to the good type of american soldier without exception the black policeman whom i question have serve either in the british army or in the jamaica or barbados police they be evidently content and be do their work well where possible the policeman be use to control people of their own color but in any emergency no hesitation be feel in use they indiscriminately
 inasmuch as so many both of the white and colored employee have bring their family with they school have be establish the school service be under mr. o&#39;connor for the white pupil white american teacher be employ for the colored pupil there be also some white american teacher one spanish teacher and one colored american teacher most of they be color teacher from jamaica barbados and st. lucia the schoolroom be good and it be a pleasant thing to see the pride that the teacher be take in their work and their pupil
 there seem to i to be too many saloon in the zone but the new high license law which go into effect on january 1 next will probably close four fifth of they resolute and successful effort be be make to minimize and control the sale of liquor
 the car on the passenger train on the isthmus be divide into first and second class the difference be mark in the price of ticket as a rule second class passenger be color and first class passenger white but in every train which i see there be a number of white second class passenger and on two of they there be color first class passenger
 next in importance to the problem of sanitation and indeed now of equal importance be the problem of securing and care for the mechanic laborer and other employee who actually do the work on the canal and the railroad this great task have be under the control of mr. jackson smith and on the whole have be well do at present there be some 6,000 white employee and some 19,000 colored employee on the isthmus i go over the different place where the different kind of employee be work i think i see representative of every type both at their work and in their home and i converse with probably a couple of hundred of they all tell choose they at random from every class and include those who come especially to present certain grievance i find that those who do not come specifically to present grievance almost invariably express far great content and satisfaction with the condition than do those who call to make complaint
 nearly 5,000 of the white employee have come from the united states no man can see these young vigorous man energetically do their duty without a thrill of pride in they as americans they represent on the average a high class doubtless to congress the wage pay they will seem high but as a matter of fact the only general complaint which i find have any real basis among the complaint make to i upon the isthmus be that owe to the peculiar surrounding the cost of living and the distance from home the wage be really not as high as they should be in fact almost every man i speak to feel that he ought to be receive more money a view however which the average man who stay at home in the united states probably likewise hold as regard himself i append figure of the wage pay so that the congress can judge the matter for itself later i shall confer on the subject with certain representative labor man here in the united states as well as go over with mr. stevens the comparative wage pay on the zone and at home and i may then communicate my finding to the canal committee of the two houses
 the white americans be employ some of they in office work but the majority in handle the great steam shovel as engineer and conductor on the dirt train as machinist in the great repair shop as carpenter and time keeper superintendent and foreman of division and of gang and so on and so on many of they have bring down their wife and family and the child when not in school be run about and behave precisely as the american small boy and small girl behave at home the bachelor among the employee live sometimes in small separate house sometimes in large house quarter be furnish free to all the man married and unmarried usually the bachelor sleep two in a room as they would do in this country i find a few case where three be in a room and i be tell of although i do not see large room in which four be sleep for it be not possible in what be really a vast system of construction camp always to provide in advance as ample house room as the commission intend later to give in one case where the house be an old french house with a leak in the roof i do not think the accommodation be good but in every other case among the score of house i enter at random the accommodation be good every room be neat and clean usually have book magazine and small ornament and in short just such a room as a self respect craftsman would be glad to live in at home the quarter for the married people be even well doubtless there must be here and there a married couple who with or without reason be not content with their house on the isthmus but i never happen to strike such a couple the wife of the steam shovel man engineer machinist and carpenter into whose house i go all with one accord express their pleasure in their home life and surrounding indeed i do not think they could have do otherwise the house themselves be excellent bathroom sitting room piazza and bedroom be all that could be desire in every house which i happen to enter the mistress of the home be evidently a good american housewife and helpmeet who have give to the home life that touch of attractiveness which of course the bachelor quarter neither have nor could have
 the housewife purchase their supply directly or through their husband from the commissary store of the commission all to whom i speak agree that the supply be excellent and all but two state that there be no complaint to be make these two complain that the price be excessive as compare to the price in the states on investigation i do not feel that this complaint be well found the married man eat at home the unmarried man sometimes eat at private boarding house or private mess but more often judge by the answer of those whom i question at the government canteen or hotel where the meal cost 30 cent to each employee this 30 cent meal strike i as be as good a meal as we get in the united states at the ordinary hotel in which a 50 cent meal be provide three fourth of the man whom i question state that the meal furnish at these government hotel be good the remain one fourth that they be not good i myself take dinner at the la boca government hotel no warning whatever having be give of my coming there be two room as generally in these hotel in one the employee be allow to dine without their coat while in the other they have to put they on the 30 cent meal include soup native beef which be good mashed potato pea beet chili con carne plum pudding tea coffee each man have as much of each dish as he desire on the table there be a bottle of liquid quinine tonic which two third of the guest as i be inform use every day there be neat tablecloth and napkin the man who be take the meal at or about the same time include railroad man machinist shipwright and member of the office force the room be clean comfortable and airy with mosquito screen around the outer piazza i be inform by some of those present that this hotel and also the other similar hotel be every saturday night turn into clubhouse where the american official the school teacher and various employee appear bring their wife there be dance and singing there be a piano in the room which i be inform be use for the music on these occasion my meal be excellent and two newspaper correspondent who have be on the isthmus several day inform i that it be precisely like the meal they have be get elsewhere at other government hotel one of the employee be a cousin of one of the secret service man who be with i and he state that the meal have always be good but that after a time he grow tired of they because they seem so much alike
 i come to the conclusion that speak generally there be no warrant for complaint about the food doubtless it grow monotonous after awhile any man accustom to handle large masse of man know that some of they even though otherwise very good man be sure to grumble about something and usually about their food schoolboy college boy and boarder in boarding house make similar complaint so do soldier and sailor on this very trip on one of the warship a seaman come to complain to the second watch officer about the quality of the cocoa at the seaman&#39;s mess say that it be not sweet enough it be point out to he that there be sugar on the table and he could always put it in to which he respond that that be the cook&#39;s business and not his i think that the complaint as to the food on the isthmus have but little more foundation than that of the sailor in question moreover i be give to understand that one real cause of complaint be that at the government hotel no liquor be serve and some of the drinking man therefore refuse to go to they the number of man use the government hotel be steadily increase
 of the nineteen or twenty thousand day laborer employ on the canal a few hundred be spaniards these do excellent work their foreman tell i that they do twice as well as the west india laborer they keep healthy and no difficulty be experience with they in any way some italian laborer be also employ in connection with the drilling as might be expect with labor as high price as at present in the united states it have not so far prove practicable to get any ordinary laborer from the united states the american wage worker on the isthmus be the highly pay skilled mechanic of the type mention previously a steady effort be be make to secure italians and especially to procure more spaniards because of the very satisfactory result that have come from their employment and their number will be increase as far as possible it have not prove possible however to get they in anything like the number need for the work and from present appearance we shall in the main have to rely for the ordinary unskilled work partly upon colored laborer from the west indies partly upon chinese labor it certainly ought to be unnecessary to point out that the american workingman in the united states have no concern whatever in the question as to whether the rough work on the isthmus which be perform by alien in any event be do by alien from one country with a black skin or by alien from another country with a yellow skin our business be to dig the canal as efficiently and as quickly as possible provide always that nothing be do that be inhumane to any laborer and nothing that interfere with the wage of or lower the standard of living of our own workman have in view this principle i have arrange to try several thousand chinese laborer this be desirable both because we must try to find out what laborer be most efficient and furthermore because we should not leave ourselves at the mercy of any one type of foreign labor at present the great bulk of the unskilled labor on the isthmus be do by west india negro chiefly from jamaica barbados and the other english possession one of the governor of the land in question have show an unfriendly disposition to our work and have throw obstacle in the way of our get the labor need and it be highly undesirable to give any outsider the impression however ill found that they be indispensable and can dictate term to we
 the west india laborer be fairly but only fairly satisfactory some of the man do very well indeed the well class who be to be find as foreman as skilled mechanic as policeman be good man and many of the ordinary day laborer be also good but thousand of those who be bring over under contract at our expense go off into the jungle to live or loaf around colon or work so badly after the first three or four day as to cause a serious diminution of the amount of labor perform on friday and saturday of each week i question many of these jamaica laborer as to the condition of their work and what if any change they wish i receive many complaint from they but as regard most of these complaint they themselves contradict one another in all case where the complaint be as to their treatment by any individual it prove on examination that this individual be himself a west india man of color either a policeman a storekeeper or an assistant storekeeper doubtless there must be many complaint against americans but those to whom i speak do not happen to make any such complaint to i there be no complaint of the housing i see but one set of quarter for color laborer which i think poor and this be in an old french house the barrack for unmarried man be roomy well ventilate and clean with canvas bunk for each man and a kind of false attic at the top where the trunk and other belonging of the different man be keep the clothe be hang on clothesline nothing be allow to be keep on the floor in each of these big room there be table and lamp and usually a few book or paper and in almost every room there be a bible the book be the property of the laborer themselves the cleanliness of the quarter be secure by daily inspection the quarter for the married negro laborer be good they be neatly keep and in almost every case the man live in they whose wife or daughter do the cooking for they be far well satisfied and of a high grade than the ordinary bachelor negro not only be the quarter in which these negro laborer be live much superior to those in which i be inform they live at home but they be much superior to the hut to be see in the jungle of panama itself beside the railroad track in which the low class of native panamans live as well as the negro workman when they leave the employ of the canal and go into the jungle a single glance at the two set of building be enough to show the great superiority in point of comfort cleanliness and healthfulness of the government house as compare with the native house
 the negro generally do their own cooking the bachelor cook in shed provide by the government and use their own pot in the different camp there be a wide variation in the character of these cooking shed in some where the camp be complete the kitchen or cooking shed as well as the bathroom and water closet be all in excellent trim while there be board sidewalk lead from building to building in other camp the kitchen or cook shed have not be floor and the sidewalk have not be put down while in one camp the bath house be not yet up in each case however every effort be be make to hurry on the construction and i do not believe that the delay have be great than be inevitable in such work the laborer be accustomed to do their own cooking but there be much complaint especially among the bachelor as to the quantity and some as to the quality of the food they get from the commissary department especially as regard yam on the other hand the married man and their wife and the more advanced among the bachelor almost invariably express themselves as entirely satisfied with their treatment at the commissary store except that they state that they generally could not get yam there and have to purchase they outside the chief complaint be that the price be too high it be unavoidable that the price should be high than in their own home and after careful investigation i come to the conclusion that the chief trouble lie in the fact that the yam plantain and the like be rather perishable food and be very bulky compare to the amount of nourishment they contain so that it be costly to import they in large quantity and difficult to keep they nevertheless i feel that an effort should be make to secure they a more ample supply of their favorite food and so directed and i believe that ultimately the government must itself feed they i be have this matter look into
 the superintendent have immediate charge of one gang of man at the colon reservoir state that he endeavor to get they to substitute bean and other nourishing food for the stringy watery yam because the man keep their strength and health well on the more nourishing food inasmuch however as they be accustom to yams it be difficult to get they to eat the more strengthen food and some time elapse before they grow accustomed to it at this reservoir there have be a curious experience it be off in the jungle by itself at the end of a couple of mile of a little toy railroad in order to get the laborer there they be give free food and of course free lodging and yet it prove difficult to keep they because they wish to be where they could reach the dramshop and place of amusement
 i be strike by the superior comfort and respectability of the life of the married man it would in my opinion be a most admirable thing if a much large number of the man have their wife for with their advent all complaint about the food and cooking be almost sure to cease
 i have an interview with mr. mallet the british consul to find out if there be any just cause for complaint as to the treatment of the west india negro he inform i most emphatically that there be not and authorize i to give his statement publicity he say that not only be the condition of the laborer far well than have be the case under the old french company but that year by year the condition be improve under our own regime he state that complaint be continually bring to he and that he always investigate they and that for the last six month he have fail to find a single complaint of a serious nature that contain any justification whatever
 one of the great need at present be to provide amusement both for the white man and the black the young men&#39;s christian association be try to do good work and should be in every way encouraged but the government should do the main work i have specifically call the attention of the commission to this matter and something have be accomplish already anything do for the welfare of the man add to their efficiency and money devote to that purpose be therefore properly to be consider as spend in build the canal it be imperatively necessary to provide ample recreation and amusement if the man be to be keep well and healthy i call the special attention of congress to this need
 this gathering distribute and care for the great force of laborer be one of the giant feature of the work that friction will from time to time occur in connection therewith be inevitable the astonishing thing be that the work have be perform so well and that the machinery run so smoothly from my own experience i be able to say that more care have be exercise in housing feeding and generally pay heed to the need of the skilled mechanic and ordinary laborer in the work on this canal than be the case in the construction of new railroad or in any other similar private or public work in the united states proper and it be the testimony of all people competent to speak that on no other similar work anywhere in the tropics indeed as far as i know anywhere else have there be such forethought and such success achieve in provide for the need of the man who do the work
 i have now deal with the hygienic condition which make it possible to employ a great force of laborer and with the task of gathering housing and feed these laborer there remain to consider the actual work which have to be do the work because of which these laborer be gather together the work of construct the canal this be under the direct control of the chief engineer mr. stevens who have already show admirable result and whom we can safely trust to achieve similar result in the future
 our people find on the isthmus a certain amount of old french material and equipment which could be use some of it in addition could be sell as scrap iron some could be use for furnish the foundation for fill in for much no possible use could be devise that would not cost more than it would bring in
 the work be now go on with a vigor and efficiency pleasant to witness the three big problem of the canal be the la boca dams the gatun dam and the culebra cut the culebra cut must be make anyhow but of course change as to the dams or at least as to the lock adjacent to the dams may still occur the la boca dam offer no particular problem the bottom material be so good that there be a practical certainty not merely as to what can be achieve but as to the time of achievement the gatun dam offer the most serious problem which we have to solve and yet the able man on the isthmus believe that this problem be certain of solution along the line propose although of course it necessitate great toil energy and intelligence and although equally of course there will be some little risk in connection with the work the risk arise from the fact that some of the material near the bottom be not so good as could be desire if the huge earth dam now contemplate be throw across from one foothill to the other we will have what be practically a low broad mountain ridge behind which will rise the inland lake this artificial mountain will probably show less seepage that is will have great restraining capacity than the average natural mountain range the exact locality of the lock at this dam as at the other dams be now be determine in april next secretary taft with three of the able engineer of the country messrs. noble stearns and ripley will visit the isthmus and the three engineer will make the final and conclusive examination as to the exact site for each lock meanwhile the work be go ahead without a break
 the culebra cut do not offer such great risk that is the damage liable to occur from occasional land slip will not represent what may be call major disaster the work will merely call for intelligence perseverance and executive capacity it be however the work upon which most labor will have to be spend the dam will be compose of the earth take out of the cut and very possibly the building of the lock and dam will take even long than the cutting in culebra itself
 the main work be now be do in the culebra cut it be strike and impressive to see the huge steam shovel in full play the dumping train carry away the rock and earth they dislodge the implement of french excavating machinery which often stand a little way from the line of work though of excellent construction look like the veri toy when compare with these new steam shovel just as the french dumping car seem like toy car when compare with the long train of huge car dump by steam plow which be now in use this represent the enormous advance that have be make in machinery during the past quarter of a century no doubt a quarter of a century hence this new machinery of which we be now so proud will similarly seem out of date but it be certainly serve its purpose well now the old french car have to be entirely discard we still have in use a few of the more modern but not most modern car which hold but twelve yard of earth they can be employ on certain line with sharp curve but the recent car hold from twenty five to thirty yard apiece and instead of the old clumsy method of unload they a steam plow be draw from end to end of the whole vestibuled train thus immensely economize labor in the rainy season the steam shovel can do but little in dirt but they work steadily in rock and in the hard ground there be some twenty five at work during the time i be on the isthmus and their tremendous power and efficiency be most impressive
 as soon as the type of canal be decide this work begin in good earnest the rainy season will shortly be over and then there will be an immense increase in the amount take out but even during the last three month in the rainy season steady progress be show by the figure in august 242,000 cubic yard in september 291,000 cubic yard and in october 325,000 cubic yard in october new record be establish for the output of individual shovel as well as for the tonnage haul of individual locomotive i hope to see the growth of a healthy spirit of emulation between the different shovel and locomotive crew just such a spirit as have grow on our battle ship between the different gun crew in matter of marksmanship pass through the cut the amount of new work can be see at a glance in one place the entire side of a hill have be take out recently by twenty seven ton of dynamite which be explode at one blast at another place i be give a presidential salute of twenty one charge of dynamite on the top notch of the culebra cut the prism be now as wide as it will be all tell the canal bed at this point have now be sink about two hundred foot below what it originally be it will have to be sink about one hundred and thirty foot far throughout the cut the drilling blasting shoveling and hauling be go on with constantly increase energy the huge shovel be press up as if they be mountain howitzer into the most unlikely look place where they eat their way into the hillside
 the most advanced method not only in construction but in railroad management have be apply in the zone with corresponding economy in time and cost this have be show in the handling of the tonnage from ship into car and from car into ship on the panama railroad where thank largely to the efficiency of general manager bierd the saving in time and cost have be noteworthy my examination tend to show that some of the department have doubtless necessarily become overdeveloped and could now be reduce or subordinate without impairment of efficiency and with a saving of cost the chairman of the commission mr. shonts have all matter of this kind constantly in view and be now reorganize the government of the zone so as to make the form of administration both more flexible and less expensive subordinate everything to direct efficiency with a view to the work of the canal commission from time to time change of this kind will undoubtedly have to be make for it must be remember that in this giant work of construction it be continually necessary to develop department or bureau which be vital for the time being but which soon become useless just as it will be continually necessary to put up building and even to erect town which in ten year will once more give place to jungle or will then be at the bottom of the great lake at the end of the canal
 it be not only natural but inevitable that a work as gigantic as this which have be undertake on the isthmus should arouse every specie of hostility and criticism the condition be so new and so try and the work so vast that it would be absolutely out of the question that mistake should not be make check will occur unforeseen difficulty will arise from time to time seemingly well settle plan will have to be change at present twenty five thousand man be engage on the task after a while the number will be double in such a multitude it be inevitable that there should be here and there a scoundrel very many of the poor class of laborer lack the mental development to protect themselves against either the rascality of other or their own folly and it be not possible for human wisdom to devise a plan by which they can invariably be protect in a place which have be for age a by word for unhealthfulness and with so large a congregation of stranger suddenly put down and set to hard work there will now and then be outbreak of disease there will now and then be shortcoming in administration there will be unlooke for accident to delay the excavation of the cut or the building of the dam and lock each such incident will be entirely natural and even though serious no one of they will mean more than a little extra delay or trouble yet each when discover by sensation monger and retail to timid folk of little faith will serve as an excuse for the belief that the whole work be be badly manage experiment will continually be try in housing in hygiene in street repair in dredging and in dig earth and rock now and then an experiment will be a failure and among those who hear of it a certain proportion of doubt thomases will at once believe that the whole work be a failure doubtless here and there some minor rascality will be uncover but as to this i have to say that after the most painstaking inquiry i have be unable to find a single reputable person who have so much as hear of any serious accusation affect the honesty of the commission or of any responsible officer under it i append a letter deal with the most serious charge that of the ownership of lot in colon the charge be not advance by a reputable man and be utterly baseless it be not too much to say that the whole atmosphere of the commission breathe honesty as it breathe efficiency and energy above all the work have be keep absolutely clear of politic i have never hear even a suggestion of spoil politic in connection with it
 i have investigate every complaint bring to i for which there seem to be any shadow of foundation in two or three case all of which i have indicate in the course of this message i come to the conclusion that there be foundation for the complaint and that the method of the commission in the respect complain of could be better in the other instance the complaint prove absolutely baseless save in two or three instance where they refer to mistake which the commission have already itself find out and correct
 so much for honest criticism there remain an immense amount of as reckless slander as have ever be publish where the slanderer be of foreign origin i have no concern with they where they be americans i feel for they the heartiest contempt and indignation because in a spirit of wanton dishonesty and malice they be try to interfere with and hamper the execution of the great work of the kind ever attempt and be seek to bring to naught the effort of their countryman to put to the credit of america one of the giant feat of the age the outrageous accusation of these slanderer constitute a gross libel upon a body of public servant who for train intelligence expert ability high character and devotion to duty have never be excel anywhere there be not a man among those direct the work on the isthmus who have obtain his position on any other basis than merit alone and not one who have use his position in any way for his own personal or pecuniary advantage
 after most careful consideration we have decide to let out most of the work by contract if we can come to satisfactory term with the contractor the whole work be of a kind suit to the peculiar genius of our people and our people have develop the type of contractor well fit to grapple with it it be of course much well to do the work in large part by contract than to do it all by the government provide it be possible on the one hand to secure to the contractor a sufficient remuneration to make it worth while for responsible contractor of the good kind to undertake the work and provide on the other hand it can be do on term which will not give an excessive profit to the contractor at the expense of the government after much consideration the plan already promulgate by the secretary of war be adopt this plan in its essential feature be draft after careful and thorough study and consideration by the chief engineer mr. stevens who while in the employment of mr. hill the president of the great northern railroad have personal experience of this very type of contract mr. stevens then submit the plan to the chairman of the commission mr. shouts who go carefully over it with mr. rogers the legal adviser of the commission to see that all legal difficulty be meet he then submit copy of the plan to both secretary taft and myself secretary taft submit it to some of the good counsel at the new york bar and afterwards i go over it very carefully with mr. taft and mr. shouts and we lay the plan in its general feature before mr. root my conclusion be that it combine the maximum of advantage with the minimum of disadvantage under it a premium will be put upon the speedy and economical construction of the canal and a penalty impose on delay and waste the plan as promulgate be tentative doubtless it will have to be change in some respect before we can come to a satisfactory agreement with responsible contractor perhaps even after the bid have be receive and of course it be possible that we can not come to an agreement in which case the government will do the work itself meanwhile the work on the isthmus be progress steadily and without any let up
 a seven headed commission be of course a clumsy executive instrument we should have but one commissioner with such head of department and other officer under he as we may find necessary we should be expressly permit to employ the good engineer in the country as consult engineer
  i accompany this paper with a map show substantially what the canal will be like when it be finish when the culebra cut have be make and the dam build if they be build as at present propose there will then be at both the pacific and atlantic end of the canal two great fresh water lake connect by a broad channel run at the bottom of a ravine across the backbone of the western hemisphere those well inform believe that the work will be complete in about eight year but it be never save to prophesy about such a work as this especially in the tropics
 i be inform that the representative of the commercial club of four cities&mdash;boston chicago cincinnati and st. louis&mdash;the membership of which include most of the lead business man of those city expect to visit the isthmus for the purpose of examine the work of construction of the canal i be glad to hear it and i shall direct that every facility be give they to see all that be to be see in the work which the government be do such interest as a visit like this would indicate will have a good effect upon the man who be do the work on one hand while on the other hand it will offer as witness of the exact condition man whose experience as business man and whose impartiality will make the result of their observation of value to the country as a whole
 of the success of the enterprise i be as well convince as one can be of any enterprise that be human it be a stupendous work upon which our fellow countryman be engage down there on the isthmus and while we should hold they to a strict accountability for the way in which they perform it we should yet recognize with frank generosity the epic nature of the task on which they be engage and its world wide importance they be do something which will redound immeasurably to the credit of america which will benefit all the world and which will last for age to come under mr. shonts and mr. stevens and doctor gorgas this work have start with every omen of good fortune they and their worthy associate from the high to the low be entitle to the same credit that we would give to the pick man of a victorious army for this conquest of peace will in its great and far reach effect stand as among the great conquest whether of peace or of war which have ever be win by any of the people of mankind a badge be to be give to every american citizen who for a specify time have take part in this work for participation in it will hereafter be hold to reflect honor upon the man participate just as it reflect honor upon a soldier to have belong to a mighty army in a great war for righteousness our fellow countryman on the isthmus be work for our interest and for the national renown in the same spirit and with the same efficiency that the man of the army and navy work i n time of war it behoove we in our turn to do all we can to hold up their hand and to aid they in every way to bring their great work to a triumphant conclusion

to the senate
 in response to senate resolution of december 6 address to i and to the two senate resolution address to he the secretary of war have by my direction submit to i a report which i herewith send to the senate together with several document include a letter of general nettleton and memoranda as to precedent for the summary discharge or muster out of regiment or company some or all of the member of which have be guilty of misconduct
 i order the discharge of nearly all the member of companies b c and d of the twenty fifth infantry by name in the exercise of my constitutional power and in pursuance of what after full consideration i find to be my constitutional duty as commander in chief of the united states army i be glad to avail myself of the opportunity afford by these resolution to lay before the senate the follow fact as to the murderous conduct of certain member of the company in question and as to the conspiracy by which many of the other member of these company save the criminal from justice to the disgrace of the united states uniform
 i call your attention to the accompany report of maj augustus p. blocksom of lieut col leonard a. lovering and of brig gen. ernest a. garlington the inspector general of the united states army of their investigation into the conduct of the troop in question an effort have be make to discredit the fairness of the investigation into the conduct of these colored troop by point out that general garlington be a southerner precisely the same action would have be take have the troop be white indeed the discharge would probably have be make in more summary fashion general garlington be a native of south carolina lieutenant colonel lovering be a native of new hampshire major blocksore be a native of ohio as it happen the disclosure of the guilt of the troop be make in the report of the officer who come from ohio and the effort of the officer who come from south carolina be confine to the endeavor to shield the innocent man of the company in question if any such there be by secure information which would enable we adequately to punish the guilty but i wish it distinctly understand that the fact of the birthplace of either officer be one which i absolutely refuse to consider the standard of professional honor and of loyalty to the flag and the service be the same for all officer and all enlisted man of the united states army and i resent with the keen indignation any effort to draw any line among they base upon birthplace creed or any other consideration of the kind i should put the same entire faith in these report if it have happen that they be all make by man come from some one state whether in the south or the north the east or the west as i now do when as it happen they be make by officer bear in different states
 major blocksom&#39;s report be most careful be base upon the testimony of score of eye witness testimony which conflict only in non essential and which establish the essential fact beyond chance of successful contradiction not only have no successful effort be make to traverse his finding in any essential particular but as a matter of fact every trustworthy report from outsider amply corroborate they by far the good of these outside report be that of gen. a. b. nettleton make in a letter to the secretary of war which i herewith append general nettleton be an ex union soldier a consistent friend of the colored man throughout his life a lifelong republican a citizen of illinois and assistant secretary of the treasury under president harrison
 it appear that in brownsville the city immediately beside which fort brown be situate there have be considerable feeling between the citizen and the colored troop of the garrison company difficulty have occur there be a conflict of evidence as to whether the citizen or the colored troop be to blame my impression be that as a matter of fact in these difficulty there be blame attach to both side but this be a wholly unimportant matter for our present purpose as nothing that occur offer in any shape or way an excuse or justification for the atrocious conduct of the troop when in lawless and murderous spirit and under cover of the night they make their attack upon the citizen
 the attack be make near midnight on august 13 the following fact as to this attack be make clear by major blocksom&#39;s investigation and have not be and in my judgment can not be successfully controvert from 9 to 15 or 20 of the colored soldier take part in the attack they leap over the wall from the barrack and hurry through the town they shoot at whomever they see move and they shoot into house where they see light in some of these house there be woman and child as the would be murderer must have know in one house in which there be two woman and five child some ten shot go through at a height of about 4 1/2 foot above the floor one put out the lamp upon the table the lieutenant of police of the town hear the firing and ride toward it he meet the raider who as he state be about 15 colored soldier they instantly start fire upon he he turn and ride off and they continue fire upon he until they have kill his horse they shoot he in the right arm it be afterwards amputate above the elbow a number of shot be also fire at two other policeman the raider fire several time into a hotel some of the shot be aim at a guest sit by a window they shoot into a saloon kill the bartender and wound another man at the same time other raider fire into another house in which woman and child be sleep two of the shot go through the mosquito bar over the bed in which the mistress of the house and her two child be lie several other house be strike by bullet it be at night and the street of the town be poorly light so that none of the individual raider be recognize but the evidence of many witness of all class be conclusive to the effect that the raider be negro soldier the shattered bullet shell and clip of the government rifle which be find on the ground be merely corroborative so be the bullet hole in the house some of which it appear must from the direction have be fire from the fort just at the moment when the soldier leave it not a bullet hole appear in any of the structure of the fort
 the townspeople be completely surprised by the unprovoked and murderous savagery of the attack the soldier be the aggressor from start to finish they meet with no substantial resistance and one and all who take part in that raid stand as deliberate murderer who do murder one man who try to murder other and who try to murder woman and child the act be one of horrible atrocity and so far as i be aware unparalleled for infamy in the annal of the united states army
 the white officer of the company be completely take by surprise and at first evidently believe that the firing mean that the townspeople be attack the soldier it be not until 2 or 3 o&#39;clock in the morning that any of they become aware of the truth i have direct a careful investigation into the conduct of the officer to see if any of they be blameworthy and i have approve the recommendation of the war department that two be bring before a court martial
 as to the noncommissioned officer and enlisted man there can be no doubt whatever that many be necessarily privy after if not before the attack to the conduct of those who take actual part in this murderous riot i refer to major blocksom&#39;s report for proof of the fact that certainly some and probably all of the noncommissioned officer in charge of quarter who be responsible for the gun rack and have key thereto in their personal possession know what man be engage in the attack
 major penrose in command of the post in his letter include in the appendix give the reason why he be reluctantly convince that some of the man under he as he think from 7 to 10 -got their rifle slip out of quarter to do the shooting and return to the barrack without be discover the shooting all occur within two and a half short block of the barrack it be possible for the raider to go from the fort to the farth point of firing and return in less than ten minute for the distance do not exceed 350 yard
 such be the fact of this case general nettleton in his letter herewith append state that next door to where he be write in brownsville be a small cottage where a children&#39;s party have just break up before the house be riddle by united states bullet fire by united states troop from united states springfield rifle at close range with the purpose of kill or maim the inmate include the parent and child who be still in the well light house and whose escape from death under such circumstance be astonishing he state that on another street he daily look upon fresh bullet scar where a volley from similar government rifle be fire into the side and window of a hotel occupy at the time by sleep or frightened guest from abroad who could not possibly have give any offense to the assailant he write that the chief of the brownsville police be again on duty from hospital and carry an empty sleeve because be be shoot by federal soldier from the adjacent garrison in the course of their murderous foray and not far away be the fresh grave of an unoffending citizen of the place a boy in year who be wantonly shoot down by these united states soldier while unarmed and attempt to escape
 the effort to confute this testimony so far have consist in the assertion or implication that the townspeople shoot one another in order to discredit the soldier an absurdity too gross to need discussion and unsupported by a shred of evidence there be no question as to the murder and the attempt murder there be no question that some of the soldier be guilty thereof there be no question that many of their comrade privy to the deed have combine to shelter the criminal from justice these comrade of the murderer by their own action have render it necessary either to leave all the man include the murderer in the army or to turn they all out and under such circumstance there be no alternative for the usefulness of the army would be at an end be we to permit such an outrage to be commit with impunity
 in short the evidence prove conclusively that a number of the soldier engage in a deliberate and concerted attack as cold blooded as it be cowardly the purpose be to terrorize the community and to kill or injure man woman and child in their home and bed or on the street and this at an hour of the night when concerted or effective resistance or defense be out of the question and when detection by identification of the criminal in the united states uniform be well nigh impossible so much for the original crime a blacker never stain the annal of our army it have be supplement by another only less black in the shape of a successful conspiracy of silence for the purpose of shield those who take part in the original conspiracy of murder these soldier be not school boy on a frolic they be full grow man in the uniform of the united states army arm with deadly weapon swear to uphold the law of the united states and under every obligation of oath and honor not merely to refrain from criminality but with the sturdy rigor to hunt down criminality and the crime they commit or connive at be murder they pervert the power put into their hand to sustain the law into the most deadly violation of the law the noncommissioned officer be primarily responsible for the discipline and good conduct of the man they be appoint to their position for the very purpose of preserve this discipline and good conduct and of detect and secure the punishment of every enlisted man who do what be wrong they fill with reference to the discipline a part that the commission officer be of course unable to fill although the ultimate responsibility for the discipline can never be shift from the shoulder of the latter under any ordinary circumstance the first duty of the noncommissioned officer as of the commission officer be to train the private in the rank so that he may be an efficient fighting man against a foreign foe but there be an even high duty so obvious that it be not under ordinary circumstance necessary so much as to allude to it the duty of train the soldier so that he shall be a protection and not a menace to his peaceful fellow citizen and above all to the woman and child of the nation unless this duty be well perform the army become a mere dangerous mob and if conduct such as that of the murderer in question be not where possible punish and where this be not possible unless the chance of its repetition be guard against in the most thoroughgoing fashion it would be well that the entire army should be disband it be vital for the army to be imbue with the spirit which will make every man in it and above all the officer and non commission officer feel it a matter of high obligation to discover and punish and not to shield the criminal in uniform
 yet some of the noncommissioned officer and many of the man of the three company in question have band together in a conspiracy to protect the assassin and would be assassin who have disgrace their uniform by the conduct above relate many of these non commission officer and man must have know and all of they may have know circumstance which would have lead to the conviction of those engage in the murderous assault they have stolidly and as one man break their oath of enlistment and refuse to help discover the criminal
 by my direction every effort be make to persuade those innocent of murder among they to separate themselves from the guilty by help bring the criminal to justice they be warn that if they do not take advantage of the offer they would all be discharge from the service and forbid again to enter the employ of the government they refuse to profit by the warning i accordingly have they discharge if any organization of troop in the service white or black be guilty of similar conduct in the future i shall follow precisely the same course under no circumstance will i consent to keep in the service body of man whom the circumstance show to be a menace to the country incidentally i may add that the soldier of long service and high position who suffer because of the order so far from be those who deserve most sympathy deserve least for they be the very man upon whom we should be able especially to rely to prevent mutiny and murder
 people have speak as if this discharge from the service be a punishment i deny emphatically that such be the case because as punishment it be utterly inadequate the punishment meet for mutineer and murderer such as those guilty of the brownsville assault be death and a punishment only less severe ought to be mete out to those who have aid and abet mutiny and murder and treason by refuse to help in their detection i would that it be possible for i to have punish the guilty man i regret most keenly that i have not be able to do so
 be it remember always that these man be all in the service of the united states under contract of enlistment which by their term and by statute be terminable by my direction as commander in chief of the army it be my clear duty to terminate those contract when the public interest demand it and it would have be a betrayal of the public interest on my part not to terminate the contract which be keep in the service of the united states a body of mutineer and murderer
 any assertion that these man be deal with harshly because they be color man be utterly without foundation officer or enlisted man white man or colored man who be guilty of such conduct would have be treat in precisely the same way for there can be nothing more important than for the united states army in all its membership to understand that its arm can not be turn with impunity against the peace and order of the civil community
 there be plenty of precedent for the action take i call your attention to the memoranda herewith submit from the military secretary&#39;s office of the war department and a memorandum from the military secretary enclose a piece by ex corporal hesse now chief of division in the military secretary&#39;s office together with a letter from district attorney james wilkinson of new orleans the district attorney&#39;s letter recite several case in which white united states soldier be arrest for crime be try and every soldier and employee of the regiment or in the fort at which the soldier be station volunteer all they know both before and at the trial so as to secure justice in one case the soldier be acquit in another case the soldier be convict of murder the conviction result from the fact that every soldier from the command officer to the humblest private unite in secure all the evidence in their power about the crime in other case for less offense soldier be convict purely because their comrade in arm in a spirit of fine loyalty to the honor of the service at once tell the whole story of the trouble and decline to identify themselves with the criminal
 during the civil war numerous precedent for the action take by i occur in the shape of the summary discharge of regiment or company because of misconduct on the part of some or all of their member the sixtieth ohio be summarily discharge on the ground that the regiment be disorganize mutinous and worthless the eleventh new york be discharge by reason of general demoralization and numerous desertion three company of the fifth missouri cavalry and one company of the fourth missouri cavalry be muster out of the service of the united states without trial by court martial by reason of mutinous conduct and disaffection of the majority of the member of these company an almost exact parallel to my action another missouri regiment be muster out of service because it be in a state border closely on mutiny other example include new jersey maryland and other organization be give in the enclose paper
 i call your particular attention to the special field order of brig gen. u. s. grant issue from the headquarters of the thirteenth army corps on november 16 1862 in reference to the twentieth illinois member of this regiment have break into a store and take good to the value of some $ 1,240 and the rest of the regiment include especially two officer fail in the word of general grant to exercise their authority to ferret out the man guilty of the offense general grant accordingly muster out of the service of the united states the two officer in question and assess the sum of $ 1,240 against the say regiment as a whole officer and man to be assess pro rata on their pay in its essence this action be precisely similar to that i have take although the offense be of course trivial compare to the offense with which i have to deal
 ex corporal hesse recite what occur in a united states regular regiment in the spring of 1860 corporal hesse subsequently when the regiment be surrender to the confederates by general twiggs save the regimental color by wrap they about his body under his clothing and bring they north in safety receive a medal of honor for his action it appear that certain member of the regiment lynch a barkeeper who have kill one of the soldier be unable to discover the culprit col robert e. lee then in command of the department of texas order the company to be disband and the member transfer to other company and discharge at the end of their enlistment without honor owe to the outbreak of the civil war and the consequent loss of record and confusion it be not possible to say what finally become of this case
 when general lee be in command of the army of northern virginia as will appear from the inclose clipping from the charlotte observer he issue an order in october 1864 disband a certain battalion for cowardly conduct state at the time his regret that there be some officer and man belong to the organization who although not deserve it be oblige to share in the common disgrace because the good of the service demand it
 in addition to the discharge of organization which be of course infrequent there be continual case of the discharge of individual enlisted man without honor and without trial by court martial the official record show that during the fiscal year end june 30 last such discharge be issue by the war department without trial by court martial in the case of 352 enlisted man of the regular army 35 of they be on account of having become disqualify for service through own misconduct moreover in addition to the discharge without honor order by the war department there be a considerable number of discharge without honor issue by subordinate military authority under paragraph 148 of the army regulations where the service have not be honest and faithful that be where the service do not warrant reenlistment
 so much for the military side of the case but i wish to say something additional from the standpoint of the race question in my message at the opening of the congress i discuss the matter of lynch in it i give utterance to the abhorrence which all decent citizen should feel for the deed of the man in almost all case white man who take part in lynching and at the same time i condemn as all decent man of any color should condemn the action of those colored man who actively or passively shield the colored criminal from the law in the case of these company we have to deal with man who in the first place be guilty of what be practically the bad possible form of lynching for a lynching be in its essence lawless and murderous vengeance take by an armed mob for real or fancied wrong and who in the second place cover up the crime of lynch by stand with a vicious solidarity to protect the criminal
 it be of the utmost importance to all our people that we shall deal with each man on his merit as a man and not deal with he merely as a member of a give race that we shall judge each man by his conduct and not his color this be important for the white man and it be far more important for the colored man more evil and sinister counsel never be give to any people than that give to colored man by those adviser whether black or white who by apology and condonation encourage conduct such as that of the three company in question if the colored man elect to stand by criminal of their own race because they be of their own race they assuredly lie up for themselves the most dreadful day of reckoning every farsighte friend of the colored race in its effort to strive onward and upward should teach first as the most important lesson alike to the white man and the black the duty of treat the individual man strictly on his worth as he show it any conduct by colored people which tend to substitute for this rule the rule of stand by and shield an evil doer because he be a member of their race mean the inevitable degradation of the colored race it may and probably do mean damage to the white race but it mean ruin to the black race
 throughout my term of service in the presidency i have act on the principle thus advocate in the north as in the south i have appoint colored man of high character to office utterly disregard the protest of those who would have keep they out of office because they be color man so far as be in my power i have seek to secure for the colored people all their right under the law i have do all i could to secure they equal school training when young equal opportunity to earn their livelihood and achieve their happiness when old i have strive to break up peonage i have uphold the hand of those who like judge jones and judge speer have war against this peonage because i would hold myself unfit to be president if i do not feel the same revolt at wrong do a colored man as i feel at wrong do a white man i have condemn in unstinted term the crime of lynching perpetrate by white man and i should take instant advantage of any opportunity whereby i could bring to justice a mob of lyncher in precisely the same spirit i have now act with reference to these colored man who have be guilty of a black and dastardly crime in one policy as in the other i do not claim as a favor but i challenge as a right the support of every citizen of this country whatever his color provide only he have in he the spirit of genuine and farsighte patriotism

to the senate and house of representatives no nation have great resource than our and i think it can be truthfully say that the citizen of no nation possess great energy and industrial ability in no nation be the fundamental business condition sounder than in ours at this very moment and it be foolish when such be the case for people to hoard money instead of keep it in sound bank for it be such hoarding that be the immediate occasion of money stringency moreover as a rule the business of our people be conduct with honesty and probity and this apply alike to farm and factory to railroad and bank to all our legitimate commercial enterprise in any large body of man however there be certain to be some who be dishonest and if the condition be such that these man prosper or commit their misdeed with impunity their example be a very evil thing for the community where these man be business man of great sagacity and of temperament both unscrupulous and reckless and where the condition be such that they act without supervision or control and at first without effective check from public opinion they delude many innocent people into make investment or embark in kind of business that be really unsound when the misdeed of these successfully dishonest man be discover suffer come not only upon they but upon the innocent man whom they have mislead it be a painful awakening whenever it occur and naturally when it do occur those who suffer be apt to forget that the long it be defer the more painful it would be in the effort to punish the guilty it be both wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible to minimize the distress of those who have be mislead by the guilty yet it be not possible to refrain because of such distress from strive to put an end to the misdeed that be the ultimate cause of the suffering and as a means to this end where possible to punish those responsible for they there may be honest difference of opinion as to many governmental policy but surely there can be no such difference as to the need of unflinche perseverance in the war against successful dishonesty in my message to the congress on december 5 1905 i said:"if the folly of man mar the general well being then those who be innocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incur by those who be guilty of the folly a panic bring on by the speculative folly of part of the business community would hurt the whole business community but such stoppage of welfare though it might be severe would not be last in the long run the one vital factor in the permanent prosperity of the country be the high individual character of the average american worker the average american citizen no matter whether his work be mental or manual whether he be farmer or wage worker business man or professional man "in our industrial and social system the interest of all man be so closely intertwine that in the immense majority of case a straight deal man who by his efficiency by his ingenuity and industry benefit himself must also benefit other normally the man of great productive capacity who become rich by guide the labor of many other man do so by enable they to produce more than they could produce without his guidance and both he and they share in the benefit which come also to the public at large the superficial fact that the sharing may be unequal must never blind we to the underlying fact that there be this sharing and that the benefit come in some degree to each man concern normally the wageworker the man of small mean and the average consumer as well as the average producer be all alike help by make condition such that the man of exceptional business ability receive an exceptional reward for his ability something can be do by legislation to help the general prosperity but no such help of a permanently beneficial character can be give to the less able and less fortunate save as the result of a policy which shall inure to the advantage of all industrious and efficient people who act decently and this be only another way of say that any benefit which come to the less able and less fortunate must of necessity come even more to the more able and more fortunate if therefore the less fortunate man be move by envy of his more fortunate brother to strike at the condition under which they have both though unequally prosper the result will assuredly be that while damage may come to the one strike at it will visit with an even heavy load the one who strike the blow take as a whole we must all go up or go down together "yet while not merely admit but insist upon this it be also true that where there be no governmental restraint or supervision some of the exceptional man use their energy not in way that be for the common good but in way which tell against this common good the fortune amass through corporate organization be now so large and vest such power in those that wield they as to make it a matter of necessity to give to the sovereign that be to the government which represent the people as a whole some effective power of supervision over their corporate use in order to insure a healthy social and industrial life every big corporation should be hold responsible by and be accountable to some sovereign strong enough to control its conduct i be in no sense hostile to corporation this be an age of combination and any effort to prevent all combination will be not only useless but in the end vicious because of the contempt for law which the failure to enforce law inevitably produce we should moreover recognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effect by corporate agency in a country such as ours and the wealth of intellect energy and fidelity devote to their service and therefore normally to the service of the public by their officer and director the corporation have come to stay just as the trade union have come to stay each can do and have do great good each should be favor so long as it do good but each should be sharply check where it act against law and justice "the maker of our national constitution provide especially that the regulation of interstate commerce should come within the sphere of the general government the argument in favor of their take this stand be even then overwhelming but they be far strong to day in view of the enormous development of great business agency usually corporate in form experience have show conclusively that it be useless to try to get any adequate regulation and supervision of these great corporation by state action such regulation and supervision can only be effectively exercise by a sovereign whose jurisdiction be coextensive with the field of work of the corporation that be by the national government i believe that this regulation and supervision can be obtain by the enactment of law by the congress our steady aim should be by legislation cautiously and carefully undertake but resolutely persevere in to assert the sovereignty of the national government by affirmative action "this be only in form an innovation in substance it be merely a restoration for from the early time such regulation of industrial activity have be recognize in the action of the lawmaking body and all that i propose be to meet the change condition in such manner as will prevent the commonwealth abdicate the power it have always possess not only in this country but also in england before and since this country become a separate nation "it have be a misfortune that the national law on this subject have hitherto be of a negative or prohibitive rather than an affirmative kind and still more that they have in part seek to prohibit what could not be effectively prohibit and have in part in their prohibition confound what should be allow and what should not be allow it be generally useless to try to prohibit all restraint on competition whether this restraint be reasonable or unreasonable and where it be not useless it be generally hurtful the successful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develop another device to accomplish the same purpose what be need be not sweep prohibition of every arrangement good or bad which may tend to restrict competition but such adequate supervision and regulation as will prevent any restriction of competition from be to the detriment of the public as well as such supervision and regulation as will prevent other abuse in no way connect with restriction of competition "i have call your attention in these quotation to what i have already say because i be satisfied that it be the duty of the national government to embody in action the principle thus express no small part of the trouble that we have come from carry to an extreme the national virtue of self reliance of independence in initiative and action it be wise to conserve this virtue and to provide for its full exercise compatible with see that liberty do not become a liberty to wrong other unfortunately this be the kind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation inevitably breed founder of the constitution provide that the national government should have complete and sole control of interstate commerce there be then practically no interstate business save such as be conduct by water and this the national government at once proceed to regulate in thoroughgoe and effective fashion condition have now so wholly change that the interstate commerce by water be insignificant compare with the amount that go by land and almost all big business concern be now engage in interstate commerce as a result it can be but partially and imperfectly control or regulate by the action of any one of the several states such action inevitably tend to be either too drastic or else too lax and in either case ineffective for purpose of justice only the national government can in thoroughgoe fashion exercise the need control this do not mean that there should be any extension of federal authority for such authority already exist under the constitution in amplest and most far reach form but it do mean that there should be an extension of federal activity this be not advocate centralization it be merely look fact in the face and realize that centralization in business have already come and can not be avoid or undo and that the public at large can only protect itself from certain evil effect of this business centralization by provide well method for the exercise of control through the authority already centralize in the national government by the constitution itself there must be no ball in the healthy constructive course of action which this nation have elect to pursue and have steadily pursue during the last six year as show both in the legislation of the congress and the administration of the law by the department of justice the most vital need be in connection with the railroad as to these in my judgment there should now be either a national incorporation act or a law licensing railway company to engage in interstate commerce upon certain condition the law should be so frame as to give to the interstate commerce commission power to pass upon the future issue of security while ample mean should be provide to enable the commission whenever in its judgment it be necessary to make a physical valuation of any railroad as i state in my message to the congress a year ago railroad should be give power to enter into agreement subject to these argreement be make public in minute detail and to the consent of the interstate commerce commission be first obtain until the national government assume proper control of interstate commerce in the exercise of the authority it already possess it will be impossible either to give to or to get from the railroad full justice the railroad and all other great corporation will do well to recognize that this control must come the only question be as to what governmental body can most wisely exercise it the court will determine the limit within which the federal authority can exercise it and there will still remain ample work within each state for the railway commission of that state and the national interstate commerce commission will work in harmony with the several state commission each within its own province to achieve the desire end moreover in my judgment there should be additional legislation look to the proper control of the great business concern engage in interstate business this control to be exercise for their own benefit and prosperity no less than for the protection of investor and of the general public as i have repeatedly say in message to the congress and elsewhere experience have definitely show not merely the unwisdom but the futility of endeavor to put a stop to all business combination modern industrial condition be such that combination be not only necessary but inevitable it be so in the world of business just as it be so in the world of labor and it be as idle to desire to put an end to all corporation to all big combination of capital as to desire to put an end to combination of labor corporation and labor union alike have come to stay each if properly manage be a source of good and not evil whenever in either there be evil it should be promptly hold to account but it should receive hearty encouragement so long as it be properly manage it be profoundly immoral to put or keep on the statute book a law nominally in the interest of public morality that really put a premium upon public immorality by undertake to forbid honest man from do what must be do under modern business condition so that the law itself provide that its own infraction must be the condition precedent upon business success to aim at the accomplishment of too much usually mean the accomplishment of too little and often the doing of positive damage in my message to the congress a year ago in speak of the antitrust law i said:"the actual working of our law have show that the effort to prohibit all combination good or bad be noxious where it be not ineffective combination of capital like combination of labor be a necessary element in our present industrial system it be not possible completely to prevent it and if it be possible such complete prevention would do damage to the body politic what we need be not vainly to try to prevent all combination but to secure such rigorous and adequate control and supervision of the combination as to prevent their injure the public or exist in such form as inevitably to threaten injury it be unfortunate that our present law should forbid all combination instead of sharply discriminate between those combination which do evil often railroad would like to combine for the purpose of prevent a big shipper from maintain improper advantage at the expense of small shipper and of the general public such a combination instead of be forbid by law should be favor it be a public evil to have on the statute book a law incapable of full enforcement because both judge and jury realize that its full enforcement would destroy the business of the country for the result be to make decent man violator of the law against their will and to put a premium on the behavior of the willful wrongdoer such a result in turn tend to throw the decent man and the willful wrongdoer into close association and in the end to drag clown the former to the latter 's level for the man who become a lawbreaker in one way unhappily tend to lose all respect for law and to be willing to break it in many way no more scathing condemnation could be visit upon a law than be contain in the word of the interstate commerce commission when in comment upon the fact that the numerous joint traffic association do technically violate the law they say the decision of the united states supreme court in the trans missouri case and the joint traffic association case have produce no practical effect upon the railway operation of the country such association in fact exist now as they do before these decision and with the same general effect in justice to all party we ought probably to add that it be difficult to see how our interstate railway could be operate with due regard to the interest of the shipper and the railway without concerted action of the kind afford through these asociation '"this mean that the law as construe by the supreme court be such that the business of the country can not be conduct without break it "as i have elsewhere said:'all this be substantially what i have say over and over again surely it ought not to be necessary to say that it in no shape or way represent any hostility to corporation as such on the contrary it mean a frank recognition of the fact that combination of capital like combination of labor be a natural result of modern condition and of our national development as far as in my ability lie my endeavor be and will be to prevent abuse of power by either and to favor both so long as they do well the aim of the national government be quite as much to favor and protect honest corporation honest business man of wealth as to bring to justice those individual and corporation represent dishonest method most certainly there will be no relaxation by the government authority in the effort to get at any great railroad wrecker any man who by clever swindle device rob investor oppress wage worker and do injustice to the general public but any such move as this be in the interest of honest railway operator of honest corporation and of those who when they invest their small saving in stock and bond wish to be assure that these will represent money honestly expend for legitimate business purpose to confer upon the national government the power for which i ask would be a check upon overcapitalization and upon the clever gambler who benefit by overcapitalization but it alone would mean an increase in the value an increase in the safety of the stock and bond of law abide honestly manage railroad and would render it far easy to market their security i believe in proper publicity there have be complaint of some of the investigation recently carry on but those who complain should put the blame where it belong upon the misdeed which be do in darkness and not upon the investigation which bring they to light the administration be responsible for turn on the light but it be not responsible for what the light show i ask for full power to be give the federal government because no single state can by legislation effectually cope with these powerful corporation engage in interstate commerce and while do they full justice exact from they in return full justice to other the condition of railroad activity the condition of our immense interstate commerce be such as to make the central government alone competent to exercise full supervision and control "the grave abuse in individual case of railroad management in the past represent wrong not merely to the general public but above all wrong to fair deal and honest corporation and man of wealth because they excite a popular anger and distrust which from the very nature of the case tend to include in the sweep of its resentment good and bad alike from the standpoint of the public i can not too earnestly say that as soon as the natural and proper resentment arouse by these abuse become indiscriminate and unthinking it also become not merely unwise and unfair but calculate to defeat the very end which those feel it have in view there have be plenty of dishonest work by corporation in the past there will not be the slight let up in the effort to hunt down and punish every dishonest man but the bulk of our business be honestly do in the natural indignation the people feel over the dishonesty it be essential that they should not lose their head and get draw into an indiscriminate raid upon all corporation all people of wealth whether they do well or ill out of any such wild movement good will not come can not come and never have come on the contrary the sure way to invite reaction be to follow the lead of either demagogue or visionary in a sweeping assault upon property value and upon public confidence which would work incalculable damage in the business world and would produce such distrust of the agitator that in the revulsion the distrust would extend to honest man who in sincere and same fashion be try to remedy the evil "the antitrust law should not be repeal but it should be make both more efficient and more in harmony with actual condition it should be so amend as to forbid only the kind of combination which do harm to the general public such amendment to be accompany by or to be an incident of a grant of supervisory power to the government over these big concern engage in interstate business this should be accompany by provision for the compulsory publication of account and the subjection of book and paper to the inspection of the government official a beginning have already be make for such supervision by the establishment of the bureau of corporations the antitrust law should not prohibit combination that do no injustice to the public still less those the existence of which be on the whole of benefit to the public but even if this feature of the law be abolish there would remain as an equally objectionable feature the difficulty and delay now incident to its enforcement the government must now submit to irksome and repeat delay before obtain a final decision of the court upon proceeding institute and even a favorable decree may mean an empty victory moreover to attempt to control these corporation by lawsuit mean to impose upon both the department of justice and the court an impossible burden it be not feasible to carry on more than a limited number of such suit such a law to be really effective must of course be administer by an executive body and not merely by mean of lawsuit the design should be to prevent the abuse incident to the creation of unhealthy and improper combination instead of wait until they be in existence and then attempt to destroy they by civil or criminal proceeding a combination should not be tolerate if it abuse the power acquire by combination to the public detriment no corporation or association of any kind should be permit to engage in foreign or interstate commerce that be form for the purpose of or whose operation create a monopoly or general control of the production sale or distribution of any one or more of the prime necessity of life or article of general use and necessity such combination be against public policy they violate the common law the door of the court be close to those who be party to they and i believe the congress can close the channel of interstate commerce against they for its protection the law should make its prohibition and permission as clear and definite as possible leave the least possible room for arbitrary action or allegation of such action on the part of the executive or of divergent interpretation by the court among the point to be aim at should be the prohibition of unhealthy competition such as by render service at an actual loss for the purpose of crush out competition the prevention of inflation of capital and the prohibition of a corporation 's make exclusive trade with itself a condition of have any trade with itself reasonable agreement between or combination of corporation should be permit provide they be submit to and approve by some appropriate government body the congress have the power to charter corporation to engage in interstate and foreign commerce and a general law can be enact under the provision of which exist corporation could take out federal charter and new federal corporation could be create an essential provision of such a law should be a method of predetermine by some federal board or commission whether the applicant for a federal charter be an association or combination within the restriction of the federal law provision should also be make for complete publicity in all matter affect the public and complete protection to the invest public and the shareholder in the matter of issue corporate security if an incorporation law be not deem advisable a license act for big interstate corporation might be enact or a combination of the two might be try the supervision establish might be analogous to that now exercise over national bank at least the antitrust act should be supplement by specific prohibition of the method which experience have show have be of most service in enable monopolistic combination to crush out competition the real owner of a corporation should be compel to do business in their own name the right to hold stock in other corporation should hereafter be deny to interstate corporation unless on approval by the government official and a prerequisite to such approval should be the listing with the government of all owner and stockholder both by the corporation own such stock and by the corporation in which such stock be own to confer upon the national government in connection with the amendment i advocate in the antitrust law power of supervision over big business concern engage in interstate commerce would benefit they as it have benefit the national bank in the recent business crisis it be noteworthy that the institution which fail be institution which be not under the supervision and control of the national government those which be under national control stand the test national control of the kind above advocate would be to the benefit of every well manage railway from the standpoint of the public there be need for additional track additional terminal and improvement in the actual handling of the railroad and all this as rapidly as possible ample safe and speedy transportation facility be even more necessary than cheap transportation therefore there be need for the investment of money which will provide for all these thing while at the same time secure as far as be possible well wage and short hour for their employee therefore while there must be just and reasonable regulation of rate we should be the first to protest against any arbitrary and unthinke movement to cut they down without the full and most careful consideration of all interest concern and of the actual need of the situation only a special body of man act for the national government under authority confer upon it by the congress be competent to pass judgment on such a matter those who fear from any reason the extension of federal activity will do well to study the history not only of the national banking act but of the pure food law and notably the meat inspection law recently enact the pure food law be oppose so violently that its passage be delay for a decade yet it have work unmixed and immediate good the meat inspection law be even more violently assail and the same man who now denounce the attitude of the national government in seek to oversee and control the working of interstate common carrier and business concern then assert that we be discredit and ruin a great american industry two year have not elapse and already it have become evident that the great benefit the law confer upon the public be accompany by an equal benefit to the reputable packing establishment the latter be well off under the law than they be without it the benefit to interstate common carrier and business concern from the legislation i advocate would be equally marked incidentally in the passage of the pure food law the action of the various state food and dairy commissioner show in strike fashion how much good for the whole people result from the hearty cooperation of the federal and state official in secure a give reform it be primarily to the action of these state commissioner that we owe the enactment of this law for they arouse the people first to demand the enactment and enforcement of state law on the subject and then the enactment of the federal law without which the state law be largely ineffective there must be the close cooperation between the national and state government in administer these law in my message to the congress a year ago i speak as follow of the currency:"i especially call your attention to the condition of our currency law the national bank act have ably serve a great purpose in aid the enormous business development of the country and within ten year there have be an increase in circulation per capita from $ 21.41 to $ 33.08 for several year evidence have be accumulate that additional legislation be need the recurrence of each crop season emphasize the defect of the present law there must soon be a revision of they because to leave they as they be means to incur liability of business disaster since your body adjourn there have be a fluctuation in the interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30 percent and the fluctuation be even great during the precede six month the secretary of the treasury have to step in and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation even bad than such fluctuation be the advance in commercial rate and the uncertainty feel in the sufficiency of credit even at high rate all commercial interest suffer during each crop period excessive rate for call money in new york attract money from the interior bank into the speculative field this deplete the fund that would otherwise be available for commercial use and commercial borrower be force to pay abnormal rate so that each fall a tax in the shape of increase interest charge be place on the whole commerce of the country "the mere statement of these fact show that our present system be seriously defective there be need of a change unfortunately however many of the propose change must be rule from consideration because they be complicated be not easy of comprehension and tend to disturb exist right and interest we must also rule out any plan which would materially impair the value of the united states 2 per cent bond now pledge to secure circulation the issue of which be make under condition peculiarly creditable to the treasury i do not press any especial plan various plan have recently be propose by expert committee of banker among the plan which be possibly feasible and which certainly should receive your consideration be that repeatedly bring to your attention by the present secretary of the treasury the essential feature of which have be approve by many prominent banker and business man accord to this plan national bank should be permit to issue a specify proportion of their capital in note of a give kind the issue to be tax at so high a rate as to drive the note back when not want in legitimate trade this plan would not permit the issue of currency to give bank additional profit but to meet the emergency present by time of stringency "i do not say that this be the right system i only advance it to emphasize my belief that there be need for the adoption of some system which shall be automatic and open to all sound bank so as to avoid all possibility of discrimination and favoritism such a plan would tend to prevent the spasm of high money and speculation which now obtain in the new york market for at present there be too much currency at certain season of the year and its accumulation at new york tempt banker to lend it at low rate for speculative purpose whereas at other time when the crop be be move there be urgent need for a large but temporary increase in the currency supply it must never be forget that this question concern business man generally quite as much as banker especially be this true of stockman farmer and business man in the west for at present at certain season of the year the difference in interest rate between the east and the west be from 6 to 10 per cent whereas in canada the correspond difference be but 2 per cent any plan must of course guard the interest of western and southern banker as carefully as it guard the interest of new york or chicago banker and must be draw from the standpoint of the farmer and the merchant no less than from the standpoint of the city banker and the country banker "i again urge on the congress the need of immediate attention to this matter we need a great elasticity in our currency provide of course that we recognize the even great need of a safe and secure currency there must always be the most rigid examination by the national authority provision should be make for an emergency currency the emergency issue should of course be make with an effective guaranty and upon condition carefully prescribe by the government such emergency issue must be base on adequate security approve by the government and must be issue under a heavy tax this would permit currency be issue when the demand for it be urgent while secure its requirement as the demand fall off it be worth investigate to determine whether officer and director of national bank should ever be allow to loan to themselves trust company should be subject to the same supervision as bank legislation to this effect should be enact for the district of columbia and the territories yet we must also remember that even the wise legislation on the subject can only accomplish a certain amount no legislation can by any possibility guarantee the business community against the result of speculative folly any more than it can guarantee an individual against the result of his extravagance when an individual mortgage his house to buy an automobile he invite disaster and when wealthy man or man who pose as such or be unscrupulously or foolishly eager to become such indulge in reckless speculation especially if it be accompany by dishonesty they jeopardize not only their own future but the future of all their innocent fellow citizen for the expose the whole business community to panic and distress the income account of the nation be in a most satisfactory condition for the six fiscal year end with the 1st of july last the total expenditure and revenue of the national government exclusive of the postal revenue and expenditure be in round number revenue $ 3,465,000,0000 and expenditure $ 3,275,000,000 the net excess of income over expenditure include in the latter the fifty million expend for the panama canal be one hundred and ninety million dollar for the six year an average of about thirty one million a year this represent an approximation between income and outgo which it would be hard to improve the satisfactory working of the present tariff law have be chiefly responsible for this excellent showing nevertheless there be an evident and constantly grow feeling among our people that the time be rapidly approach when our system of revenue legislation must be revise this country be definitely committed to the protective system and any effort to uproot it could not but cause widespread industrial disaster in other word the principle of the present tariff law could not with wisdom be change but in a country of such phenomenal growth as ours it be probably well that every dozen year or so the tariff law should be carefully scrutinize so as to see that no excessive or improper benefit be confer thereby that proper revenue be provide and that our foreign trade be encourage there must always be as a minimum a tariff which will not only allow for the collection of an ample revenue but which will at least make good the difference in cost of production here and abroad that is the difference in the labor cost here and abroad for the well being of the wage worker must ever be a cardinal point of american policy the question should be approach purely from a business standpoint both the time and the manner of the change be such as to arouse the minimum of agitation and disturbance in the business world and to give the least play for selfish and factional motive the sole consideration should be to see that the sum total of change represent the public good this mean that the subject can not with wisdom be deal with in the year precede a presidential election because as a matter of fact experience have conclusively show that at such a time it be impossible to get man to treat it from the standpoint of the public good in my judgment the wise time to deal with the matter be immediately after such election when our tax law be revise the question of an income tax and an inheritance tax should receive the careful attention of our legislator in my judgment both of these taxis should be part of our system of federal taxation i speak diffidently about the income tax because one scheme for an income tax be declare unconstitutional by the supreme court while in addition it be a difficult tax to administer in its practical working and great care would have to be exercise to see that it be not evade by the very man whom it be most desirable to have tax for if so evade it would of course be bad than no tax at all as the least desirable of all taxis be the tax which bear heavily upon the honest as compare with the dishonest man nevertheless a graduated income tax of the proper type would be a desirable feature of federal taxation and it be to be hope that one may be devise which the supreme court will declare constitutional the inheritance tax however be both a far well method of taxation and far more important for the purpose of have the fortune of the country bear in proportion to their increase in size a corresponding increase and burden of taxation the government have the absolute right to decide as to the term upon which a man shall receive a bequest or devise from another and this point in the devolution of property be especially appropriate for the imposition of a tax law impose such taxis have repeatedly be place upon the national statute book and as repeatedly declare constitutional by the court and these law contain the progressive principle that is after a certain amount be reach the bequest or gift in life or death be increasingly burden and the rate of taxation be increase in proportion to the remoteness of blood of the man receive the bequest these principle be recognize already in the lead civilized nation of the world in great britain all the estate worth $ 5,000 or less be practically exempt from death duty while the increase be such that when an estate exceed five million of dollar in value and pass to a distant kinsman or strange in blood the government receive all tell an amount equivalent to nearly a fifth of the whole estate in france so much of an inheritance as exceed $ 10,000,000 pay over a fifth to the state if it pass to a distant relative the german law be especially interesting to we because it make the inheritance tax an imperial measure while allot to the individual states of the empire a portion of the proceed and permit they to impose taxis in addition to those impose by the imperial government small inheritance be exempt but the tax be so sharply progressive that when the inheritance be still not very large provide it be not an agricultural or a forest land it be tax at the rate of 25 per cent if it go to distant relative there be no reason why in the united states the national government should not impose inheritance taxis in addition to those impose by the states and when we last have an inheritance tax about one half of the states levy such taxis concurrently with the national government make a combine maximum rate in some case as high as 25 per cent the french law have one feature which be to be heartily commend the progressive principle be so applied that each high rate be impose only on the excess above the amount subject to the next low rate so that each increase of rate will apply only to a certain amount above a certain maximum the tax should if possible be make to bear more heavily upon those reside without the country than within it a heavy progressive tax upon a very large fortune be in no way such a tax upon thrift or industry as a like would be on a small fortune no advantage come either to the country as a whole or to the individual inherit the money by permit the transmission in their entirety of the enormous fortune which would be affect by such a tax and as an incident to its function of revenue raising such a tax would help to preserve a measurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generation grow to manhood we have not the slight sympathy with that socialistic idea which would try to put laziness thriftlessness and inefficiency on a par with industry thrift and efficiency which would strive to break up not merely private property but what be far more important the home the chief prop upon which our whole civilization stand such a theory if ever adopt would mean the ruin of the entire country a ruin which would bear heavy upon the weak upon those least able to shift for themselves but proposal for legislation such as this herein advocate be directly oppose to this class of socialistic theory our aim be to recognize what lincoln point out the fact that there be some respect in which man be obviously not equal but also to insist that there should be an equality of self respect and of mutual respect an equality of right before the law and at least an approximate equality in the condition under which each man obtain the chance to show the stuff that be in he when compare to his fellow a few year ago there be loud complaint that the law could not be invoke against wealthy offender there be no such complaint now the course of the department of justice during the last few year have be such as to make it evident that no man stand above the law that no corporation be so wealthy that it can not be hold to account the department of justice have be as prompt to proceed against the wealthy malefactor whose crime be one of greed and cunning as to proceed against the agitator who incite to brutal violence everything that can be do under the exist law and with the exist state of public opinion which so profoundly influence both the court and jury have be do but the law themselves need strengthen in more than one important point they should be make more definite so that no honest man can be lead unwittingly to break they and so that the real wrongdoer can be readily punish moreover there must be the public opinion back of the law or the law themselves will be of no avail at present while the average juryman undoubtedly wish to see trust break up and be quite ready to fine the corporation itself he be very reluctant to find the fact prove beyond a reasonable doubt when it come to send to jail a member of the business community for indulge in practice which be profoundly unhealthy but which unfortunately the business community have grow to recognize as well nigh normal both the present condition of the law and the present temper of jury render it a task of extreme difficulty to get at the real wrongdoer in any such case especially by imprisonment yet it be from every standpoint far preferable to punish the prime offender by imprisonment rather than to fine the corporation with the attendant damage to stockholder the two great evil in the execution of our criminal law to day be sentimentality and technicality for the latter the remedy must come from the hand of the legislature the court and the lawyer the other must depend for its cure upon the gradual growth of a sound public opinion which shall insist that regard for the law and the demand of reason shall control all other influence and emotion in the jury box both of these evil must be remove or public discontent with the criminal law will continue instance of abuse in the granting of injunction in labor dispute continue to occur and the resentment in the mind of those who feel that their right be be invade and their liberty of action and of speech unwarrantably restrain continue likewise to grow much of the attack on the use of the process of injunction be wholly without warrant but i be constrain to express the belief that for some of it there be warrant this question be become more and more one of prime importance and unless the court will themselves deal with it in effective manner it be certain ultimately to demand some form of legislative action it would be most unfortunate for our social welfare if we should permit many honest and law abide citizen to feel that they have just cause for regard our court with hostility i earnestly commend to the attention of the congress this matter so that some way may be devise which will limit the abuse of injunction and protect those right which from time to time it unwarrantably invade moreover discontent be often express with the use of the process of injunction by the court not only in labor dispute but where state law be concern i refrain from discussion of this question as i be inform that it will soon receive the consideration of the supreme court the federal court must of course decide ultimately what be the respective sphere of state and nation in connection with any law state or national and they must decide definitely and finally in matter affect individual citizen not only as to the right and wrong of labor but as to the right and wrong of capital and the national government must always see that the decision of the court be put into effect the process of injunction be an essential adjunct of the court 's do its work well and as preventive measure be always well than remedial the wise use of this process be from every standpoint commendable but where it be recklessly or unnecessarily use the abuse should he censure above all by the very man who be properly anxious to prevent any effort to shear the court of this necessary power the court 's decision must be final the protest be only against the conduct of individual judge in needlessly anticipate such final decision or in the tyrannical use of what be nominally a temporary injunction to accomplish what be in fact a permanent decision the loss of life and limb from railroad accident in this country have become appalling it be a subject of which the national government should take supervision it might be well to begin by provide for a federal inspection of interstate railroad somewhat along the line of federal inspection of steamboat although not go so far perhaps at first all that it would be necessary to have would be some officer whose duty would be to investigate all accident on interstate railroad and report in detail the cause thereof such an officer should make it his business to get into close touch with railroad operate man so as to become thoroughly familiar with every side of the question the idea be to work along the line of the present steamboat inspection law the national government should be a model employer it should demand the high quality of service from each of its employee and it should care for all of they properly in return congress should adopt legislation provide limited but definite compensation for accident to all workman within the scope of the federal power include employee of navy yard and arsenal in other word a model employer liability act far reach and thoroughgoing should be enact which should apply to all position public and private over which the national government have jurisdiction the number of accident to wage worker include those that be preventable and those that be not have become appal in the mechanical manufacturing and transportation operation of the day it work grim hardship to the ordinary wage worker and his family to have the effect of such an accident fall solely upon he and on the other hand there be whole class of attorney who exist only by incite man who may or may not have be wrong to undertake suit for negligence as a matter of fact a suit for negligence be generally an inadequate remedy for the person injure while it often cause altogether disproportionate annoyance to the employer the law should be make such that the payment for accident by the employer would be automatic instead of be a matter for lawsuit workmen should receive certain and definite compensation for all accident in industry irrespective of negligence the employer be the agent of the public and on his own responsibility and for his own profit he serve the public when he start in motion agency which create risk for other he should take all the ordinary and extraordinary risk involve and the risk he thus at the moment assume will ultimately be assume as it ought to be by the general public only in this way can the shock of the accident be diffuse instead of fall upon the man or woman least able to bear it as be now the case the community at large should share the burden as well as the benefit of industry by the propose law employer would gain a desirable certainty of obligation and get rid of litigation to determine it while the workman and his family would be relieve from a crush load with such a policy would come increase care and accident would be reduce in number the national law provide for employer liability on railroad engage in interstate commerce and for safety appliance as well as for diminish the hour any employee of a railroad should be permit to work should all be strengthen wherever in actual practice they have show weakness they should be keep on the statute book in thoroughgoe form the constitutionality of the employer liability act pass by the precede congress have be carry before the court in two jurisdiction the law have be declare unconstitutional and in three jurisdiction its constitutionality have be affirm the question have be carry to the supreme court the case have be hear by that tribunal and a decision be expect at an early date in the event that the court should affirm the constitutionality of the act i urge further legislation along the line advocate in my message to the precede congress the practice of put the entire burden of loss to life or limb upon the victim or the victim 's family be a form of social injustice in which the united states stand in unenviable prominence in both our federal and state legislation we have with few exception scarcely go far than the repeal of the fellow servant principle of the old law of liability and in some of our states even this slight modification of a completely outgrown principle have not yet be secure the legislation of the rest of the industrial world stand out in strike contrast to our backwardness in this respect since 1895 practically every country of europe together with great britain new zealand australia british columbia and the cape of good hope have enact legislation embody in one form or another the complete recognition of the principle which place upon the employer the entire trade risk in the various line of industry i urge upon the congress the enactment of a law which will at the same time bring federal legislation up to the standard already establish by all the european country and which will serve as a stimulus to the various states to perfect their legislation in this regard the congress should consider the extension of the eight hour law the constitutionality of the present law have recently be call into question and the supreme court have decide that the exist legislation be unquestionably within the power of the congress the principle of the eight hour day should as rapidly and as far as practicable be extend to the entire work carry on by the government and the present law should be amend to embrace contract on those public work which the present wording of the act have be construe to exclude the general introduction of the eight hour day should be the goal toward which we should steadily tend and the government should set the example in this respect strike and lockout with their attendant loss and suffering continue to increase for the five year end december 31 1905 the number of strike be great than those in any previous ten year and be double the number in the precede five year these figure indicate the increase need of provide some machinery to deal with this class of disturbance in the interest alike of the employer the employee and the general public i renew my previous recommendation that the congress favorably consider the matter of create the machinery for compulsory investigation of such industrial controversy as be of sufficient magnitude and of sufficient concern to the people of the country as a whole to warrant the federal government in take action the need for some provision for such investigation be forcibly illustrate during the past summer a strike of telegraph operator seriously interfere with telegraphic communication cause great damage to business interest and serious inconvenience to the general public appeal be make to i from many part of the country from city council from board of trade from chamber of commerce and from labor organization urge that step be take to terminate the strike everything that could with any propriety be do by a representative of the government be do without avail and for week the public stand by and suffer without recourse of any kind have the machinery exist and have there be authority for compulsory investigation of the dispute the public would have be place in possession of the merit of the controversy and public opinion would probably have bring about a prompt adjustment each successive step create machinery for the adjustment of labor difficulty must be take with caution but we should endeavor to make progress in this direction the provision of the act of 1898 create the chairman of the interstate commerce commission and the commissioner of labor a board of mediation in controversy between interstate railroad and their employee have for the first time be subject to serious test within the past year and the wisdom of the experiment have be fully demonstrate the creation of a board for compulsory investigation in case where mediation fail and arbitration be reject be the next logical step in a progressive program it be certain that for some time to come there will be a constant increase absolutely and perhaps relatively of those among our citizen who dwell in city or town of some size and who work for wage this mean that there will be an ever increase need to consider the problem inseparable from a great industrial civilization where an immense and complex business especially in those branch relate to manufacture and transportation be transact by a large number of capitalist who employ a very much large number of wage earner the former tend more and more to combine into corporation and the latter into union the relation of the capitalist and wage worker to one another and of each to the general public be not always easy to adjust and to put they and keep they on a satisfactory basis be one of the most important and one of the most delicate task before our whole civilization much of the work for the accomplishment of this end must be do by the individual concern themselves whether singly or in combination and the one fundamental fact that must never be lose track of be that the character of the average man whether he be a man of mean or a man who work with his hand be the most important factor in solve the problem aright but it be almost equally important to remember that without good law it be also impossible to reach the proper solution it be idle to hold that without good law evil such as child labor as the over working of woman as the failure to protect employee from loss of life or limb can be effectively reach any more than the evil of rebate and stock watering can be reach without good law to fail to stop these practice by legislation mean to force honest man into they because otherwise the dishonest who surely will take advantage of they will have everything their own way if the states will correct these evil well and good but the nation must stand ready to aid they no question grow out of our rapid and complex industrial development be more important than that of the employment of woman and child the presence of woman in industry react with extreme directness upon the character of the home and upon family life and the condition surround the employment of child bear a vital relation to our future citizenship our legislation in those area under the control of the congress be very much behind the legislation of our more progressive state a thorough and comprehensive measure should be adopt at this session of the congress relate to the employment of woman and child in the district of columbia and the territories the investigation into the condition of woman and child wage earner recently authorize and direct by the congress be now be carry on in the various states and i recommend that the appropriation make last year for begin this work be renew in order that we may have the thorough and comprehensive investigation which the subject demand the national government have as an ultimate resort for control of child labor the use of the interstate commerce clause to prevent the product of child labor from enter into interstate commerce but before use this it ought certainly to enact model law on the subject for the territories under its own immediate control there be one fundamental proposition which can be lay down as regard all these matter namely while honesty by itself will not solve the problem yet the insistence upon honesty not merely technical honesty but honesty in purpose and spirit be an essential element in arrive at a right conclusion vice in its cruder and more archaic form shock everybody but there be very urgent need that public opinion should be just as severe in condemnation of the vice which hide itself behind class or professional loyalty or which deny that it be vice if it can escape conviction in the court the public and the representative of the public the high official whether on the bench or in executive or legislative position need to remember that often the most dangerous criminal so far as the life of the nation be concern be not those who commit the crime know to and condemn by the popular conscience for century but those who commit crime only render possible by the complex condition of our modern industrial life it make not a particle of difference whether these crime be commit by a capitalist or by a laborer by a lead banker or manufacturer or railroad man or by a lead representative of a labor union swindle in stock corrupt legislature make fortune by the inflation of security by wreck railroad by destroy competitor through rebate these form of wrongdoing in the capitalist be far more infamous than any ordinary form of embezzlement or forgery yet it be a matter of extreme difficulty to secure the punishment of the man most guilty of they most responsible for they the business man who condone such conduct stand on a level with the labor man who deliberately support a corrupt demagogue and agitator whether head of a union or head of some municipality because he be say to have stand by the union the member of the business community the educator or clergyman who condone and encourage the first kind of wrongdoing be no more dangerous to the community but be morally even bad than the labor man who be guilty of the second type of wrongdoing because less be to be pardon those who have no such excuse as be furnish either by ignorance or by dire need when the department of agriculture be found there be much sneer as to its usefulness no department of the government however have more emphatically vindicate its usefulness and none save the post office department come so continually and intimately into touch with the people the two citizen whose welfare be in the aggregate most vital to the welfare of the nation and therefore to the welfare of all other citizen be the wage worker who do manual labor and the tiller of the soil the farmer there be of course kind of labor where the work must be purely mental and there be other kind of labor where under existing condition very little demand indeed be make upon the mind though i be glad to say that the proportion of man engage in this kind of work be diminish but in any community with the solid healthy quality which make up a really great nation the bulk of the people should do work which call for the exercise of both body and mind progress can not permanently exist in the abandonment of physical labor but in the development of physical labor so that it shall represent more and more the work of the train mind in the train body our school system be gravely defective in so far as it put a premium upon mere literary training and tend therefore to train the boy away from the farm and the workshop nothing be more need than the good type of industrial school the school for mechanical industry in the city the school for practically teach agriculture in the country the calling of the skilled tiller of the soil the calling of the skilled mechanic should alike be recognize as profession just as emphatically as the calling of lawyer doctor merchant or clerk the school recognize this fact and it should equally be recognize in popular opinion the young man who have the farsightedness and courage to recognize it and to get over the idea that it make a difference whether what he earn be call salary or wage and who refuse to enter the crowded field of the so call profession and take to constructive industry instead be reasonably sure of an ample reward in earning in health in opportunity to marry early and to establish a home with a fair amount of freedom from worry it should be one of our prime object to put both the farmer and the mechanic on a high plane of efficiency and reward so as to increase their effectiveness in the economic world and therefore the dignity the remuneration and the power of their position in the social world no growth of city no growth of wealth can make up for any loss in either the number or the character of the farming population we of the united states should realize this above almost all other people we begin our existence as a nation of farmer and in every great crisis of the past a peculiar dependence have have to be place upon the farming population and this dependence have hitherto be justify but it can not be justify in the future if agriculture be permit to sink in the scale as compare with other employment we can not afford to lose that preeminently typical american the farmer who own his own medium sized farm to have his place take by either a class of small peasant proprietor or by a class of great landlord with tenant farm estate would be a veritable calamity the growth of our city be a good thing but only in so far as it do not mean a growth at the expense of the country farmer we must welcome the rise of physical science in their application to agricultural practice and we must do all we can to render country condition more easy and pleasant there be force which now tend to bring about both these result but they be as yet in their infancy the national government through the department of agriculture should do all it can by join with the state government and with independent association of farmer to encourage the growth in the open farming country of such institutional and social movement as will meet the demand of the good type of farmer both for the improvement of their farm and for the betterment of the life itself the department of agriculture have in many place perhaps especially in certain district of the south accomplish an extraordinary amount by cooperate with and teach the farmer through their association on their own soil how to increase their income by manage their farm well than they be hitherto manage the farmer must not lose his independence his initiative his rugged self reliance yet he must learn to work in the heartiest cooperation with his fellow exactly as the business man have learn to work and he must prepare to use to constantly well advantage the knowledge that can be obtain from agricultural college while he must insist upon a practical curriculum in the school in which his child be teach the department of agriculture and the department of commerce and labor both deal with the fundamental need of our people in the production of raw material and its manufacture and distribution and therefore with the welfare of those who produce it in the raw state and of those who manufacture and distribute it the department of commerce and labor have but recently be found but have already justify its existence while the department of agriculture yield to no other in the government in the practical benefit which it produce in proportion to the public money expend it must continue in the future to deal with grow crop as it have deal in the past but it must still far extend its field of usefulness hereafter by deal with live man through a far reach study and treatment of the problem of farm life alike from the industrial and economic and social standpoint farmer must cooperate with one another and with the government and the government can well give its aid through association of farmer so as to deliver to the farmer the large body of agricultural knowledge which have be accumulate by the national and state government and by the agricultural college and school the grain produce industry of the country one of the most important in the united states deserve special consideration at the hand of the congress our grain be sell almost exclusively by grade to secure satisfactory result in our home market and to facilitate our trade abroad these grade should approximate the high degree of uniformity and certainty the present diverse method of inspection and grade throughout the country under different law and board result in confusion and lack of uniformity destroy that confidence which be necessary for healthful trade complaint against the present method have continue for year and they be grow in volume and intensity not only in this country but abroad i therefore suggest to the congress the advisability of a national system of inspection and grading of grain enter into interstate and foreign commerce as a remedy for the present evil the conservation of our natural resource and their proper use constitute the fundamental problem which underlie almost every other problem of our national life we must maintain for our civilization the adequate material basis without which that civilization can not exist we must show foresight we must look ahead as a nation we not only enjoy a wonderful measure of present prosperity but if this prosperity be use aright it be an earnest of future success such as no other nation will have the reward of foresight for this nation be great and easily foretold but there must be the look ahead there must be a realization of the fact that to waste to destroy our natural resource to skin and exhaust the land instead of use it so as to increase its usefulness will result in undermine in the day of our child the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to they amplify and develop for the last few year through several agency the government have be endeavor to get our people to look ahead and to substitute a planned and orderly development of our resource in place of a haphazard strive for immediate profit our great river system should be develop as national water highway the mississippi with its tributary stand first in importance and the columbia second although there be many other of importance on the pacific the atlantic and the gulf slope the national government should undertake this work and i hope a beginning will be make in the present congress and the great of all our river the mississippi should receive especial attention from the great lakes to the mouth of the mississippi there should be a deep waterway with deep waterway lead from it to the east and the west such a waterway would practically mean the extension of our coast line into the very heart of our country it would be of incalculable benefit to our people if begin at once it can be carry through in time appreciably to relieve the congestion of our great freight carry line of railroad the work should be systematically and continuously carry forward in accordance with some well conceive plan the main stream should be improve to the high point of efficiency before the improvement of the branch be attempt and the work should be keep free from every faint of recklessness or jobbery the inland waterway which lie just back of the whole eastern and southern coast should likewise be develop moreover the development of our waterway involve many other important water problem all of which should be consider as part of the same general scheme the government dam should be use to produce hundred of thousand of horsepower as an incident to improve navigation for the annual value of the unused water power of the united states perhaps exceed the annual value of the product of all our mine as an incident to create the deep waterway down the mississippi the government should build along its whole low length levee which take together with the control of the headwater will at once and forever put a complete stop to all threat of flood in the immensely fertile delta region the territory lie adjacent to the mississippi along its low course will thereby become one of the most prosperous and populous as it already be one of the most fertile farming region in all the world i have appoint an inland waterways commission to study and outline a comprehensive scheme of development along all the line indicate later i shall lay its report before the congress irrigation should be far more extensively develop than at present not only in the states of the great plains and the rocky mountains but in many other as for instance in large portion of the south atlantic and gulf states where it should go hand in hand with the reclamation of swamp land the federal government should seriously devote itself to this task realize that utilization of waterway and water power forestry irrigation and the reclamation of land threaten with overflow be all interdependent part of the same problem the work of the reclamation service in develop the large opportunity of the western half of our country for irrigation be more important than almost any other movement the constant purpose of the government in connection with the reclamation service have be to use the water resource of the public land for the ultimate great good of the great number in other word to put upon the land permanent home maker to use and develop it for themselves and for their child and child 's child there have be of course opposition to this work opposition from some interested man who desire to exhaust the land for their own immediate profit without regard to the welfare of the next generation and opposition from honest and well mean man who do not fully understand the subject or who do not look far enough ahead this opposition be i think die away and our people be understand that it would be utterly wrong to allow a few individual to exhaust for their own temporary personal profit the resource which ought to be develop through use so as to be conserve for the permanent common advantage of the people as a whole the effort of the government to deal with the public land have be base upon the same principle as that of the reclamation service the land law system which be design to meet the need of the fertile and well water region of the middle west have largely break down when apply to the dryer region of the great plains the mountain and much of the pacific slope where a farm of 160 acre be inadequate for self support in these region the system lend itself to fraud and much land pass out of the hand of the government without pass into the hand of the home maker the department of the interior and the department of justice join in prosecute the offender against the law and they have accomplish much while where the administration of the law have be defective it have be change but the law themselves be defective three year ago a public land commission be appoint to scrutinize the law and defect and recommend a remedy their examination specifically show the existence of great fraud upon the public domain and their recommendation for change in the law be make with the design of conserve the natural resource of every part of the public land by put it to its good use especial attention be call to the prevention of settlement by the passage of great area of public land into the hand of a few man and to the enormous waste cause by unrestricted grazing upon the open range the recommendation of the public lands commission be sound for they be especially in the interest of the actual homemaker and where the small home maker can not at present utilize the land they provide that the government shall keep control of it so that it may not be monopolize by a few man the congress have not yet act upon these recommendation but they be so just and proper so essential to our national welfare that i feel confident if the congress will take time to consider they that they will ultimately be adopt some such legislation as that propose be essential in order to preserve the great stretch of public graze land which be unfit for cultivation under present method and be valuable only for the forage which they supply these stretch amount in all to some 300,000,000 acre and be open to the free grazing of cattle sheep horse and goat without restriction such a system or lack of system mean that the range be not so much use as waste by abuse as the west settle the range become more and more over graze much of it can not be use to advantage unless it be fence for fencing be the only way by which to keep in check the owner of nomad flock which roam hither and thither utterly destroy the pasture and leave a waste behind so that their presence be incompatible with the presence of home maker the exist fence be all illegal some of they represent the improper exclusion of actual settler actual home maker from territory which be usurped by great cattle company some of they represent what be in itself a proper effort to use the range for those upon the land and to prevent its use by nomadic outsider all these fence those that be hurtful and those that be beneficial be alike illegal and must come down but it be an outrage that the law should necessitate such action on the part of the administration the unlawful fencing of public land for private grazing must be stop but the necessity which occasion it must be provide for the federal government should have control of the range whether by permit or lease as local necessity may determine such control could secure the great benefit of legitimate fencing while at the same time secure and promote the settlement of the country in some place it may be that the tract of range adjacent to the homestead of actual settler should be allot to they severally or in common for the summer grazing of their stock elsewhere it may be that a lease system would serve the purpose the lease to be temporary and subject to the right of settlement and the amount charge be large enough merely to permit of the efficient and beneficial control of the range by the government and of the payment to the county of the equivalent of what it would otherwise receive in taxis the destruction of the public range will continue until some such law as these be enact fully to prevent the fraud in the public land which through the joint action of the interior department and the department of justice we have be endeavor to prevent there must be further legislation and especially a sufficient appropriation to permit the department of the interior to examine certain class of entry on the ground before they pass into private ownership the government should part with its title only to the actual home maker not to the profit maker who do not care to make a home our prime object be to secure the right and guard the interest of the small ranchman the man who plow and pitch hay for himself it be this small ranchman this actual settler and homemaker who in the long run be most hurt by permit theft of the public land in whatever form optimism be a good characteristic but if carry to an excess it become foolishness we be prone to speak of the resource of this country as inexhaustible this be not so the mineral wealth of the country the coal iron oil gas and the like do not reproduce itself and therefore be certain to be exhaust ultimately and wastefulness in deal with it to day mean that our descendant will feel the exhaustion a generation or two before they otherwise would but there be certain other form of waste which could be entirely stop the waste of soil by washing for instance which be among the most dangerous of all waste now in progress in the united states be easily preventable so that this present enormous loss of fertility be entirely unnecessary the preservation or replacement of the forest be one of the most important mean of prevent this loss we have make a beginning in forest preservation but it be only a beginning at present lumbering be the fourth great industry in the united states and yet so rapid have be the rate of exhaustion of timber in the united states in the past and so rapidly be the remainder be exhaust that the country be unquestionably on the verge of a timber famine which will be feel in every household in the land there have already be a rise in the price of lumber but there be certain to be a more rapid and heavy rise in the future the present annual consumption of lumber be certainly three time as great as the annual growth and if the consumption and growth continue unchanged practically all our lumber will be exhaust in another generation while long before the limit to complete exhaustion be reach the grow scarcity will make itself feel in many blight way upon our national welfare about 20 per cent of our forest territory be now reserve in national forest but these do not include the most valuable timber laud and in any event the proportion be too small to expect that the reserve can accomplish more than a mitigation of the trouble which be ahead for the nation far more drastic action be need forest can be lumber so as to give to the public the full use of their mercantile timber without the slight detriment to the forest any more than it be a detriment to a farm to furnish a harvest so that there be no parallel between forest and mine which can only be completely use by exhaustion but forest if use as all our forest have be use in the past and as most of they be still use will be either wholly destroy or so damaged that many decade have to pass before effective use can be make of they again all these fact be so obvious that it be extraordinary that it should be necessary to repeat they every business man in the land every writer in the newspaper every man or woman of an ordinary school education ought to be able to see that immense quantity of timber be use in the country that the forest which supply this timber be rapidly be exhaust and that if no change take place exhaustion will come comparatively soon and that the effect of it will be feel severely in the every day life of our people surely when these fact be so obvious there should be no delay in take preventive measure yet we seem as a nation to be willing to proceed in this matter with happy go lucky indifference even to the immediate future it be this attitude which permit the self interest of a very few person to weigh for more than the ultimate interest of all our people there be person who find it to their immense pecuniary benefit to destroy the forest by lumber they be to be blame for thus sacrifice the future of the nation as a whole to their own self interest of the moment but heavy blame attache to the people at large for permit such action whether in the white mountains in the southern alleghenies or in the rockies and sierras a big lumber company impatient for immediate return and not care to look far enough ahead will often deliberately destroy all the good timber in a region hope afterwards to move on to some new country the shiftless man of small mean who do not care to become an actual home maker but would like immediate profit will find it to his advantage to take up timber land simply to turn it over to such a big company and leave it valueless for future settler a big mine owner anxious only to develop his mine at the moment will care only to cut all the timber that he wish without regard to the future probably net look ahead to the condition of the country when the forest be exhaust any more than he do to the condition when the mine be work out i do not blame these man nearly as much as i blame the supine public opinion the indifferent public opinion which permit their action to go unchecked of course to check the waste of timber mean that there must be on the part of the public the acceptance of a temporary restriction in the lavish use of the timber in order to prevent the total loss of this use in the future there be plenty of man in public and private life who actually advocate the continuance of the present system of unchecked and wasteful extravagance use as an argument the fact that to check it will of course mean interference with the ease and comfort of certain people who now get lumber at less cost than they ought to pay at the expense of the future generation some of these person actually demand that the present forest reserve be throw open to destruction because forsooth they think that thereby the price of lumber could be put down again for two or three or more year their attitude be precisely like that of an agitator protest against the outlay of money by farmer on manure and in take care of their farm generally undoubtedly if the average farmer be content absolutely to ruin his farm he could for two or three year avoid spend any money on it and yet make a good deal of money out of it but only a savage would in his private affair show such reckless disregard of the future yet it be precisely this reckless disregard of the future which the opponent of the forestry system be now endeavor to get the people of the united states to show the only trouble with the movement for the preservation of our forest be that it have not go nearly far enough and be not begin soon enough it be a most fortunate thing however that we begin it when we do we should acquire in the appalachian and white mountain region all the forest land that it be possible to acquire for the use of the nation these land because they form a national asset be as emphatically national as the river which they feed and which flow through so many states before they reach the ocean there should be no tariff on any forest product grow in this country and in especial there should be no tariff on wood pulp due notice of the change be of course give to those engage in the business so as to enable they to adjust themselves to the new condition the repeal of the duty on wood pulp should if possible be accompany by an agreement with canada that there shall be no export duty on canadian pulp wood in the eastern united states the mineral fuel have already pass into the hand of large private owner and those of the west be rapidly follow it be obvious that these fuel should be conserve and not waste and it would be well to protect the people against unjust and extortionate price so far as that can still be do what have be accomplish in the great oil field of the indian territory by the action of the administration offer a striking example of the good result of such a policy in my judgment the government should have the right to keep the fee of the coal oil and gas field in its own possession and to lease the right to develop they under proper regulation or else if the congress will not adopt this method the coal deposit should be sell under limitation to conserve they as public utility the right to mine coal being separate from the title to the soil the regulation should permit coal land to be work in sufficient quantity by the several corporation the present limitation have be absurd excessive and serve no useful purpose and often render it necessary that there should be either fraud or close abandonment of the work of get out the coal work on the panama canal be proceed in a highly satisfactory manner in march last john f. stevens chairman of the commission and chief engineer resign and the commission be reorganize and

over the question of wage this trouble be settle satisfactorily to all party and in july the total excavation advance materially and in august the grand total from all point in the canal prism by steam shovel and dredge exceed all previous united states record reach 1,274,404 cubic yard in september this record be eclipse and a total of 1,517,412 cubic yard be remove of this amount 1,481,307 cubic yard be from the canal prism and 36,105 cubic yard be from accessory work these result be achieve in the rainy season with a rainfall in august of 11.89 inch and in september of 11.65 inch finally in october the record be again eclipse the total excavation be 1,868,729 cubic yard a truly extraordinary record especially in view of the heavy rainfall which be 17.1 inch in fact experience during the last two rainy season demonstrate that the rain be a less serious obstacle to progress than have hitherto be suppose work on the lock and dam at gatun which begin actively in march last have advance so far that it be think that masonry work on the lock can be begin within fifteen month in order to remove all doubt as to the satisfactory character of the foundation for the lock of the canal the secretary of war request three eminent civil engineer of special experience in such construction alfred noble frederic p. stearns and john r. freeman to visit the isthmus and make thorough personal investigation of the site these gentleman go to the isthmus in april and by mean of test pit which have be dig for the purpose they inspect the propose foundation and also examine the boring that have be make in their report to the secretary of war under date of may 2 1907 they say we find that all of the lock of the dimension now propese will rest upon rock of such character that it will furnish a safe and stable foundation subsequent new boring conduct by the present commission have fully confirm this verdict they show that the lock will rest on rock for their entire length the cross section of the dam and method of construction will be such as to insure against any slip or slough off similar examination of the foundation of the lock and dam on the pacific side be in progress i believe that the lock should be make of a width of 120 foot last winter bid be request and receive for do the work of canal construction by contract none of they be find to be satisfactory and all be reject it be the unanimous opinion of the present commission that the work can be do well more cheaply and more quickly by the government than by private contractor fully 80 per cent of the entire plant need for construction have be purchase or contract for machine shop have be erect and equip for make all need repair to the plant many thousand of employee have be secure an effective organization have be perfect a recruiting system be in operation which be capable of furnish more labor than can be use advantageously employee be well sheltered and well feed salary pay be satisfactory and the work be not only go forward smoothly but it be produce result far in advance of the most sanguine anticipation under these favorable condition a change in the method of prosecute the work would be unwise and unjustifiable for it would inevitably disorganize exist condition check progress and increase the cost and lengthen the time of complete the canal the chief engineer and all his professional associate be firmly convinced that the 85 foot level lock canal which they be construct be the good that could be desire some of they have doubt on this point when they go to the isthmus as the plan have develop under their direction their doubt have be dispel while they may decide upon change in detail as construction advance they be in hearty accord in approve the general plan they believe that it provide a canal not only adequate to all demand that will be make upon it but superior in every way to a sea level canal i concur in this belief i commend to the favorable consideration of the congress a postal saving bank system as recommend by the postmaster general the primary object be to encourage among our people economy and thrift and by the use of postal saving bank to give they an opportunity to husband their resource particularly those who have not the facility at hand for deposit their money in saving bank view however from the experience of the past few week it be evident that the advantage of such an institution be till more far reaching timid depositor have withdraw their saving for the time be from national bank trust company and saving bank individual have hoard their cash and the workingman their earning all of which money have be withhold and keep in hiding or in safe deposit box to the detriment of prosperity through the agency of the postal saving bank such money would be restore to the channel of trade to the mutual benefit of capital and labor i far commend to the congress the consideration of the postmaster general 's recommendation for an extension of the parcel post especially on the rural route there be now 38,215 rural route serve nearly 15,000,000 people who do not have the advantage of the inhabitant of city in obtain their supply these recommendation have be draw up to benefit the farmer and the country storekeeper otherwise i should not favor they for i believe that it be good policy for our government to do everything possible to aid the small town and the country district it be desirable that the country merchant should not be crush out the fourth class postmaster convention have pass a very strong resolution in favor of place the fourth class postmaster under the civil service law the administration have already put into effect the policy of refuse to remove any fourth class postmaster save for reason connect with the good of the service and it be endeavor so far as possible to remove they from the domain of partisan politic it would be a most desirable thing to put the fourth class postmaster in the classified service it be possible that this might be do without congressional action but as the matter be debatable i earnestly recommend that the congress enact a law provide that they be include under the civil service law and put in the classified service oklahoma have become a state stand on a full equality with her elder sister and her future be assure by her great natural resource the duty of the national government to guard the personal and property right of the indians within her border remain of course unchanged i reiterate my recommendation of last year as regard alaska some form of local self government should be provide as simple and inexpensive as possible it be impossible for the congress to devote the necessary time to all the little detail of necessary alaskan legislation road building and railway building should be encourage the governor of alaska should begiven an ample appropriation wherewith to organize a force to preserve the public peace whisky selling to the native should be make a felony the coal land law should be change so as to meet the peculiar need of the territory this should be attend to at once for the present law permit individual to locate large area of the public domain for speculative purpose and cause an immense amount of trouble fraud and litigation there should be another judicial division establish as early as possible lighthouse and buoy should be establish as aid to navigation especially in and about prince william sound and the survey of the coast complete there be need of liberal appropriation for lighting and buoy the southern coast and improve the aid to navigation in southeastern alaska one of the great industry of alaska as of puget sound and the columbia be salmon fishing gradually by reason of lack of proper law this industry be be ruin it should now be take in charge and effectively protect by the united states government the courage and enterprise of the citizen of the farnorth west in their project alaskan yukon pacific exposition to be hold in 1909 should receive liberal encouragement this exposition be not sentimental in its conception but seek to exploit the natural resource of alaska and to promote the commerce trade and industry of the pacific states with their neighboring states and with our insular possession and the neighboring country of the pacific the exposition ask no loan from the congress but seek appropriation for national exhibit and exhibit of the western dependency of the general government the state of washington and the city of seattle have show the characteristic western enterprise in large donation for the conduct of this exposition in which other state be lend generous assistance the unfortunate failure of the shipping bill at the last session of the last congress be follow by the taking off of certain pacific steamship which have greatly hamper the movement of passenger between hawaii and the mainland unless the congress be prepare by positive encouragement to secure proper facility in the way of shipping between hawaii and the mainland then the coastwise shipping law should be so far relax as to prevent hawaii suffering as it be now suffer i again call your attention to the capital importance from every standpoint of make pearl harbor available for the large deep water vessel and of suitably fortify the islanthe secretary of war have go to the philippines on his return i shall submit to you his report on the island i again recommend that the right of citizenship be confer upon the people of porto rico a bureau of mine should be create under the control and direction of the secretary of the interior the bureau to have power to collect statistic and make investigation in all matter pertain to mining and particularly to the accident and danger of the industry if this can not now be do at least additional appropriation should be give the interior department to be use for the study of mining condition for the prevention of fraudulent mining scheme for carry on the work of map the mining district for study method for minimize the accident and danger in the industry in short to aid in all proper way the development of the mining industry i strongly recommend to the congress to provide fund for keep up the hermitage the home of andrew jackson these fund to be use through the exist hermitage association for the preservation of a historic building which should ever be dear to americans i far recommend that a naval monument be establish in the vicksburg national park this national park give a unique opportunity for commemorate the deed of those gallant man who fight on water no less than of those who fight on land in the great civil war legislation should be enact at the present session of the congress for the thirteenth census the establishment of the permanent census bureau afford the opportunity for a well census than we have ever have but in order to realize the full advantage of the permanent organization ample time must be give for preparation there be a constantly grow interest in this country in the question of the public health at last the public mind be awake to the fact that many disease notably tuberculosis be national scourge the work of the state and city board of health should be supplement by a constantly increase interest on the part of the national government the congress have already provide a bureau of public health and have provide for a hygienic laboratory there be other valuable law relate to the public health connect with the various department this whole branch of the government should be strengthen and aid in every way i call attention to two government commission which i have appoint and which have already do excellent work the first of these have to do with the organization of the scientific work of the government which have grow up wholly without plan and be in consequence so unwisely distribute among the executive departments that much of its effect be lose for the lack of proper coordination this commission 's chief object be to introduce a planned and orderly development and operation in the place of the ill assorted and often ineffective grouping and method of work which have prevail this can not be do without legislation nor would it be feasible to deal in detail with so complex an administrative problem by specific provision of law i recommend that the president be give authority to concentrate related line of work and reduce duplication by executive order through transfer and consolidation of line of work the second committee that on department method be instruct to investigate and report upon the change need to place the conduct of the executive force of the government on the most economical and effective basis in the light of the good modern business practice the committee have make very satisfactory progress antiquated practice and bureaucratic way have be abolish and a general renovation of departmental method have be inaugurate all that can be do by executive order have already be accomplish or will be put into effect in the near future the work of the main committee and its several assistant committee have produce a wholesome awakening on the part of the great body of officer and employee engage in government work in nearly every department and office there have be a careful self inspection for the purpose of remedy any defect before they could be make the subject of adverse criticism this have lead individual to a wide study of the work on which they be engage and this study have result in increase their efficiency in their respective line of work there be recommendation of special importance from the committee on the subject of personnel and the classification of salary which will require legislative action before they can be put into effect it be my intention to submit to the congress in the near future a special message on those subject under our form of government voting be not merely a right but a duty and moreover a fundamental and necessary duty if a man be to be a good citizen it be well to provide that corporation shall not contribute to presidential or national campaign and furthermore to provide for the publication of both contribution and expenditure there be however always danger in law of this kind which from their very nature be difficult of enforcement the danger be lest they be obey only by the honest and disobey by the unscrupulous so as to act only as a penalty upon honest man moreover no such law would hamper an unscrupulous man of unlimited mean from buy his own way into office there be a very radical measure which would i believe work a substantial improvement in our system of conduct a campaign although i be well aware that it will take some time for people so to familiarize themselves with such a proposal as to be willing to consider its adoption the need for collect large campaign fund would vanish if congress provide an appropriation for the proper and legitimate expense of each of the great national party an appropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thorough organization and machinery which require a large expenditure of money then the stipulation should be make that no party receive campaign fund from the treasury should accept more than a fix amount from any individual subscriber or donor and the necessary publicity for receipt and expenditure could without difficulty be provide there should be a national gallery of art establish in the capital city of this country this be important not merely to the artistic but to the material welfare of the country and the people be to be congratulate on the fact that the movement to establish such a gallery be take definite form under the guidance of the smithsonian institution so far from there be a tariff on work of art bring into the country their importation should be encourage in every way there have be no sufficient collection of object of art by the government and what collection have be acquire be scatter and be generally place in unsuitable and imperfectly light gallery the biological survey be quietly work for the good of our agricultural interest and be an excellent example of a government bureau which conduct original scientific research the finding of which be of much practical utility for more than twenty year it have study the food habit of bird and mammal that be injurious or beneficial to agriculture horticulture and forestry have distribute illustrate bulletin on the subject and have labor to secure legislative protection for the beneficial specie the cotton boll weevil which have recently overspread the cotton belt of texas and be steadily extend its range be say to cause an annual loss of about $ 3,000,000 the biological survey have ascertain and give wide publicity to the fact that at least 43 kind of bird prey upon this destructive insect it have discover that 57 specie of bird feed upon scale insect dread enemy of the fruit grower it have show that woodpecker as a class by destroy the larvae of wood bore insect be so essential to tree life that it be doubtful if our forest could exist without they it have show that cuckoo and oriole be the natural enemy of the leaf eat caterpillar that destroy our shade and fruit tree that our quail and sparrow consume annually hundred of ton of seed of noxious weed that hawk and owl as a class except the few that kill poultry and game bird be markedly beneficial spend their life in catch grasshopper mouse and other pest that prey upon the product of husbandry it have conduct field experiment for the purpose of devise and perfect simple method for hold in check the horde of destructive rodent rat mouse rabbit gopher prairie dog and ground squirrel which annually destroy crop worth many million of dollar and it have publish practical direction for the destruction of wolf and coyote on the stock range of the west result during the past year in an estimate saving of cattle and sheep value at upwards of a million dollar it have inaugurate a system of inspection at the principal port of entry on both atlantic and pacific coast by mean of which the introduction of noxious mammal and bird be prevent thus keep out the mongoose and certain bird which be as much to be dread as the previously introduce english sparrow and the house rat and mouse in the interest of game protection it have cooperate with local official in every state in the union have strive to promote uniform legislation in the several states have render important service in enforce the federal law regulate interstate traffic in game and have show bow game protection may be make to yield a large revenue to the state a revenue amounting in the case of illinois to $ 128,000 in a single year the biological survey have explore the fauna and flora of america with reference to the distribution of animal and plant it have define and map the natural life area area in which by reason of prevail climatic condition certain kind of animal and plant occur and have point out the adaptability of these area to the cultivation of particular crop the result of these investigation be not only of high educational value but be worth each year to the progressive farmer of the country many time the cost of maintain the survey which it may be add be exceedingly small i recommend to congress that this bureau whose usefulness be seriously handicap by lack of fund be grant an appropriation in some degree commensurate with the importance of the work it be do i call your especial attention to the unsatisfactory condition of our foreign mail service which because of the lack of american steamship line be now largely do through foreign line and which particularly so far as south and central america be concern be do in a manner which constitute a serious barrier to the extension of our commerce the time have come in my judgment to set to work seriously to make our ocean mail service correspond more closely with our recent commercial and political development a beginning be make by the ocean mail act of march 3 1891 but even at that time the act be know to be inadequate in various particular since that time event have move rapidly in our history we have acquire hawaii the philippines and less island in the pacific we be steadily prosecute the great work of unite at the isthmus the water of the atlantic and the pacific to a great extent than seem probable even a dozen year ago we may look to an american future on the sea worthy of the tradition of our past as the first step in that direction and the step most feasible at the present time i recommend the extension of the ocean mail act of 1891 this act have stand for some year free from successful criticism of its principle and purpose it be base on theory of the obligation of a great maritime nation undisputed in our own land and follow by other nation since the beginning of steam navigation briefly those theory be that it be the duty of a first class power so far as practicable to carry its ocean mail under its own flag;that the fast ocean steamship and their crew require for such mail service be valuable auxiliary to the sea power of a nation furthermore the construction of such steamship insure the maintenance in an efficient condition of the shipyard in which our battleship must be build the expenditure of public money for the performance of such necessary function of government be certainly warrant nor be it necessary to dwell upon the incidental benefit to our foreign commerce to the shipbuilding industry and to ship owning and navigation which will accompany the discharge of these urgent public duty though they too should have weight the only serious question be whether at this time we can afford to improve our ocean mail service as it should be improve all doubt on this subject be remove by the report of the post office department for the fiscal year end june 30 1907 that department estimate that the postage collect on the article exchange with foreign country other than canada and mexico amount to $ 6,579,043.48 or $ 3,637,226.81 more than the net cost of the service exclusive of the cost of transport the article between the united states exchange post office and the united states post office at which they be mail or deliver in other word the government of the united states having assume a monopoly of carry the mail for the people make a profit of over $ 3,600,000 by render a cheap and inefficient service that profit i believe should be devoted to strengthen maritime power in those direction where it will well promote our prestige the country be familiar with the fact of our maritime impotence in the harbor of the great and friendly republics of south america follow the failure of the shipbuilding bill we lose our only american line of steamer to australasia and that loss on the pacific have become a serious embarrassment to the people of hawaii and have wholly cut off the samoan island from regular communication with the pacific coast puget sound in the year have lose over half four out of seven of its american steamer trade with the orient we now pay under the act of 1891 $ 4 a statute mile outward to 20 knot american mail steamship build accord to naval plan available as cruiser and man by americans steamship of that speed be confine exclusively to trans atlantic trade with new york to steamship of 16 knot or over only $ 2 a mile can be pay and it be steamship of this speed and type which be need to meet the requirement of mail service to south america asia include the philippines and australia i strongly recommend therefore a simple amendment to the ocean mail act of 1891 which shall authorize the postmaster general in his discretion to enter into contract for the transportation of mail to the republics of south america to asia the philippines and australia at a rate not to exceed $ 4 a mile for steamship of 16 knot speed or upwards subject to the restriction and obligation of the act of 1891 the profit of $ 3,600,000 which have be mention will fully cover the maximum annual expenditure involve in this recommendation and it be believe will in time establish the line so urgently need the proposition involve no new principle but permit the efficient discharge of public function now inadequately perform or not perform at all not only there be not now but there never have be any other nation in the world so wholly free from the evil of militarism as be ours there never have be any other large nation not even china which for so long a period have have relatively to its number so small a regular army as have ours never at any time in our history have this nation suffer from militarism or be in the remotest danger of suffer from militarism never at any time of our history have the regular army be of a size which cause the slight appreciable tax upon the tax pay citizen of the nation almost always it have be too small in size and underpaid never in our entire history have the nation suffer in the least particular because too much care have be give to the army too much prominence give it too much money spend upon it or because it have be too large but again and again we have suffer because enough care have not be give to it because it have be too small because there have not be sufficient preparation in advance for possible war every foreign war in which we have engage have cost we many time the amount which if wisely expend during the precede year of peace on the regular army would have insure the war end in but a fraction of the time and but for a fraction of the cost that be actually the case as a nation we have always be shortsighte in provide for the efficiency of the army in time of peace it be nobody 's especial interest to make such provision and no one look ahead to war at any period no matter how remote as be a serious possibility while an improper economy or rather niggardliness can be practice at the expense of the army with the certainty that those practice it will not be call to account therefor but that the price will be pay by the unfortunate person who happen to be in office when a war do actually come i think it be only lack of foresight that trouble we not any hostility to the army there be of course foolish people who denounce any care of the army or navy as militarism but i do not think that these people be numerous this country have to contend now and have have to contend in the past with many evil and there be ample scope for all who would work for reform but there be not one evil that now exist or that ever have exist in this country which be or ever have be owe in the small part to militarism declamation against militarism have no more serious place in an earnest and intelligent movement for righteousness in this country than declamation against the worship of baal or astaroth it be declamation against a non existent evil one which never have exist in this country and which have not the slight chance of appear here we be glad to help in any movement for international peace but this be because we sincerely believe that it be our duty to help all such movement provide they be sane and rational and not because there be any tendency toward militarism on our part which need to be cure the evil we have to fight be those in connection with industrialism not militarism industry be always necessary just as war be sometimes necessary each have its price and industry in the united states now exact and have always exact a far heavy toll of death than all our war put together the statistic of the railroad of this country for the year end june 30 1906 the last contain in the annual statistical report of the interstate commerce commission show in that one year a total of 108,324 casualty to person of which 10,618 represent the number of person kill in that wonderful hive of human activity pittsburg the death due to industrial accident in 1906 be 919 all the result of accident in mill mine or on railroad for the entire country therefore it be safe to say that the death due to industrial accident aggregate in the neighborhood of twenty thousand a year such a record make the death rate in all our foreign war utterly trivial by comparison the number of death in battle in all the foreign war put together for the last century and a quarter aggregate considerably less than one year 's death record for our industry a mere glance at these figure be sufficient to show the absurdity of the outcry against militarism but again and again in the past our little regular army have render service literally vital to the country and it may at any time have to do so in the future its standard of efficiency and instruction be high now than ever in the past but it be too small there be not enough officer and it be impossible to secure enough enlisted man we should maintain in peace a fairly complete skeleton of a large army a great and long continue war would have to be fight by volunteer but month would pass before any large body of efficient volunteer could be put in the field and our regular army should be large enough to meet any immediate need in particular it be essential that we should possess a number of extra officer train in peace to perform efficiently the duty urgently require upon the breaking out of war the medical corps should be much large than the need of our regular army in war yet at present it be small than the need of the service demand even in peace the spanish war occur less than ten year ago the chief loss we suffer in it be by disease among the regiment which never leave the country at the moment the nation seem deeply impressed by this fact yet seemingly it have already be forget for not the slight effort have be make to prepare a medical corps of sufficient size to prevent the repetition of the same disaster on a much large scale if we should ever be engage in a serious conflict the trouble in the spanish war be not with the then exist official of the war department it be with the representative of the people as a whole who for the precede thirty year have decline to make the necessary provision for the army unless ample provision be now make by congress to put the medical corps where it should be put disaster in the next war be inevitable and the responsibility will not lie with those then in charge of the war department but with those who now decline to make the necessary provision a well organize medical corps thoroughly train before the advent of war in all the important administrative duty of a military sanitary corps be essential to the efficiency of any large army and especially of a large volunteer army such knowledge of medicine and surgery as be possess by the medical profession generally will not alone suffice to make an efficient military surgeon he must have in addition knowledge of the administration and sanitation of large field hospital and camp in order to safeguard the health and life of man intrust in great number to his care a bill have long be pende before the congress for the reorganization of the medical corps its passage be urgently need but the medical department be not the only department for which increase provision should be make the rate of pay for the officer should be greatly increase there be no high type of citizen than the american regular officer and he should have a fair reward for his admirable work there should be a relatively even great increase in the pay for the enlisted man in especial provision should be make for establish grade equivalent to those of warrant officer in the navy which should be open to the enlisted man who serve sufficiently long and who do their work well inducement should be offer sufficient to encourage really good man to make the army a life occupation the prime need of our present army be to secure and retain competent noncommissioned officer this difficulty rest fundamentally on the question of pay the noncommissioned officer do not correspond with an unskilled laborer he correspond to the good type of skilled workman or to the subordinate official in civil institution wage have greatly increase in outside occupation in the last forty year and the pay of the soldier like the pay of the officer should be proportionately increase the first sergeant of a company if a good man must be one of such executive and administrative ability and such knowledge of his trade as to be worth far more than we at present pay he the same be true of the regimental sergeant major these man should be man who have fully resolve to make the army a life occupation and they should be able to look forward to ample reward while only man properly qualified should be give a chance to secure these final reward the increase over the present pay need not be great in the low grade for the first one or two enlistment but the increase should be mark for the noncommissioned officer of the upper grade who serve long enough to make it evident that they intend to stay permanently in the army while additional pay should be give for high qualification in target practice the position of warrant officer should be establish and there should be not only an increase of pay but an increase of privilege and allowance and dignity so as to make the grade open to noncommissioned officer capable of fill they desirably from every standpoint the rate of desertion in our army now in time of peace be alarming the deserter should be treat by public opinion as a man guilty of the great crime while on the other hand the man who serve steadily in the army should be treat as what he be that is as preeminently one of the good citizen of this republic after twelve year service in the army my own belief be that the man should be give a preference accord to his ability for certain type of office over all civilian applicant without examination this should also apply of course to the man who have serve twelve year in the navy a special corps should be provide to do the manual labor now necessarily demand of the private themselves among the officer there should be severe examination to weed out the unfit up to the grade of major from that position on appointment should be solely by selection and it should be understand that a man of merely average capacity could never get beyond the position of major while every man who serve in any grade a certain length of time prior to promotion to the next grade without get the promotion to the next grade should be forthwith retire the practice marche and field maneuver of the last two or three year have be invaluable to the army they should be continue and extend a rigid and not a perfunctory examination of physical capacity have be provide for the high grade officer this will work well unless an officer have a good physique unless he can stand hardship ride well and walk fairly he be not fit for any position even after he have become a colonel before he have become a colonel the need for physical fitness in the officer be almost as great as in the enlisted man i hope speedily to see introduce into the army a far more rigid and thoroughgoing test of horsemanship for all field officer than at present there should be a chief of cavalry just as there be a chief of artillery perhaps the most important of all legislation need for the benefit of the army be a law to equalize and increase the pay of officer and enlisted man of the army navy marine corps and revenue cutter service such a bill have be prepare which it be hope will meet with your favorable consideration the next most essential measure be to authorize a number of extra officer as mention above to make the army more attractive to enlisted man it be absolutely essential to create a service corps such as exist in nearly every modern army in the world to do the skilled and unskilled labor inseparably connect with military administration which be now exact without just compensation of enlisted man who voluntarily enter the army to do service of an altogether different kind there be a number of other law necessary to so organize the army as to promote its efficiency and facilitate its rapid expansion in time of war but the above be the most important it be hope the hague conference might deal with the question of the limitation of armament but even before it have assemble informal inquiry have develop that as regard naval armament the only one in which this country have any interest it be hopeless to try to devise any plan for which there be the slight possibility of secure the assent of the nation gather at the hague no plan be even propose which would have have the assent of more than one first class power outside of the united states the only plan that seem at all feasible that of limit the size of battleship meet with no favor at all it be evident therefore that it be folly for this nation to base any hope of secure peace on any international agreement as to the limitation of armament such be the fact it would be most unwise for we to stop the upbuilding of our navy to build one battleship of the good and most advanced type a year would barely keep our fleet up to its present force this be not enough in my judgment we should this year provide for four battleship but it be idle to build battleship unless in addition to provide the man and the mean for thorough training we provide the auxiliary for they unless we provide dock the coaling station the collier and supply ship that they need we be extremely deficient in coal station and dock on the pacific and this deficiency should not long be permit to exist plenty of torpedo boat and destroyer should be build both on the atlantic and pacific coast fortification of the good type should be provide for all our great harbor we need always to remember that in time of war the navy be not to be use to defend harbor and sea coast city we should perfect our system of coast fortification the only efficient use for the navy be for offense the only way in which it can efficiently protect our own coast against the possible action of a foreign navy be by destroy that foreign navy for defense against a hostile fleet which actually attack they the coast city must depend upon their fort mine torpedo submarine and torpedo boat and destroyer all of these together be efficient for defensive purpose but they in no way supply the place of a thoroughly efficient navy capable of act on the offensive for parry never yet win a fight it can only be win by hard hitting and an aggressive sea go navy alone can do this hard hitting of the offensive type but the fort and the like be necessary so that the navy may be footloose in time of war there be sure to be demand under pressure of fright for the ship to be scatter so as to defend all kind of port under penalty of terrible disaster this demand must be refuse the ship must be keep together and their objective make the enemy fleet if fortification be sufficiently strong no modern navy will venture to attack they so long as the foe have in existence a hostile navy of anything like the same size or efficiency but unless there exist such a navy then the fortification be powerless by themselves to secure the victory for of course the mere deficiency mean that any resolute enemy can at his leisure combine all his force upon one point with the certainty that he can take it until our battle fleet be much large than at present it should never be split into detachment so far apart that they could not in event of emergency be speedily united our coast line be on the pacific just as much as on the atlantic the interest of california oregon and washington be as emphatically the interest of the whole union as those of maine and new york of louisiana and texas the battle fleet should now and then be move to the pacific just as at other time it should be keep in the atlantic when the isthmian canal be build the transit of the battle fleet from one ocean to the other will be comparatively easy until it be build i earnestly hope that the battle fleet will be thus shift between the two ocean every year or two the marksmanship on all our ship have improve phenomenally during the last five year until within the last two or three year it be not possible to train a battle fleet in squadron maneuver under service condition and it be only during these last two or three year that the training under these condition have become really effective another and most necessary stride in advance be now be take the battle fleet be about start by the straits of magellan to visit the pacific coast sixteen battleship be go under the command of rear admiral evans while eight armored cruiser and two other battleship will meet he at san francisco whither certain torpedo destroyer be also go no fleet of such size have ever make such a voyage and it will be of very great educational use to all engage in it the only way by which to teach officer and man how to handle the fleet so as to meet every possible strain and emergency in time of war be to have they practice under similar condition in time of peace moreover the only way to find out our actual need be to perform in time of peace whatever maneuver might be necessary in time of war after war be declare it be too late to find out the need that mean to invite disaster this trip to the pacific will show what some of our need be and will enable we to provide for they the proper place for an officer to learn his duty be at sea and the only way in which a navy can ever be make efficient be by practice at sea under all the condition which would have to be meet if war exist i bespeak the most liberal treatment for the officer and enlisted man of the navy it be true of they as likewise of the officer and enlisted man of the army that they form a body whose interest should be close to the heart of every good american in return the most rigid performance of duty should be exact from they the reward should be ample when they do their good and nothing less than their good should be tolerate it be idle to hope for the good result when the man in the senior grade come to those grade late in life and serve too short a time in they up to the rank of lieutenant commander promotion in the navy should be as now by seniority subject however to such rigid test as would eliminate the unfit after the grade of lieutenant commander that is when we come to the grade of command rank the unfit should be eliminate in such manner that only the conspicuously fit would remain and sea service should be a principal test of fitness those who be pass by should after a certain length of service in their respective grade be retire of a give number of man it may well be that almost all would make good lieutenant and most of they good lieutenant commander while only a minority be fit to be captain and but three or four to be admiral those who object to promotion otherwise than by mere seniority should reflect upon the elementary fact that no business in private life could be successfully manage if those who enter at the low rung of the ladder should each in turn if he live become the head of the firm its active director and retire after he have hold the position a few month on its face such a scheme be an absurdity chance for improper favoritism can be minimize by a properly form board such as the board of last june which do such conscientious and excellent work in elimination if all that ought to be do can not now be do at least let a beginning be make in my last three annual message and in a special message to the last congress the necessity for legislation that will cause officer of the line of the navy to reach the grade of captain and rear admiral at less advanced age and which will cause they to have more sea training and experience in the highly responsible duty of those grade so that they may become thoroughly skillful in handle battleship division squadron and fleet in action have be fully explain and urgently recommend upon this subject the secretary of the navy have submit detailed and definite recommendation which have receive my approval and which if enact into law will accomplish what be immediately necessary and will as compare with exist law make a saving of more than five million of dollar during the next seven year the navy personnel act of 1899 have accomplish all that be expect of it in provide satisfactory period of service in the several subordinate grade from the grade of ensign to the grade of lieutenant commander but the law be inadequate in the upper grade and will continue to be inadequate on account of the expansion of the personnel since its enactment your attention be invite to the following quotation from the report of the personnel board of 1906 of which the assistant secretary of the navy be president:"congress have authorize a considerable increase in the number of midshipman at the naval academy and these midshipman upon graduation be promote to ensign and lieutenant junior grade but no provision have be make for a corresponding increase in the upper grade the result be that the low grade will become so congested that a midshipman now in one of the low class at annapolis may possibly not be promote to lieutenant until he be between 45 and 50 year of age so it will continue under the present law congest at the top and congest at the bottom the country fail to get from the officer of the service the good that be in they by not provide opportunity for their normal development and training the board believe that this work a serious detriment to the efficiency of the navy and be a real menace to the public safety "as state in my special message to the last congress i be firmly of the opinion that unless the present condition of the high commission personnel be rectify by judicious legislation the future of our navy will be gravely compromise it be also urgently necessary to increase the efficiency of the medical corps of the navy special legislation to this end have already be propose and i trust it may be enact without delay it must be remember that everything do in the navy to fit it to do well in time of war must be do in time of peace modern war be short they do not last the length of time requisite to build a battleship and it take long to train the officer and man to do well on a battleship than it take to build it nothing effective can be do for the navy once war have begin and the result of the war if the combatant be otherwise equally match will depend upon which power have prepare well in time of peace the united states navy be the good guaranty the nation have that its honor and interest will not be neglect and in addition it offer by far the good insurance for peace that can by human ingenuity be devise i call attention to the report of the official board of visitors to the naval academy at annapolis which have be forward to the congress the report contain this paragraph:"such revision should be make of the course of study and method of conduct and mark examination as will develop and bring out the average all round ability of the midshipman rather than to give he prominence in any one particular study the fact should be keep in mind that the naval academy be not a university but a school the primary object of which be to educate boy to be efficient naval officer change in curriculum therefore should be in the direction of make the course of instruction less theoretical and more practical no portion of any future class should be graduate in advance of the full four year course and under no circumstance should the standard of instruction be lower the academy in almost all of its department be now magnificently equip and it would be very unwise to make the course of instruction less exact than it be to day "acte upon this suggestion i designate three seagoe officer capt richard wainwright commander robert s. griffin and lieut commander albert l. key all graduate of the academy to investigate condition and to recommend to i the good method of carry into effect this general recommendation these officer perform the duty promptly and intelligently and under the personal direction of capt charles j. badger superintendent of the academy such of the propose change as be deem to be at present advisable be put into effect at the beginning of the academic year october 1 last the result i be confident will be most beneficial to the academy to the midshipman and to the navy in foreign affair this country 's steady policy be to behave toward other nation as a strong and self respect man should behave toward the other man with whom he be bring into contact in other word our aim be disinterestedly to help other nation where such help can be wisely give without the appearance of meddle with what do not concern we to be careful to act as a good neighbor and at the same time in good natured fashion to make it evident that we do not intend to be impose upon the second international peace conference be convene at the hague on the 15th of june last and remain in session until the 18th of october for the first time the representative of practically all the civilized country of the world unite in a temperate and kindly discussion of the method by which the cause of war might be narrow and its injurious effect reduce although the agreement reach in the conference do not in any direction go to the length hope for by the more sanguine yet in many direction important step be take and upon every subject on the programme there be such full and considerate discussion as to justify the belief that substantial progress have be make toward further agreement in the future thirteen convention be agree upon embody the definite conclusion which have be reach and resolution be adopt mark the progress make in matter upon which agreement be not yet sufficiently complete to make convention practicable the delegate of the united states be instruct to favor an agreement for obligatory arbitration the establishment of a permanent court of arbitration to proceed judicially in the hearing and decision of international cause the prohibition of force for the collection of contract debt allege to be due from government to citizen of other country until after arbitration as to the justice and amount of the debt and the time and manner of payment the immunity of private property at sea the well definition of the right of neutral and in case any measure to that end should be introduce the limitation of armament in the field of peaceful disposal of international difference several important advance be make first as to obligatory arbitration although the conference fail to secure a unanimous agreement upon the detail of a convention for obligatory arbitration it do resolve as follows;"it be unanimous 1 in accept the principle for obligatory arbitration 2 in declare that certain difference and notably those relate to the interpretation and application of international conventional stipulation be susceptible of be submit to obligatory arbitration without any restriction "in view of the fact that as a result of the discussion the vote upon the definite treaty of obligatory arbitration which be propose stand 32 in favor to 9 against the adoption of the treaty there can be little doubt that the great majority of the country of the world have reach a point where they be now ready to apply practically the principle thus unanimously agree upon by the conference the second advance and a very great one be the agreement which relate to the use of force for the collection of contract debt your attention be invite to the paragraph upon this subject in my message of december 1906 and to the resolution of the third american conference at rio in the summer of 1906 the convention upon this subject adopt by the conference substantially as propose by the american delegate be as follows::"in order to avoid between nation armed conflict of a purely pecuniary origin arise from contractual debt claim of the government of one country by the government of another country to be due to its national the signatory powers agree not to have recourse to armed force for the collection of such contractual debt "however this stipulation shall not be applicable when the debtor state refuse or leave unanswere an offer to arbitrate or in case of acceptance make it impossible to formulate the term of submission or after arbitration fail to comply with the award render "it be far agree that arbitration here contemplate shall be in conformity as to procedure with chapter iii of the convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes adopt at the hague and that it shall determine in so far as there shall be no agreement between the party the justice and the amount of the debt the time and mode of payment thereof "such a provision would have prevent much injustice and extortion in the past and i can not doubt that its effect in the future will be most salutary a third advance have be make in amend and perfect the convention of 1899 for the voluntary settlement of international dispute and particularly the extension of those part of that convention which relate to commission of inquiry the existence of those provision enable the government of great britain and russia to avoid war notwithstanding great public excitement at the time of the dogger bank incident and the new convention agree upon by the conference give practical effect to the experience gain in that inquiry substantial progress be also make towards the creation of a permanent judicial tribunal for the determination of international cause there be very full discussion of the proposal for such a court and a general agreement be finally reach in favor of its creation the conference recommend to the signatory powers the adoption of a draft upon which it agree for the organization of the court leave to be determine only the method by which the judge should be select this remain unsettled question be plainly one which time and good temper will solve a further agreement of the first importance be that for the creation of an international prize court the constitution organization and procedure of such a tribunal be provide for in detail anyone who recall the injustice under which this country suffer as a neutral power during the early part of the last century can not fail to see in this provision for an international prize court the great advance which the world be make towards the substitution of the rule of reason and justice in place of simple force not only will the international prize court be the mean of protect the interest of neutral but it be in itself a step towards the creation of the more general court for the hearing of international controversy to which reference have just be make the organization and action of such a prize court can not fail to accustom the different country to the submission of international question to the decision of an international tribunal and we may confidently expect the result of such submission to bring about a general agreement upon the enlargement of the practice numerous provision be adopt for reduce the evil effect of war and for define the right and duty of neutral the conference also provide for the holding of a third conference within a period similar to that which elapse between the first and second conferences the delegate of the united states worthily represent the spirit of the american people and maintain with fidelity and ability the policy of our government upon all the great question discuss in the conference the report of the delegation together with authenticated copy of the convention sign when receive will be lay before the senate for its consideration when we remember how difficult it be for one of our own legislative body compose of citizen of the same country speak the same language live under the same law and have the same custom to reach an agreement or even to secure a majority upon any difficult and important subject which be propose for legislation it become plain that the representative of forty five different country speak many different language accustom to different method of procedure with widely diverse interest who discuss so many different subject and reach agreement upon so many be entitle to grateful appreciation for the wisdom patience and moderation with which they have discharge their duty the example of this temperate discussion and the agreement and the effort to agree among representative of all the nation of the earth act with universal recognition of the supreme obligation to promote peace can not fail to be a powerful influence for good in future international relation a year ago in consequence of a revolutionary movement in cuba which threaten the immediate return to chaos of the island the united states intervene send down an army and establish a provisional government under governor magoon absolute quiet and prosperity have return to the island because of this action we be now take step to provide for election in the island and our expectation be within the come year to be able to turn the island over again to government choose by the people thereof cuba be at our door it be not possible that this nation should permit cuba again to sink into the condition from which we rescue it all that we ask of the cuban people be that they be prosperous that they govern themselves so as to bring content order and progress to their island the queen of the antilles and our only interference have be and will be to help they achieve these result an invitation have be extend by japan to the government and people of the united states to participate in a great national exposition to be hold at tokyo from april 1 to october 31 1912 and in which the principal country of the world be to be invite to take part this be an occasion of special interest to all the nation of the world and peculiarly so to we for it be the first instance in which such a great national exposition have be hold by a great power dwelling on the pacific and all the nation of europe and america will i trust join in help to success this first great exposition ever hold by a great nation of asia the geographical relation of japan and the united states as the possessor of such large portion of the coast of the pacific the intimate trade relation already exist between the two country the warm friendship which have be maintain between they without break since the opening of japan to intercourse with the western nation and her increase wealth and production which we regard with hearty goodwill and wish to make the occasion of mutually beneficial commerce all unite in make it eminently desirable that this invitation should be accept i heartily recommend such legislation as will provide in generous fashion for the representation of this government and its people in the propose exposition action should be take now we be apt to underestimate the time necessary for preparation in such case the invitation to the french exposition of 1900 be bring to the attention of the congress by president cleveland in december 1895 and so many be the delay necessary to such proceeding that the period of font year and a half which then intervene before the exposition prove none too long for the proper preparation of the exhibit the adoption of a new tariff by germany accompany by convention for reciprocal tariff concession between that country and most of the other country of continental europe lead the german government to -ire the notice necessary to terminate the reciprocal commercial agreement with this country proclaim july 13 1900 the notice be to take effect on the 1st of march 1906 and in default of some other arrangement this would have leave the export from the united states to germany subject to the general german tariff duty from 25 to 50 per cent high than the conventional duty impose upon the good of most of our competitor for german trade under a special agreement make between the two government in february 1906 the german government postpone the operation of their notice until the 30th of june 1907 in the meantime deem it to be my duty to make every possible effort to prevent a tariff war between the united states and germany arise from misunderstand by either country of the condition exist in the other and act upon the invitation of the german government i send to berlin a commission compose of competent expert in the operation and administration of the custom tariff from the departments of the treasury and commerce and labor this commission be engage for several mouth in conference with a similar commission appoint by the german government under instruction so far as practicable to reach a common understanding as to all the fact regard the tariff of the united states and germany material and relevant to the trade relation between the two country the commission report and upon the basis of the report a further temporary commercial agreement be enter into by the two country pursuant to which in the exercise of the authority confer upon the president by the third section of the tariff act of july 24 1897 i extend the reduce tariff rate provide for in that section to champagne and all other sparkling wine and pursuant to which the german conventional or minimum tariff rate be extend to about 96 1/2 per cent of all the export from the united states to germany this agreement be to remain in force until the 30th of june 1908 and until six month after notice by either party to terminate it the agreement and the report of the commission on which it be base will be lay before the congress for its information this careful examination into the tariff relation between the united states and germany involve an inquiry into certain of our method of administration which have be the cause of much complaint on the part of german exporter in this inquiry i become satisfied that certain vicious and unjustifiable practice have grow up in our custom administration notably the practice of determine value of import upon detective report never disclose to the person whose interest be affect the use of detective though often necessary tend towards abuse and should be carefully guard under our practice as i find it to exist in this case the abuse have become gross and discreditable under it instead of seek information as to the market value of merchandise from the well know and respected member of the commercial community in the country of its production secret statement be obtain from informer and discharged employee and business rival and upon this kind of secret evidence the value of import good be frequently raise and heavy penalty be frequently impose upon importer who be never permit to know what the evidence be and who never have an opportunity to meet it it be quite probable that this system tend towards an increase of the duty collect upon import good but i conceive it to be a violation of law to exact more duty than the law provide just as it be a violation to admit good upon the payment of less than the legal rate of duty this practice be repugnant to the spirit of american law and to american sense of justice in the judgment of the most competent expert of the treasury department and the department of commerce and labor it be wholly unnecessary for the due collection of the custom revenue and the attempt to defend it merely illustrate the demoralization which naturally follow from a long continued course of reliance upon such method i accordingly cause the regulation govern this branch of the custom service to be modify so that value be determine upon a hearing in which all the party interested have an opportunity to be hear and to know the evidence against they moreover our treasury agent be accredit to the government of the country in which they seek information and in germany receive the assistance of the quasi official chamber of commerce in determine the actual market value of good in accordance with what i be advise to be the true construction of the law these change of regulation be adapt to the removal of such manifest abuse that i have not feel that they ought to be confine to our relation with germany and i have extend their operation to all other country which have express a desire to enter into similar administrative relation i ask for authority to reform the agreement with china under which the indemnity of 1900 be fix by remit and cancel the obligation of china for the payment of all that part of the stipulate indemnity which be in excess of the sum of eleven million six hundred and fifty five thousand four hundred and ninety two dollar and sixty nine cent and interest at four per cent after the rescue of the foreign legation in peking during the boxer trouble in 1900 the powers require from china the payment of equitable indemnity to the several nation and the final protocol under which the troop be withdraw sign at peking september 7 1901 fix the amount of this indemnity allot to the united states at over $ 20,000,000 and china pay up to and include the 1st day of june last a little over $ 6,000,000 it be the first intention of this government at the proper time when all claim have be present and all expense ascertain as fully as possible to revise the estimate and account and as a proof of sincere friendship for china voluntarily to release that country from its legal liability for all payment in excess of the sum which should prove to be necessary for actual indemnity to the united states and its citizen this nation should help in every practicable way in the education of the chinese people so that the vast and populous empire of china may gradually adapt itself to modern condition one way of do this be by promote the coming of chinese student to this country and make it attractive to they to take course at our university and high educational institution our educator should so far as possible take concert action toward this end on the courteous invitation of the president of mexico the secretary of state visit that country in september and october and be receive everywhere with the great kindness and hospitality he carry from the government of the united states to our southern neighbor a message of respect and good will and of desire for well acquaintance and increase friendship the response from the government and the people of mexico be hearty and sincere no pain be spare to manifest the most friendly attitude and feel toward the united states in view of the close neighborhood of the two country the relation which exist between mexico and the united states be just cause for gratification we have a common boundary of over 1,500 mile from the gulf of mexico to the pacific much of it be mark only by the shift water of the rio grande many thousand of mexicans be reside upon our side of the line and it be estimate that over 40,000 americans be resident in mexican territory and that american investment in mexico amount to over seven hundred million dollar the extraordinary industrial and commercial prosperity of mexico have be greatly promote by american enterprise and americans be share largely in its result the foreign trade of the republic already exceed $ 240,000,000 per annum and of this two third both of export and import be exchange with the united states under these circumstance numerous question necessarily arise between the two country these question be always approach and dispose of in a spirit of mutual courtesy and fair dealing american carry on business in mexico testify uniformly to the kindness and consideration with which they be treat and their sense of the security of their property and enterprise under the wise administration of the great statesman who have so long hold the office of chief magistrate of that republic the two government have be unite their effort for a considerable time past to aid central america in attain the degree of peace and order which have make possible the prosperity of the northern port of the continent after the peace between guatemala honduras and salvador celebrate under the circumstance describe in my last message a new war break out between the republics of nicaragua honduras and salvador the effort to compose this new difficulty have result in the acceptance of the joint suggestion of the president of mexico and of the united states for a general peace conference between all the country of central america on the 17th day of september last a protocol be sign between the representative of the five central american country accredit to this government agree upon a conference to be hold in the city of washington in order to devise the mean of preserve the good relation among say republics and bring about permanent peace in those country the protocol include the expression of a wish that the president of the united states and mexico should appoint representative to lend their good and impartial office in a purely friendly way toward the realization of the object of the conference the conference be now in session and will have our good wish and where it be practicable our friendly assistance one of the result of the pan american conference at rio janeiro in the summer of 1906 have be a great increase in the activity and usefulness of the international bureau of american republics that institution which include all the american republics in its membership and bring all their representative together be do a really valuable work in inform the people of the united states about the other republics and in make the united states know to they its action be now limit by appropriation determine when it be do a work on a much small scale and render much less valuable service i recommend that the contribution of this government to the expense of the bureau be make commensurate with its increase work
to the senate and house of representatives
 i call your attention to certain measure as to which i think there should be action by the congress before the close of the present session there be ample time for their consideration as regard most if not all of the matter bill have be introduce into one or the other of the two houses and it be not too much to hope that action will be take one way or the other on these bill at the present session in my message at the opening of the present session and indeed in various message to previous congresses i have repeatedly suggest action on most of these measure
 child labor should be prohibit throughout the nation at least a model child labor bill should be pass for the district of columbia it be unfortunate that in the one place solely dependent upon congress for its legislation there should be no law whatever to protect child by forbid or regulate their labor
 i renew my recommendation for the immediate reenactment of an employers&#39 liability law draw to conform to the recent decision of the supreme court within the limit indicate by the court the law should be make through and comprehensive and the protection it afford should embrace every class of employee to which the power of the congress can extend
 in addition to a liability law protect the employee of common carrier the government should show its good faith by enact a further law give compensation to its own employee for injury or death incur in its service it be a reproach to we as a nation that in both federal and state legislation we have afford less protection to public and private employee than any other industrial country of the world
 i also urge that action be take along the line of the recommendation i have already make concern injunction in labor dispute no temporary restraining order should be issue by any court without notice and the petition for a permanent injunction upon which such temporary restraining order have be issue should be hear by the court issue the same within a reasonable time say not to exceed a week or thereabout from the date when the order be issue it be worth consider whether it would not give great popular confidence in the impartiality of sentence for contempt if it be require that the issue should be decide by another judge than the one issue the injunction except where the contempt be commit in the presence of the court or in other case of urgency
 i again call attention to the urgent need of amend the interstate commerce law and especially the anti trust law along the line indicate in my last message the interstate commerce law should be amend so as to give railroad the right to make traffic agreement subject to these agreement be approve by the interstate commerce commission and publish in all of their detail the commission should also be give the power to make public and to pass upon the issuance of all security hereafter issue by railroad do an interstate commerce business
 a law should be pass provide in effect that when a federal court determine to place a common carrier or other public utility concern under the control of a receivership the attorney general should have the right to nominate at least one of the receiver or else in some other way the interest of the stockholder should be consult so that the management may not be wholly redelivere to the man or man the failure of whose policy may have necessitate the creation of the receivership receivership should be use not to operate road but as speedily as possible to pay their debt and return they to the proper owner
 in addition to the reason i have already urge on your attention it have now become important that there should be an amendment of the anti trust law because of the uncertainty as to how this law affect combination among labor man and farmer if the combination have any tendency to restrict interstate commerce all of these combination if and while exist for and engage in the promotion of innocent and proper purpose should be recognize as legal as i have repeatedly point out this antitrust law be a most unwisely draw statute it be perhaps inevitable that in feeling after the right remedy the first attempt to provide such should be crude and it be absolutely imperative that some legislation should be pass to control in the interest of the public the business use of the enormous aggregation of corporate wealth that be so mark a feature of the modern industrial world but the present anti trust law in its construction and working have exemplify only too well the kind of legislation which under the guise of be thoroughgoe be draw up in such sweeping form as to become either ineffective or else mischievous
 in the modern industrial world combination be absolutely necessary they be necessary among business man they be necessary among labor man they be become more and more necessary among farmer some of these combination be among the most powerful of all instrument for wrongdoing other offer the only effective way of meet actual business need it be mischievous and unwholesome to keep upon the statute book unmodified a law like the anti trust law which while in practice only partially effective against vicious combination have nevertheless in theory be construe so as sweepingly to prohibit every combination for the transaction of modern business some real good have result from this law but the time have come when it be imperative to modify it such modification be urgently need for the sake of the business man of the country for the sake of the wage worker and for the sake of the farmer the congress can not afford to leave it on the statute book in its present shape
 it have now become uncertain how far this law may involve all labor organization and farmers&#39 organization as well as all business organization in conflict with the law or if we secure literal compliance with the law how far it may result in the destruction of the organization necessary for the transaction of modern business as well as of all labor organization and farmers&#39 organization completely check the wise movement for secure business cooperation among farmer and put back half a century the progress of the movement for the betterment of labor a bill have be present in the congress to remedy this situation some such measure as this bill be need in the interest of all engage in the industry which be essential to the country&#39; well being i do not pretend to say the exact shape that the bill should take and the suggestion i have to offer be tentative and my view would apply equally to any other measure which would achieve the desire end bear this in mind i would suggest merely tentatively the follow change in the law
 the substantive part of the anti trust law should remain as at present that is every contract in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nation should continue to be declare illegal provide however that some proper governmental authority such as the commissioner of corporations act under the secretary of commerce and labor be allow to pass on any such contract probably the good method of provide for this would be to enact that any contract subject to the prohibition contain in the antitrust law into which it be desire to enter might be file with the bureau of corporations or other appropriate executive body this would provide publicity within say sixty day of the filing which period could be extend by order of the department whenever for any reason it do not give the department sufficient time for a thorough examination the executive department have power might forbid the contract which would then become subject to the provision of the anti trust law if at all in restraint of trade
 if no such prohibition be issue the contract would then only be liable to attack on the ground that it constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade whenever the period of filing have pass without any such prohibition the contract or combination could be disapprove or forbid only after notice and hear with a reasonable provision for summary review on appeal by the court labor organization farmers&#39 organization and other organization not organize for purpose of profit should be allow to register under the law by give the location of the head office the charter and by law and the name and address of their principal officer in the interest of all these organization business labor and farmers&#39 organization alike the present provision permit the recovery of threefold damage should be abolish and as a substitute therefor the right of recovery allow for should be only the damage sustain by the plaintiff and the cost of suit include a reasonable attorney&#39;s fee
 the law should not affect pende suit a short statute of limitation should be provide so far as the past be concern not to exceed a year moreover and even more in the interest of labor than of business combination all such suit bring for cause of action heretofore occur should be bring only if the contract or combination complain of be unfair or unreasonable it may be well to remember that all of the suit hitherto bring by the government under the antitrust law have be in case where the combination or contract be in fact unfair unreasonable and against the public interest
 it be important that we should encourage trade agreement between employer and employee where they be just and fair a strike be a clumsy weapon for right wrong do to labor and we should extend so far as possible the process of conciliation and arbitration as a substitute for strike moreover violence disorder and coercion when commit in connection with strike should be as promptly and sternly repress as when commit in any other connection but strike themselves be and should be recognize to be entirely legal combination of workingman have a peculiar reason for their existence the very wealthy individual employer and still more the very wealthy corporation stand at an enormous advantage when compare to the individual workingman and while there be many case where it may not be necessary for laborer to form a union in many other case it be indispensable for otherwise the thousand of small unit the thousand of individual workingmen will be leave helpless in their dealing with the one big unit the big individual or corporate employer
 twenty two year ago by the act of june 29 1886 trade union be recognize by law and the right of labor people to combine for all lawful purpose be formally recognize this right include combination for mutual protection and benefit the regulation of wage hour and condition of labor and the protection of the individual right of the workman in the prosecution of their trade or trade and in the act of june 1 1898 strike be recognize as legal in the same provision that forbid participation in or instigation of force or violence against person or property or the attempt to prevent other from work by violence threat or intimidation the business man must be protect in person and property and so must the farmer and the wageworker and as regard all alike the right of peaceful combination for all lawful purpose should be explicitly recognize
 the right of employer to combine and contract with one another and with their employee should be explicitly recognize and so should the right of the employee to combine and to contract with one another and with the employer and to seek peaceably to persuade other to accept their view and to strike for the purpose of peaceably obtain from employer satisfactory term for their labor nothing should be do to legalize either a blacklist or a boycott that would be illegal at common law this be the type of boycott define and condemn by the anthracite strike commission
 the question of financial legislation be now receive such attention in both houses that we have a right to expect action before the close of the session it be urgently necessary that there should be such action moreover action should be take to establish postal saving bank these postal saving bank be imperatively need for the benefit of the wageworker and man of small mean and will be a valuable adjunct to our whole financial system
 the time have come when we should prepare for a revision of the tariff this should be and indeed must be precede by careful investigation it be peculiarly the province of the congress and not of the president and indeed peculiarly the province of the house of representatives to originate a tariff bill and to determine upon its term and this i fully realize yet it seem to i that before the close of this session provision should be make for collect full material which will enable the congress elect next fall to act immediately after it come into existence this would necessitate some action by the congress at its present session perhaps in the shape of direct the proper committee to gather the necessary information both through the committee itself and through government agent who should report to the committee and should lay before it the fact which would permit it to act with prompt and intelligent fairness these government agent if it be not deem wise to appoint individual from outside the public service might with advantage be member of the executive departments designate by the president on his own motion or on the request of the committee to act with it
 i be of the opinion however that one change in the tariff could with advantage be make forthwith our forest need every protection and one method of protect they would be to put upon the free list wood pulp with a corresponding reduction upon paper make from wood pulp when they come from any country that do not put an export duty upon they
 ample provision should be make for a permanent waterways commission with whatever power be require to make it effective the reasonable expectation of the people will not be meet unless the congress provide at this session for the beginning and prosecution of the actual work or waterway improvement and control the congress should recognize in full fashion the fact that the subject of the conservation of our natural resource with which this commission deal be literally vital for the future of the nation
 numerous bill grant water power right on navigable stream have be introduce none of they give the government the right to make a reasonable charge for the valuable privilege so grant in spite of the fact that these water power privilege be equivalent to many thousand of acre of the good coal land for their production of power nor be any definite time limit set as should always be do in such case i shall be oblige hereafter in accordance with the policy state in a recent message to veto any water power bill which do not provide for a time limit and for the right of the president or of the secretary concern to fix and collect such a charge as he may find to be just and reasonable in each case

to the senate and house of representatives finance the financial standing of the nation at the present time be excellent and the financial management of the nation 's interest by the government during the last seven year have show the most satisfactory result but our currency system be imperfect and it be earnestly to be hope that the currency commission will be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the exist defect during the period from july 1 1901 to september 30 1908 there be an increase in the amount of money in circulation of $ 902,991,399 the increase in the per capita during this period be $ 7.06 within this time there be several occasion when it be necessary for the treasury department to come to the relief of the money market by purchase or redemption of united states bond by increase deposit in national bank by stimulate additional issue of national bank note and by facilitate importation from abroad of gold our imperfect currency system have make these proceeding necessary and they be effective until the monetary disturbance in the fall of 1907 immensely increase the difficulty of ordinary method of relief by the middle of november the available work balance in the treasury have be reduce to approximately $ 5,000,000 clearing house association throughout the country have be oblige to resort to the expedient of issue clearing house certificate to be use as money in this emergency it be determined to invite subscription for $ 50,000,000 panama canal bond and $ 100,000,000 three per cent certificate of indebtedness authorize by the act of june 13 1898 it be propose to re deposit in the national bank the proceed of these issue and to permit their use as a basis for additional circulate note of national bank the moral effect of this procedure be so great that it be necessary to issue only $ 24,631,980 of the panama canal bond and $ 15,436,500 of the certificate of indebtedness during the period from july 1 1901 to september 30 1908 the balance between the net ordinary receipt and the net ordinary expense of the government show a surplus in the four year 1902 1903 1906 and 1907 and a deficit in the year 1904 1905 1908 and a fractional part of the fiscal year 1909 the net result be a surplus of $ 99,283,413.54 the financial operation of the government during this period base upon these difference between receipt and expenditure result in a net reduction of the interest bear debt of the united states from $ 987,141,040 to $ 897,253,990 notwithstanding that there have be two sale of panama canal bond amount in the aggregate to $ 54,631,980 and an issue of three per cent certificate of indebtedness under the act of june 13 1998 amount to $ 15,436,500 refund operation of the treasury department under the act of march 14 1900 result in the conversion into two per cent consol of 1930 of $ 200,309,400 bond bear high rate of interest a decrease of $ 8,687,956 in the annual interest charge result from these operation in short during the seven year and three month there have be a net surplus of nearly one hundred million of receipt over expenditure a reduction of the interest bear debt by ninety million in spite of the extraordinary expense of the panama canal and a saving of nearly nine million on the annual interest charge this be an exceedingly satisfactory showing especially in view of the fact that during this period the nation have never hesitate to undertake any expenditure that it regard as necessary there have be no new taxis and no increase of taxis on the contrary some taxis have be take off there have be a reduction of taxation corporations .as regard the great corporation engage in interstate business and especially the railroad i can only repeat what i have already again and again say in my message to the congress i believe that under the interstate clause of the constitution the united states have complete and paramount right to control all agency of interstate commerce and i believe that the national government alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure justice from and to do justice to the great corporation which be the most important factor in modern business i believe that it be bad than folly to attempt to prohibit all combination as be do by the sherman anti trust law because such a law can be enforce only imperfectly and unequally and its enforcement work almost as much hardship as good i strongly advocate that instead of an unwise effort to prohibit all combination there shall be substitute a law which shall expressly permit combination which be in the interest of the public but shall at the same time give to some agency of the national government full power of control and supervision over they one of the chief feature of this control should be secure entire publicity in all matter which the public have a right to know and furthermore the power not by judicial but by executive action to prevent or put a stop to every form of improper favoritism or other wrongdoing the railway of the country should be put completely under the interstate commerce commission and remove from the domain of the anti trust law the power of the commission should be make thoroughgoing so that it could exercise complete supervision and control over the issue of security as well as over the raising and lowering of rate as regard rate at least this power should be summary the power to investigate the financial operation and account of the railway have be one of the most valuable feature in recent legislation power to make combination and traffic agreement should be explicitly confer upon the railroad the permission of the commission be first gain and the combination or agreement be publish in all its detail in the interest of the public the representative of the public should have complete power to see that the railroad do their duty by the public and as a matter of course this power should also be exercise so as to see that no injustice be do to the railroad the shareholder the employee and the shipper all have interest that must be guard it be to the interest of all of they that no swindle stock speculation should be allow and that there should be no improper issuance of security the guiding intelligence necessary for the successful building and successful management of railroad should receive ample remuneration but no man should be allow to make money in connection with railroad out of fraudulent over capitalization and kindre stock gambling performance there must be no defrauding of investor oppression of the farmer and business man who ship freight or callous disregard of the right and need of the employee in addition to this the interest of the shareholder of the employee and of the shipper should all be guard as against one another to give any one of they undue and improper consideration be to do injustice to the other rate must be make as low as be compatible with give proper return to all the employee of the railroad from the high to the low and proper return to the shareholder but they must not for instance be reduce in such fashion as to necessitate a cut in the wage of the employee or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profit of honest shareholder telegraph and telephone company engage in interstate business should be put under the jurisdiction of the interstate commerce commission it be very earnestly to be wish that our people through their representative should act in this matter it be hard to say whether most damage to the country at large would come from entire failure on the part of the public to supervise and control the action of the great corporation or from the exercise of the necessary governmental power in a way which would do injustice and wrong to the corporation both the preacher of an unrestricted individualism and the preacher of an oppression which would deny to able man of business the just reward of their initiative and business sagacity be advocate policy that would be fraught with the grave harm to the whole country to permit every lawless capitalist every law defy corporation to take any action no matter how iniquitous in the effort to secure an improper profit and to build up privilege would be ruinous to the republic and would mark the abandonment of the effort to secure in the industrial world the spirit of democratic fair dealing on the other hand to attack these wrong in that spirit of demagogy which can see wrong only when commit by the man of wealth and be dumb and blind in the presence of wrong commit against man of property or by man of no property be exactly as evil as corruptly to defend the wrongdoing of man of wealth the war we wage must be wage against misconduct against wrongdoing wherever it be find and we must stand heartily for the right of every decent man whether he be a man of great wealth or a man who earn his livelihood as a wage worker or a tiller of the soil it be to the interest of all of we that there should be a premium put upon individual initiative and individual capacity and an ample reward for the great directing intelligence alone competent to manage the great business operation of to day it be well to keep in mind that exactly as the anarchist be the bad enemy of liberty and the reactionary the bad enemy of order so the man who defend the right of property have most to fear from the wrongdoer of great wealth and the man who be champion popular right have most to fear from the demagogue who in the name of popular right would do wrong to and oppress honest business man honest man of wealth for the success of either type of wrongdoer necessarily invite a violent reaction against the cause the wrongdoer nominally uphold in point of danger to the nation there be nothing to choose between on the one hand the corruptionist the bribe giver the bribe taker the man who employ his great talent to swindle his fellow citizen on a large scale and on the other hand the preacher of class hatred the man who whether from ignorance or from willingness to sacrifice his country to his ambition persuade well mean but wrong head man to try to destroy the instrument upon which our prosperity mainly rest let each group of man beware of and guard against the shortcoming to which that group be itself most liable too often we see the business community in a spirit of unhealthy class consciousness deplore the effort to hold to account under the law the wealthy man who in their management of great corporation whether railroad street railway or other industrial enterprise have behave in a way that revolt the conscience of the plain decent people such an attitude can not be condemn too severely for man of property should recognize that they jeopardize the right of property when they fail heartily to join in the effort to do away with the abuse of wealth on the other hand those who advocate proper control on behalf of the public through the state of these great corporation and of the wealth engage on a giant scale in business operation must ever keep in mind that unless they do scrupulous justice to the corporation unless they permit ample profit and cordially encourage capable man of business so long as they act with honesty they be strike at the root of our national well being for in the long run under the mere pressure of material distress the people as a whole would probably go back to the reign of an unrestricted individualism rather than submit to a control by the state so drastic and so foolish conceive in a spirit of such unreasonable and narrow hostility to wealth as to prevent business operation from be profitable and therefore to bring ruin upon the entire business community and ultimately upon the entire body of citizen the opposition to government control of these great corporation make its most effective effort in the shape of an appeal to the old doctrine of state 's right of course there be many sincere man who now believe in unrestricted individualism in business just as there be formerly many sincere man who believe in slavery that be in the unrestricted right of an individual to own another individual these man do not by themselves have great weight however the effective fight against adequate government control and supervision of individual and especially of corporate wealth engage in interstate business be chiefly do under cover and especially under cover of an appeal to state 's right it be not at all infrequent to read in the same speech a denunciation of predatory wealth foster by special privilege and defiant of both the public welfare and law of the land and a denunciation of centralization in the central government of the power to deal with this centralized and organized wealth of course the policy set forth in such twin denunciation amount to absolutely nothing for the first half be nullify by the second half the chief reason among the many sound and compelling reason that lead to the formation of the national government be the absolute need that the union and not the several states should deal with interstate and foreign commerce and the power to deal with interstate commerce be grant absolutely and plenarily to the central government and be exercise completely as regard the only instrument of interstate commerce know in those day the waterway the highroad as well as the partnership of individual who then conduct all of what business there be interstate commerce be now chiefly conduct by railroad and the great corporation have supplant the mass of small partnership or individual the proposal to make the national government supreme over and therefore to give it complete control over the railroad and other instrument of interstate commerce be merely a proposal to carry out to the letter one of the prime purpose if not the prime purpose for which the constitution be rounded it do not represent centralization it represent merely the acknowledgment of the patent fact that centralization have already come in business if this irresponsible outside business power be to be control in the interest of the general public it can only be control in one way by give adequate power of control to the one sovereignty capable of exercise such power the national government forty or fifty separate state government can not exercise that power over corporation do business in most or all of they first because they absolutely lack the authority to deal with interstate business in any form and second because of the inevitable conflict of authority sure to arise in the effort to enforce different kind of state regulation often inconsistent with one another and sometimes oppressive in themselves such divided authority can not regulate commerce with wisdom and effect the central government be the only power which without oppression can nevertheless thoroughly and adequately control and supervise the large corporation to abandon the effort for national control mean to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet to render likely continual burst of action by state legislature which can not achieve the purpose seek for but which can do a great deal of damage to the corporation without confer any real benefit on the public i believe that the more farsighte corporation be themselves come to recognize the unwisdom of the violent hostility they have display during the last few year to regulation and control by the national government of combination engage in interstate business the truth be that we who believe in this movement of assert and exercise a genuine control in the public interest over these great corporation have to contend against two set of enemy who though nominally oppose to one another be really ally in prevent a proper solution of the problem there be first the big corporation man and the extreme individualist among business man who genuinely believe in utterly unregulated business that be in the reign of plutocracy and second the man who be blind to the economic movement of the day believe in a movement of repression rather than of regulation of corporation and who denounce both the power of the railroad and the exercise of the federal power which alone can really control the railroad those who believe in efficient national control on the other hand do not in the least object to combination do not in the least object to concentration in business administration on the contrary they favor both with the all important proviso that there shall be such publicity about their working and such thoroughgoe control over they as to insure their being in the interest and not against the interest of the general public we do not object to the concentration of wealth and administration but we do believe in the distribution of the wealth in profit to the real owner and in securing to the public the full benefit of the concentrated administration we believe that with concentration in administration there can come both be advantage of a large ownership and of a more equitable distribution of profit and at the same time a well service to the commonwealth we believe that the administration should be for the benefit of the many and that greed and rascality practice on a large scale should be punish as relentlessly as if practice on a small scale we do not for a moment believe that the problem will be solve by any short and easy method the solution will come only by press various concurrent remedy some of these remedy must lie outside the domain of all government some must lie outside the domain of the federal government but there be legislation which the federal government alone can enact and which be absolutely vital in order to secure the attainment of our purpose many law be need there should be regulation by the national government of the great interstate corporation include a simple method of account keeping publicity supervision of the issue security abolition of rebate and of special privilege there should be short time franchise for all corporation engage in public business include the corporation which get power from water right there should be national as well as state guardianship of mine and forest the labor legislation hereinafter refer to should concurrently be enact into law to accomplish this mean of course a certain increase in the use of not the creation of power by the central government the power already exist it do not have to be create the only question be whether it shall be use or leave idle and meanwhile the corporation over which the power ought to be exercise will not remain idle let those who object to this increase in the use of the only power available the national power be frank and admit openly that they propose to abandon any effort to control the great business corporation and to exercise supervision over the accumulation and distribution of wealth for such supervision and control can only come through this particular kind of increase of power we no more believe in that empiricism which demand absolutely unrestrained individualism than we do in that empiricism which clamor for a deaden socialism which would destroy all individual initiative and would ruin the country with a completeness that not even an unrestrained individualism itself could achieve the danger to american democracy lie not in the least in the concentration of administrative power in responsible and accountable hand it lie in have the power insufficiently concentrate so that no one can be hold responsible to the people for its use concentrated power be palpable visible responsible easily reach quickly hold to account power scatter through many administrator many legislator many man who work behind and through legislator and administrator be impalpable be unseen be irresponsible can not be reach can not be hold to account democracy be in peril wherever the administration of political power be scatter among a variety of man who work in secret whose very name be unknown to the common people it be not in peril from any man who derive authority from the people who exercise it in sight of the people and who be from time to time compel to give an account of its exercise to the people labor there be many matter affect labor and the status of the wage worker to which i should like to draw your attention but an exhaustive discussion of the problem in all its aspect be not now necessary this administration be near its end and moreover under our form of government the solution of the problem depend upon the action of the states as much as upon the action of the nation nevertheless there be certain consideration which i wish to set before you because i hope that our people will more and more keep they in mind a blind and ignorant resistance to every effort for the reform of abuse and for the readjustment of society to modern industrial condition represent not true conservatism but an incitement to the wild radicalism for wise radicalism and wise conservatism go hand in hand one bent on progress the other bent on see that no change be make unless in the right direction i believe in a steady effort or perhaps it would be more accurate to say in steady effort in many different direction to bring about a condition of affair under which the man who work with hand or with brain the laborer the superintendent the man who produce for the market and the man who find a market for the article produce shall own a far great share than at present of the wealth they produce and be enable to invest it in the tool and instrument by which all work be carry on as far as possible i hope to see a frank recognition of the advantage confer by machinery organization and division of labor accompany by an effort to bring about a large share in the ownership by wage worker of railway mill and factory in farming this simply mean that we wish to see the farmer own his own land we do not wish to see the farm so large that they become the property of absentee landlord who farm they by tenant nor yet so small that the farmer become like a european peasant again the depositor in our saving bank now number over one tenth of our entire population these be all capitalist who through the saving bank loan their money to the worker that be in many case to themselves to carry on their various industry the more we increase their number the more we introduce the principle of cooperation into our industry every increase in the number of small stockholder in corporation be a good thing for the same reason and where the employee be the stockholder the result be particularly good very much of this movement must be outside of anything that can be accomplish by legislation but legislation can do a good deal postal saving bank will make it easy for the poor to keep their saving in absolute safety the regulation of the national highway must be such that they shall serve all people with equal justice corporate finance must be supervise so as to make it far safe than at present for the man of small mean to invest his money in stock there must be prohibition of child labor diminution of woman labor shortening of hour of all mechanical labor stock watering should be prohibit and stock gambling so far as be possible discouraged there should be a progressive inheritance tax on large fortune industrial education should be encourage as far as possible we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man we should put a premium upon thrift hard work and business energy but these quality cease to be the main factor in accumulate a fortune long before that fortune reach a point where it would be seriously affect by any inheritance tax such as i propose it be eminently right that the nation should fix the term upon which the great fortune be inherit they rarely do good and they often do harm to those who inherit they in their entirety protection for wageworkers the above be the mere sketch hardly even a sketch in outline of the reform for which we should work but there be one matter with which the congress should deal at this session there should no long be any paltering with the question of take care of the wage worker who under our present industrial system become kill crippled or wear out as part of the regular incident of a give business the majority of wageworker must have their right secure for they by state action but the national government should legislate in thoroughgoing and far reach fashion not only for all employee of the national government but for all person engage in interstate commerce the object seek for could be achieve to a measurable degree as far as those kill or crippled be concern by proper employer liability law as far as concern those who have be wear out i call your attention to the fact that definite step toward provide old age pension have be take in many of our private industry these may be indefinitely extend through voluntary association and contributory scheme or through the agency of saving bank as under the recent massachusetts plan to strengthen these practical measure should be our immediate duty it be not at present necessary to consider the large and more general governmental scheme that most european government have find themselves oblige to adopt our present system or rather no system work dreadful wrong and be of benefit to only one class of people the lawyer when a workman be injure what he need be not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit but the certainty of relief through immediate administrative action the number of accident which result in the death or crippling of wageworker in the union at large be simply appalling in a very few year it run up a total far in excess of the aggregate of the dead and wound in any modern war no academic theory about freedom of contract or constitutional liberty to contract should be permit to interfere with this and similar movement progress in civilization have everywhere mean a limitation and regulation of contract i call your especial attention to the bulletin of the bureau of labor which give a statement of the method of treat the unemployed in european country as this be a subject which in germany for instance be treat in connection with make provision for worn out and crippled workman pende a thoroughgoing investigation and action there be certain legislation which should be enact at once the law pass at the last session of the congress grant compensation to certain class of employee of the government should be extend to include all employee of the government and should be make more liberal in its term there be no good ground for the distinction make in the law between those engage in hazardous occupation and those not so engaged if a man be injure or kill in any line of work it be hazardous in his case whether 1 per cent or 10 per cent of those follow a give occupation actually suffer injury or death ought not to have any bearing on the question of their receive compensation it be a grim logic which say to an injure employee or to the dependent of one kill that he or they be entitle to no compensation because very few people other than he have be injure or kill in that occupation perhaps one of the most striking omission in the law be that it do not embrace peace officer and other whose life may be sacrifice in enforce the law of the united states the term of the act provide compensation should be make more liberal than in the present act a year 's compensation be not adequate for a wage earner 's family in the event of his death by accident in the course of his employment and in the event of death occur say ten or eleven month after the accident the family would only receive as compensation the equivalent of one or two month earning in this respect the generosity of the united states towards its employee compare most unfavorably with that of every country in europe even the poor the term of the act be also a hardship in prohibit payment in case where the accident be in any way due to the negligence of the employee it be inevitable that daily familiarity with danger will lead man to take chance that can be construe into negligence so well be this recognize that in practically all country in the civilized world except the united states only a great degree of negligence act as a bar to secure compensation probably in no other respect be our legislation both state and national so far behind practically the entire civilized world as in the matter of liability and compensation for accident in industry it be humiliating that at european international congress on accident the united states should be single out as the most belated among the nation in respect to employer liability legislation this government be itself a large employer of labor and in its dealing with its employee it should set a standard in this country which would place it on a par with the most progressive country in europe the law of the united states in this respect and the law of european country have be summarize in a recent bulletin of the bureau of labor and no american who read this summary can fail to be strike by the great contrast between our practice and theirs a contrast not in any sense to our credit the congress should without further delay pass a model employer liability law for the district of columbia the employer liability act recently declare unconstitutional on account of apparently include in its provision employee engage in intrastate commerce as well as those engage in interstate commerce have be hold by the local court to be still in effect so far as its provision apply to district of columbia there should be no ambiguity on this point if there be any doubt on the subject the law should be reenact with special reference to the district of columbia this act however apply only to employee of common carrier in all other occupation the liability law of the district be the old common law the severity and injustice of the common law in this matter have be in some degree or another modify in the majority of our states and the only jurisdiction under the exclusive control of the congress should be ahead and not behind the states of the union in this respect a comprehensive employer liability law should be pass for the district of columbia i renew my recommendation make in a previous message that half holiday be grant during summer to all wageworker in government employ i also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight hour day should as rapidly and as far as practicable be extend to the entire work be carry on by the government the present law should be amend to embrace contract on those public work which the present wording of the act seem to exclude the courts i most earnestly urge upon the congress the duty of increase the totally inadequate salary now give to our judges on the whole there be no body of public servant who do as valuable work nor whose moneyed reward be so inadequate compare to their work begin with the supreme court the judges should have their salary double it be not befit the dignity of the nation that its most honored public servant should be pay sum so small compare to what they would earn in private life that the performance of public service by they imply an exceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice it be earnestly to be desire that some method should be devise for do away with the long delay which now obtain in the administration of justice and which operate with peculiar severity against person of small mean and favor only the very criminal whom it be most desirable to punish these long delay in the final decision of case make in the aggregate a cry evil and a remedy should be devise much of this intolerable delay be due to improper regard pay to technicality which be a mere hindrance to justice in some noted recent case this over regard for technicality have result in a striking denial of justice and flagrant wrong to the body politic at the last election certain leader of organize labor make a violent and sweeping attack upon the entire judiciary of the country an attack couch in such term as to include the most upright honest and broad minded judge no less than those of narrow mind and more restricted outlook it be the kind of attack admirably fit to prevent any successful attempt to reform abuse of the judiciary because it give the champion of the unjust judge their eagerly desire opportunity to shift their ground into a championship of just judge who be unjustly assail last year before the house committee on the judiciary these same labor leader formulate their demand specify the bill that contain they refuse all compromise state they wish the principle of that bill or nothing they insist on a provision that in a labor dispute no injunction should issue except to protect a property right and specifically provide that the right to carry on business should not be construe as a property right and in a second provision their bill make legal in a labor dispute any act or agreement by or between two or more person that would not have be unlawful if do by a single person in other word this bill legalize blacklisting and boycott in every form legalizing for instance those form of the secondary boycott which the anthracite coal strike commission so unreservedly condemn while the right to carry on a business be explicitly take out from under that protection which the law throw over property the demand be make that there should be trial by jury in contempt case thereby most seriously impair the authority of the court all this represent a course of policy which if carry out would mean the enthronement of class privilege in its crudest and most brutal form and the destruction of one of the most essential function of the judiciary in all civilized land the violence of the crusade for this legislation and its complete failure illustrate two truth which it be essential our people should learn in the first place they ought to teach the workingman the laborer the wageworker that by demand what be improper and impossible he play into the hand of his foe such a crude and vicious attack upon the court even if it be temporarily successful would inevitably in the end cause a violent reaction and would band the great mass of citizen together force they to stand by all the judge competent and incompetent alike rather than to see the wheel of justice stop a movement of this kind can ultimately result in nothing but damage to those in whose behalf it be nominally undertake this be a most healthy truth which it be wise for all our people to learn any movement base on that class hatred which at time assume the name of class consciousness be certain ultimately to fail and if it temporarily succeed to do far reach damage class consciousness where it be merely another name for the odious vice of class selfishness be equally noxious whether in an employer 's association or in a workingman 's association the movement in question be one in which the appeal be make to all workingman to vote primarily not as american citizen but as individual of a certain class in society such an appeal in the first place revolt the more high minded and far sighted among the person to whom it be address and in the second place tend to arouse a strong antagonism among all other class of citizen whom it therefore tend to unite against the very organization on whose behalf it be issue the result be therefore unfortunate from every standpoint this healthy truth by the way will be learn by the socialist if they ever succeed in establish in this country an important national party base on such class consciousness and selfish class interest the wageworker the workingmen the labor man of the country by the way in which they repudiate the effort to get they to cast their vote in response to an appeal to class hatred have emphasize their sound patriotism and americanism the whole country have cause to fell pride in this attitude of sturdy independence in this uncompromise insistence upon act simply as good citizen as good americans without regard to fancied and improper class interest such an attitude be an object lesson in good citizenship to the entire nation but the extreme reactionary the person who blind themselves to the wrong now and then commit by the court on labor man should also think seriously as to what such a movement as this portend the judge who have show themselves able and willing effectively to check the dishonest activity of the very rich man who work iniquity by the mismanagement of corporation who have show themselves alert to do justice to the wageworker and sympathetic with the need of the mass of our people so that the dweller in the tenement house the man who practice a dangerous trade the man who be crush by excessive hour of labor feel that their need be understand by the court these judge be the real bulwark of the court these judge the judge of the stamp of the president elect who have be fearless in oppose labor when it have go wrong but fearless also in hold to strict account corporation that work iniquity and far sighted in see that the workingman get his right be the man of all other to whom we owe it that the appeal for such violent and mistaken legislation have fall on deaf ear that the agitation for its passage prove to be without substantial basis the court be jeopardize primarily by the action of those federal and state judge who show inability or unwillingness to put a stop to the wrongdoing of very rich man under modern industrial condition and inability or unwillingness to give relief to man of small mean or wageworker who be crush down by these modern industrial condition who in other word fail to understand and apply the need remedy for the new wrong produce by the new and highly complex social and industrial civilization which have grow up in the last half century the rapid change in our social and industrial life which have attend this rapid growth have make it necessary that in apply to concrete case the great rule of right lay down in our constitution there should be a full understanding and appreciation of the new condition to which the rule be to be apply what would have be an infringement upon liberty half a century ago may be the necessary safeguard of liberty to day what would have be an injury to property then may be necessary to the enjoyment of property now every judicial decision involve two term one as interpretation of the law the other the understanding of the fact to which it be to be apply the great mass of our judicial officer be i believe alive to those change of condition which so materially affect the performance of their judicial duty our judicial system be sound and effective at core and it remain and must ever be maintain as the safeguard of those principle of liberty and justice which stand at the foundation of american institution for as burke finely say when liberty and justice be separate neither be safe there be however some member of the judicial body who have lag behind in their understanding of these great and vital change in the body politic whose mind have never be open to the new application of the old principle make necessary by the new condition judge of this stamp do last harm by their decision because they convince poor man in need of protection that the court of the land be profoundly ignorant of and out of sympathy with their need and profoundly indifferent or hostile to any propose remedy to such man it seem a cruel mockery to have any court decide against they on the ground that it desire to preserve liberty in a purely technical form by withhold liberty in any real and constructive sense it be desirable that the legislative body should possess and wherever necessary exercise the power to determine whether in a give case employer and employee be not on an equal footing so that the necessity of the latter compel they to submit to such exaction as to hour and condition of labor as unduly to tax their strength and only mischief can result when such determination be upset on the ground that there must be no interference with the liberty to contract"--often a merely academic liberty the exercise of which be the negation of real liberty there be certain decision by various court which have be exceedingly detrimental to the right of wageworker this be true of all the decision that decide that man and woman be by the constitution guarantee their liberty to contract to enter a dangerous occupation or to work an undesirable or improper number of hour or to work in unhealthy surrounding and therefore can not recover damage when maim in that occupation and can not be forbid to work what the legislature decide be an excessive number of hour or to carry on the work under condition which the legislature decide to be unhealthy the most dangerous occupation be often the poorest pay and those where the hour of work be long and in many case those who go into they be drive by necessity so great that they have practically no alternative decision such as those allude to above nullify the legislative effort to protect the wage worker who most need protection from those employer who take advantage of their grind need they halt or hamper the movement for secure well and more equitable condition of labor the talk about preserve to the misery hunt being who make contract for such service their liberty to make they be either to speak in a spirit of heartless irony or else to show an utter lack of knowledge of the condition of life among the great masse of our fellow countryman a lack which unfit a judge to do good service just as it would unfit any executive or legislative officer there be also i think ground for the belief that substantial injustice be often suffer by employee in consequence of the custom of court issue temporary injunction without notice to they and punish they for contempt of court in instance where as a matter of fact they have no knowledge of any proceeding outside of organize labor there be a widespread feeling that this system often work great injustice to wageworker when their effort to better their working condition result in industrial dispute a temporary injunction procure ex parte may as a matter of fact have all the effect of a permanent injunction in cause disaster to the wageworker side in such a dispute organized labor be chafe under the unjust restraint which come from repeat resort to this plan of procedure its discontent have be unwisely express and often improperly express but there be a sound basis for it and the orderly and law abide people of a community would be in a far strong position for uphold the court if the undoubtedly exist abuse could be provide against such proposal as those mention above as advocate by the extreme labor leader contain the vital error of be class legislation of the most offensive kind and even if enact into law i believe that the law would rightly be hold unconstitutional moreover the labor people be themselves now begin to invoke the use of the power of injunction during the last ten year and within my own knowledge at least fifty injunction have be obtain by labor union in new york city alone most of they be to protect the union label a property right but some be obtain for other reason against employer the power of injunction be a great equitable remedy which should on no account be destroy but safeguard should be erect against its abuse i believe that some such provision as those i advocate a year ago for check the abuse of the issuance of temporary injunction should be adopt in substance provision should be make that no injunction or temporary restraining order issue otherwise than on notice except where irreparable injury would otherwise result and in such case a hearing on the merit of the order should be have within a short fix period and if not then continue after hear it should forthwith lapse decision should be render immediately and the chance of delay minimize in every way moreover i believe that the procedure should be sharply define and the judge require minutely to state the particular both of his action and of his reason therefor so that the congress can if it desire examine and investigate the same the chief lawmaker in our country may be and often be the judge because they be the final seat of authority every time they interpret contract property vested right due process of law liberty they necessarily enact into law part of a system of social philosophy and as such interpretation be fundamental they give direction to all law making the decision of the court on economic and social question depend upon their economic and social philosophy and for the peaceful progress of our people during the twentieth century we shall owe most to those judge who hold to a twentieth century economic and social philosophy and not to a long outgrown philosophy which be itself the product of primitive economic condition of course a judge 's view on progressive social philosophy be entirely second in importance to his possession of a high and fine character which mean the possession of such elementary virtue as honesty courage and fair mindedness the judge who owe his election to pander to demagogic sentiment or class hatred and prejudice and the judge who owe either his election or his appointment to the money or the favor of a great corporation be alike unworthy to sit on the bench be alike traitor to the people and no profundity of legal learning or correctness of abstract conviction on question of public policy can serve as an offset to such shortcoming but it be also true that judge like executive and legislator should hold sound view on the question of public policy which be of vital interest to the people the legislator and executive be choose to represent the people in enact and administer the law the judge be not choose to represent the people in this sense their function be to interpret the law the legislator be responsible for the law the judge for the spirit in which they interpret and enforce the law we stand aloof from the reckless agitator who would make the judge mere pliant tool of popular prejudice and passion and we stand aloof from those equally unwise partisan of reaction and privilege who deny the proposition that inasmuch as judge be choose to serve the interest of the whole people they should strive to find out what those interest be and so far as they conscientiously can should strive to give effect to popular conviction when deliberately and duly express by the lawmaking body the court be to be highly commend and staunchly uphold when they set their face against wrongdoing or tyranny by a majority but they be to be blame when they fail to recognize under a government like ours the deliberate judgment of the majority as to a matter of legitimate policy when duly express by the legislature such lawfully express and deliberate judgment should be give effect by the court save in the extreme and exceptional case where there have be a clear violation of a constitutional provision anything like frivolity or wantonness in upset such clearly take governmental action be a grave offense against the republic to protest against tyranny to protect minority from oppression to nullify an act commit in a spasm of popular fury be to render a service to the republic but for the court to arrogate to themselves function which properly belong to the legislative body be all wrong and in the end work mischief the people should not be permit to pardon evil and slipshod legislation on the theory that the court will set it right they should be teach that the right way to get rid of a bad law be to have the legislature repeal it and not to have the court by ingenious hair splitting nullify it a law may be unwise and improper but it should not for these reason be declare unconstitutional by a strained interpretation for the result of such action be to take away from the people at large their sense of responsibility and ultimately to destroy their capacity for orderly self restraint and self government under such a popular government as ours round on the theory that in the long run the will of the people be supreme the ultimate safety of the nation can only rest in training and guide the people so that what they will shall be right and not in devising mean to defeat their will by the technicality of strained construction for many of the shortcoming of justice in our country our people as a whole be themselves to blame and the judge and jury merely bear their share together with the public as a whole it be discreditable to we as a people that there should be difficulty in convict murderer or in bring to justice man who as public servant have be guilty of corruption or who have profit by the corruption of public servant the result be equally unfortunate whether due to hairsplitte technicality in the interpretation of law by judge to sentimentality and class consciousness on the part of jury or to hysteria and sensationalism in the daily press for much of this failure of justice no responsibility whatever lie on rich man as such we who make up the mass of the people can not shift the responsibility from our own shoulder but there be an important part of the failure which have specially to do with inability to hold to proper account man of wealth who behave badly the chief breakdown be in deal with the new relation that arise from the mutualism the interdependence of our time every new social relation beget a new type of wrongdoing of sin to use an old fashioned word and many year always elapse before society be able to turn this sin into crime which can be effectively punish at law during the lifetime of the old man now alive the social relation have change far more rapidly than in the precede two century the immense growth of corporation of business do by association and the extreme strain and pressure of modern life have produce condition which render the public confuse as to who its really dangerous foe be and among the public servant who have not only share this confusion but by some of their act have increase it be certain judge mark inefficiency have be show in deal with corporation and in re settle the proper attitude to be take by the public not only towards corporation but towards labor and towards the social question arise out of the factory system and the enormous growth of our great city the huge wealth that have be accumulate by a few individual of recent year in what have amount to a social and industrial revolution have be as regard some of these individual make possible only by the improper use of the modern corporation a certain type of modern corporation with its officer and agent its many issue of security and its constant consolidation with allied undertaking finally become an instrument so complex as to contain a great number of element that under various judicial decision lend themselves to fraud and oppression than any device yet evolve in the human brain corporation be necessary instrument of modern business they have be permit to become a menace largely because the governmental representative of the people have work slowly in provide for adequate control over they the chief offender in any give case may be an executive a legislature or a judge every executive head who advise violent instead of gradual action or who advocate ill consider and sweeping measure of reform especially if they be taint with vindictiveness and disregard for the right of the minority be particularly blameworthy the several legislature be responsible for the fact that our law be often prepare with slovenly haste and lack of consideration moreover they be often prepare and still more frequently amend during passage at the suggestion of the very party against whom they be afterwards enforce our great cluster of corporation huge trust and fabulously wealthy multi millionaire employ the very good lawyer they can obtain to pick flaw in these statute after their passage but they also employ a class of secret agent who seek under the advice of expert to render hostile legislation innocuous by make it unconstitutional often through the insertion of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweeping provision against the interest of the party inspire they while the demagogue the corrupt creature who introduce blackmail scheme to strike corporation and all who demand extreme and undesirably radical measure show themselves to be the bad enemy of the very public whose loud mouthed champion they profess to be a very striking illustration of the consequence of carelessness in the preparation of a statute be the employer liability law of 1906 in the case arise under that law four out of six court of first instance hold it unconstitutional six out of nine justice of the supreme court hold that its subject matter be within the province of congressional action and four of the nine justice hold it valid it be however adjudge unconstitutional by a bare majority of the court five to four it be surely a very slovenly piece of work to frame the legislation in such shape as to leave the question open at all real damage have be do by the manifold and conflicting interpretation of the interstate commerce law control over the great corporation do interstate business can be effective only if it be vest with full power in an administrative department a branch of the federal executive carry out a federal law it can never be effective if a divided responsibility be leave in both the states and the nation it can never be effective if leave in the hand of the court to be decide by lawsuit the court hold a place of peculiar and deserve sanctity under our form of government respect for the law be essential to the permanence of our institution and respect for the law be largely condition upon respect for the court it be an offense against the republic to say anything which can weaken this respect save for the grave reason and in the most carefully guard manner our judge should be hold in peculiar honor and the duty of respectful and truthful comment and criticism which should be bind when we speak of anybody should be especially binding when we speak of they on an average they stand above any other servant of the community and the great judge have reach the high level hold by those few great patriot whom the whole country delight to honor but we must face the fact that there be wise and unwise judge just as there be wise and unwise executive and legislator when a president or a governor behave improperly or unwisely the remedy be easy for his term be short the same be true with the legislator although not to the same degree for he be one of many who belong to some give legislative body and it be therefore less easy to fix his personal responsibility and hold he accountable therefor with a judge who be human be also likely to err but whose tenure be for life there be no similar way of hold he to responsibility under ordinary condition the only form of pressure to which he be in any way amenable be public opinion and the action of his fellow judge it be the last which be most immediately effective and to which we should look for the reform of abuse any remedy apply from without be fraught with risk it be far well from every standpoint that the remedy should come from within in no other nation in the world do the court wield such vast and far reach power as in the united states all that be necessary be that the court as a whole should exercise this power with the farsighte wisdom already show by those judge who scan the future while they act in the present let they exercise this great power not only honestly and bravely but with wise insight into the need and fix purpose of the people so that they may do justice and work equity so that they may protect all person in their right and yet break down the barrier of privilege which be the foe of right forests .if there be any one duty which more than another we owe it to our child and our child 's child to perform at once it be to save the forest of this country for they constitute the first and most important element in the conservation of the natural resource of the country there be of course two kind of natural resource one be the kind which can only be use as part of a process of exhaustion this be true of mine natural oil and gas well and the like the other and of course ultimately by far the most important include the resource which can be improve in the process of wise use the soil the river and the forest come under this head any really civilized nation will so use all of these three great national asset that the nation will have their benefit in the future just as a farmer after all his life make his living from his farm will if he be an expert farmer leave it as an asset of increase value to his son so we should leave our national domain to our child increase in value and not wear out there be small section of our own country in the east and the west in the adriondacks the white mountains and the appalachians and in the rocky mountains where we can already see for ourselves the damage in the shape of permanent injury to the soil and the river system which come from reckless deforestation it matter not whether this deforestation be due to the actual reckless cutting of timber to the fire that inevitably follow such reckless cutting of timber or to reckless and uncontrolled grazing especially by the great migratory band of sheep the unchecked wandering of which over the country mean destruction to forest and disaster to the small home maker the settler of limited mean shortsighted person or person blind to the future by desire to make money in every way out of the present sometimes speak as if no great damage would be do by the reckless destruction of our forest it be difficult to have patience with the argument of these person thank to our own recklessness in the use of our splendid forest we have already cross the verge of a timber famine in this country and no measure that we now take can at least for many year undo the mischief that have already be do but we can prevent further mischief be do and it would be in the high degree reprehensible to let any consideration of temporary convenience or temporary cost interfere with such action especially as regard the national forests which the nation can now at this very moment control all serious student of the question be aware of the great damage that have be do in the mediterranean country of europe asia and africa by deforestation the similar damage that have be do in eastern asia be less well know a recent investigation into condition in north china by mr. frank n. meyer of the bureau of plant industry of the united states department of agriculture have incidentally furnish in very striking fashion proof of the ruin that come from reckless deforestation of mountain and of the further fact that the damage once do may prove practically irreparable so important be these investigation that i herewith attach as an appendix to my message certain photograph show present condition in china they show in vivid fashion the appalling desolation take the shape of barren mountain and gravel and sand cover plain which immediately follow and depend upon the deforestation of the mountain not many century ago the country of northern china be one of the most fertile and beautiful spot in the entire world and be heavily forest we know this not only from the old chinese record but from the account give by the traveler marco polo he for instance mention that in visit the province of shansi and shensi he observe many plantation of mulberry tree now there be hardly a single mulberry tree in either of these province and the culture of the silkworm have move far south to region of atmospheric moisture as an illustration of the complete change in the river we may take polo 's statement that a certain river the hun ho be so large and deep that merchant ascend it from the sea with heavily laden boat today this river be simply a broad sandy bed with shallow rapid current wander hither and thither across it absolutely unnavigable but we do not have to depend upon write record the dry well and the well with water far below the former watermark bear testimony to the good day of the past and the evil day of the present wherever the native vegetation have be allow to remain as for instance here and there around a sacred temple or imperial burying ground there be still huge tree and tangled jungle fragment of the glorious ancient forest the thick matted forest growth formerly cover the mountain to their summit all natural factor favor this dense forest growth and as long as it be permit to exist the plain at the foot of the mountain be among the most fertile on the globe and the whole country be a garden not the slight effort be make however to prevent the unchecked cutting of the tree or to secure reforestation doubtless for many century the tree cutting by the inhabitant of the mountain work but slowly in bring about the change that have now come to pass doubtless for generation the inroad be scarcely noticeable but there come a time when the forest have shrink sufficiently to make each year 's cut a serious matter and from that time on the destruction proceed with appalling rapidity for of course each year of destruction render the forest less able to recuperate less able to resist next year 's inroad mr. meyer describe the ceaseless progress of the destruction even now when there be so little leave to destroy every morning man and boy go out armed with mattox or axe scale the steep mountain side and cut down and grub out root and branch the small tree and shrub still to be find the big tree disappear century ago so that now one of these be never see save in the neighborhood of temple where they be artificially protect and even here it take all the watch and care of the tree love priest to prevent their destruction each family each community where there be no common care exercise in the interest of all of they to prevent deforestation find its profit in the immediate use of the fuel which would otherwise be use by some other family or some other community in the total absence of regulation of the matter in the interest of the whole people each small group be inevitably push into a policy of destruction which can not afford to take thought for the morrow this be just one of those matter which it be fatal to leave to unsupervised individual control the forest can only be protect by the state by the nation and the liberty of action of individual must be condition upon what the state or nation determine to be necessary for the common safety the lesson of deforestation in china be a lesson which mankind should have learn many time already from what have occur in other place denudation leave naked soil then gullying cut down to the bare rock and meanwhile the rock waste burie the bottomland when the soil be go man must go and the process do not take long this ruthless destruction of the forest in northern china have bring about or have aid in bring about desolation just as the destruction of the forest in central asia aid in bring ruin to the once rich central asian city just as the destruction of the forest in northern africa help towards the ruin of a region that be a fertile granary in roman day shortsighted man whether barbaric semi civilized or what he mistakenly regard as fully civilized when he have destroy the forest have render certain the ultimate destruction of the land itself in northern china the mountain be now such as be show by the accompany photograph absolutely barren peak not only have the forest be destroy but because of their destruction the soil have be wash off the naked rock the terrible consequence be that it be impossible now to undo the damage that have be do many century would have to pass before soil would again collect or could be make to collect in sufficient quantity once more to support the old time forest growth in consequence the mongol desert be practically extend eastward over northern china the climate have change and be still change it have change even within the last half century as the work of tree destruction have be consummate the great masse of arboreal vegetation on the mountain formerly absorb the heat of the sun and send up current of cool air which bring the moisture laden cloud lower and force they to precipitate in rain a part of their burden of water now that there be no vegetation the barren mountain scorch by the sun send up current of heated air which drive away instead of attract the rain cloud and cause their moisture to be disseminate in consequence instead of the regular and plentiful rain which exist in these region of china when the forest be still in evidence the unfortunate inhabitant of the deforest land now see their crop wither for lack of rainfall while the season grow more and more irregular and as the air become dryer certain crop refuse long to grow at all that everything dry out fast than formerly be show by the fact that the level of the well all over the land have sink perceptibly many of they having become totally dry in addition to the result agricultural distress the watercourse have change formerly they be narrow and deep with an abundance of clear water the year around for the root and humus of the forest catch the rainwater and let it escape by slow regular seepage they have now become broad shallow stream bed in which muddy water trickle in slender current during the dry season while when it rain there be freshet and roar muddy torrent come tear down bring disaster and destruction everywhere moreover these flood and freshet which diversify the general dryness wash away from the mountain side and either wash away or cover in the valley the rich fertile soil which it take ten of thousand of year for nature to form and it be lose forever and until the forest grow again it can not be replace the sand and stone from the mountain side be wash loose and come roll down to cover the arable land and in consequence throughout this part of china many formerly rich district be now sandy waste useless for human cultivation and even for pasture the city have be of course seriously affect for the stream have gradually cease to be navigable there be testimony that even within the memory of man now live there have be a serious diminution of the rainfall of northeastern china the level of the sungari river in northern manchuria have be sensibly lower during the last fifty year at least partly as the result of the indiscriminate rutting of the forest form its watershed almost all the river of northern china have become uncontrollable and very dangerous to the dweller along their bank as a direct result of the destruction of the forest the journey from pekin to jehol show in melancholy fashion how the soil have be wash away from whole valley so that they have be convert into desert in northern china this disastrous process have go on so long and have proceed so far that no complete remedy could be apply there be certain mountain in china from which the soil be go so utterly that only the slow action of the age could again restore it although of course much could be do to prevent the still far eastward extension of the mongolian desert if the chinese government would act at once the accompanying cut from photograph show the inconceivable desolation of the barren mountain in which certain of these river rise mountain be it remember which formerly support dense forest of larch and fir now unable to produce any wood and because of their condition a source of danger to the whole country the photograph also show the same river after they have pass through the mountain the bed having become broad and sandy because of the deforestation of the mountain one of the photograph show a caravan pass through a valley formerly when the mountain be forest it be thickly people by prosperous peasant now the flood have carry destruction all over the land and the valley be a stony desert another photograph show a mountain road cover with the stone and rock that be bring down in the rainy season from the mountain which have already be deforest by human hand another show a pebbly river bed in southern manchuria where what be once a great stream have dry up owe to the deforestation in the mountain only some scrub wood be leave which will disappear within a half century yet another show the effect of one of the washout destroy an arable mountain side these washout be due to the removal of all vegetation yet in this photograph the foreground show that reforestation be still a possibility in place what have thus happen in northern china what have happen in central asia in palestine in north africa in part of the mediterranean country of europe will surely happen in our country if we do not exercise that wise forethought which should be one of the chief mark of any people call itself civilized nothing should be permit to stand in the way of the preservation of the forest and it be criminal to permit individual to purchase a little gain for themselves through the destruction of forest when this destruction be fatal to the well being of the whole country in the future inland waterways action should be begin forthwith during the present session of the congress for the improvement of our inland waterway action which will result in give we not only navigable but navigated river we have spend hundred of million of dollar upon these waterway yet the traffic on nearly all of they be steadily decline this condition be the direct result of the absence of any comprehensive and far see plan of waterway improvement obviously we can not continue thus to expend the revenue of the government without return it be poor business to spend money for inland navigation unless we get it inquiry into the condition of the mississippi and its principal tributary reveal very many instance of the utter waste cause by the method which have hitherto obtain for the so call improvement of navigation a striking instance be supply by the improvement of the ohio which begin in 1824 be continue under a single plan for half a century in 1875 a new plan be adopt and follow for a quarter of a century in 1902 still a different plan be adopt and have since be pursue at a rate which only promise a navigable river in from twenty to one hundred year long such shortsighted vacillating and futile method be accompany by decrease water bear commerce and increase traffic congestion on land by increase flood and by the waste of public money the remedy lie in abandon the method which have so signally fail and adopt new one in keep with the need and demand of our people in a report on a measure introduce at the first session of the present congress the secretary of war say the chief defect in the method hitherto pursue lie in the absence of executive authority for originate comprehensive plan cover the country or natural division thereof in this opinion i heartily concur the present method not only fail to give we inland navigation but they be injurious to the army as well what be virtually a permanent detail of the corp of engineer to civilian duty necessarily impair the efficiency of our military establishment the military engineer have undoubtedly do efficient work in actual construction but they be necessarily unsuited by their training and tradition to take the broad view and to gather and transmit to the congress the commercial and industrial information and forecast upon which waterway improvement must always so largely rest furthermore they have fail to grasp the great underlying fact that every stream be a unit from its source to its mouth and that all its use be interdependent prominent officer of the engineer corps have recently even go so far as to assert in print that waterway be not dependent upon the conservation of the forest about their headwater this position be oppose to all the recent work of the scientific bureaus of the government and to the general experience of mankind a physician who disbelieve in vaccination would not be the right man to handle an epidemic of smallpox nor should we leave a doctor skeptical about the transmission of yellow fever by the stegomyia mosquito in charge of sanitation at havana or panama so with the improvement of our river it be no long wise or safe to leave this great work in the hand of man who fail to grasp the essential relation between navigation and general development and to assimilate and use the central fact about our stream until the work of river improvement be undertake in a modern way it can not have result that will meet the need of this modern nation these need should be meet without far dilly dally or delay the plan which promise the good and quick result be that of a permanent commission authorize to coordinate the work of all the government department relate to waterway and to frame and supervise the execution of a comprehensive plan under such a commission the actual work of construction might be entrust to the reclamation service or to the military engineer act with a sufficient number of civilian to continue the work in time of war or it might be divide between the reclamation service and the corps of engineer fund should be provide from current revenue if it be deem wise otherwise from the sale of bond the essential thing be that the work should go forward under the good possible plan and with the least possible delay we should have a new type of work and a new organization for plan and direct it the time for play with our waterway be past the country demand result national parks .i urge that all our national park adjacent to national forest be place completely under the control of the forest service of the agricultural department instead of leave they as they now be under the interior department and police by the army the congress should provide for superintendent with adequate corp of first class civilian scout or ranger and far place the road construction under the superintendent instead of leave it with the war department such a change in park management would result in economy and avoid the difficulty of administration which now arise from have the responsibility of care and protection divide between different department the need for this course be peculiarly great in the yellowstone park this like the yosemite be a great wonderland and should be keep as a national playground in both all wild thing should be protect and the scenery keep wholly unmarred i be happy to say that i have be able to set aside in various part of the country small well choose tract of ground to serve as sanctuary and nursery for wild creature denatured alcohol i have occasion in my message of may 4 1906 to urge the passage of some law put alcohol use in the art industry and manufacture upon the free list that be to provide for the withdrawal free of tax of alcohol which be to be denature for those purpose the law of june 7 1906 and its amendment of march 2 1907 accomplish what be desire in that respect and the use of denature alcohol as intend be make a fair degree of progress and be entitle to further encouragement and support from the congress pure food the pure food legislation have already work a benefit difficult to overestimate indian service it have be my purpose from the beginning of my administration to take the indian service completely out of the atmosphere of political activity and there have be steady progress toward that end the last remain stronghold of politic in that service be the agency system which have see its good day and be gradually fall to piece from natural or purely evolutionary cause but like all such survival be decay slowly in its later stage it seem clear that its extinction have well be make final now so that the ground can be clear for large constructive work on behalf of the indians preparatory to their induction into the full measure of responsible citizenship on november 1 only eighteen agency be leave on the roster with two exception where some legal question seem to stand temporarily in the way these have be change to superintendencie and their head bring into the classified civil service secret service last year an amendment be incorporate in the measure provide for the secret service which provide that there should be no detail from the secret service and no transfer therefrom it be not too much to say that this amendment have be of benefit only and could be of benefit only to the criminal class if deliberately introduce for the purpose of diminish the effectiveness of war against crime it could not have be well devise to this end it forbid the practice that have be follow to a great or less extent by the executive head of various department for twenty year to these practice we owe the securing of the evidence which enable we to drive great lottery out of business and secure a quarter of a million of dollar in fine from their promoter these practice have enable we to get some of the evidence indispensable in order in connection with the theft of government land and government timber by great corporation and by individual these practice have enable we to get some of the evidence indispensable in order to secure the conviction of the wealthy and most formidable criminal with whom the government have to deal both those operate in violation of the anti trust law and other the amendment in question be of benefit to no one except to these criminal and it seriously hamper the government in the detection of crime and the securing of justice moreover it not only affect department outside of the treasury but it tend to hamper the secretary of the treasury himself in the effort to utilize the employee of his department so as to well meet the requirement of the public service it forbid he from prevent fraud upon the custom service from investigate irregularity in branch mint and assay office and have seriously cripple he it prevent the promotion of employee in the secret service and this far discourage good effort in its present form the restriction operate only to the advantage of the criminal of the wrongdoer the chief argument in favor of the provision be that the congressmen do not themselves wish to be investigate by secret service man very little of such investigation have be do in the past but it be true that the work of the secret service agent be partly responsible for the indictment and conviction of a senator and a congressman for land fraud in oregon i do not believe that it be in the public interest to protect criminally in any branch of the public service and exactly as we have again and again during the past seven year prosecute and convict such criminal who be in the executive branch of the government so in my belief we should be give ample mean to prosecute they if find in the legislative branch but if this be not consider desirable a special exception could be make in the law prohibit the use of the secret service force in investigate member of the congress it would be far well to do this than to do what actually be do and strive to prevent or at least to hamper effective action against criminal by the executive branch of the government postal savings bank i again renew my recommendation for postal saving hank for deposit saving with the security of the government behind they the object be to encourage thrift and economy in the wage earner and person of moderate mean in 14 state the deposit in saving bank as report to the comptroller of the currency amount to $ 3,590,245,402 or 98.4 per cent of the entire deposit while in the remain 32 state there be only $ 70,308,543 or 1.6 per cent show conclusively that there be many locality in the united states where sufficient opportunity be not give to the people to deposit their saving the result be that money be keep in hiding and unemployed it be believe that in the aggregate vast sum of money would be bring into circulation through the instrumentality of the postal saving bank while there be only 1,453 saving bank report to the comptroller there be more than 61,000 post office 40,000 of which be money order office postal saving bank be now in operation in practically all of the great civilized country with the exception of the united states parcel post in my last annual message i commend the postmaster general 's recommendation for an extension of the parcel post on the rural route the establishment of a local parcel post on rural route would be to the mutual benefit of the farmer and the country storekeeper and it be desirable that the route serve more than 15,000,000 people should be utilize to the full practicable extent an amendment be propose in the senate at the last session at the suggestion of the postmaster general provide that for the purpose of ascertain the practicability of establish a special local parcel post system on the rural route throughout the united states the postmaster general be authorize and direct to experiment and report to the congress the result of such experiment by establish a special local parcel post system on rural delivery route in not to exceed four county in the united states for package of fourth class matter originate on a rural route or at the distribute post office for delivery by rural carrier it would seem only proper that such an experiment should be try in order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposition especially as the postmaster general estimate that the revenue derive from the operation of such a system on all the rural route would amount to many million dollar education .the share that the national government should take in the broad work of education have not receive the attention and the care it rightly deserve the immediate responsibility for the support and improvement of our educational system and institution rest and should always rest with the people of the several states act through their state and local government but the nation have an opportunity in educational work which must not be lose and a duty which should no long be neglect the national bureau of education be establish more than forty year ago its purpose be to collect and diffuse such information as shall aid the people of the united states in the establishment and maintenance of efficient school system and otherwise promote the cause of education throughout the country this purpose in no way conflict with the educational work of the states but may be make of great advantage to the states by give they the full most accurate and hence the most helpful information and suggestion regard the good educational system the nation through its broad field of activity its wide opportunity for obtain information from all the states and from foreign country be able to do that which not even the rich state can do and with the distinct additional advantage that the information thus obtain be use for the immediate benefit of all our people with the limited mean hitherto provide the bureau of education have render efficient service but the congress have neglect to adequately supply the bureau with mean to meet the educational growth of the country the appropriation for the general work of the bureau outside education in alaska for the year 1909 be but $ 87,500 -an amount less than they be ten year ago and some of the important item in these appropriation be less than they be thirty year ago it be an inexcusable waste of public money to appropriate an amount which be so inadequate as to make it impossible properly to do the work authorize and it be unfair to the great educational interest of the country to deprive they of the value of the result which can be obtain by proper appropriation i earnestly recommend that this unfortunate state of affair as regard the national educational office be remedie by adequate appropriation this recommendation be urge by the representative of our common school and great state university and the lead educator who all unite in request favorable consideration and action by the congress upon this subject censu .i strongly urge that the request of the director of the census in connection with the decennial work so soon to be begin be comply with and that the appointment to the census force be place under the civil service law waive the geographical requirement as request by the director of the census the supervisor and enumerator should not be appoint under the civil service law for the reason give by the director i commend to the congress the careful consideration of the admirable report of the director of the census and i trust that his recommendation will be adopt and immediate action thereon take public health it be highly advisable that there should be intelligent action on the part of the nation on the question of preserve the health of the country through the practical extermination in san francisco of disease bearing rodent our country have thus far escape the bubonic plague this be but one of the many achievement of american health officer and it show what can be accomplish with a well organization than at present exist the danger to public health from food adulteration and from many other source such as the menace to the physical mental and moral development of child from child labor should be meet and overcome there be numerous disease which be now know to be preventable which be nevertheless not prevent the recent international congress on tuberculosis have make we painfully aware of the inadequacy of american public health legislation this nation can not afford to lag behind in the world wide battle now be wage by all civilized people with the microscopic foe of mankind nor ought we long to ignore the reproach that this government take more pain to protect the life of hog and of cattle than of human being redistribution of bureaus the first legislative step to be take be that for the concentration of the proper bureaus into one of the exist department i therefore urgently recommend the passage of a bill which shall authorize a redistribution of the bureaus which shall well accomplish this end government printing office i recommend that legislation be enact place under the jurisdiction of the department of commerce and labor the government printing office at present this office be under the combine control supervision and administrative direction of the president and of the joint committee on printing of the two houses of the congress the advantage of have the 4,069 employee in this office and the expenditure of the $ 5,761,377.57 appropriate therefor supervise by an executive department be obvious instead of the present combine supervision soldier homes all soldier home should be place under the complete jurisdiction and control of the war department independent bureaus and commission economy and sound business policy require that all exist independent bureaus and commission should be place under the jurisdiction of appropriate executive department it be unwise from every standpoint and result only in mischief to have any executive work do save by the purely executive body under the control of the president and each such executive body should be under the immediate supervision of a cabinet minister statehood .i advocate the immediate admission of new mexico and arizona as states this should be do at the present session of the congress the people of the two territories have make it evident by their vote that they will not come in as one state the only alternative be to admit they as two and i trust that this will be do without delay interstate fishery i call the attention of the congress to the importance of the problem of the fishery in the interstate water on the great lakes we be now under the very wise treaty of april 11th of this year endeavor to come to an international agreement for the preservation and satisfactory use of the fishery of these water which can not otherwise be achieve lake erie for example have the rich fresh water fishery in the world but it be now control by the statute of two nation four state and one province and in this province by different ordinance in different county all these political division work at cross purpose and in no case can they achieve protection to the fishery on the one hand and justice to the locality and individual on the other the case be similar in puget sound but the problem be quite as press in the interstate water of the united states the salmon fishery of the columbia river be now but a fraction of what they be twenty five year ago and what they would be now if the united states government have take complete charge of they by intervene between oregon and washington during these twenty five year the fisherman of each state have naturally try to take all they could get and the two legislature have never be able to agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fishery at the moment the fishing on the oregon side be practically closed while there be no limit on the washington side of any kind and no one can tell what the court will decide as to the very statute under which this action and non action result meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawn ground and probably four year hence the fishery will amount to nothing and this come from a struggle between the associate or gill net fisherman on the one hand and the owner of the fishing wheel up the river the fishery of the mississippi the ohio and the potomac be also in a bad way for this there be no remedy except for the united states to control and legislate for the interstate fishery as part of the business of interstate commerce in this case the machinery for scientific investigation and for control already exist in the united states bureau of fisheries in this as in similar problem the obvious and simple rule should be follow of have those matter which no particular state can manage take in hand by the united states problem which in the seesaw of conflict state legislature be absolutely unsolvable be easy enough for congress to control fishery and fur seals the federal statute regulate interstate traffic in game should be extend to include fish new federal fish hatchery should be establish the administration of the alaskan fur seal service should be vest in the bureau of fisheries foreign affairs this nation 's foreign policy be base on the theory that right must be do between nation precisely as between individual and in our action for the last ten year we have in this matter prove our faith by our deed we have behave and be behave towards other nation as in private life an honorable man would behave towards his fellow latin american republics the commercial and material progress of the twenty latin american republics be worthy of the careful attention of the congress no other section of the world have show a great proportionate development of its foreign trade during the last ten year and none other have more special claim on the interest of the united states it offer to day probably large opportunity for the legitimate expansion of our commerce than any other group of country these country will want our product in greatly increase quantity and we shall correspondingly need theirs the international bureau of the american republics be do a useful work in make these nation and their resource well know to we and in acquaint they not only with we as a people and with our purpose towards they but with what we have to exchange for their good it be an international institution support by all the government of the two americas panama canal the work on the panama canal be be do with a speed efficiency and entire devotion to duty which make it a model for all work of the kind no task of such magnitude have ever before be undertake by any nation and no task of the kind have ever be well perform the man on the isthmus from colonel goethals and his fellow commissioner through the entire list of employee who be faithfully do their duty have win their right to the ungrudge respect and gratitude of the american people ocean mail liner i again recommend the extension of the ocean mail act of 1891 so that satisfactory american ocean mail line to south america asia the philippines and australiasia may be establish the creation of such steamship line should be the natural corollary of the voyage of the battle fleet it should precede the opening of the panamal canal even under favorable condition several year must elapse before such line can be put into operation accordingly i urge that the congress act promptly where foresight already show that action soon or later will be inevitable hawaii .i call particular attention to the territory of hawaii the importance of those island be apparent and the need of improve their condition and develop their resource be urgent in recent year industrial condition upon the island have radically change the importation of coolie labor have practically cease and there be now develop such a diversity in agricultural product as to make possible a change in the land condition of the territory so that an opportunity may be give to the small land owner similar to that on the mainland to aid these change the national government must provide the necessary harbor improvement on each island so that the agricultural product can be carry to the market of the world the coastwise shipping law should be amend to meet the special need of the island and the alien contract labor law should be so modified in its application to hawaii as to enable american and european labor to be bring thither we have begin to improve pearl harbor for a naval base and to provide the necessary military fortification for the protection of the island but i can not too strongly emphasize the need of appropriation for these purpose of such an amount as will within the short possible time make those island practically impregnable it be useless to develop the industrial condition of the island and establish there basis of supply for our naval and merchant fleet unless we insure as far as human ingenuity can their safety from foreign seizure one thing to be remember with all our fortification be that it be almost useless to make they impregnable from the sea if they be leave open to land attack this be true even of our own coast but it be doubly true of our insular possession in hawaii for instance it be bad than useless to establish a naval station unless we establish it behind fortification so strong that no landing force can take they save by regular and long continue siege operation the philippines real progress toward self government be be make in the philippine islands the gathering of a philippine legislative body and philippine assembly mark a process absolutely new in asia not only as regard asiatic colony of european power but as regard asiatic possession of other asiatic power and indeed always except the striking and wonderful example afford by the great empire of japan it open an entirely new departure when compare with anything which have happen among asiatic power which be their own master hitherto this philippine legislature have act with moderation and self restraint and have seem in practical fashion to realize the eternal truth that there must always be government and that the only way in which any body of individual can escape the necessity of be govern by outsider be to show that they be able to restrain themselves to keep down wrongdoing and disorder the filipino people through their official be therefore make real step in the direction of self government i hope and believe that these step mark the beginning of a course which will continue till the filipinos become fit to decide for themselves whether they desire to be an independent nation but it be well for they and well also for those americans who during the past decade have do so much damage to the filipinos by agitation for an immediate independence for which they be totally unfit to remember that self government depend and must depend upon the filipinos themselves all we can do be to give they the opportunity to develop the capacity for self government if we have follow the advice of the foolish doctrinaire who wish we at any time during the last ten year to turn the filipino people adrift we should have shirk the plain possible duty and have inflict a last wrong upon the filipino people we have act in exactly the opposite spirit we have give the filipinos constitutional government a government base upon justice and we have show that we have govern they for their good and not for our aggrandizement at the present time as during the past ten year the inexorable logic of fact show that this government must be supply by we and not by they we must be wise and generous we must help the filipinos to master the difficult art of self control which be simply another name for self government but we can not give they self government save in the sense of govern they so that gradually they may if they be able learn to govern themselves under the present system of just law and sympathetic administration we have every reason to believe that they be gradually acquire the character which lie at the basis of self government and for which if it be lack no system of law no paper constitution will in any wise serve as a substitute our people in the philippines have achieve what may legitimately be call a marvelous success in give to they a government which mark on the part of those in authority both the necessary understanding of the people and the necessary purpose to serve they disinterestedly and in good faith i trust that within a generation the time will arrive when the philippines can decide for themselves whether it be well for they to become independent or to continue under the protection of a strong and disinterested power able to guarantee to the island order at home and protection from foreign invasion but no one can prophesy the exact date when it will be wise to consider independence as a fixed and definite policy it would be bad than folly to try to set down such a date in advance for it must depend upon the way in which the philippine people themselves develop the power of self mastery porto rico i again recommend that american citizenship be confer upon the people of porto rico cuba .in cuba our occupancy will cease in about two month time the cubans have in orderly manner elect their own governmental authority and the island will be turn over to they our occupation on this occasion have last a little over two year and cuba have thriven and prosper under it our earnest hope and one desire be that the people of the island shall now govern themselves with justice so that peace and order may be secure we will gladly help they to this end but i would solemnly warn they to remember the great truth that the only way a people can permanently avoid be govern from without be to show that they both can and will govern themselves from within japanese exposition the japanese government have postpone until 1917 the date of the great international exposition the action be take so as to insure ample time in which to prepare to make the exposition all that it should be make the american commissioner have visit japan and the postponement will merely give ampler opportunity for america to be represent at the exposition not since the first international exposition have there be one of great importance than this will be mark as it do the fiftieth anniversary of the ascension to the throne of the emperor of japan the extraordinary leap to a foremost place among the nation of the world make by japan during this half century be something unparalleled in all previous history this exposition will fitly commemorate and signalize the giant progress that have be achieve it be the first exposition of its kind that have ever be hold in asia the united states because of the ancient friendship between the two people because each of we front on the pacific and because of the grow commercial relation between this country and asia take a peculiar interest in see the exposition make a success in every way i take this opportunity publicly to state my appreciation of the way in which in japan in australia in new zealand and in all the states of south america the battle fleet have be receive on its practice voyage around the world the american government can not too strongly express its appreciation of the abounding and generous hospitality show our ship in every port they visit the army as regard the army i call attention to the fact that while our junior officer and enlisted man stand very high the present system of promotion by seniority result in bring into the high grade many man of mediocre capacity who have but a short time to serve no man should regard it as his vest right to rise to the high rank in the army any more than in any other profession it be a curious and by no mean creditable fact that there should be so often a failure on the part of the public and its representative to understand the great need from the standpoint of the service and the nation of refuse to promote respectable elderly incompetent the high place should be give to the most deserving man without regard to seniority at least seniority should be treat as only one consideration in the stress of modern industrial competition no business firm could succeed if those responsible for its management be choose simply on the ground that they be the old people in its employment yet this be the course advocate as regard the army and require by law for all grade except those of general officer as a matter of fact all of the good officer in the high rank of the army be those who have attain their present position wholly or in part by a process of selection the scope of retire board should be extend so that they could consider general unfitness to command for any cause in order to secure a far more rigid enforcement than at present in the elimination of officer for mental physical or temperamental disability but this plan be recommend only if the congress do not see fit to provide what in my judgment be far well that be for selection in promotion and for elimination for age officer who fail to attain a certain rank by a certain age should be retire for instance if a man should not attain field rank by the time he be 45 he should of course be place on the retired list general officer should be select as at present and one third of the other promotion should be make by selection the selection to be make by the president or the secretary of war from a list of at least two candidate propose for each vacancy by a board of officer from the arm of the service from which the promotion be to be make a bill be now before the congress have for its object to secure the promotion of officer to various grade at reasonable age through a process of selection by board of officer of the least efficient for retirement with a percentage of their pay depend upon length of service the bill although not accomplish all that should be do be a long step in the right direction and i earnestly recommend its passage or that of a more completely effective measure the cavalry arm should be reorganize upon modern line this be an arm in which it be peculiarly necessary that the field officer should not be old the cavalry be much more difficult to form than infantry and it should be keep up to the maximum both in efficiency and in strength for it can not be make in a hurry at present both infantry and artillery be too few in number for our need especial attention should be pay to development of the machine gun a general service corp should be establish as thing be now the average soldier have far too much labor of a nonmilitary character to perform national guard now that the organized militia the national guard have be incorporate with the army as a part of the national force it behoove the government to do every reasonable thing in its power to perfect its efficiency it should be assist in its instruction and otherwise aid more liberally than heretofore the continuous service of many well train regular officer will be essential in this connection such officer must be specially train at service school good to qualify they as instructor of the national guard but the detailing of officer for training at the service school and for duty with the national guard entail detach they from their regiment which be already greatly deplete by detachment of officer for assignment to duty prescribe by act of the congress a bill be now pende before the congress create a number of extra officer in the army which if pass as it ought to be will enable more officer to be train as instructor of the national guard and assign to that duty in case of war it will be of the utmost importance to have a large number of train officer to use for turn raw levy into good troop there should be legislation to provide a complete plan for organize the great body of volunteer behind the regular army and national guard when war have come congressional assistance should be give those who be endeavor to promote rifle practice so that our man in the service or out of they may know how to use the rifle while team represent the united states win the rifle and revolver championship of the world against all comer in england this year it be unfortunately true that the great body of our citizen shoot less and less as time go on to meet this we should encourage rifle practice among schoolboy and indeed among all class as well as in the military service by every mean in our power thus and not otherwise may we be able to assist in preserve the peace of the world fit to hold our own against the strong nation of the earth our voice for peace will carry to the end of the earth unprepared and therefore unfit we must sit dumb and helpless to defend ourselves protect other or preserve peace the first step in the direction of preparation to avert war if possible and to be fit for war if it should come be to teach our man to shoot the navy i approve the recommendation of the general board for the increase of the navy call especial attention to the need of additional destroyer and collier and above all of the four battleship it be desirable to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eight battleship of the good exist type the north dakota delaware florida and utah will form the first division of this squadron the four vessel propose will form the second division it will be an improvement on the first the ship be of the heavy single caliber all big gun type all the vessel should have the same tactical quality that is speed and turn circle and as near as possible these tactical quality should be the same as in the four vessel before name now be build i most earnestly recommend that the general board be by law turn into a general staff there be literally no excuse whatever for continue the present bureau organization of the navy the navy should be treat as a purely military organization and everything should be subordinate to the one object of secure military efficiency such military efficiency can only be guarantee in time of war if there be the most thorough previous preparation in time of peace a preparation i may add which will in all probability prevent any need of war the secretary must be supreme and he should have as his official adviser a body of line officer who should themselves have the power to pass upon and coordinate all the work and all the proposal of the several bureau a system of promotion by merit either by selection or by exclusion or by both process should be introduce it be out of the question if the present principle of promotion by mere seniority be keep to expect to get the good result from the high officer our man come too old and stay for too short a time in the high command position two hospital ship should be provide the actual experience of the hospital ship with the fleet in the pacific have show the invaluable work which such a ship do and have also prove that it be well to have it keep under the command of a medical officer as be to be expect all of the anticipation of trouble from such a command have prove completely baseless it be as absurd to put a hospital ship under a line officer as it would be to put a hospital on shore under such a command this ought to have be realize before and there be no excuse for failure to realize it now nothing well for the navy from every standpoint have ever occur than the cruise of the battle fleet around the world the improvement of the ship in every way have be extraordinary and they have gain far more experience in battle tactic than they would have gain if they have stay in the atlantic water the american people have cause for profound gratification both in view of the excellent condition of the fleet as show by this cruise and in view of the improvement the cruise have work in this already high condition i do not believe that there be any other service in the world in which the average of character and efficiency in the enlisted man be as high as be now the case in our own i believe that the same statement can be make as to our officer take as a whole but there must be a reservation make in regard to those in the high rank as to which i have already speak and in regard to those who have just enter the service because we do not now get full benefit from our excellent naval school at annapolis it be absurd not to graduate the midshipman as ensign to keep they for two year in such an anomalous position as at present the law require be detrimental to they and to the service in the academy itself every first classman should be require in turn to serve as petty officer and officer his ability to discharge his duty as such should be a prerequisite to his go into the line and his success in commanding should largely determine his standing at graduation the board of visitors should be appoint in january and each member should be require to give at least six day service only from one to three day to be perform during june week which be the least desirable time for the board to be at annapolis so far as benefit the navy by their observation be concern
my fellow citizen anyone who have take the oath i have just take must feel a heavy weightof responsibility if not he have no conception of the power and dutiesof the office upon which he be about to enter or he be lack in a propersense of the obligation which the oath impose the office of an inaugural address be to give a summary outline of themain policy of the new administration so far as they can be anticipate i have have the honor to be one of the adviser of my distinguished predecessor and as such to hold up his hand in the reform he have initiate i shouldbe untrue to myself to my promise and to the declaration of the partyplatform upon which i be elect to office if i do not make the maintenanceand enforcement of those reform a most important feature of my administration they be direct to the suppression of the lawlessness and abuse ofpower of the great combination of capital invest in railroad and inindustrial enterprise carry on interstate commerce the step whichmy predecessor take and the legislation pass on his recommendation haveaccomplishe much have cause a general halt in the vicious policy whichcreate popular alarm and have bring about in the business affecteda much high regard for exist law to render the reform last however and to secure at the same timefreedom from alarm on the part of those pursue proper and progressivebusiness method far legislative and executive action be need relief of the railroad from certain restriction of the antitrust lawhave be urge by my predecessor and will be urge by i on the otherhand the administration be pledge to legislation look to a properfederal supervision and restriction to prevent excessive issue of bondsand stock by company own and operate interstate commerce railroad then too a reorganization of the department of justice of the bureauof corporations in the department of commerce and labor and of the interstatecommerce commission look to effective cooperation of these agency be need to secure a more rapid and certain enforcement of the law affectinginterstate railroad and industrial combination i hope to be able to submit at the first regular session of the incomingcongres in december next definite suggestion in respect to the neededamendment to the antitrust and the interstate commerce law and the changesrequire in the executive department concern in their enforcement it be believe that with the change to be recommend american businesscan be assure of that measure of stability and certainty in respect tothose thing that may be do and those that be prohibit which be essentialto the life and growth of all business such a plan must include the rightof the people to avail themselves of those method of combine capitaland effort deem necessary to reach the high degree of economic efficiency at the same time differentiate between combination base upon legitimateeconomic reason and those form with the intent of create monopoliesand artificially control price the work of formulate into practical shape such change be creativeword of the high order and require all the deliberation possible inthe interval i believe that the amendment to be propose be just asnecessary in the protection of legitimate business as in the clinchingof the reform which properly bear the name of my predecessor a matter of most pressing importance be the revision of the tariff in accordance with the promise of the platform upon which i be elect i shall call congress into extra session to meet on the 15th day of march in order that consideration may be at once give to a bill revise thedingley act this should secure an adequate revenue and adjust the dutiesin such a manner as to afford to labor and to all industry in this country whether of the farm mine or factory protection by tariff equal to thedifference between the cost of production abroad and the cost of productionhere and have a provision which shall put into force upon executive determinationof certain fact a high or maximum tariff against those country whosetrade policy toward we equitably require such discrimination it be thoughtthat there have be such a change in condition since the enactment ofthe dingley act draft on a similarly protective principle that themeasure of the tariff above state will permit the reduction of rate incertain schedule and will require the advancement of few if any the proposal to revise the tariff make in such an authoritative waya to lead the business community to count upon it necessarily halt allthose branch of business directly affect and as these be most important it disturb the whole business of the country it be imperatively necessary therefore that a tariff bill be draw in good faith in accordance withpromise make before the election by the party in power and as promptlypasse as due consideration will permit it be not that the tariff be moreimportant in the long run than the perfecting of the reform in respectto antitrust legislation and interstate commerce regulation but the needfor action when the revision of the tariff have be determine upon ismore immediate to avoid embarrassment of business to secure the neededspeed in the passage of the tariff bill it would seem wise to attemptno other legislation at the extra session i venture this as a suggestiononly for the course to be take by congress upon the call of the executive be wholly within its discretion in the mailing of a tariff bill the prime motive be taxation and thesecure thereby of a revenue due largely to the business depression whichfollowe the financial panic of 1907 the revenue from custom and othersource have decrease to such an extent that the expenditure for the currentfiscal year will exceed the receipt by $ 100,000,000 it be imperativethat such a deficit shall not continue and the framer of the tariff billmust of course have in mind the total revenue likely to be producedby it and so arrange the duty as to secure an adequate income shouldit be impossible to do so by import duty new kind of taxation mustbe adopt and among these i recommend a graduated inheritance tax ascorrect in principle and as certain and easy of collection the obligation on the part of those responsible for the expendituresmade to carry on the government to be as economical as possible and tomake the burden of taxation as light as possible be plain and shouldbe affirm in every declaration of government policy this be especiallytrue when we be face to face with a heavy deficit but when the desireto win the popular approval lead to the cutting off of expenditure reallyneede to make the government effective and to enable it to accomplishit proper object the result be as much to be condemn as the wasteof government fund in unnecessary expenditure the scope of a modern governmentin what it can and ought to accomplish for its people have be widenedfar beyond the principle lay down by the old laissez faire school ofpolitical writer and this widening have meet popular approval in the department of agriculture the use of scientific experiment ona large scale and the spread of information derive from they for the improvementof general agriculture must go on the importance of supervise business of great railway and industrialcombination and the necessary investigation and prosecution of unlawfulbusiness method be another necessary tax upon government which do notexist half a century ago the putting into force of law which shall secure the conservation ofour resource so far as they may be within the jurisdiction of the federalgovernment include the most important work of save and restore ourforest and the great improvement of waterway be all proper governmentfunction which must involve large expenditure if properly perform whilesome of they like the reclamation of and land be make to pay for themselves other be of such an indirect benefit that this can not be expect ofthem a permanent improvement like the panama canal should be treatedas a distinct enterprise and should be pay for by the proceed of bond the issue of which will distribute its cost between the present and futuregeneration in accordance with the benefit derive it may well be submittedto the serious consideration of congress whether the deepening and controlof the channel of a great river system like that of the ohio or of themississippi when definite and practical plan for the enterprise havebeen approve and determine upon should not be provide for in the sameway then too there be expenditure of government absolutely necessaryif our country be to maintain its proper place among the nation of theworld and be to exercise its proper influence in defense of its own tradeinterest in the maintenance of traditional american policy against thecolonization of european monarchy in this hemisphere and in the promotionof peace and international morality i refer to the cost of maintaininga proper army a proper navy and suitable fortification upon the mainlandof the united states and in its dependency we should have an army so organized and so officer as to be capablein time of emergency in cooperation with the national militia and underthe provision of a proper national volunteer law rapidly to expand intoa force sufficient to resist all probable invasion from abroad and to furnisha respectable expeditionary force if necessary in the maintenance of ourtraditional american policy which bear the name of president monroe our fortification be yet in a state of only partial completeness and the number of man to man they be insufficient in a few year however the usual annual appropriation for our coast defense both on the mainlandand in the dependency will make they sufficient to resist all directattack and by that time we may hope that the man to man they will be provideda a necessary adjunct the distance of our shore from europe and asiaof course reduce the necessity for maintain under arm a great army but it do not take away the requirement of mere prudence-- that we shouldhave an army sufficiently large and so constitute as to form a nucleusout of which a suitable force can quickly grow what have be say of the army may be affirm in even a more emphaticway of the navy a modern navy can not be improvise it must be builtand in existence when the emergency arise which call for its use andoperation my distinguished predecessor have in many speech and messagesset out with great force and strike language the necessity for maintaininga strong navy commensurate with the coast line the governmental resource and the foreign trade of our nation and i wish to reiterate all the reasonswhich he have present in favor of the policy of maintain a strong navyas the good conservator of our peace with other nation and the good meansof secure respect for the assertion of our right the defense of ourinterest and the exercise of our influence in international matter our international policy be always to promote peace we shall enterinto any war with a full consciousness of the awful consequence that italway entail whether successful or not and we of course shall makeevery effort consistent with national honor and the high national interestto avoid a resort to arm we favor every instrumentality like that ofthe hague tribunal and arbitration treaty make with a view to its usein all international controversy in order to maintain peace and to avoidwar but we should be blind to exist condition and should allow ourselvesto become foolish idealist if we do not realize that with all the nationsof the world armed and prepare for war we must be ourselves in a similarcondition in order to prevent other nation from take advantage of usand of our inability to defend our interest and assert our right witha strong hand in the international controversy that be likely to arise in the orientgrowing out of the question of the open door and other issue the unitedstates can maintain her interest intact and can secure respect for herjust demand she will not be able to do so however if it be understoodthat she never intend to back up her assertion of right and her defenseof her interest by anything but mere verbal protest and diplomatic note for these reason the expense of the army and navy and of coast defensesshould always be consider as something which the government must payfor and they should not be cut off through mere consideration of economy our government be able to afford a suitable army and a suitable navy itmay maintain they without the slight danger to the republic or the causeof free institution and fear of additional taxation ought not to changea proper policy in this regard the policy of the united states in the spanish war and since have givenit a position of influence among the nation that it never have before and should be constantly exert to secure to its bona fide citizen whether native or naturalized respect for they as such in foreign country we should make every effort to prevent humiliating and degrading prohibitionagainst any of our citizen wish temporarily to sojourn in foreign countriesbecause of race or religion the admission of asiatic immigrant who can not be amalgamate with ourpopulation have be make the subject either of prohibitory clause in ourtreatie and statute or of strict administrative regulation secure bydiplomatic negotiation i sincerely hope that we may continue to minimizethe evil likely to arise from such immigration without unnecessary frictionand by mutual concession between self respect government meantimewe must take every precaution to prevent or fail that to punish outburstsof race feeling among our people against foreigner of whatever nationalitywho have by our grant a treaty right to pursue lawful business here andto be protect against lawless assault or injury this lead i to point out a serious defect in the present federal jurisdiction which ought to be remedie at once having assure to other country bytreaty the protection of our law for such of their subject or citizensa we permit to come within our jurisdiction we now leave to a state ora city not under the control of the federal government the duty of performingour international obligation in this respect by proper legislation wemay and ought to place in the hand of the federal executive the meansof enforce the treaty right of such alien in the court of the federalgovernment it put our government in a pusillanimous position to makedefinite engagement to protect alien and then to excuse the failure toperform those engagement by an explanation that the duty to keep themis in states or city not within our control if we would promise wemust put ourselves in a position to perform our promise we can not permitthe possible failure of justice due to local prejudice in any state ormunicipal government to expose we to the risk of a war which might beavoide if federal jurisdiction be assert by suitable legislation bycongress and carry out by proper proceeding institute by the executivein the court of the national government one of the reform to be carry out during the incoming administrationi a change of our monetary and banking law so as to secure great elasticityin the form of currency available for trade and to prevent the limitationsof law from operate to increase the embarrassment of a financial panic the monetary commission lately appoint be give full considerationto exist condition and to all propose remedy and will doubtlesssuggest one that will meet the requirement of business and of public interest we may hope that the report will embody neither the narrow dew of thosewho believe that the sole purpose of the new system should be to securea large return on banking capital or of those who would have great expansionof currency with little regard to provision for its immediate redemptionor ultimate security there be no subject of economic discussion so intricateand so likely to evoke differ view and dogmatic statement as thisone the commission in study the general influence of currency on businessand of business on currency have wisely extend their investigationsin european banking and monetary method the information that they havederive from such expert as they have find abroad will undoubtedly befound helpful in the solution of the difficult problem they have in hand the incoming congress should promptly fulfill the promise of the republicanplatform and pass a proper postal saving bank bill it will not be unwiseor excessive paternalism the promise to repay by the government will furnishan inducement to saving deposit which private enterprise can not supplyand at such a low rate of interest as not to withdraw custom from existingbank it will substantially increase the fund available for investmentas capital in useful enterprise it will furnish absolute security whichmake the propose scheme of government guaranty of deposit so alluring without its pernicious result i sincerely hope that the incoming congress will be alive as it shouldbe to the importance of our foreign trade and of encourage it in everyway feasible the possibility of increase this trade in the orient inthe philippines and in south america be know to everyone who have giventhe matter attention the direct effect of free trade between this countryand the philippines will be mark upon our sale of cotton agriculturalmachinery and other manufacture the necessity of the establishment ofdirect line of steamer between north and south america have be broughtto the attention of congress by my predecessor and by mr. root before andafter his noteworthy visit to that continent and i sincerely hope thatcongress may be induce to see the wisdom of a tentative effort to establishsuch line by the use of mail subsidy the importance of the part which the departments of agriculture andof commerce and labor may play in rid the market of europe of prohibitionsand discrimination against the importation of our product be fully understand and it be hope that the use of the maximum and minimum feature of ourtariff law to be soon pass will be effective to remove many of thoserestriction the panama canal will have a most important bearing upon the trade betweenthe eastern and far western section of our country and will greatly increasethe facility for transportation between the eastern and the western seaboard and may possibly revolutionize the transcontinental rate with respectto bulky merchandise it will also have a most beneficial effect to increasethe trade between the eastern seaboard of the united states and the westerncoast of south america and indeed with some of the important port onthe east coast of south america reach by rail from the west coast the work on the canal be make most satisfactory progress the typeof the canal as a lock canal be fix by congress after a full considerationof the conflicting report of the majority and minority of the consultingboard and after the recommendation of the war department and the executiveupon those report recent suggestion that something have occur on theisthmus to make the lock type of the canal less feasible than it be supposedto be when the report be make and the policy determine on lead to avisit to the isthmus of a board of competent engineer to examine the gatundam and lock which be the key of the lock type the report of that boardshow nothing have occur in the nature of newly reveal evidence whichshould change the view once form in the original discussion the constructionwill go on under a most effective organization control by colonel goethalsand his fellow army engineer associate with he and will certainly becomplete early in the next administration if not before some type of canal must be construct the lock type have be select we be all in favor of have it build as promptly as possible we mustnot now therefore keep up a fire in the rear of the agent whom we haveauthorize to do our work on the isthmus we must hold up their hand and speak for the incoming administration i wish to say that i proposeto devote all the energy possible and under my control to push of thiswork on the plan which have be adopt and to stand behind the menwho be do faithful hard work to bring about the early completion ofthis the great constructive enterprise of modern time the government of our dependency in porto rico and the philippinesare progressing as favorably as could be desire the prosperity of portorico continue unabated the business condition in the philippines arenot all that we could wish they to be but with the passage of the newtariff bill permit free trade between the united states and the archipelago with such limitation on sugar and tobacco as shall prevent injury to domesticinterest in those product we can count on an improvement in businesscondition in the philippines and the development of a mutually profitabletrade between this country and the island meantime our government ineach dependency be uphold the tradition of civil liberty and increasingpopular control which might be expect under american auspex the workwhich we be do there redound to our credit as a nation i look forward with hope to increase the already good feeling betweenthe south and the other section of the country my chief purpose be notto effect a change in the electoral vote of the southern states that isa secondary consideration what i look forward to be an increase in thetolerance of political view of all kind and their advocacy throughoutthe south and the existence of a respectable political opposition in everystate even more than this to an increase feeling on the part of allthe people in the south that this government be their government and thatit officer in their state be their officer the consideration of this question can not however be complete andfull without reference to the negro race its progress and its presentcondition the thirteenth amendment secure they freedom the fourteenthamendment due process of law protection of property and the pursuit ofhappiness and the fifteenth amendment attempt to secure the negro againstany deprivation of the privilege to vote because he be a negro the thirteenthand fourteenth amendment have be generally enforce and have securedthe object for which they be intend while the fifteenth amendmenthas not be generally observe in the past it ought to be observe andthe tendency of southern legislation today be toward the enactment of electoralqualification which shall square with that amendment of course the mereadoption of a constitutional law be only one step in the right direction it must be fairly and justly enforce as well in time both will come hence it be clear to all that the domination of an ignorant irresponsibleelement can be prevent by constitutional law which shall exclude fromvote both negro and white not have education or other qualificationsthought to be necessary for a proper electorate the danger of the controlof an ignorant electorate have therefore pass with this change the interestwhich many of the southern white citizen take in the welfare of the negroesha increase the colored man must base their hope on the result of theirown industry self restraint thrift and business success as well asupon the aid and comfort and sympathy which they may receive from theirwhite neighbor of the south there be a time when northerners who sympathize with the negro inhis necessary struggle for well condition seek to give he the suffragea a protection to enforce its exercise against the prevail sentimentof the south the movement prove to be a failure what remain be thefifteenth amendment to the constitution and the right to have statutesof states specify qualification for elector subject to the testof compliance with that amendment this be a great protection to the negro it never will be repeal and it never ought to be repeal if it hadnot pass it might be difficult now to adopt it but with it in our fundamentallaw the policy of southern legislation must and will tend to obey it and so long as the statute of the states meet the test of this amendmentand be not otherwise in conflict with the constitution and law of theunited states it be not the disposition or within the province of thefederal government to interfere with the regulation by southern statesof their domestic affair there be in the south a strong feeling thanever among the intelligent well to do and influential element in favorof the industrial education of the negro and the encouragement of the raceto make themselves useful member of the community the progress whichthe negro have make in the last fifty year from slavery when its statisticsare review be marvelous and it furnish every reason to hope thatin the next twenty five year a still great improvement in his conditiona a productive member of society on the farm and in the shop and inoth occupation may come the negro be now americans their ancestor come here year ago againsttheir will and this be their only country and their only flag they haveshown themselves anxious to live for it and to die for it encounteringthe race feel against they subject at time to cruel injustice growingout of it they may well have our profound sympathy and aid in the strugglethey be make we be charge with the sacred duty of make their patha smooth and easy as we can any recognition of their distinguished man any appointment to office from among their number be properly take asan encouragement and an appreciation of their progress and this just policyshould be pursue when suitable occasion offer but it may well admit of doubt whether in the case of any race anappointment of one of their number to a local office in a community inwhich the race feeling be so widespread and acute as to interfere withthe ease and facility with which the local government business can be doneby the appointee be of sufficient benefit by way of encouragement to therace to outweigh the recurrence and increase of race feeling which suchan appointment be likely to engender therefore the executive in recognizingthe negro race by appointment must exercise a careful discretion notthereby to do it more harm than good on the other hand we must be carefulnot to encourage the mere pretense of race feeling manufacture in theinterest of individual political ambition personally i have not the slight race prejudice or feeling andrecognition of its existence only awaken in my heart a deep sympathyfor those who have to bear it or suffer from it and i question the wisdomof a policy which be likely to increase it meantime if nothing be doneto prevent it a well feeling between the negro and the white in thesouth will continue to grow and more and more of the white people willcome to realize that the future of the south be to be much benefit bythe industrial and intellectual progress of the negro the exercise ofpolitical franchise by those of this race who be intelligent and wellto do will be acquiesce in and the right to vote will be withhold onlyfrom the ignorant and irresponsible of both race there be one other matter to which i shall refer it be make the subjectof great controversy during the election and call for at least a passingreference now my distinguished predecessor have give much attention tothe cause of labor with whose struggle for well thing he have shownthe sincere sympathy at his instance congress have pass the bill fixingthe liability of interstate carrier to their employee for injury sustainedin the course of employment abolish the rule of fellow servant andthe common law rule as to contributory negligence and substitute thereforthe so call rule of comparative negligence it have also pass a lawfixe the compensation of government employee for injury sustainedin the employ of the government through the negligence of the superior it have also pass a model child labor law for the district of columbia in previous administration an arbitration law for interstate commercerailroad and their employee and law for the application of safety devicesto save the life and limb of employee of interstate railroad have beenpasse additional legislation of this kind be pass by the outgoingcongress i wish to say that insofar as i can i hope to promote the enactmentof further legislation of this character i be strongly convinced thatthe government should make itself as responsible to employee injure init employ as an interstate railway corporation be make responsible byfederal law to its employee and i shall be glad whenever any additionalreasonable safety device can be invent to reduce the loss of life andlimb among railway employee to urge congress to require its adoptionby interstate railway another labor question have arise which have awaken the most exciteddiscussion that be in respect to the power of the federal court to issueinjunction in industrial dispute as to that my conviction be fix take away from the court if it could be take away the power to issueinjunction in labor dispute and it would create a privileged class amongthe laborer and save the lawless among their number from a most needfulremedy available to all man for the protection of their business againstlawless invasion the proposition that business be not a property or pecuniaryright which can be protect by equitable injunction be utterly withoutfoundation in precedent or reason the proposition be usually link withone to make the secondary boycott lawful such a proposition be at variancewith the american instinct and will find no support in my judgment whensubmitte to the american people the secondary boycott be an instrumentof tyranny and ought not to be make legitimate the issue of a temporary restraining order without notice have in severalinstance be abuse by its inconsiderate exercise and to remedy thisthe platform upon which i be elect recommend the formulation in a statuteof the condition under which such a temporary restraining order oughtto issue a statute can and ought to be frame to embody the good modernpractice and can bring the subject so closely to the attention of thecourt as to make abuse of the process unlikely in the future the americanpeople if i understand they insist that the authority of the court shallbe sustain and be oppose to any change in the procedure by which thepower of a court may be weaken and the fearless and effective administrationof justice be interfere with having thus review the question likely to recur during my administration and having express in a summary way the position which i expect to takein recommendation to congress and in my conduct as an executive i invokethe considerate sympathy and support of my fellow citizen and the aidof the almighty god in the discharge of my responsible duty
to the senate and house of representatives
 i have convene congress in this extra session in order to enable it to give immediate consideration to the revision of the dingley tariff act condition affect production manufacture and business generally have so change in the last twelve year as to require a readjustment and revision of the import duty impose by that act more than this the present tariff act with the other source of government revenue do not furnish income enough to pay the authorized expenditure by july 1 next the excess of expense over receipt for the current fiscal year will equal $ 100,000,000
 the successful party in the late lection be pledge to a revision of the tariff the country and the business community especially expect it the prospect of a change in the rate of import duty always cause a suspension or halt in business because of the uncertainty as to the change to be make and their effect it be therefore of the high importance that the new bill should be agree upon and pass with as much speed as possible consistent with its due and thorough consideration for these reason i have deem the present to be an extraordinary occasion within the meaning of the constitution justify and require the calling of an extra session in my inaugural address i state in a summary way the principle upon which in my judgment the revision of the tariff should proceed and indicate at least one new source of revenue that might be properly resort to in order to avoid a future deficit it be not necessary for i to repeat what i then say
 i venture to suggest that the vital business interest of the country require that the attention of the congress in this session be chiefly devoted to the consideration of the new tariff bill and that the less time give to other subject of legislation in this session the well for the country
to the senate and house of representatives
 it be the constitutional duty of the president from time to time to recommend to the consideration of congress such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient in my inaugural address immediately precede this present extraordinary session of congress i invite attention to the necessity for a revision of the tariff at this session and state the principle upon which i think the revision should be effect i refer to the then rapidly increase deficit and point out the obligation on the part of the framer of the tariff bill to arrange the duty so as to secure an adequate income and suggest that if it be not possible to do so by import duty new kind of taxation must be adopt and among they i recommend a graduate inheritance tax as correct in principle and as certain and easy of collection the house of representatives have adopt the suggestion and have provide in the bill it pass for the collection of such a tax in the senate the action of its finance committee and the course of the debate indicate that it may not agree to this provision and it be now propose to make up the deficit by the imposition of a general income tax in form and substance of almost exactly the same character as that which in the case of pollock v. farmers&#39 loan and trust company 157 u. s. 429 be hold by the supreme court to be a direct tax and therefore not within the power of the federal government to impose unless apportion among the several states accord to population this new proposal which i do not discuss in my inaugural addressor in my message at the opening of the present session make it appropriate for i to submit to the congress certain additional recommendation
 the decision of the supreme court in the income tax case deprive the national government of a power which by reason of previous decision of the court it be generally suppose that government have it be undoubtedly a power the national government ought to have it might be indispensable to the nation&#39;s life in great crisis although i have not consider a constitutional amendment as necessary to the exercise of certain phase of this power a mature consideration have satisfy i that an amendment be the only proper course for its establishment to its full extent i therefore recommend to the congress that both house by a two third vote shall propose an amendment to the constitution confer the power to levy an income tax upon the national government without apportionment among the states in proportion to population
 this course be much to be prefer to the one propose of reenact a law once judicially declare to be unconstitutional for the congress to assume that the court will reverse itself and to enact legislation on such an assumption will not strengthen popular confidence in the stability of judicial construction of the constitution it be much wise policy to accept the decision and remedy the defect by amendment in due and regular course
 again it be clear that by the enactment of the propose law the congress will not be bring money into the treasury to meet the present deficiency but by put on the statute book a law already there and never repeal will simply be suggest to the executive officer of the government their possible duty to invoke litigation if the court should maintain its former view no tax would be collect at all if it should ultimately reverse itself still no taxis would have be collect until after protract delay
 it be say the difficulty and delay in secure the approval of three fourth of the states will destroy all chance of adopt the amendment of course no one can speak with certainty upon this point but i have become convinced that a great majority of the people of this country be in favor of vest the national government with power to levy an income tax and that they will secure the adoption of the amendment in the states if propose to they
 second the decision in the pollock case leave power in the national government to levy an excise tax which accomplish the same purpose as a corporation income tax and be free from certain objection urge to the propose income tax measure
 i therefore recommend an amendment to the tariff bill impose upon all corporation and joint stock company for profit except national bank otherwise tax saving bank and building and loan association an excise tax measure by 2 per cent on the net income of such corporation this be an excise tax upon the privilege of do business as an artificial entity and of freedom from a general partnership liability enjoy by those who own the stock
 i be inform that a 2 per cent tax of this character would bring into the treasury of the united states not less than $ 25,000,000
 the decision of the supreme court in the case of spreckels sugar refining company against mcclain 192 u. s. 397 seem clearly to establish the principle that such a tax as this be an excise tax upon privilege and not a direct tax on property and be within the federal power without apportionment accord to population the tax on net income be preferable to one proportionate to a percentage of the gross receipt because it be a tax upon success and not failure it impose a burden at the source of the income at a time when the corporation be well able to pay and when collection be easy
 another merit of this tax be the federal supervision which must be exercise in order to make the law effective over the annual account and business transaction of all corporation while the faculty of assume a corporate form have be of the utmost utility in the business world it be also true that substantially all of the abuse and all of the evil which have arouse the public to the necessity of reform be make possible by the use of this very faculty if now by a perfectly legitimate and effective system of taxation we be incidentally able to possess the government and the stockholder and the public of the knowledge of the real business transaction and the gain and profit of every corporation in the country we have make along step toward that supervisory control of corporation which may prevent a further abuse of power
 i recommend then first the adoption of a joint resolution by two third of both house propose to the states an amendment to the constitution grant to the federal government the right to levy and collect an income tax without apportionment among the states accord to population and second the enactment as part of the pende revenue measure either as a substitute for or in addition to the inheritance tax of an excise tax upon all corporation measure by 2 per cent of their net income

my fellow citizens as long ago as august 1906 in the congressional campaign in maine i venture to announce that i be a tariff revisionist and think that the time have come for a readjustment of the schedule i point out that it have be ten year prior to that time that the dingley bill have be pass that great change have take place in the condition surround the production of the farm the factory and the mine and that under the theory of protection in that time the rate impose in the dingley bill in many instance might have become excessive that is might have be great than the difference between the cost of production abroad and the cost of production at home with a sufficient allowance for a reasonable rate of profit to the american producer i say that the party be divide on the issue but that in my judgment the opinion of the party be crystallize and would probably result in the near future in an effort to make such revision i point out the difficulty that there always be in a revision of the tariff due to the threaten disturbance of industry to be affect and the suspension of business in a way which make it unwise to have too many revision in the summer of 1907 my position on the tariff be challenge and i then enter into a somewhat full discussion of the matter it be contend by the so call standpatter that rate beyond the necessary measure of protection be not objectionable because behind the tariff wall competition always reduce the price and thus save the consumer but i point out in that speech what seem to i as true to day as it then be that the danger of excessive rate be in the temptation they create to form monopoly in the protect article and thus to take advantage of the excessive rate by increase the price and therefore and in order to avoid such a danger it be wise at regular interval to examine the question of what the effect of the rate have be upon the industry in this country and whether the condition with respect to the cost of production here have so change as to warrant a reduction in the tariff and to make a low rate truly protective of the industry it will be observe that the object of the revision under such a statement be not to destroy protect industry in this country but it be to continue to protect they where low rate offer a sufficient protection to prevent injury by foreign competition that be the object of the revision as advocate by i and it be certainly the object of the revision as promise in the republican platform i want to make as clear as i can this proposition because in order to determine whether a bill be a compliance with the term of that platform it must be understand what the platform mean a free trader be oppose to any protect rate because be think that our manufacturer our farmer and our miner ought to withstand the competition of foreign manufacturer and miner and farmer or else go out of business and find something else more profitable to do now certainly the promise of the platform do not contemplate the downward revision of the tariff rate to such a point that any industry theretofore protect should be injure hence those who contend that the promise of the platform be to reduce price by let in foreign competition be contend for a free trade and not for anything that they have the right to infer from the republican platform the ways and means committee of the house with mr. payne at its head spend a full year in an investigation assemble evidence in reference to the rate under the tariff and devote an immense amount of work in the study of the question where the tariff rate could be reduce and where they ought to be raise with a view to maintain a reasonably protective rate under the principle of the platform for every industry that deserve protection they find that the determination of the question what be the actual cost of production and whether an industry in this country could live under a certain rate and withstand threaten competition from abroad be most difficult the manufacturer be prone to exaggerate the injury which a reduction in the duty would give and to magnify the amount of duty that be need while the importer on the other hand who be interested in develop the importation from foreign shore be quite likely to be equally biased on the other side mr. payne report a bill the payne tariff bill which go to the senate and be amend in the senate by increase the duty on some thing and decrease it on other the difference between the house bill and the senate bill be very much less than the newspaper represent it turn out upon examination that the reduction in the senate be about equal to those in the house though they differ in character now there be nothing quite so difficult as the discussion of a tariff bill for the reason that it cover so many different item and the meaning of the term and the percentage be very hard to understand the passage of a new bill especially where a change in the method of assess the duty have be follow present an opportunity for various mode and calculation of the percentage of increase and decrease that be most misleading and really throw no light at all upon the change make one way of state what be do be to say what the fact show that under the dingley law there be 2,024 item this include dutiable item only the payne law leave 1,150 of these item unchanged there be decrease in 654 of the item and increase in 220 of the item now of course that do not give a full picture but it do show the proportion of decrease to have be three time those of the increase again the schedule be divide

by compare the import under the various schedule and assume that the change and their importance be in proportion to the importation nothing could be more unjust in a protective tariff which also contain revenue provision some of the tariff be make for the purpose of increase the revenue by increase importation which shall pay duty other item in the tariff be make for the purpose of reduce competition that is by reduce importation and therefore the question of the importance of a change in rate can not in the slight degree be determine by the amount of import that take place in order to determine the importance of the change it be much fair to take the article on which the rate of duty have be reduce and those on which the rate of duty have be increase and then determine from statistic how large a part the article upon which duty have be reduce play in the consumption of the country and how large a part those upon which the duty have be increase play in the consumption of the country such a table have be prepare by mr. payne than whom there be no one who understand well what the tariff be and who have give more attention to the detail of the schedule now let we take schedule a chemical oil and paint the article upon which the duty have be decrease be consume in this country to the extent of $ 433,000,000 the article upon which the duty have be increase be consume in this country to the extent of $ 11,000,000 take schedule b. the article on which the duty have be decrease enter in the consumption of the country to the amount of $ 128,000,000 and there have be no increase in duty on such article take schedule c metal and their manufacture the amount to which such article enter into the consumption of the country be $ 1,221,000,000 whereas the article of the same schedule upon which there have be an increase enter into the consumption of the country to the extent of only $ 37,000,000 take schedule d lumber the article in this schedule upon which there have be a decrease enter into the consumption of the country to the extent of $ 566,000,000 whereas the article under the same schedule upon which there have be an increase enter into its consumption to the extent of $ 31,000,000 in tobacco there have be no change in agricultural product those in which there have be a reduction of rate enter into the consumption of the country to the extent of $ 483,000,000 those in which there have be an increase enter into the consumption to the extent of $ 4,000,000 in the schedule of wine and liquor the article upon which there have be an increase enter into the consumption of the country to the extent of $ 462,000,000 in cotton there have be a change in the higher price cotton and an increase there have be no increase in the lower price cotton and of the increase the high price cotton enter into the consumption of the country to the extent of $ 41,000,000 schedule j flax hemp and jute the article upon which there have be a decrease enter into

there be a substantial downward revision on article enter into the general consumption of the country which can be term necessity for the proportion be $ 5,000,000,000 represent the consumption of article to which decreases apply to less than $ 300,000,000 of article of necessity to which the increase apply now the promise of the republican platform be not to revise everything downward and in the speech which have be take as interpret that platform which i make in the campaign i do not promise that everything should go downward what i promise be that there should be many decrease and that in some few thing increase would be find to be necessary but that on the whole i conceive that the change of condition would make the revision necessarily downward and that i contend under the showing which i have make have be the result of the payne bill i do not agree nor do the republican party agree that we would reduce rate to such a point as to reduce price by the introduction of foreign competition that be what the free trader desire that be what the revenue tariff reformer desire but that be not what the republican platform promise and it be not what the republican party wish to bring about to repeat the statement with which i open this speech the proposition of the republican party be to reduce rate so as to maintain a difference between the cost of production abroad and the cost of production here insure a reasonable profit to the manufacturer on all article produce in this country and the proposition to reduce rate and prevent their being excessive be to avoid the opportunity for monopoly and the suppression of competition so that the excessive rate could be take advantage of to force price up now it be say that there be not a reduction in a number of the schedule where there should have be it be say that there be no reduction in the cotton schedule there be not the house and the senate take evidence and find from cotton manufacturer and from other source that the rate upon the low class of cotton be such as to enable they to make a decent profit but only a decent profit and they be content with it but that the rate on the high grade of cotton cloth by reason of court decision have be reduce so that they be considerably below those of the cheap grade of cotton cloth and that by undervaluation and otherwise the whole cotton schedule have be make unjust and the various item be disproportionate in respect to the vary cloth hence in the senate a new system be introduce attempt to make the duty more specific rather than ad valorem in order to prevent by judicial decision or otherwise a disproportionate and unequal operation of the schedule under this schedule it be contend that there have be a general rise of all the duty on cotton this be vigorously deny by the expert of the treasury department at last the senate in conference consent to a reduction amounting to about 10 per cent on all the low grade of cotton and thus reduce the low grade substantially to the same rate as before and increase the high grade to what they ought to be under the dingley law and what they be intend to be now i be not go into the question of evidence as to whether the cotton duty be too high and whether the difference between the cost of production abroad and at home allow only a reasonable profit to the manufacturer here be less than the duty which be impose under the payne bill it be a question of evidence which congress pass upon after they hear the statement of cotton manufacturer and such other evidence as they could avail themselves of i agree that the method of take evidence and the determination be make in a general way and that there ought to be other method of obtain evidence and reach a conclusion more satisfactory criticism have also be make of the crockery schedule and the failure to reduce that the question whether it ought to have be reduce or not be a question of evidence which both committee of congress take up and both conclude that the present rate on crockery be such as be need to maintain the business in this country i have be inform that the crockery schedule be not high enough and mention that in one of my campaign speech as a schedule probably where there ought to be some increase it turn out that the difficulty be rather in undervaluation than in the character of the schedule itself and so it be not change it be entirely possible to collect evidence to attack almost any of the schedule but one story be good until another be tell and i have hear no reason for sustain the contention that the crockery schedule be unduly high so with respect to numerous detail item of not great importance in which upon what they regard as sufficient evidence the committee advance the rate in order to save a business which be likely to he destroy i have never know a subject that will evoke so much contradictory evidence as the question of tariff rate and the question of cost of production at home and abroad take the subject of paper a committee be appoint by congress a year before the tariff sitting begin to determine what the difference be between the cost of production in canada of print paper and the cost of production here and they report that they think that a good bill would be one impose $ 2 a ton on paper rather than $ 6 the dingley rate provide that canada could be induce to take off the export duty and remove the other obstacle to the importation of spruce wood in this country out of which wood pulp be make an examination of the evidence satisfy mr. payne i believe it satisfy some of the republican dissenter that $ 2 unless some change be make in the canadian restriction upon the export of wood to this country be much too low and that $ 4 be only a fair measure of the difference between the cost of production here and in canada in other word the $ 2 find by the special committee in the house be rather an invitation to canada and the canadian print paper people to use their influence with their government to remove the wood restriction by reduce the duty on print paper against canadian print paper mill it be rather a suggestion of a diplomatic nature than a positive statement of the difference in actual cost of production under exist condition between canada and the united states there be other subject which i might take up the tariff on hide be take off because it be think that it be not necessary in view of the high price of cattle thus to protect the man who raise they and that the duty impose be likely to throw the control of the sale of hide into the hand of the meat packer in chicago in order to balance the reduction on hide however there be a great reduction in shoe from 25 to 10 per cent on sole leather from 20 to 5 per cent on harness from 45 to 20 per cent so there be a reduction in the duty on coal of 33 1/3 per cent all countervail duty be remove from oil naphtha gasoline and its refined product lumber be reduce from $ 2 to $ 1.25 and these all on article of prime necessity it be say that there might have be more but there be many business interest in the south in maine along the border and especially in the far northwest which insist that it would give great advantage to canadian lumber if the reduction be make more than 75 cent mr. pinchot the chief forester think that it would tend to make well lumber in this country if a duty be retain on it the lumber interest think that $ 2 be none too much but the reduction be make and the compromise effect personally i be in favor of free lumber because i do not think that if the tariff be take off there would be much suffering among the lumber interest but in the controversy the house and senate take a middle course and who can say they be not justify with respect to the wool schedule i agree that it probably represent considerably more than the difference between the cost of production abroad and the cost of production here the difficulty about the woolen schedule be that there be two contending faction early in the history of republican tariff to wit woolgrower and the woolen manufacturer and that finally many year ago they settle on a basis by which wool in the grease should have 11 cent a pound and by which allowance should be make for the shrinkage of the wash wool in the differential upon woolen manufacture the percentage of duty be very heavy quite beyond the difference in the cost of production which be not then regard as a necessary or proper limitation upon protective duty when it come to the question of reduce the duty at this bearing in the tariff bill on wool mr. payne in the house and mr. aldrich in the senate although both favor reduction in the schedule find that in the republican party the interest of the woolgrower of the far west and the interest of the woolen manufacturer in the east and in other states reflect through their representative in congress be sufficiently strong to defeat any attempt to change the woolen tariff and that have it be attempt it would have beat the bill report from either committee i be sorry this be so and i could wish that it have be otherwise it be the one important defect in the present payne tariff bill and in the performance of the promise of the platform to reduce rate to a difference in the cost of production with reasonable profit to the manufacturer that it will increase the price of woolen cloth or clothe i very much doubt there have be increase by the natural product but this be not due to the tariff because the tariff be not change the increase would therefore have take place whether the tariff would have be change or not the cost of woolen cloth behind the tariff wall through the effect of competition have be greatly less than the duty if add to the price would have make it there be a complaint now by the woolen clothier and by the card woolen people of this woolen schedule they have honor i by ask in circular send out by they that certain question be put to i in respect to it and ask why i do not veto the bill in view of the fact that the woolen schedule be not make in accord with the platform i ought to say in respect to this point that all of they in previous tariff bill be strictly in favor of maintain the woolen schedule as it be the card woolen people be find that card wool be lose their sale because they be go out of style people prefer worsted the clothing people who be do so much circularizing be content to let the woolen schedule remain as it be until very late in the tariff discussion long after the bill have pass the house and indeed they do not grow very urgent until the bill have pass the senate this be because they find that the price of woolen cloth be go up and so they desire to secure reduction in the tariff which would enable they to get cheap material they themselves be protect by a large duty and i can not with deference to they ascribe their intense interest only to a deep sympathy with the ultimate consumer so call but as i have already say i be quite willing to admit that allow the woolen schedule to remain where it be be not a compliance with the term of the platform as i interpret it and as it be generally understand on the whole however i be bind to say that i think the payne tariff bill be the good tariff bill that the republican party ever pass that in it the party have concede the necessity for follow the change condition and reduce tariff rate accordingly this be a substantial achievement in the direction of low tariff and downward revision and it ought to be accept as such critic of the bill utterly ignore the very tremendous cut that have be make in the iron schedule which heretofore have be subject to criticism in all tariff bill from iron ore which be cut 75 per cent to all the other item as low as 20 per cent with an average of something like 40 or 50 per cent that schedule have be reduce so that the danger of increase price through a monopoly of the business be very much lessened and that be the chief purpose of revise the tariff downward under republican protective principle the severe critic of the bill pass this reduction in the metal schedule with a sneer and say that the cut do not hurt the iron interest of the country well of course it do not hurt they it be not expect to hurt they it be expect only to reduce excessive rate so that business should still be conduct at a profit and the very character of the criticism be an indication of the general injustice of the attitude of those who make it in assume that it be the promise of the republican party to hurt the industry of the country by the reduction which they be to make in the tariff whereas it expressly indicate as plainly as possible in the platform that all of the industry be to be protect against injury by foreign competition and the promise only go to the reduction of excessive rate beyond what be necessary to protect they the high cost of living of which 50 per cent be consume in food 25 per cent in clothing and 25 per cent in rent and fuel have not be produce by the tariff because the tariff have remain the same while the increase have go on it be due to the change of condition the world over living have increase everywhere in cost in country where there be free trade and in country where there be protection and that increase have be chiefly see in the cost of food product in other word we have have to pay more for the product of the farmer for meat for grain for everything that enter into food now certainly no one will contend that protection have increase the cost of food in this country when the fact be that we have be the great exporter of food product in the world it be only that the demand have increase beyond the supply that farm land have not be open as rapidly as the population and the demand have increase i be not say that the tariff do not increase price in clothing and in building and in other item that enter into the necessity of life but what i wish to emphasize be that the recent increase in the cost of live in this country have not be due to the tariff we have a much high standard of live in this country than they have abroad and this have be make possible by high income for the workingman the farmer and all class high wage have be make possible by the encouragement of diversified industry build up and foster by the tariff now the revision downward of the tariff that i have favor will not i hope destroy the industry of the country certainly it be not intend to all that it be intend to do and that be what i wish to repeat be to put the tariff where it will protect industry here from foreign competition but will not enable those who will wish to monopolize to raise price by take advantage of excessive rate beyond the normal difference in the cost of production if the country desire free trade and the country desire a revenue tariff and wish the manufacturer all over the country to go out of business and to have cheap price at the expense of the sacrifice of many of our manufacturing interest then it ought to say so and ought to put the democratic party in power if it think that party can be trust to carry out any affirmative policy in favor of a revenue tariff certainly in the discussion in the senate there be no great manifestation on the part of our democratic friend in favor of reduce rate on necessity they vote to maintain the tariff rate on everything that come from their particular section if we be to have free trade certainly it can not be have through the maintenance of republican majority in the senate and house and a republican administration and now the question arise what be the duty of a member of congress who believe in a downward revision great than that which have be accomplish who think that the wool schedule ought to be reduce and that perhaps there be other respect in which the bill could be improve be it his duty because in his judgment it do not fully and completely comply with the promise of the party platform as he interpret it and indeed as i have interpret it to vote against the bill i be here to justify those who answer this question in the negative mr. tawney be adownward revisionist like myself he be a low tariff man and have be know to be such in congress all the time he have be there he be a prominent republican the head of the appropriations committee and when a man vote as i think he ought to vote and an opportunity such as this present itself i be glad to speak in behalf of what he do not in defense of it but in support of it this be a government by a majority of the people it be a representative government people select some 400 member to constitute the low house and some 92 member to constitute the upper house through their legislature and the vary view of a majority of the voter in eighty or ninety million of people be reduce to one resultant force to take affirmative step in carry on a government by a system of party without party popular government would be absolutely impossible in a party those who join it if they would make it effective must surrender their personal predilection on matter comparatively of less importance in order to accomplish the good which unite action on the most important principle at issue secure now i be not here to criticise those republican members and senators whose view on the subject of the tariff be so strong and intense that they believe it their duty to vote against their party on the tariff bill it be a question for each man to settle for himself the question be whether he shall help maintain the party solidarity for accomplish its chief purpose or whether the departure from principle in the bill as he regard it be so extreme that he must in conscience abandon the party all i have to say be in respect to mr. tawney 's action and in respect to my own in sign the bill that i believe that the interest of the country the interest of the party require i to sacrifice the accomplishment of certain thing in the revision of the tariff which i have hope for in order to maintain party solidarity which i believe to be much more important than the reduction of rate in one or two schedule of the tariff have mr. tawney vote against the bill and there have be other of the house sufficient in number to have defeat the bill or if i have veto the bill because of the absence of a reduction of rate in the wool schedule when there be a general downward revision and a substantial one though not a complete one we should have leave the party in a condition of demoralization that would have prevent the accomplishment of purpose and a fulfillment of other promise which we have make just as solemnly as we have enter into that with respect to the tariff when i could say without hesitation that this be the good tariff bill that the republican party have ever pass and therefore the good tariff bill that have be pass at all i do not feel that i could have reconcile any other course to my conscience than that of sign the bill and i think mr. tawney feel the same way of course if i have veto the bill i would have receive the applause of many republicans who may be call low tariff republicans and who think deeply on that subject and of all the democracy our friend the democrats would have applaud and then laugh in their sleeve at the condition in which the party would have be leave but more than this and waive consideration of party where would the country have be have the bill be veto or be lose by a vote it would have leave the question of the revision of the tariff open for further discussion during the next session it would have suspend the settlement of all our business down to a know basis upon which prosperity could proceed and investment be make and it would have hold up the coming of prosperity to this country certainly for a year and probably long these be the reason why i sign it but there be additional reason why the bill ought not to have be beat it contain provision of the utmost importance in the interest of this country in deal with foreign country and in the supplying of a deficit which under the dingley bill seem inevitable there have be a disposition in some foreign country take advantage of great elasticity in their system of impose tariff and of make regulation to exclude our product and exercise against we undue discrimination against these thing we have be helpless because it require an act of congress to meet the difficulty it be now propose by what be call the maximum and minimum clause to enable the president to allow to come into operation a maximum or penalizing increase of duty over the normal or minimum duty whenever in his opinion the conduct of the foreign country have be unduly discriminatory against the united states it be hope that very little use may be require of this clause but its presence in the law and the power confer upon the executive it be think will prevent in the future such undue discrimination certainly this be most important to our exporter of agricultural product and manufacture second we have impose an excise tax upon corporation measure by 1 per cent upon the net income of all corporation except fraternal and charitable corporation after exempt $ 5,000 this it be think will raise an income of 26 to 30 million of dollar will supply the deficit which otherwise might arise without it and will bring under federal supervision more or less all the corporation of the country the inquisitorial provision of the act be mild but effective and certainly we may look not only for a revenue but for some most interesting statistic and the mean of obtain supervision over corporate method that have heretofore not obtain then we have finally do justice to the philippines we have introduce free trade between the philippines and the united states and we have limit the amount of sugar and the amount of tobacco and cigar that can be introduce from the philippines to such a figure as shall greatly profit the philippines and yet in no way disturb the product of the united states or interfere with those engage in the tobacco or sugar interest here these feature of the bill be most important and the question be whether they be to be sacrifice because the bill do not in respect to wool and woolen and in some few other matter meet our expectation i do not hesitate to repeat that i think it would have be an unwise sacrifice of the business interest of the country it would have be an unwise sacrifice of the solidarity efficiency and promise perform power of the party to have project into the next session another long discussion of the tariff and to have delay or probably defeat the legislation need in the improvement of our interstate commerce regulation and in make more efficient our antitrust law and the prosecution under it such legislation be need to clinch the roosevelt policy by which corporation and those in control of they shall be limit to a lawful path and shall be prevent from return to those abuse which a recurrence of prosperity be too apt to bring about unless definite positive step of a legislative character be take to mark the line of honest and lawful corporate management now there be another provision in the new tariff bill that i regard as of the utmost importance it be a provision which appropriate $ 75,000 for the president to employ person to assist he in the execution of the maximum and minimum tariff clause and in the administration of the tariff law under that authority i conceive that the president have the right to appoint a board as i have appoint it who shall associate with themselves and have under their control a number of expert who shall address themselves first to the operation of foreign tariff upon the export of the united states and then to the operation of the united states tariff upon import and export there be provision in the general tariff procedure for the ascertainment of the cost of production of article abroad and the cost of production of article here i intend to direct the board in the course of these duty and in carry they out in order to assist i in the administration of the law to make what might be call a glossary of the tariff or a small encyclopedia of the tariff or something to be compare to the united states pharmacopoeia with reference to information as to drug and medicine i conceive that such a board may very properly in the course of their duty take up separately all the item of the tariff both those on the free list and those which be dutiable describe what they be where they be manufacture what their use be the method of manufacture the cost of production abroad and here and every other fact with respect to each item which would enable the executive to understand the operation of the tariff the value of the article and the amount of duty impose and all those detail which the student of every tariff law find it so difficult to discover i do not intend unless compel or direct by congress to publish the result of these investigation but to treat they merely as incidental fact bring out officially from time to time and as they may be ascertain and put on record in the department there to be use when they have all be accumulate and be sufficiently complete to justify executive recommendation base on they now i think it be utterly useless as i think it would be greatly distress to business to talk of another revision of the tariff during the present congress i should think that it would certainly take the rest of this administration to accumulate the datum upon which a new and proper revision of the tariff might be have by that time the whole republican party can express itself again in respect to the matter and bring to bear upon its representatives in congress that sort of public opinion which shall result in solid party action i be glad to see that a number of those who think it their duty to vote against the bill insist that they be still republicans and intend to carry on their battle in favor of low duty and a low revision within the line of the party that be their right and in their view of thing be their duty it be vastly well that they should seek action of the party than that they should break off from it and seek to organize another party which would probably not result in accomplish anything more than merely defeat our party and invite in the oppose party which do not believe or say that it do not believe in protection i think that we ought to give the present bill a chance after it have be operate for two or three year we can tell much more accurately than we can to day its effect upon the industry of the country and the necessity for any amendment in its provision i have try to state as strongly as i can but not more strongly than i think the fact justify the importance of not disturb the business interest of this country by an attempt in this congress or the next to make a new revision but meantime i intend so far as in i lie to secure official datum upon the operation of the tariff from which when a new revision be attempt exact fact can be secure i have appoint a tariff board that have no brief for either side in respect to what the rate shall be i hope they will make their observation and note their datum in their record with exactly the same impartiality and freedom from anxiety as to result with which the weather bureau record the action of the element or any scientific bureau of the government record the result of its impartial investigation certainly the experience in this tariff justify the statement that no revision should hereafter be attempt in which more satisfactory evidence of an impartial character be not secure i be sorry that i be not able to go into further detail with respect to the tariff bill but i have neither the information nor the time in which to do it i have simply state the case as it seem to mr. tawney in his vote and as it seem to i in my sign the bill

the invitation under the reservation above state and under the further reservation that all interest in those island already vest should be protect and that there should be equality of opportunity for the future it be far point out that membership in the conference on the part of the united states be qualified by the consideration that this government would not become a signatory to any conventional arrangement conclude by the european member of the conference which would imply contributory participation by the united states in any obligation or responsibility for the enforcement of any scheme of administration which might be devise by the conference for the island the near east his majesty mehmed v sultan of turkey recently send to this country a special embassy to announce his accession the quick transition of the government of the ottoman empire from one of retrograde tendency to a constitutional government with a parliament and with progressive modern policy of reform and public improvement be one of the important phenomena of our time constitutional government seem also to have make further advance in persia these event have turn the eye of the world upon the near east in that quarter the prestige of the united states have spread widely through the peaceful influence of american school university and missionary there be every reason why we should obtain a great share of the commerce of the near east since the condition be more favorable now than ever before latin america one of the happy event in recent pan american diplomacy be the pacific independent settlement by the government of bolivia and peru of a boundary difference between they which for some week threaten to cause war and even to entrain embitterment affect other republic less directly concern from various quarter directly or indirectly concern the intermediation of the united states be seek to assist in a solution of the controversy desire at all time to abstain from any undue mingling in the affair of sister republic and have faith in the ability of the governments of peru and bolivia themselves to settle their difference in a manner satisfactory to themselves which view with magnanimity would assuage all embitterment this government steadily abstain from be draw into the controversy and be much gratified to find its confidence justify by event on the 9th of july next there will open at buenos aires the fourth pan american conference this conference will have a special meaning to the heart of all americans because around its date be cluster the anniversary of the independence of so many of the american republic it be not necessary for i to remind the congress of the political social and commercial importance of these gathering you be ask to make liberal appropriation for our participation if this be grant it be my purpose to appoint a distinguished and representative delegation qualified fittingly to represent this country and to deal with the problem of intercontinental interest which will there be discuss the argentine republic will also hold from may to november 1910 at buenos aires a great international agricultural exhibition in which the united states have be invite to participate consider the rapid growth of the trade of the united states with the argentine republic and the cordial relation exist between the two nation together with the fact that it provide an opportunity to show deference to a sister republic on the occasion of the celebration of its national independence the proper department of this government be take step to apprise the interest concern of the opportunity afford by this exhibition in which appropriate participation by this country be so desirable the designation of an official representative be also receive consideration to day more than ever before american capital be seek investment in foreign country and american product be more and more generally seek foreign market as a consequence in all country there be american citizen and american interest to be protect on occasion by their government these movement of man of capital and of commodity bring people and government close together and so form bond of peace and mutual dependency as they must also naturally sometimes make passing point of friction the resultant situation inevitably impose upon this government vastly increase responsibility this administration through the department of state and the foreign service be lend all proper support to legitimate and beneficial american enterprise in foreign country the degree of such support be measure by the national advantage to be expect a citizen himself can not by contract or otherwise divest himself of the right nor can this government escape the obligation of his protection in his personal and property right when these be unjustly infringe in a foreign country to avoid ceaseless vexation it be proper that in consider whether american enterprise should be encourage or support in a particular country the government should give full weight not only to the national as oppose to the individual benefit to accrue but also to the fact whether or not the government of the country in question be in its administration and in its diplomacy faithful to the principle of moderation equity and justice upon which alone depend international credit in diplomacy as well as in finance the pan american policy of this government have long be fix in its principle and remain unchanged with the change circumstance of the united states and of the republics to the south of we most of which have great natural resource stable government and progressive ideal the apprehension which give rise to the monroe doctrine may be say to have nearly disappear and neither the doctrine as it exist nor any other doctrine of american policy should be permit to operate for the perpetuation of irresponsible government the escape of just obligation or the insidious allegation of dominating ambition on the part of the united states beside the fundamental doctrine of our pan american policy there have grow up a realization of political interest community of institution and ideal and a flourish commerce all these bond will be greatly strengthen as time go on and increase facility such as the great bank soon to be establish in latin america supply the mean for build up the colossal intercontinental commerce of the future my meeting with president diaz and the greeting exchange on both american and mexican soil serve i hope to signalize the close and cordial relation which so well bind together this republic and the great republic immediately to the south between which there be so vast a network of material interest i be happy to say that all but one of the case which for so long vex our relation with venezuela have be settle within the past few month and that under the enlightened regime now direct the government of venezuela provision have be make for arbitration of the remain case before the hague tribunal on july 30 1909 the government of panama agree after considerable negotiation to indemnify the relative of the american officer and sailor who be brutally treat one of they have indeed be kill by the panaman police this year the sincere desire of the government of panama to do away with a situation where such an accident could occur be manifest in the recent request in compliance with which this government have lend the service of an officer of the army to be employ by the government of panama as instructor of police the sanitary improvement and public work undertake in cuba prior to the present administration of that government in the success of which the united states be interested under the treaty be report to be make good progress and since the congress provide for the continuance of the reciprocal commercial arrangement between cuba and the united states assurance have be receive that no negotiation injuriously affect the situation will be undertake without consultation the collection of the custom of the dominican republic through the general receiver of custom appoint by the president of the united states in accordance with the convention of february 8 1907 have proceed in an uneventful and satisfactory manner the custom receipt have decrease owe to disturb political and economic condition and to a very natural curtailment of import in view of the anticipated revision of the dominican tariff schedule the payment to the fiscal agency fund for the service of the bond debt of the republic as provide by the convention have be regularly and promptly make and satisfactory progress have be make in carry out the provision of the convention look towards the completion of the adjustment of the debt and the acquirement by the dominican government of certain concession and monopoly which have be a burden to the commerce of the country in short the receivership have demonstrate its ability even under unfavorable economic and political condition to do the work for which it be intend this government be oblige to intervene diplomatically to bring about arbitration or settlement of the claim of the emery company against nicaragua which it have long before be agree should be arbitrate a settlement of this troublesome case be reach by the signature of a protocol on september 18 1909.many year ago diplomatic intervention become necessary to the protection of the interest in the american claim of alsop and company against the government of chile the government of chile have frequently admit obligation in the case and have promise this government to settle there have be two abortive attempt to do so through arbitral commission which fail through lack of jurisdiction now happily as the result of the recent diplomatic negotiation the government of the united states and of chile actuate by the sincere desire to free from any strain those cordial and friendly relation upon which both set such store have agree by a protocol to submit the controversy to definitive settlement by his britannic majesty edward vii.since the washington conventions of 1907 be communicate to the government of the united states as a consulting and advise party this government have be almost continuously call upon by one or another and in turn by all the five central american republics to exert itself for the maintenance of the conventions nearly every complaint have be against the zelaya government of nicaragua which have keep central america in constant tension or turmoil the response make to the representation of central american republics as due from the united states on account of its relation to the washington conventions have be at all time conservative and have avoid so far as possible any semblance of interference although it be very apparent that the consideration of geographic proximity to the canal zone and of the very substantial american interest in central america give to the united states a special position in the zone of these republics and the caribbean sea i need not rehearse here the patient effort of this government to promote peace and welfare among these republic effort which be fully appreciate by the majority of they who be loyal to their true interest it would be no less unnecessary to rehearse here the sad tale of unspeakable barbarity and oppression allege to have be commit by the zelaya government recently two americans be put to death by order of president zelaya himself they be report to have be regularly commission officer in the organize force of a revolution which have continue many week and be in control of about half of the republic and as such accord to the modern enlightened practice of civilized nation they be entitle to be deal with as prisoner of war at the date when this message be print this government have terminate diplomatic relation with the zelaya government for reason make public in a communication to the former nicaraguan charge d'affaire and be intend to take such future step as may be find most consistent with its dignity its duty to american interest and its moral obligation to central america and to civilization it may later be necessary for i to bring this subject to the attention of the congress in a special message the international bureau of american republics have carry on an important and increase work during the last year in the exercise of its peculiar function as an international agency maintain by all the american republics for the development of pan american commerce and friendship it have accomplish a great practical good which could be do in the same way by no individual department or bureau of one government and be therefore deserve of your liberal support the fact that it be about to enter a new building erect through the munificence of an american philanthropist and the contribution of all the american nation where both its efficiency of administration and expense of maintenance will naturally be much augmented far entitle it to special consideration the far east in the far east this government preserve unchanged its policy of support the principle of equality of opportunity and scrupulous respect for the integrity of the chinese empire to which policy be pledge the interested powers of both east and west by the treaty of 1903 china have undertake the abolition of likin with a moderate and proportionate raising of the custom tariff along with currency reform these reform be of manifest advantage to foreign commerce as well as to the interest of china this government be endeavor to facilitate these measure and the needful acquiescence of the treaty powers when it appear that chinese likin revenue be to be hypothecate to foreign banker in connection with a great railway project it be obvious that the government whose national hold this loan would have a certain direct interest in the question of the carrying out by china of the reform in question because this railroad loan represent a practical and real application of the open door policy through cooperation with china by interested powers as well as because of its relation to the reform refer to above the administration deem american participation to be of great national interest happily when it be as a matter of broad policy urgent that this opportunity should not be lose the indispensable instrumentality present itself when a group of american banker of international reputation and great resource agree at once to share in the loan upon precisely such term as this government should approve the chief of those term be that american railway material should be upon an exact equality with that of the other national join in the loan in the placing of order for this whole railroad system after month of negotiation the equal participation of americans seem at last assure it be gratify that americans will thus take their share in this extension of these great highway of trade and to believe that such activity will give a real impetus to our commerce and will prove a practical corollary to our historic policy in the far east the imperial chinese government in pursuance of its decision to devote fund from the portion of the indemnity remit by the united states to the sending of student to this country have already complete arrangement for carry out this purpose and a considerable body of student have arrive to take up their work in our school and university no one can doubt the happy effect that the association form by these representative young man will have when they return to take up their work in the progressive development of their country the result of the opium conference hold at shanghai last spring at the invitation of the united states have be lay before the government the report show that china be make remarkable progress and admirable effort toward the eradication of the opium evil and that the government concern have not allow their commercial interest to interfere with a helpful cooperation in this reform collateral investigation of the opium question in this country lead i to recommend that the manufacture sale and use of opium and its derivative in the united states should be so far as possible more rigorously control by legislation in one of the chinese japanese conventions of september 4 of this year there be a provision which cause considerable public apprehension in that upon its face it be believe in some quarter to seek to establish a monopoly of mining privilege along the south manchurian and antung mukden railroads and thus to exclude americans from a wide field of enterprise to take part in which they be by treaty with china entitle after a thorough examination of the conventions and of the several contextual document the secretary of state reach the conclusion that no such monopoly be intend or accomplish however in view of the widespread discussion of this question to confirm the view it have reach this government make inquiry of the imperial chinese and japanese government and receive from each official assurance that the provision have no purpose inconsistent with the policy of equality of opportunity to which the signatory in common with the united states be pledge our traditional relation with the japanese empire continue cordial as usual as the representative of japan his imperial highness prince kuni visit the hudson fulton celebration the recent visit of a delegation of prominent business man as guest of the chamber of commerce of the pacific slope whose representative have be so agreeably receive in japan will doubtless contribute to the grow trade across the pacific as well as to that mutual understanding which lead to mutual appreciation the arrangement of 1908 for a cooperative control of the coming of laborer to the united states have prove to work satisfactorily the matter of a revision of the exist treaty between the united states and japan which be terminable in 1912 be already receive the study of both country the department of state be consider the revision in whole or in part of the exist treaty with siam which be conclude in 1856 and be now in respect to many of its provision out of date the department of state i earnestly recommend to the favorable action of the congress the estimate submit by the department of state and most especially the legislation suggest in the secretary of state 's letter of this date whereby it will be possible to develop and make permanent the reorganization of the department upon modern line in a manner to make it a thoroughly efficient instrument in the furtherance of our foreign trade and of american interest abroad the plan to have divisions of latin american and far eastern affairs and to institute a certain specialization in business with europe and the near east will at once commend itself these politico geographical division and the detail from the diplomatic or consular service to the department of a number of man who bring to the study of complicated problem in different part of the world practical knowledge recently gain on the spot clearly be of the great advantage to the secretary of state in foresee condition likely to arise and in conduct the great variety of correspondence and negotiation it should be remember that such facility exist in the foreign office of all the lead commercial nation and that to deny they to the secretary of state would be to place this government at a great disadvantage in the rivalry of commercial competition the consular service have be greatly improve under the law of april 5 1906 and the executive order of june 27 1906 and i commend to your consideration the question of embody in a statute the principle of the present executive order upon which the efficiency of our consular service be wholly dependent in modern time political and commercial interest be interrelate and in the negotiation of commercial treaty convention and tariff agreement the keeping open of opportunity and the proper support of american enterprise our diplomatic service be quite as important as the consular service to the business interest of the country impressed with this idea and convince that selection after rigorous examination promotion for merit solely and the experience only to be gain through the continuity of an organized service be indispensable to a high degree of efficiency in the diplomatic service i have sign an executive order as the first step toward this very desirable result its effect should be to place all secretary in the diplomatic service in much the same position as consular officer be now place and to tend to the promotion of the most efficient to the grade of minister generally leave for outside appointment such post of the grade of ambassador or minister as it may be expedient to fill from without the service it be propose also to continue the practice institute last summer of give to all newly appoint secretary at least one month 's thorough training in the department of state before they proceed to their post this have be do for some time in regard to the consular service with excellent result under a provision of the act of august 5 1909 i have appoint three official to assist the officer of the government in collect information necessary to a wise administration of the tariff act of august 5 1909 as to question of custom administration they be cooperate with the official of the treasury department and as to matter of the need and the exigency of our manufacturer and exporter with the department of commerce and labor in its relation to the domestic aspect of the subject of foreign commerce in the study of foreign tariff treatment they will assist the bureau of trade relations of the department of state it be hope thus to coordinate and bring to bear upon this most important subject all the agency of the government which can contribute anything to its efficient handling as a consequence of section 2 of the tariff act of august 5 1909 it become the duty of the secretary of state to conduct as diplomatic business all the negotiation necessary to place he in a position to advise i as to whether or not a particular country unduly discriminate against the united states in the sense of the statute refer to the great scope and complexity of this work as well as the obligation to lend all proper aid to our expand commerce be meet by the expansion of the bureau of trade relations as set forth in the estimate for the department of state other department i have thus in some detail describe the important transaction of the state department since the beginning of this administration for the reason that there be no provision either by statute or custom for a formal report by the secretary of state to the president or to congress and a presidential message be the only mean by which the condition of our foreign relation be bring to the attention of congress and the public in deal with the affair of the other departments the head of which all submit annual report i shall touch only those matter that seem to i to call for special mention on my part without minimize in any way the recommendation make by they for legislation affect their respective department in all of which i wish to express my general concurrence government expenditures and revenues perhaps the most important question present to this administration be that of economy in expenditure and sufficiency of revenue the deficit of the last fiscal year and the certain deficit of the current year prompt congress to throw a great responsibility on the executive and the secretary of the treasury than have heretofore be declare by statute this declaration impose upon the secretary of the treasury the duty of assemble all the estimate of the executive departments bureau and office of the expenditure necessary in the ensue fiscal year and of make an estimate of the revenue of the government for the same period and if a probable deficit be thus show it be make the duty of the president to recommend the method by which such deficit can be meet the report of the secretary show that the ordinary expenditure for the current fiscal year end june 30 1910 will exceed the estimate receipt by $ 34,075,620 if to this deficit be add the sum to be disburse for the panama canal amount to $ 38,000,000 and $ 1,000,000 to be pay on the public debt the deficit of ordinary receipt and expenditure will be increase to a total deficit of $ 73,075,620 this deficit the secretary propose to meet by the proceed of bond issue to pay the cost of construct the panama canal i approve this proposal the policy of pay for the construction of the panama canal not out of current revenue but by bond issue be adopt in the spooner act of 1902 and there seem to be no good reason for depart from the principle by which a part at least of the burden of the cost of the canal shall fall upon our posterity who be to enjoy it and there be all the more reason for this view because the actual cost to date of the canal which be now half do and which will be complete january 1 1915 show that the cost of engineering and construction will be $ 297,766,000 instead of $ 139,705,200 as originally estimate in addition to engineering and construction the other expense include sanitation and government and the amount pay for the property the franchise and the privilege of build the canal increase the cost by $ 75,435,000 to a total of $ 375,201,000 the increase in the cost of engineering and construction be due to a substantial enlargement of the plan of construction by widen the canal 100 foot in the culebra cut and by increase the dimension of the lock to the underestimate of the quantity of the work to be do under the original plan and to an underestimate of the cost of labor and material both of which have greatly enhance in price since the original estimate be make in order to avoid a deficit for the ensue fiscal year i direct the head of departments in the preparation of their estimate to make they as low as possible consistent with imperative governmental necessity the result have be as i be advise by the secretary of the treasury that the estimate for the expense of the government for the next fiscal year end june 30 1911 be less than the appropriation for this current fiscal year by $ 42,818,000 so far as the secretary of the treasury be able to form a judgment as to future income and compare it with the expenditure for the next fiscal year end june 30 1911 and exclude payment on account of the panama canal which will doubtless be take up by bond there will be a surplus of $ 35,931,000.in the present estimate the need of the departments and of the government have be cut to the quick so to speak and any assumption on the part of congress so often make in time past that the estimate have be prepare with the expectation that they may be reduce will result in seriously hamper proper administration the secretary of the treasury point out what should be carefully note in respect to this reduction in governmental expense for the next fiscal year that the economy be of two kind first there be a saving in the permanent administration of the departments bureau and office of the government and second there be a present reduction in expense by a postponement of project and improvement that ultimately will have to be carry out but which be now delay with the hope that additional revenue in the future will permit their execution without produce a deficit it have be impossible in the preparation of estimate greatly to reduce the cost of permanent administration this can not be do without a thorough reorganization of bureau office and department for the purpose of secure information which may enable the executive and the legislative branch to unite in a plan for the permanent reduction of the cost of governmental administration the treasury department have institute an investigation by one of the most skilled expert accountant in the united states the result of his work in two or three bureau which if extend to the entire government must occupy two or more year have be to show much room for improvement and opportunity for substantial reduction in the cost and increase efficiency of administration the object of the investigation be to devise mean to increase the average efficiency of each employee there be great room for improvement toward this end not only by the reorganization of bureaus and department and in the avoidance of duplication but also in the treatment of the individual employee under the present system it constantly happen that two employee receive the same salary when the work of one be far more difficult and important and exact than that of the other superior ability be not reward or encourage as the classification be now entirely by salary an employee often rise to the high class while do the easy work for which alone he may be fit an investigation order by my predecessor result in the recommendation that the civil service he reclassify accord to the kind of work so that the work require most application and knowledge and ability shall receive most compensation i believe such a change would be fair to the whole force and would permanently improve the personnel of the service more than this every reform direct toward the improvement in the average efficiency of government employee must depend on the ability of the executive to eliminate from the government service those who be inefficient from any cause and as the degree of efficiency in all the departments be much lessen by the retention of old employee who have outlive their energy and usefulness it be indispensable to any proper system of economy that provision be make so that their separation from the service shall be easy and inevitable it be impossible to make such provision unless there be adopt a plan of civil pension most of the great industrial organization and many of the well conduct railway of this country be come to the conclusion that a system of pension for old employee and the substitution therefor of young and more energetic servant promote both economy and efficiency of administration i be aware that there be a strong feeling in both houses of congress and possibly in the country against the establishment of civil pension and that this have naturally grow out of the heavy burden of military pension which it have always be the policy of our government to assume but i be strongly convinced that no other practical solution of the difficulty present by the superannuation of civil servant can be find than that of a system of civil pension the business and expenditure of the government have expand enormously since the spanish war but as the revenue have increase in nearly the same proportion as the expenditure until recently the attention of the public and of those responsible for the government have not be fasten upon the question of reduce the cost of administration we can not in view of the advance price of living hope to save money by a reduction in the standard of salary pay indeed if any change be make in that regard an increase rather than a decrease will be necessary and the only mean of economy will be in reduce the number of employee and in obtain a great average of efficiency from those retain in the service close investigation and study need to make definite recommendation in this regard will consume at least two year i note with much satisfaction the organization in the senate of a committee on public expenditures charge with the duty of conduct such an investigation and i tender to that committee all the assistance which the executive branch of the government can possibly render frauds in the collection of customs i regret to refer to the fact of the discovery of extensive fraud in the collection of the custom revenue at new york city in which a number of the subordinate employee in the weighing and other department be directly concern and in which the beneficiary be the american sugar refining company and other the fraud consist in the payment of duty on underweight of sugar the government have recover from the american sugar refining company all that it be show to have be defraud of the sum be receive in full of the amount due which might have be recover by civil suit against the beneficiary of the fraud but there be an express reservation in the contract of settlement by which the settlement should not interfere with or prevent the criminal prosecution of everyone who be find to be subject to the same criminal prosecution be now proceed against a number of the government officer the treasury department and the department of justice be exert every effort to discover all the wrongdoer include the officer and employee of the company who may have be privy to the fraud it would seem to i that an investigation of the fraud by congress at present pende the probing by the treasury department and the department of justice as propose might by give immunity and otherwise prove an embarrassment in secure conviction of the guilty party maximum and minimum clause in tariff act two feature of the new tariff act call for special reference by virtue of the clause know as the maximum and minimum clause it be the duty of the executive to consider the law and practice of other country with reference to the importation into those country of the product and merchandise of the united states and if the executive find such law and practice not to be unduly discriminatory against the united states the minimum duty provide in the bill be to go into force unless the president make such a finding then the maximum duty provide in the bill that is an increase of twenty five per cent ad valorem over the minimum duty be to be in force fear have be express that this power conferred and duty impose on the executive be likely to lead to a tariff war i beg to express the hope and belief that no such result need be anticipate the discretion grant to the executive by the term unduly discriminatory be wide in order that the maximum duty shall be charge against the import from a country it be necessary that he shall find on the part of that country not only discrimination in its law or the practice under they against the trade of the united states but that the discrimination find shall be undue that be without good and fair reason i conceive that this power be repose in the president with the hope that the maximum duty might never be apply in any case but that the power to apply they would enable the president and the state department through friendly negotiation to secure the elimination from the law and the practice under they of any foreign country of that which be unduly discriminatory no one be seek a tariff war or a condition in which the spirit of retaliation shall be arouse use of the new tariff board the new tariff law enable i to appoint a tariff board to assist i in connection with the department of state in the administration of the minimum and maximum clause of the act and also to assist officer of the government in the administration of the entire law an examination of the law and an understanding of the nature of the fact which should be consider in discharge the function impose upon the executive show that i have the power to direct the tariff board to make a comprehensive glossary and encyclopedia of the term use and article embrace in the tariff law and to secure information as to the cost of production of such good in this country and the cost of their production in foreign country i have therefore appoint a tariff board consist of three member and have direct they to perform all the duty above describe this work will perhaps take two or three year and i ask from congress a continue annual appropriation equal to that already make for its prosecution i believe that the work of this board will be of prime utility and importance whenever congress shall deem it wise again to readjust the custom duty if the fact secure by the tariff board be of such a character as to show generally that the rate of duty impose by the present tariff law be excessive under the principle of protection as describe in the platform of the successful party at the late election i shall not hesitate to invite the attention of congress to this fact and to the necessity for action predicate thereon nothing however halt business and interfere with the course of prosperity so much as the threaten revision of the tariff and until the fact be at hand after careful and deliberate investigation upon which such revision can properly be undertake it seem to i unwise to attempt it the amount of misinformation that creep into argument pro and con in respect to tariff rate be such as to require the kind of investigation that i have direct the tariff board to make an investigation undertake by it wholly without respect to the effect which the fact may have in call for a readjustment of the rate of duty war department in the interest of immediate economy and because of the prospect of a deficit i have require a reduction in the estimate of the war department for the come fiscal year which bring the total estimate down to an amount forty five million less than the correspond estimate for last year this could only be accomplish by cut off new project and suspend for the period of one year all progress in military matter for the same reason i have direct that the army shall not be recruit up to its present authorized strength these measure can hardly be more than temporary to last until our revenue be in well condition and until the whole question of the expediency of adopt a definite military policy can be submit to congress for i be sure that the interest of the military establishment be seriously in need of careful consideration by congress the law regulate the organization of our armed force in the event of war need to be revise in order that the organization can be modify so as to produce a force which would be more consistently apportion throughout its numerous branch to explain the circumstance upon which this opinion be base would necessitate a lengthy discussion and i postpone it until the first convenient opportunity shall arise to send to congress a special message upon this subject the secretary of war call attention to a number of need change in the army in all of which i concur but the point upon which i place most emphasis be the need for an elimination bill provide a method by which the merit of officer shall have some effect upon their advancement and by which the advancement of all may be accelerate by the effective elimination of a definite proportion of the least efficient there be in every army and certainly in ours a number of officer who do not violate their duty in any such way as to give reason for a court martial or dismissal but who do not show such aptitude and skill and character for high command as to justify their remain in the active service to be promote provision should be make by which they may be retire on a certain proportion of their pay increase with their length of service at the time of retirement there be now a personnel law for the navy which itself need amendment and to which i shall make further reference such a law be need quite as much for the army the coast defense of the united states proper be generally all that could be desire and in some respect they be rather more elaborate than under present condition be need to stop an enemy 's fleet from enter the harbor defend there be however one place where additional defense be badly need and that be at the mouth of chesapeake bay where it be propose to make an artificial island for a fort which shall prevent an enemy 's fleet from enter this most important strategical base of operation on the whole atlantic and gulf coast i hope that appropriate legislation will be adopt to secure the construction of this defense the military and naval joint board have unanimously agree that it would be unwise to make the large expenditure which at one time be contemplate in the establishment of a naval base and station in the philippine islands and have express their judgment in which i fully concur in favor of make an extensive naval base at pearl harbor near honolulu and not in the philippines this do not dispense with the necessity for the comparatively small appropriation require to finish the proper coast defense in the philippines now under construction on the island of corregidor and elsewhere or to complete a suitable repair station and coal supply station at olongapo where be the float dock dewey i hope that this recommendation of the joint board will end the discussion as to the comparative merit of manila bay and olongapo as naval station and will lead to prompt measure for the proper equipment and defense of pearl harbor the navy the return of the battle ship fleet from its voyage around the world in more efficient condition than when it start be a noteworthy event of interest alike to our citizen and the naval authority of the world besides the beneficial and far reach effect on our personal and diplomatic relation in the country which the fleet visit the marked success of the ship in steam around the world in all weather on schedule time have increase respect for our navy and have add to our national prestige our enlisted personnel recruit from all section of the country be young and energetic and representative of the national spirit it be moreover owe to its intelligence capable of quick training into the modern man of warsman our officer be earnest and zealous in their profession but it be a regrettable fact that the high officer be old for the responsibility of the modern navy and the admiral do not arrive at flag rank young enough to obtain adequate training in their duty as flag officer this need for reform in the navy have be ably and earnestly present to congress by my predecessor and i also urgently recommend the subject for consideration early in the come session a comprehensive plan for the reorganization of the officer of all corp of the navy will be present to congress and i hope it will meet with action suit to its urgency owe to the necessity for economy in expenditure i have direct the curtailment of recommendation for naval appropriation so that they be thirty eight million less than the correspond estimate of last year and the request for new naval construction be limit to two first class battle ship and one repair vessel the use of a navy be for military purpose and there have be find need in the department of a military branch deal directly with the military use of the fleet the secretary of the navy have also feel the lack of responsible adviser to aid he in reach conclusion and decide important matter between coordinate branch of the department to secure these result he have inaugurate a tentative plan involve certain change in the organization of the navy department include the navy yard all of which have be find by the attorney general to be in accordance with law i have approve the execution of the plan propose because of the great efficiency and economy it promise the generosity of congress have provide in the present naval observatory the most magnificent and expensive astronomical establishment in the world it be be use for certain naval purpose which might easily and adequately be subserve by a small division connect with the naval department at only a fraction of the cost of the present naval observatory the official board of visitors establish by congress and appoint in 1901 express its conclusion that the official head of the observatory should be an eminent astronomer appoint by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate hold his place by a tenure at least as permanent as that of the superintendent of the coast survey or the head of the geological survey and not merely by a detail of two or three year duration i fully concur in this judgment and urge a provision by law for the appointment of such a director it may not be necessary to take the observatory out of the navy department and put it into another department in which opportunity for scientific research afford by the observatory would seem to be more appropriate though i believe such a transfer in the long run be the good policy i be sure however i express the desire of the astronomer and those learn in the kindre science when i urge upon congress that the naval observatory be now dedicate to science under control of a man of science who can if need be render all the service to the navy department which this observatory now render and still furnish to the world the discovery in astronomy that a great astronomer use such a plant would be likely to make department of justice expedition in legal procedure the deplorable delay in the administration of civil and criminal law have receive the attention of committee of the american bar association and of many state bar associations as well as the consider thought of judge and jurist in my judgment a change in judicial procedure with a view to reduce its expense to private litigant in civil case and facilitate the dispatch of business and final decision in both civil and criminal case constitute the great need in our american institution i do not doubt for one moment that much of the lawless violence and cruelty exhibit in lynching be directly due to the uncertainty and injustice grow out of the delay in trial judgment and the execution thereof by our court of course these remark apply quite as well to the administration of justice in state court as to that in federal court and without make invidious distinction it be perhaps not too much to say that speak generally the defect be less in the federal court than in the state court but they be very great in the federal court the expedition with which business be dispose of both on the civil and the criminal side of english court under modern rule of procedure make the delay in our court seem archaic and barbarous the procedure in the federal court should furnish an example for the state court i presume it be impossible without an amendment to the constitution to unite under one form of action the proceeding at common law and proceeding in equity in the federal court but it be certainly not impossible by a statute to simplify and make short and direct the procedure both at law and in equity in those court it be not impossible to cut down still more than it be cut down the jurisdiction of the supreme court so as to confine it almost wholly to statutory and constitutional question under the present statute the equity and admiralty procedure in the federal court be under the control of the supreme court but in the pressure of business to which that court be subject it be impossible to hope that a radical and proper reform of the federal equity procedure can be bring about i therefore recommend legislation provide for the appointment by the president of a commission with authority to examine the law and equity procedure of the federal court of first instance the law of appeal from those court to the court of appeal and to the supreme court and the cost impose in such procedure upon the private litigant and upon the public treasury and make recommendation with a view to simplify and expedite the procedure as far as possible and make it as inexpensive as may be to the litigant of little mean injunction without notice the platform of the successful party in the last election contain the following:"the republican party will uphold at all time the authority and integrity of the court state and federal and will ever insist that their power to enforce their process and to protect life liberty and property shall be preserve inviolate we believe however that the rule of procedure in the federal court with respect to the issuance of the writ of injunction should be more accurately define by statute and that no injunction or temporary restraining order should be issue without notice except where irreparable injury would result from delay in which case a speedy hearing thereafter should be grant "i recommend that in compliance with the promise thus make appropriate legislation be adopt the end of justice will well be meet and the chief cause of complaint against ill consider injunction without notice will be remove by the enactment of a statute forbid hereafter the issuing of any injunction or restrain order whether temporary or permanent by any federal court without previous notice and a reasonable opportunity to he hear on behalf of the party to be enjoin unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court that the delay necessary to give such notice and hearing would result in irreparable injury to the complainant and unless also the court shall from the evidence make a write finding which shall be spread upon the court minute that immediate and irreparable injury be likely to ensue to the complainant and shall define the injury state why it be irreparable and shall also endorse on the order issue the date and the hour of the issuance of the order moreover every such injunction or restrain order issue without previous notice and opportunity by the defendant to be hear should by force of the statute expire and be of no effect after seven day from the issuance thereof or within any time less than that period which the court may fix unless within such seven day or such less period the injunction or order be extend or renew after previous notice and opportunity to be hear my judgment be that the passage of such an act which really embody the good practice in equity and be very like the rule now in force in some court will prevent the issuing of ill advise order of injunction without notice and will render such order when issue much less objectionable by the short time in which they may remain effective anti trust and interstate commerce law the jurisdiction of the general government over interstate commerce have lead to the passage of the so call sherman anti trust law and the interstate commerce law and its amendment the development in the operation of those law as show by indictment trial judicial decision and other source of information call for a discussion and some suggestion as to amendment these i prefer to embody in a special message instead of include they in the present communication and i shall avail myself of the first convenient opportunity to bring these subject to the attention of congress jail of the district of columbia my predecessor transmit to the congress a special message on january 11 1909 accompany the report of commissioners theretofore appoint to investigate the jail workhouse etc in the district of columbia in which he direct attention to the report as set forth vividly the really outrageous condition in the workhouse and jail "the congress have take action in pursuance of the recommendation of that report and of the president to the extent of appropriating fund and enact the necessary legislation for the establishment of a workhouse and reformatory no action however have be take by the congress with respect to the jail the condition of which be still antiquated and insanitary i earnestly recommend the passage of a sufficient appropriation to enable a thorough remodeling of that institution to be make without delay it be a reproach to the national government that almost under the shadow of the capitol dome prisoner should be confine in a building destitute of the ordinary decent appliance requisite to cleanliness and sanitary condition post office department second class mail matter the deficit every year in the post office department be largely cause by the low rate of postage of 1 cent a pound charge on second class mail matter which include not only newspaper but magazine and miscellaneous periodical the actual loss grow out of the transmission of this second class mail matter at 1 cent a pound amount to about $ 63,000,000 a year the average cost of the transportation of this matter be more than 9 cent a pound it appear that the average distance over which newspaper be deliver to their customer be 291 mile while the average haul of magazine be 1,049 and of miscellaneous periodical 1,128 mile thus the average haul of the magazine be three and one half time and that of the miscellaneous periodical nearly four time the haul of the daily newspaper yet all of they pay the same postage rate of 1 cent a pound the statistic of 1907 show that second class mail matter constitute 63.91 per cent of the weight of all the mail and yield only 5.19 per cent of the revenue the figure give be startling and show the payment by the government of an enormous subsidy to the newspaper magazine and periodical and congress may well consider whether radical step should not be take to reduce the deficit in the post office department cause by this discrepancy between the actual cost of transportation and the compensation exact therefor a great saving might be make amount to much more than half of the loss by impose upon magazine and periodical a high rate of postage they be much heavy than newspaper and contain a much high proportion of advertising to read matter and the average distance of their transportation be three and a half time as great the total deficit for the last fiscal year in the post office department amount to $ 17,500,000 the branch of its business which it do at a loss be the second class mail service in which the loss as already say be $ 63,000,000 and the free rural delivery in which the loss be $ 28,000,000 these loss be in part offset by the profit of the letter postage and other source of income it would seem wise to reduce the loss upon second class mail matter at least to the extent of prevent a deficit in the total operation of the post office i commend the whole subject to congress not unmindful of the spread of intelligence which a low charge for carry newspaper and periodical assist i very much doubt however the wisdom of a policy which constitute so large a subsidy and require additional taxation to meet it postal savings bank the second subject worthy of mention in the post office department be the real necessity and entire practicability of establish postal saving bank the successful party at the last election declare in favor of postal saving bank and although the proposition find opponent in many part of the country i be convinced that the people desire such bank and be sure that when the bank be furnish they will be productive of the utmost good the postal saving bank be not constitute for the purpose of create competition with other bank the rate of interest upon deposit to which they would be limited would be so small as to prevent their drawing deposit away from other bank i believe they to be necessary in order to offer a proper inducement to thrift and save to a great many people of small mean who do not now have banking facility and to whom such a system would offer an opportunity for the accumulation of capital they will furnish a satisfactory substitute base on sound principle and actual successful trial in nearly all the country of the world for the system of government guaranty of deposit now be adopt in several western states which with deference to those who advocate it seem to i to have in it the seed of demoralization to conservative banking and certain financial disaster the question of how the money deposit in postal saving bank shall be invest be not free from difficulty but i believe that a satisfactory provision for this purpose be insert as an amendment to the bill consider by the senate at its last session it have be propose to delay the consideration of legislation establish a postal saving bank until after the report of the monetary commission this report be likely to be delay and properly so cause of the necessity for careful deliberation and close investigation i do not see why the one should be tie up with the other it be understand that the monetary commission have look into the system of banking which now prevail abroad and have find that by a control there exercise in respect to reserve and the rate of exchange by some central authority panic be avoid it be not apparent that a system of postal saving bank would in any way interfere with a change to such a system here certainly in most of the country of europe where control be thus exercise by a central authority postal saving bank exist and be not think to be inconsistent with a proper financial and banking system ship subsidy follow the course of my distinguished predecessor i earnestly recommend to congress the consideration and passage of a ship subsidy bill look to the establishment of line between our atlantic seaboard and the eastern coast of south america as well as line from the west coast of the united states to south america china japan and the philippines the profit on foreign mail be perhaps a sufficient measure of the expenditure which might first be tentatively apply to this method of induce american capital to undertake the establishment of american line of steamship in those direction in which we now feel it most important that we should have mean of transportation control in the interest of the expansion of our trade a bill of this character have once pass the house and more than once pass the senate and i hope that at this session a bill frame on the same line and with the same purpose may become a law interior department new mexico and arizona the successful party in the last election in its national platform declare in favor of the admission as separate states of new mexico and arizona and i recommend that legislation appropriate to this end be adopt i urge however that care be exercise in the preparation of the legislation affect each territory to secure deliberation in the selection of person as member of the convention to draft a constitution for the incoming state and i earnestly advise that such constitution after adoption by the convention shall be submit to the people of the territory for their approval at an election in which the sole issue shall be the merit of the propose constitution and if the constitution be defeat by popular vote mean shall be provide in the enable act for a new convention and the drafting of a new constitution i think it vital that the issue as to the merit of the constitution should not be mix up with the selection of state officer and that no election of state officer should be have until after the constitution have be fully approve and finally settle upon alaska .with respect to the territory of alaska i recommend legislation which shall provide for the appointment by the president of a governor and also of an executive council the member of which shall during their term of office reside in the territory and which shall have legislative power sufficient to enable it to give to the territory local law adapt to its present growth i strongly deprecate legislation look to the election of a territorial legislature in that vast district the lack of permanence of residence of a large part of the present population and the small number of the people who either permanently or temporarily reside in the district as compare with its vast expanse and the variety of the interest that have to be subserve make it altogether unfit in my judgment to provide for a popular election of a legislative body the present system be not adequate and do not furnish the character of local control that ought to be there the only compromise it seem to i which may give need local legislation and secure a conservative government be the one i propose conservation of national resources in several department there be present the necessity for legislation look to the further conservation of our national resource and the subject be one of such importance as to require a more detailed and extended discussion than can be enter upon in this communication for that reason i shall take an early opportunity to send a special message to congress on the subject of the improvement of our waterway upon the reclamation and irrigation of arid semiarid and swamp land upon the preservation of our forest and the reforesting of suitable area upon the reclassification of the public domain with a view of separate from agricultural settlement mineral coal and phosphate land and site belong to the government border on stream suitable for the utilization of water power department of agriculture i commend to your careful consideration the report of the secretary of agriculture as show the immense sphere of usefulness which that department now fill and the wonderful addition to the wealth of the nation make by the farmer of this country in the crop of the current year department of commerce and labor the light house board the light house board now discharge its duty under the department of commerce and labor for upwards of forty year this board have be constitute of military and naval officer and two or three man of science with such an absence of a duly constitute executive head that it be marvelous what work have be accomplish in the period of construction the energy and enthusiasm of all the member prevent the inherent defect of the system from interfere greatly with the beneficial work of the board but now that the work be chiefly confine to maintenance and repair for which purpose the country be divide into sixteen district to which be assign an engineer officer of the army and an inspector of the navy each with a light house tender and the need plant for his work it have become apparent by the frequent friction that arise due to the absence of any central independent authority that there must be a complete reorganization of the board i concede the advantage of keep in the system the rigidity of discipline that the presence of naval and military officer in charge insure but unless the presence of such officer in the board can be make consistent with a responsible executive head that shall have proper authority i recommend the transfer of control over the light house to a suitable civilian bureau this be in accordance with the judgment of competent person who be familiar with the working of the present system i be confident that a reorganization can be effect which shall avoid the recurrence of friction between member instance of which have be officially bring to my attention and that by such reorganization great efficiency and a substantial reduction in the expense of operation can be bring about consolidation of bureaus i request congressional authority to enable the secretary of commerce and labor to unite the bureaus of manufactures and statistics this be recommend by a competent committee appoint in the previous administration for the purpose of suggest change in the interest of economy and efficiency and be request by the secretary the white slave trade i greatly regret to have to say that the investigation make in the bureau of immigration and other source of information lead to the view that there be urgent necessity for additional legislation and great executive activity to suppress the recruiting of the rank of prostitute from the stream of immigration into this country an evil which for want of a well name have be call the white slave trade i believe it to be constitutional to forbid under penalty the transportation of person for purpose of prostitution across national and state line and by appropriate a fund of $ 50,000 to be use by the secretary of commerce and labor for the employment of special inspector it will be possible to bring those responsible for this trade to indictment and conviction under a federal law bureau of health for a very considerable period a movement have be gather strength especially among the member of the medical profession in favor of a concentration of the instrument of the national government which have to do with the promotion of public health in the nature of thing the medical department of the army and the medical department of the navy must be keep separate but there seem to be no reason why all the other bureaus and office in the general government which have to do with the public health or subject akin thereto should not be unite in a bureau to be call the bureau of public health this would necessitate the transfer of the marine hospital service to such a bureau i be aware that there be wide field in respect to the public health commit to the states in which the federal government can not exercise jurisdiction but we have see in the agricultural department the expansion into widest usefulness of a department give attention to agriculture when that subject be plainly one over which the states properly exercise direct jurisdiction the opportunity offer for useful research and the spread of useful information in regard to the cultivation of the soil and the breeding of stock and the solution of many of the intricate problem in progressive agriculture have demonstrate the wisdom of establish that department similar reason of equal force can be give for the establishment of a bureau of health that shall not only exercise the police jurisdiction of the federal government respect quarantine but which shall also afford an opportunity for investigation and research by competent expert into question of health affect the whole country or important section thereof question which in the absence of federal governmental work be not likely to be promptly solve civil service commission the work of the united states civil service commission have be perform to the general satisfaction of the executive officer with whom the commission have be bring into official communication the volume of that work and its variety and extent have under new law such as the census act and new executive order greatly increase the activity of the commission require by the statute have reach to every portion of the public domain the accommodation of the commission be most inadequate for its need i call your attention to its request for increase in those accommodation as will appear from the annual report for this year political contribution i urgently recommend to congress that a law be pass require that candidate in election of member of the house of representatives and committee in charge of their candidacy and campaign file in a proper office of the united states government a statement of the contribution receive and of the expenditure incur in the campaign for such election and that similar legislation be enact in respect to all other election which be constitutionally within the control of congressfreedman 's savings and trust company recommendation have be make by my predecessor that congress appropriate a sufficient sum to pay the balance about 38 per cent.--of the amount due depositor in the freedman 's savings and trust company i renew this recommendation and advise also that a proper limitation be prescribe fix a period within which the claim may be present that assign claim be not recognize and that a limit be impose on the amount of fee collectible for service in present such claim semi centennial of negro freedom the year 1913 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the issuance of the emancipation proclamation grant freedom to the negro it seem fitting that this event should be properly celebrate already a movement have be start by prominent negro encourage by prominent white people and the press the south especially be manifest its interest in this movement it be suggest that a proper form of celebration would be an exposition to show the progress the negroes have make not only during their period of freedom but also from the time of their come to this country i heartily indorse this proposal and request that the executive be authorize to appoint a preliminary commission of not more than seven person to consider carefully whether or not it be wise to hold such an exposition and if so to outline a plan for the enterprise i far recommend that such preliminary commission serve without salary except as to their actual expense and that an appropriation be make to meet such expense conclusion .i have thus in a message compress as much as the subject will permit refer to many of the legislative need of the country with the exception already note speak generally the country be in a high state of prosperity there be every reason to believe that we be on the eve of a substantial business expansion and we have just garner a harvest unexampled in the market value of our agricultural product the high price which such product bring mean great prosperity for the farming community but on the other hand they mean a very considerably increase burden upon those class in the community whose yearly compensation do not expand with the improvement in business and the general prosperity various reason be give for the high price the proportionate increase in the output of gold which to day be the chief medium of exchange and be in some respect a measure of value furnish a substantial explanation of at least a part of the increase in price the increase in population and the more expensive mode of living of the people which have not be accompany by a proportionate increase in acreage production may furnish a further reason it be well to note that the increase in the cost of living be not confine to this country but prevail the world over and that those who would charge increase in price to the exist protective tariff must meet the fact that the rise in price have take place almost wholly in those product of the factory and farm in respect to which there have be either no increase in the tariff or in many instance a very considerable reduction
to the senate and house of representatives
 i withhold from my annual message a discussion of need legislation under the authority which congress have to regulate commerce between the states and with foreign country and say that i would bring this subject matter to your attention later in the session accordingly i beg to submit to you certain recommendation as to the amendment to the interstate commerce law and certain consideration arise out of the operation of the antitrust law suggest the wisdom of federal incorporation of industrial company
 interstate commerce law
 in the annual report of the interstate commerce commission for the year 1908 attention be call to the fact that between july 1 1908 and the close of that year sixteen suit have be begin to set aside order of the commission besides one commence before that date and that few order of much consequence have be permit to go without protest that the question present by these various suit be fundamental as the constitutionality of the act itself be in issue and the right of congress to delegate to any tribunal authority to establish an interstate rate be deny but that perhaps the most serious practical question raise concerned the extent of the right of the court to review the order of the commission and it be point out that if the contention of the carrier in this latter respect alone be sustain but little progress have be make in the hepburn act toward the effective regulation of interstate transportation charge in twelve of the case refer to it be state preliminary injunction be pray for be grant in six and refuse in six
 it have from the first be well understand say the commission that the success of the present act as a regulating measure depend largely upon the facility with which temporary injunction could be obtain if a railroad company by mere allegation in its bill of complaint support by ex parte affidavit can overturn the result of day of patient investigation no very satisfactory result can be expect the railroad lose nothing by these proceeding since if they fail it can only be require to establish the rate and to pay to shipper the difference between the high rate collect and the rate which be finally hold to be reasonable in point of fact it usually profit because it can seldom be require to return more than a fraction of the excess charge collect
 in its report for the year 1909 the commission show that of the seventeen case refer to in its 1908 report only one have be decide in the supreme court of the united states although five other case have be argue and submit to that tribunal in october 1909
 of course every carrier affect by an order of the commission have a constitutional right to appeal to a federal court to protect it from the enforcement of an order which it may show to be prima facie confiscatory or unjustly discriminatory in its effect and as this application may be make to a court in any district of the united states not only do delay result in the enforcement of the order but great uncertainty be cause by contrariety of decision the question present by these application be too often technical in their character and require a knowledge of the business and the mastery of a great volume of conflicting evidence which be tedious to examine and troublesome to comprehend it would not be proper to attempt to deprive any corporation of the right to the review by a court of any order or decree which if undisturbed would rob it of a reasonable return upon its investment or would subject it to burden which would unjustly discriminate against it and in favor of other carrier similarly situate what be however of supreme importance be that the decision of such question shall be as speedy as the nature of the circumstance will admit and that a uniformity of decision be secure so as to bring about an effective systematic and scientific enforcement of the commerce law rather than conflict decision and uncertainty of final result
 for this purpose i recommend the establishment of a court of the united states compose of five judge designate for such purpose from among the circuit judge of the united states to be know as the united states court of commerce which court shall be clothe with exclusive original jurisdiction over the following class of case
 1 all case for the enforcement otherwise than by adjudication and collection of a forfeiture or penalty or by infliction of criminal punishment of any order of the interstate commerce commission other than for the payment of money
 2 all case bring to enjoin set aside annul or suspend any order or requirement of the interstate commerce commission
 3 all such case as under section 3 of the act of february 19 1903 know as the elkins act be authorize to be maintain in a circuit court of the united states
 4 all such mandamus proceeding as under the provision of section 20 or section 23 of the interstate commerce law be authorize to be maintain in a circuit court of the united states
 reason precisely analogous to those which induce the congress to create the court of customs appeals by the provision in the tariff act of august 5 1909 may be urge in support of the creation of the commerce court
 in order to provide a sufficient number of judge to enable this court to be constitute it will be necessary to authorize the appointment of five additional circuit judge who for the purpose of appointment might be distribute to those circuit where there be at the present time the large volume of business such as the second third fourth seventh and eighth circuit the act should empower the chief justice at any time when the business of the court of commerce do not require the service of all the judge to reassign the judge designate to that court to the circuit to which they respectively belong and it should also provide for payment to such judge while sit by assignment in the court of commerce of such additional amount as be necessary to bring their annual compensation up to $ 10,000
 the regular session of such court should be hold at the capital but it should be empower to hold session in different part of the united states if find desirable and its order and judgment should be make final subject only to review by the supreme court of the united states with the provision that the operation of the decree appeal from shall not be stay unless the supreme court shall so order the commerce court should be empower in its discretion to restrain or suspend the operation of an order of the interstate commerce commission under review pende the final hearing and determination of the proceeding but no such restraining order should be make except upon notice and after hearing unless in case where irreparable damage would otherwise ensue to the petitioner a judge of that court might be empower to allow a stay of the commission&#39; order for a period of not more than sixty day but pende application to the court for its order or injunction then only where his order shall contain a specific finding base upon evidence submit to the judge make the order and identify by reference thereto that such irreparable damage would result to the petitioner specify the nature of the damage
 under the exist law the interstate commerce commission itself initiate and defend litigation in the court for the enforcement or in the defense of its order and decree and for this purpose it employ attorney who while subject to the control of the attorney general act upon the initiative and under the instruction of the commission this blending of administrative legislative and judicial function tend in my opinion to impair the efficiency of the commission by clothe it with partisan characteristic and rob it of the impartial judicial attitude it should occupy in pass upon question submit to it in my opinion all litigation affect the government should be under the direct control of the department of justice and i therefore recommend that all proceeding affect order and decree of the interstate commerce commission be bring by or against the united states eo nomine and be place in charge of an assistant attorney general act under the direction of the attorney general
 the subject of agreement between carrier with respect to rate have be often discuss in congress pool arrangement and agreement be condemn by the general sentiment of the people and under the sherman antitrust law any agreement between carrier operate in restraint of interstate or international trade or commerce would be unlawful the republican platform of 1908 express the belief that the interstate commerce law should be far amend so as to give the railroad the right to make and publish traffic agreement subject to the approval of the commission but maintain always the principle of competition between naturally compete line and avoid the common control of such line by any mean whatsoever in view of the complete control over rate making and other practice of interstate carrier establish by the act of congress and as recommend in this communication i see no reason why agreement between carrier subject to the act specify the classification of freight and the rate fare and charge for transportation of passenger and freight which they may agree to establish should not be permit provide copy of such agreement be promptly file with the commission but subject to all the provision of the interstate commerce act subject to the right of any party to such agreement to cancel it as to all or any of the agree rate fare charge or classification by thirty days&#39 notice in write to the other party and to the commission
 much complaint be make by shipper over the state of the law under which they be hold bind to know the legal rate applicable to any propose shipment without as a matter of fact have any certain mean of actually ascertain such rate it have be suggest that to meet this grievance carrier should be require upon application by a shipper to quote the legal rate in writing and that the shipper should be protect in act upon the rate thus quote but the objection to this suggestion be that it would afford a much too easy method of give to favor shipper unreasonable preference and rebate i think that the law should provide that a carrier upon write request by an intend shipper should quote in write the rate or charge applicable to the propose shipment under any schedule or tariff to which such carrier be a party and that if the party make such request shall suffer damage in consequence of either refusal or omission to quote the proper rate or in consequence of a misstatement of the rate the carrier shall be liable to a penalty in some reasonable amount say two hundred and fifty dollar to accrue to the united states and to be recover in a civil action bring by the appropriate district attorney such a penalty would compel the agent of the carrier to exercise due diligence in quote the applicable legal rate and would thus afford the shipper a real measure of protection while not open the way to collusion and the giving of rebate or other unfair discrimination
 under the exist law the commission can only act with respect to an alleged excessive rate or unduly discriminatory practice by a carrier on a complaint make by some individual affect thereby i see no reason why the commission should not be authorize to act on its own initiative as well as upon the complaint of an individual in investigate the fairness of any exist rate or practice and i recommend the amendment of the law to so provide and also that the commission shall be fully empower beyond any question to pass upon the classification of commodity for purpose of fix rate in like manner as it may now do with respect to the maximum rate applicable to any transportation
 under the exist law the commission may not investigate an increase in rate until after it shall have become effective and although one or more carrier may file with the commission a propose increase in rate or change in classification or other alteration of the exist rate or classification to become effective at the expiration of thirty day from such filing no proceeding can be take to investigate the reasonableness of such propose change until after it become operative on the other hand if the commission shall make an order find that an exist rate be excessive and direct it to be reduce the carrier affect may by proceeding in the court stay the operation of such order of reduction for month and even year it have therefore be suggest that the commission should be empower whenever a propose increase in rate be file at once to enter upon an investigation of the reasonableness of the increase and to make an order postpone the effective date of such increase until after such investigation shall be complete to this much objection have be make on the part of carrier they contend that this would be in effect to take from the owner of the railroad the management of their property and to clothe the interstate commerce commission with the original rate make power a policy which be much discuss at the time of the passage of the hepburn act in 1905 6 and which be then and have always be distinctly reject and in reply to the suggestion that they be able by resort to the court to stay the take effect of the order of the commission until its reasonableness shall have be investigate by the court whereas the people be deprive of any such remedy with respect to action by the carrier they point to the provision of the interstate commerce act provide for restitution to the shipper by carrier of excessive rate charge in case where the order of the commission reduce such rate be affirm it may be doubt how effective this remedy really be experience have show that many perhaps most shipper do not resort to proceeding to recover the excessive rate which they may have be require to pay for the simple reason that they have add the rate pay to the cost of the good and thus enhance the price thereof to their customer and that the public have in effect pay the bill on the other hand the enormous volume of transportation charge the great number of separate tariff file annually with the interstate commerce commission amount to almost 200,000 and the impossibility of any commission supervise the making of tariff in advance of their become effective on every transportation line within the united states to the extent that would be necessary if their active concurrence be require in the making of every tariff have satisfy i that this power if grant should be confer in a very limited and restricted form i therefore recommend that the interstate commerce commission be empower whenever any propose increase of rate be file at once either on complaint or of its own motion to enter upon an investigation into the reasonableness of such change and that it be far empower in its discretion to postpone the effective date of such propose increase for a period not exceed sixty day beyond the date when such rate would take effect if within this time it shall determine that such increase be unreasonable it may then by its order either forbid the increase at all or fix the maximum beyond which it shall not be make if on the other hand at the expiration of this time the commission shall not have complete its investigation then the rate shall take effect precisely as it would under the exist law and the commission may continue its investigation with such result as might be realize under the law as it now stand
 the claim be very earnestly advanced by some large association of shipper that shipper of freight should be empower to direct the route over which their shipment should pass to destination and in this connection it have be urge that the provision of section 15 of the interstate commerce act which now empower the commission after hear on complaint to establish through route and maximum joint rate to be charge etc when no reasonable or satisfactory through route shall have be already establish be amend so as to empower the commission to take such action even when one exist reasonable and satisfactory route already exist if it be possible to establish additional route this seem to i to be a reasonable provision i know of no reason why a shipper should not have the right to elect between two or more establish through route to which the initial carrier may be a party and to require his shipment to be transport to destination over such of such route as he may designate for that purpose subject however in the exercise of this right to such reasonable regulation as the interstate commerce commission may prescribe
 the republican platform of 1908 declare in favor of amend the interstate commerce law but so as always to maintain the principle of competition between naturally compete line and avoid the common control of such line by any mean whatsover one of the most potent mean of exercise such control have be through the holding of stock of one railroad company by another company own a compete line this condition have grow up under express legislative power confer by the law of many states and to attempt now to suddenly reverse that policy so far as it affect the ownership of stock heretofore so acquire would be to inflict a grievous injury not only upon the corporation affect but upon a large body of the investment hold public i however recommend that the law shall be amend so as to provide that from and after the date of its passage no railroad company subject to the interstate commerce act shall directly or indirectly acquire any interest of any kind in capital stock or purchase or lease any railroad of any other corporation which compete with it respect business to which the interstate commerce act apply but especially for the protection of the minority stockholder in securing to they the good market for their stock i recommend that such prohibition be couple with a proviso that it shall not operate to prevent any corporation which at the date of the passage of such act shall own not less than one half of the entire issue and outstanding capital stock of any other railroad company from acquire all or the remainder of such stock nor to prohibit any railroad company which at the date of the enactment of the law be operate a railroad of any other corporation under lease execute for a term of not less than twenty five year from acquire the reversionary ownership of the demise railroad but that such provision shall not operate to authorize or validate the acquisition through stock ownership or otherwise of a compete line or interest therein in violation of the antitrust or any other law
 the republican platform of 1908 far declare in favor of such national legislation and supervision as will prevent the future over issue of stock and bond by interstate carrier and in order to carry out its provision i recommend the enactment of a law provide that no railroad corporation subject to the interstate commerce act shall hereafter for any purpose connect with or relate to any part of its business govern by say act issue any capital stock without previous or simultaneous payment to it of not less than the par value of such stock or any bond or other obligation except note mature not more than one year from the date of their issue without the previous or simultaneous payment to such corporation of not less than the par value of such bond or other obligation or if issue at less than their par value then not without such payment of the reasonable market value of such bond or obligation as ascertain by the interstate commerce commission and that no property service or other thing than money shall be take in payment to such carrier corporation of the par or other require price of such stock bond or other obligation except at the fair value of such property service or other thing as ascertain by the commission and that such act shall also contain provision to prevent the abuse by the improvident or improper issue of note mature at a period not exceed twelve month from date in such manner as to commit the commission to the approval of a large amount of stock or bond in order to retire such note than should legitimately have be require
 such act should also provide for the approval by the interstate commerce commission of the amount of stock and bond to be issue by any railroad company subject to this act upon any reorganization pursuant to judicial sale or other legal proceeding in order to prevent the issue of stock and bond to an amount in excess of the fair value of the property which be the subject of such reorganization
 i believe these suggest modification in and amendment to the interstate commerce act would make it a complete and effective measure for secure reasonableness of rate and fairness of practice in the operation of interstate railroad line without undue preference to any individual or class over any other and would prevent the recurrence of many of the practice which have give rise in the past to so much public inconvenience and loss
 by my direction the attorney general have draft a bill to carry out these recommendation which will be furnish upon request to the appropriate committee whenever it may be desire
 in addition to the foregoing amendment of the interstate commerce law the interstate commerce commission should be give the power after a hearing to determine upon the uniform construction of those appliance such as sill step ladder roof hand hold running board and hand brake on freight car engage in interstate commerce use by the train man in the operation of train the defect and lack of uniformity in which be apt to produce accident and injury to railway train man the wonderful reform effect in the number of switchman and train man injure by couple accident due to the enforce introduction of safety coupler be a demonstration of what can be do if railroad be compel to adopt proper safety appliance
 the question have arise in the operation of the interstate commerce employer&#39;s liability act as to whether suit can be bring against the employer company in any place other than that of its home office the right to bring the suit under this act should be as easy of enforcement as the right of a private person not in the company&#39; employ to sue on an ordinary claim and process in such suit should be sufficiently serve if upon the station agent of the company upon whom service be authorize to be make to bind the company in ordinary action arise under state law bill for both the forego purpose have be consider by the house of representatives and have be pass and be now before the interstate commerce committee of the senate i earnestly urge that they be enact into law
 antitrust law and federal incorporation
 there have be a marked tendency in business in this country for forty year last past toward combination of capital and plant in manufacture sale and transportation the move cause have be several first it have render possible great economy second by a union of former competitor it have reduce the probability of excessive competition and third if the combination have be extensive enough and certain method in the treatment of competitor and customer have be adopt the combiner have secure a monopoly and complete control of price or rate
 a combination successful in achieve complete control over a particular line of manufacture have frequently be call a trust i presume that the derivation of the word be to be explain by the fact that a usual method of carry out the plan of the combination have be to put the capital and plant of various individual firm or corporation engage in the same business under the control of trustee
 the increase in the capital of a business for the purpose of reduce the cost of production and effecting economy in the management have become as essential in modern progress as the change from the hand tool to the machine when therefore we come to construe the object of congress in adopt the so call sherman anti trust act in 1890 whereby in the first section every contract combination in the form of a trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade or commerce be condemn as unlawful and make subject to indictment and restraint by injunction and whereby in the second section every monopoly or attempt to monopolize and every combination or conspiracy with other person to monopolize any part of interstate trade or commerce be denounce as illegal and make subject to similar punishment or restraint we must infer that the evil aim at be not the mere bigness of the enterprise but it be the aggregation of capital and plant with the express or imply intent to restrain interstate or foreign commerce or to monopolize it in whole or in part
 monopoly destroy competition utterly and restraint of the full and free operation of competition have a tendency to restrain commerce and trade a combination of person formerly engage in trade as partnership or corporation or otherwise of course eliminate the competition that exist between they but the incidental ending of that competition be not to be regard as necessarily a direct restraint of trade unless of such an all embrace character that the intention and effect to restrain trade be apparent from the circumstance or be expressly declare to be the object of the combination a mere incidental restraint of trade and competition be not within the inhibition of the act but it be where the combination or conspiracy or contract be inevitably and directly a substantial restraint of competition and so a restraint of trade that the statute be violate
 the second section of the act be a supplement to the first a direct restraint of trade such as be condemn in the first section if successful and use to suppress competition be one of the commonest method of secure a trade monopoly condemn in the second section
 it be possible for the owner of a business of manufacturing and sell useful article of merchandise so to conduct their business as not to violate the inhibition of the antitrust law and yet to secure to themselves the benefit of the economy of management and of production due to the concentration under one control of large capital and many plant if they use no other inducement than the constant low price of their product and its good quality to attract custom and their business be a profitable one they violate no law if their actual competitor be small in comparison with the total capital invest the prospect of new investment of capital by other in such a profitable business be sufficiently near and potential to restrain they in the price at which they sell their product but if they attempt by a use of their preponderate capital and by a sale of their good temporarily at unduly low price to drive out of business their competitor or if they attempt by exclusive contract with their patron and threat of nondeale except upon such contract or by other method of a similar character to use the largeness of their resource and the extent of their output compare with the total output as a means of compelling custom and frightening off competition then they disclose a purpose to restrain trade and to establish a monopoly and violate the act
 the object of the antitrust law be to suppress the abuse of business of the kind describe it be not to interfere with a great volume of capital which concentrate under one organization reduce the cost of production and make its profit thereby and take no advantage of its size by method akin to duress to stifle competition with it
 i wish to make this distinction as emphatic as possible because i conceive that nothing could happen more destructive to the prosperity of this country than the loss of that great economy in production which have be and will be effect in all manufacturing line by the employment of large capital under one management i do not mean to say that there be not a limit beyond which the economy of management by the enlargement of plant cease and where this happen and combination continue beyond this point the very fact show intent to monopolize and not to economize
 the original purpose of many combination of capital in this country be not confine to the legitimate and proper object of reduce the cost of production on the contrary the history of most trade will show at time a feverish desire to unite by purchase combination or otherwise all plant in the country engage in the manufacture of a particular line of good the idea be rife that thereby a monopoly could be effect and a control of price bring about which would inure to the profit of those engage in the combination the path of commerce be strew with failure of such combination their projector find that the union of all the plant do not prevent competition especially where proper economy have not be pursue in the purchase and in the conduct of the business after the aggregation be complete there be enough however of such successful combination to arouse the fear of good patriotic man as to the result of a continuance of this movement toward the concentration in the hand of a few of the absolute control of the price of all manufacture product
 the antitrust statute be pass in 1890 and prosecution be soon begin under it in the case of the united states v knight know as the sugar trust case because of the narrow scope of the pleading the combination seek to be enjoin be hold not to be include within the prohibition of the act because the averment do not go beyond the mere acquisition of manufacture plant for the refining of sugar and do not include that of a direct and intended restraint upon trade and commerce in the sale and delivery of sugar across state boundary and in foreign trade the result of the sugar trust case be not happy in that it give other company and combination seek a similar method of make profit by establish an absolute control and monopoly in a particular line of manufacture a sense of immunity against prosecution in the federal jurisdiction and where that jurisdiction be bar in respect to a business which be necessarily commensurate with the boundary of the country no state prosecution be able to supply the need machinery for adequate restraint or punishment
 follow the sugar trust decision however there have come along in the slow but certain course of judicial disposition case involve a construction of the antitrust statute and its application until now they seem to embrace every phase of that law which can be practically present to the american public and to the government for action they show that the antitrust act have a wide scope and apply to many combination in actual operation render they unlawful and subject to indictment and restraint
 the supreme court in several of its decision have decline to read into the statute the word unreasonable before restraint of trade on the ground that the statute apply to all restraint and do not intend to leave to the court the discretion to determine what be a reasonable restraint of trade the expression restraint of trade come from the common law and at common law there be certain covenant incidental to the carrying out of a main or principal contract which be say to be covenant in partial restraint of trade and be hold to be enforcible because reasonably adapt to the performance of the main or principal contract and under the general language use by the supreme court in several case it would seem that even such incidental covenant in restraint of interstate trade be within the inhibition of the statute and must be condemn in order to avoid such a result i have think and say that it might be well to amend the statute so as to exclude such covenant from its condemnation a close examination of the later decision of the court however show quite clearly in case present the exact question that such incidental restraint of trade be hold not to be within the law and be exclude by the general statement that to be within the statute the effect of the restraint upon the trade must be direct and not merely incidental or indirect the necessity therefore for an amendment of the statute so as to exclude these incidental and beneficial covenant in restraint of trade hold at common law to be reasonable do not exist
 in some of the opinion of the federal circuit judge there have be intimation have the effect if sound to weaken the force of the statute by include within it absurdly unimportant combination and arrangement and suggest therefore the wisdom of change its language by limit its application to serious combination with intent to restrain competition or control price a reading of the opinion of the supreme court however make the change unnecessary for they exclude from the operation of the act contract affect interstate trade in but a small and incidental way and apply the statute only to the real evil aim at by congress
 the statute have be on the statute book now for two decade and the supreme court in more than a dozen opinion have construe it in application to various phase of business combination and in reference to various subject matter it have apply it to the union under one control of two compete interstate railroad to joint traffic arrangement between several interstate railroad to private manufacturer engage in a plain attempt to control price and suppress competition in a part of the country include a dozen states and to many other combination affect interstate trade the value of a statute which be render more and more certain in its meaning by a series of decision of the supreme court furnish a strong reason for leave the act as it be to accomplish its useful purpose even though if it be be newly enact useful suggestion as to change of phrase might be make
 it be the duty and the purpose of the executive to direct an investigation by the department of justice through the grand jury or otherwise into the history organization and purpose of all the industrial company with respect to which there be any reasonable ground for suspicion that they have be organize for a purpose and be conduct business on a plan which be in violation of the antitrust law the work be a heavy one but it be not beyond the power of the department of justice if sufficient fund be furnish to carry on the investigation and to pay the counsel engage in the work but such an investigation and possible prosecution of corporation whose prosperity or destruction affect the comfort not only of stockholder but of million of wage earner employee and associate tradesman must necessarily tend to disturb the confidence of the business community to dry up the now flow source of capital from its place of hoarding and produce a halt in our present prosperity that will cause suffering and strained circumstance among the innocent many for the fault of the guilty few the question which i wish in this message to bring clearly to the consideration and discussion of congress be whether in order to avoid such a possible business danger something can not be do by which these business combination may be offer a mean without great financial disturbance of change the character organization and extent of their business into one within the line of the law under federal control and supervision secure compliance with the antitrust statute
 generally in the industrial combination call trust the principal business be the sale of good in many state and in foreign market in other word the interstate and foreign business far exceed the business do in any one state this fact will justify the federal government in grant a federal charter to such a combination to make and sell in interstate and foreign commerce the product of useful manufacture under such limitation as will secure a compliance with the antitrust law it be possible so to frame a statute that while it offer protection to a federal company against harmful vexatious and unnecessary invasion by the states it shall subject it to reasonable taxation and control by the states with respect to its purely local business
 many people conduct great business have cherish a hope and a belief that in some way or other a line may be draw between good trust and bad trust and that it be possible by amendment to the antitrust law to make a distinction under which good combination may be permit to organize suppress competition control price and do it all legally if only they do not abuse the power by take too great profit out of the business they point with force to certain notorious trust as having grow into power through criminal method by the use of illegal rebate and plain cheating and by various act utterly violative of business honesty or morality and urge the establishment of some legal line of separation by which criminal trust of this kind can be punish and they on the other hand be permit under the law to carry on their business now the public and especially the business public ought to rid themselves of the idea that such a distinction be practicable or can be introduce into the statute certainly under the present antitrust law no such distinction exist it have be propose however that the word reasonable should be make a part of the statute and then that it should be leave to the court to say what be a reasonable restraint of trade what be a reasonable suppression of competition what be a reasonable monopoly i venture to think that this be to put into the hand of the court a power impossible to exercise on any consistent principle which will insure the uniformity of decision essential to just judgment it be to thrust upon the court a burden that they have no precedent to enable they to carry and to give they a power approach the arbitrary the abuse of which might involve our whole judicial system in disaster
 in consider violation of the antitrust law we ought of course not to forget that that law make unlawful method of carry on business which before its passage be regard as evidence of business sagacity and success and that they be denounce in this act not because of their intrinsic immorality but because of the dangerous result toward which they tend the concentration of industrial power in the hand of the few lead to oppression and injustice in deal therefore with many of the man who have use the method condemn by the statute for the purpose of maintain a profitable business we may well facilitate a change by they in the method of do business and enable they to bring it back into the zone of lawfulness without lose to the country the economy of management by which in our domestic trade the cost of production have be materially lessen and in competition with foreign manufacturer our foreign trade have be greatly increase
 through all our consideration of this grave question however we must insist that the suppression of competition the controlling of price and the monopoly or attempt to monopolize in interstate commerce and business be not only unlawful but contrary to the public good and that they must be restrain and punish until end
 i therefore recommend the enactment by congress of a general law provide for the formation of corporation to engage in trade and commerce among the states and with foreign nation protect they from undue interference by the states and regulate their activity so as to prevent the recurrence under national auspex of those abuse which have arise under state control such a law should provide for the issue of stock of such corporation to an amount equal only to the cash pay in on the stock and if the stock be issue for property then at a fair valuation ascertain under approval and supervision of federal authority after a full and complete disclosure of all the fact pertain to the value of such property and the interest therein of the person to whom it be propose to issue stock in payment of such property it should subject the real and personal property only of such corporation to the same taxation as be impose by the states within which it may be situate upon other similar property locate therein and it should require such corporation to file full and complete report of their operation with the department of commerce and labor at regular interval corporation organize under this act should be prohibit from acquire and hold stock in other corporation except for special reason upon approval by the proper federal authority thus avoid the creation under national auspex of the hold company with subordinate corporation in different states which have be such an effective agency in the creation of the great trust and monopoly
 if the prohibition of the antitrust act against combination in restraint of trade be to be effectively enforce it be essential that the national government shall provide for the creation of national corporation to carry on a legitimate business throughout the united states the conflict law of the different states of the union with respect to foreign corporation make it difficult if not impossible for one corporation to comply with their requirement so as to carry on business in a number of different states
 to the suggestion that this proposal of federal incorporation for industrial combination be intend to furnish they a refuge in which to continue industrial abuse under federal protection it should be say that the measure contemplate do not repeal the sherman antitrust law and be not to be frame so as to permit the doing of the wrong which it be the purpose of that law to prevent but only to foster a continuance and advance of the high industrial efficiency without permit industrial abuse
 such a national incorporation law will be oppose first by those who believe that trust should be completely break up and their property destroy it will be oppose second by those who doubt the constitutionality of such federal incorporation and even if it be valid object to it as too great federal centralization it will be opposed third by those who will insist that a mere voluntary incorporation like this will not attract to its acceptance the bad of the offender against the antitrust statute and who will therefore propose instead of it a system of compulsory license for all federal corporation engage in interstate business
 let we consider these objection in their order the government be now try to dissolve some of these combination and it be not the intention of the government to desist in the least degree in its effort to end those combination which be to day monopolize the commerce of this country that where it appear that the acquisition and concentration of property go to the extent of create a monopoly or of substantially and directly restrain interstate commerce it be not the intention of the government to permit this monopoly to exist under federal incorporation or to transfer to the protect wing of the federal government a state corporation now violate the sherman act but it be not and should not be the policy of the government to prevent reasonable concentration of capital which be necessary to the economic development of manufacture trade and commerce this country have show a power of economical production that have astonish the world and have enable we to compete with foreign manufacture in many market it should be the care of the government to permit such concentration of capital while keep open the avenue of individual enterprise and the opportunity for a man or corporation with reasonable capital to engage in business if we would maintain our present business supremacy we should give to industrial concern an opportunity to reorganize and to concentrate their legitimate capital in a federal corporation and to carry on their large business within the line of the law
 second there be those who doubt the constitutionality of such federal incorporation the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce be certainly confer in the full measure upon congress and if for the purpose of securing in the most thorough manner that kind of regulation congress shall insist that it may provide and authorize certain agency to carry on that commerce it would seem to be within its power this have be distinctly affirm with respect to railroad company do an interstate business and interstate bridge the power of incorporation have be exercise by congress and uphold by the supreme court in this regard why then with respect to any other form of interstate commerce like the sale of good across state boundary and into foreign commerce may the same power not be assert indeed it be the very fact that they carry on interstate commerce that make these great industrial concern subject to federal prosecution and control how far as incidental to the carrying on of that commerce it may be within the power of the federal government to authorize the manufacture of good be perhaps more open to discussion though a recent decision of the supreme court would seem to answer that question in the affirmative
 even those who be willing to concede that the supreme court may sustain such federal incorporation be inclined to oppose it on the ground of its tendency to the enlargement of the federal power at the expense of the power of the states it be a sufficient answer to this argument to say that no other method can be suggest which offer federal protection on the one hand and close federal supervision on the other of these great organization that be in fact federal because they be as wide as the country and be entirely unlimited in their business by state line nor be the centralization of federal power under this act likely to be excessive only the large corporation would avail themselves of such a law because the burden of complete federal supervision and control that must certainly be impose to accomplish the purpose of the incorporation would not be accept by an ordinary business concern
 the third objection that the bad offender will not accept federal incorporation be easily answer the decree of injunction recently adopt in prosecution under the antitrust law be so thorough and sweeping that the corporation affect by they have but three course before they
 first they must resolve themselves into their component part in the different states with a consequent loss to themselves of capital and effective organization and to the country of concentrated energy and enterprise or
 second in defiance of law and under some secret trust they must attempt to continue their business in violation of the federal statute and thus incur the penalty of contempt and bring on an inevitable criminal prosecution of the individual name in the decree and their associate or
 third they must reorganize and accept in good faith the federal charter i suggest
 a federal compulsory license law urge as a substitute for a federal incorporation law be unnecessary except to reach that kind of corporation which by virtue of the consideration already advance will take advantage voluntarily of an incorporation law while the other state corporation do an interstate business do not need the supervision or the regulation of a federal license and would only be unnecessarily burden thereby
 the attorney general at my suggestion have draft a federal incorporation bill embody the view i have attempt to set forth and it will be at the disposition of the appropriate committee of congress

to the senate and house of representatives
 in my annual message i reserve the subject of the conservation of our national resource for discussion in a special message as follow
 in several department there be present the necessity for legislation look to the further conservation of our national resource and the subject be one of such importance as to require a more detailed and extended discussion than can be enter upon in this communication for that reason i shall take an early opportunity to send a special message to congress on the subject of the improvement of our waterway upon the reclamation and irrigation of arid semiarid and swamp land upon the preservation of our forest and the reforesting of suitable area upon the reclassification of the public domain with a view of separate from agricultural settlement mineral coal and phosphate land and site belong to the government border on stream suitable for the utilization of water power
 in 1860 we have a public domain of 1,055,911,288 acre we have now 731,354,081 acre confine largely to the mountain range and the arid and semiarid plain we have in addition 368,035,975 acre of land in alaska
 the public land be during the early administration treat as a national asset for the liquidation of the public debt and as a source of reward for our soldier and sailor later on they be donate in large amount in aid of the construction of wagon road and railway in order to open up region in the west then almost inaccessible all the principal land statute be enact more than a quarter of a century ago the homestead act the preemption and timber culture act the coal land and the mining act be among these the rapid disposition of the public land under the early statute and the lax method of distribution prevail due i think to the belief that these land should rapidly pass into private ownership give rise to the impression that the public domain be legitimate prey for the unscrupulous and that it be not contrary to good moral to circumvent the land law this prodigal manner of disposition result in the passing of large area of valuable land and many of our national resource into the hand of person who feel little or no responsibility for promote the national welfare through their development the truth be that title to million of acre of public land be fraudulently obtain and that the right to recover a large part of such land for the government long since cease by reason of statute of limitation
 there have develop in recent year a deep concern in the public mind respect the preservation and proper use of our national resource this have be particularly direct toward the conservation of the resource of the public domain the problem be how to save and how to utilize how to conserve and still develop for no sane person can contend that it be for the common good that nature&#39;s blessing be only for unborn generation
 among the most noteworthy reform initiate by my distinguished predecessor be the vigorous prosecution of land fraud and the bringing to public attention of the necessity for preserve the remain public domain from further spoliation for the maintenance and extension of our forest resource and for the enactment of law amend the obsolete statute so as to retain governmental control over that part of the public domain in which there be valuable deposit of coal of oil and of phosphate and in addition thereto to preserve control under condition favorable to the public of the land along the stream in which the fall of water can be make to generate power to be transmit in the form of electricity many mile to the point of its use know as water power site
 the investigation into violation of the public land law and the prosecution of land fraud have be vigorously continue under my administration as have be the withdrawal of coal land for classification and valuation and the temporary withholding of power site
 since march 4 1909 temporary withdrawal of power site have be make on 102 stream and these withdrawal therefore cover 229 per cent more stream than be cover by the withdrawal make prior to that date
 the present statute except so far as they dispose of the precious metal and the purely agricultural land be not adapt to carry out the modern view of the good disposition of public land to private ownership under condition offer on the one hand sufficient inducement to private capital to take they over for proper development with restrictive condition on the other which shall secure to the public that character of control which will prevent a monopoly or misuse of the land or their product the power of the secretary of the interior to withdraw from the operation of exist statute tract of land the disposition of which under such statute would be detrimental to the public interest be not clear or satisfactory this power have be exercise in the interest of the public with the hope that congress might affirm the action of the executive by law adapt to the new condition unfortunately congress have not thus far fully act on the recommendation of the executive and the question as to what the executive be to do be under the circumstance full of difficulty it seem to i that it be the duty of congress now by a statute to validate the withdrawal which have be make by the secretary of the interior and the president and to authorize the secretary of the interior temporarily to withdraw land pende submission to congress of recommendation as to legislation to meet condition or emergency as they arise
 one of the most pressing need in the matter of public land reform be that land should be classify accord to their principal value or use this ought to be do by that department whose force be well adapt to that work it should be do by the interior department through the geological survey much of the confusion fraud and contention which have exist in the past have arise from the lack of an official and determinative classification of the public land and their content
 it be now propose to dispose of agricultural land as such and at the same time to reserve for other disposition the treasure of coal oil asphaltum natural gas and phosphate contain therein this may be well accomplish by separate the right to mine from the title to the surface give the necessary use of so much of the latter as may be require for the extraction of the deposit the surface might be dispose of as agricultural land under the general agricultural statute while the coal or other mineral could be dispose of by lease on a royalty basis with provision require a certain amount of development each year and in order to prevent the use and cession of such land with other of similar character so as to constitute a monopoly forbid by law the lease should contain suitable provision subject to forfeiture the interest of person participate in such monopoly such law should apply to alaska as well as to the united states
 it be exceedingly difficult to frame a statute to retain government control over a property to be develop by private capital in such manner as to secure the governmental purpose and at the same time not to frighten away the investment of the necessary capital hence it may be necessary by law that be really only experimental to determine from their practical operation what be the good method of secure the result aim at
 the extent of the value of phosphate be hardly realize and with the need that there will be for it as the year roll on and the necessity for fertilize the land shall become more acute this will be a product which will probably attract the greed of monopolist
 with respect to the public land which lie along the stream offer opportunity to convert water power into transmissible electricity another important phase of the public land question be present there be valuable water power site through all the public land states the opinion be hold that the transfer of sovereignty from the federal government to the territorial government as they become states include the water power in the river except so far as that own by riparian proprietor i do not think it necessary to go into a discussion of this somewhat moot question of law it seem to i sufficient to say that the man who own and control the land along the stream from which the power be to be convert and transmit own land which be indispensable to the conversion and use of that power i can not conceive how the power in stream flow through public land can be make available at all except by use the land itself as the site for the construction of the plant by which the power be generate and convert and secure a right of way thereover for transmission line under these condition if the government own the adjacent land indeed if the government be the riparian owner it may control the use of the water power by impose proper condition on the disposition of land necessary in the creation and utilization of the water power
 the development in electrical appliance for the conversion of the water power into electricity to be transmit long distance have progress so far that it be no long problematical but it be a certain inference that in the future the power of the water fall in the stream to a large extent will take the place of natural fuel in the disposition of that domain already grant many water power site have come under absolute ownership and may drift into one ownership so that all the water power under private ownership shall be a monopoly if however the water power site now own by the government and there be enough of they shall be dispose of to private person for the investment of their capital in such a way as to prevent their union for purpose of monopoly with other waterpower site and under condition that shall limit the right of use to not exceed fifty year with proper mean for determine a reasonable graduate rental and with some equitable provision for fix term of renewal it would seem entirely possible to prevent the absorption of these most useful land by a power monopoly as long as the government retain control and can prevent their improper union with other plant competition must be maintain and price keep reasonable
 in consider the conservation of the natural resource of the country the feature that transcend all other include wood water mineral be the soil of the country it be incumbent upon the government to foster by all available mean the resource of the country that produce the food of the people to this end the conservation of the soil of the country should be care for with all mean at the government&#39;s disposal their productive power should have the attention of our scientist that we may conserve the new soil improve the old soil drain wet soil ditch swamp soil levee river overflow soil grow tree on thin soil pasture hillside soil rotate crop on all soil discover method for crop dry land soil find grass and legume for all soil feed grain and mill feed on the farm where they originate that the soil from which they come may be enrich
 a work of the utmost importance to inform and instruct the public on this chief branch of the conservation of our resource be be carry on successfully in the department of agriculture but it ought not to escape public attention that state action in addition to that of the department of agriculture as for instance in the drainage of swamp land be essential to the good treatment of the soil in the manner above indicate
 the act by which in semiarid part of the public domain the area of the homestead have be enlarge from 160 to 320 acre have result most beneficially in the extension of dry farming and in the demonstration which have be make of the possibility through a variation in the character and mode of culture of raise substantial crop without the presence of such a supply of water as heretofore have be think to be necessary for agriculture
 but there be million of acre of completely arid land in the public domain which by the establishment of reservoir for the storing of water and the irrigation of the land may be make much more fruitful and productive than the good land in a climate where the moisture come from the cloud congress recognize the importance of this method of artificial distribution of water on the arid land by the passage of the reclamation act the proceed of the public land create the fund to build the work need to store and furnish the necessary water and it be leave to the secretary of the interior to determine what project should be select among those suggest and to direct the reclamation service with the fund at hand and through the engineer in its employ to construct the work
 no one can visit the far west and the country of arid and semiarid land without be convince that this be one of the most important method of the conservation of our natural resource that the government have enter upon it would appear that over 30 project have be undertake and that a few of these be likely to be unsuccessful because of lack of water or for other reason but generally the work which have be do have be well do and many important engineering problem have be meet and solve
 one of the difficulty which have arise be that too many project in view of the available fund have be set on foot the fund available under the reclamation statute be inadequate to complete these project within a reasonable time and yet the project have be begin settler have be invite to take up and in many instance have take up the public land within the project rely upon their prompt completion the failure to complete the project for their benefit be in effect a breach of faith and leave they in a most distressed condition i urge that the nation ought to afford the mean to lift they out of the very desperate condition in which they now be this condition do not indicate any excessive waste or any corruption on the part of the reclamation service it only indicate an overzealous desire to extend the benefit of reclamation to as many acre and as many states as possible i recommend therefore that authority be give to issue not exceed $ 30,000,000 of bond from time to time as the secretary of the interior shall find it necessary the proceed to be apply to the completion of the project already begin and their proper extension and the bond run ten year or more to be take up by the proceed of return to the reclamation fund which return as the year go on will increase rapidly in amount
 there be no doubt at all that if these bond be to be allow to run ten year the proceed from the public land together with the rental for water furnish through the complete enterprise would quickly create a sink fund large enough to retire the bond within the time specify i hope that while the statute shall provide that these bond be to be pay out of the reclamation fund it will be draw in such a way as to secure interest at the low rate and that the credit of the united states will be pledge for their redemption
 i urge consideration of the recommendation of the secretary of the interior in his annual report for amendment of the reclamation act propose other relief for settler on these project
 respect the comparatively small timbere area on the public domain not include in national forest because of their isolation or their special value for agricultural or mineral purpose it be apparent from the evil result by virtue of the imperfection of exist law for the disposition of timber land that the act of june 3 1878 should be repeal and a law enact for the disposition of the timber at public sale the land after the removal of the timber to be subject to appropriation under the agricultural or mineral land law
 what i have say be really an epitome of the recommendation of the secretary of the interior in respect to the future conservation of the public domain in his present annual report he have give close attention to the problem of disposition of these land under such condition as to invite the private capital necessary to their development on the one hand and the maintenance of the restriction necessary to prevent monopoly and abuse from absolute ownership on the other these recommendation be incorporate in bill he have prepare and they be at the disposition of the congress i earnestly recommend that all the suggestion which he have make with respect to these land shall be embody in statute and especially that the withdrawal already make shall be validate so far as necessary and that the authority of the secretary of the interior to withdraw land for the purpose of submit recommendation as to future disposition of they where new legislation be need shall be make complete and unquestione
 the forest reserve of the united states some 190,000,000 acre in extent be under the control of the department of agriculture with authority adequate to preserve they and to extend their growth so far as that may be practicable the importance of the maintenance of our forest can not be exaggerated the possibility of a scientific treatment of forest so that they shall be make to yield a large return in timber without really reduce the supply have be demonstrate in other country and we should work toward the standard set by they as far as their method be applicable to our condition
 upwards of 400,000,000 acre of forest land in this country be in private ownership but only 3 per cent of it be be treat scientifically and with a view to the maintenance of the forest the part play by the forest in the equalization of the supply of water on watershed be a matter of discussion and dispute but the general benefit to be derive by the public from the extension of forest land on watershed and the promotion of the growth of tree in place that be now denude and that once have great flourishing forest go without say the control to be exercise over private owner in their treatment of the forest which they own be a matter for state and not national regulation because there be nothing in the constitution that authorize the federal government to exercise any control over forest within a state unless the forest be own in a proprietary way by the federal government
 it have be propose and a bill for the purpose pass the lower house in the last congress that the national government appropriate a certain amount each year out of the receipt from the forestry business of the government to institute reforestation at the source of certain navigable stream to be select by the geological survey with a view to determine the practicability of thus improve and protect the stream for federal purpose i think a moderate expenditure for each year for this purpose for a period of five or ten year would be of the utmost benefit in the development of our forestry system
 i come now to the improvement of the inland waterway he would be blind indeed who do not realize that the people of the entire west and especially those of the mississippi valley have be arouse to the need there be for the improvement of our inland waterway the mississippi river with the missouri on the one hand and the ohio on the other would seem to offer a great natural mean of interstate transportation and traffic how far if properly improve they would relieve the railroad or supplement they in respect to the bulky and cheap commodity be a matter of conjecture no enterprise ought to be undertake the cost of which be not definitely ascertain and the benefit and advantage of which be not know and assure by competent engineer and other authority when however a project of a definite character for the improvement of a waterway have be develop so that the plan have be draw the cost definitely estimate and the traffic which will be accommodate be reasonably probable i think it be the duty of congress to undertake the project and make provision therefor in the proper appropriation bill
 one of the project which answer the description i have give be that of introduce dam into the ohio river from pittsburg to cairo so as to maintain at all season of the year by slack water a depth of 9 foot upward of seven of these dam have already be construct and six be under construction while the total require be fifty four the remain cost be know to be $ 63,000,000
 it seem to i that in the development of our inland waterway it would be wise to begin with this particular project and carry it through as rapidly as may be i assume from reliable information that it can be construct economically in twelve year
 what have be say of the ohio river be true in a less complete way of the improvement of the upper mississippi from st. paul to st. louis to a constant depth of 6 foot and of the missouri from kansas city to st. louis to a constant depth of 6 foot and from st. louis to cairo to a depth of 8 foot these project have be pronounce practical by competent board of army engineer their cost have be estimate and there be business which will follow the improvement
 i recommend therefore that the present congress in the river and harbor bill make provision for continue contract to complete these improvement
 as these improvement be be make and the traffic encourage by they show itself of sufficient importance the improvement of the mississippi beyond cairo down to the gulf which be now go on with the maintenance of a depth of 9 foot everywhere may be change to another and great depth if the necessity for it shall appear to arise out of the traffic which can be deliver on the river at cairo
 i be inform that the investigation by the waterway commission in europe show that the existence of a waterway by no means assure traffic unless there be traffic adapt to water carriage at cheap rate at one end or the other of the stream it also appear in europe that the depth of the non tidal stream be rarely more than 6 foot and never more than 10 but it be certain that enormous quantity of merchandise be transport over the river and canal in germany and france and england and it be also certain that the existence of such method of traffic materially affect the rate which the railroad charge and it be the good regulator of those rate that we have not even except the governmental regulation through the interstate commerce commission for this reason i hope that this congress will take such step that it may be call the inaugurator of the new system of inland waterway
 for reason which it be not necessary here to state congress have see fit to order an investigation into the interior department and the forest service of the agricultural department the result of that investigation be not need to determine the value of and the necessity for the new legislation which i have recommend in respect to the public land and in respect to reclamation i earnestly urge that the measure recommend be take up and dispose of promptly without await the investigation which have be determine upon

to the senate and house of representatives during the past year the foreign relation of the united states have continue upon a basis of friendship and good understanding arbitration .the year have be notable as witness the pacific settlement of two important international controversy before the permanent court of the hague the arbitration of the fisheries dispute between the united states and

he should not receive any compensation the tribunal constitute at the hague by the government of the united states and venezuela have complete its deliberation and have render an award in the case of the orinoco steamship company against venezuela the award may be regard as satisfactory since it have pursuant to the contention of the united states recognize a number of important principle make for a judicial attitude in the determining of international dispute in view of grave doubt which have be raise as to the constitutionality of the hague convention for the establishment of an international prize court now before the senate for ratification because of that provision of the convention which provide that there may be an appeal to the propose court from the decision of national court this government propose in an identic circular note address to those powers who have take part in the london maritime conference that the power signatory to the convention if confront with such difficulty might insert a reservation to the effect that appeal to the international prize court in respect to decision of its national tribunal should take the form of a direct claim for compensation that the proceeding thereupon to be take should be in the form of a trial de novo and that judgment of the court should consist of compensation for the illegal capture irrespective of the decision of the national court whose judgment have thus be internationally involve as the result of an informal discussion it be decide to provide such procedure by mean of a separate protocol which should be ratify at the same time as the prize court convention itself accordingly the government of the netherlands at the request of this government propose under date of may 24 1910 to the power signatory to the hague convention the negotiation of a supplemental protocol embodying stipulation provide for this alternative procedure it be gratify to observe that this additional protocol be be sign without objection by the power signatory to the original convention and there be every reason to believe that the international prize court will be soon establish the identic circular note also propose that the international prize court when establish should be endow with the function of an arbitral court of justice under and pursuant to the recommendation adopt by the last hague conference the reply receive from the various power to this proposal inspire the hope that this also may be accomplish within the reasonably near future it be believe that the establishment of these two tribunal will go a

enlist in the rank of the revolutionist this and other offense make it the duty of the american government to take measure with a view to ultimate reparation and for the safeguarding of its interest this involve the breaking off of all diplomatic relation with the zelaya government for the reason lay down in a communication from the secretary of state which also notify the contend faction in nicaragua that this government would hold each to strict accountability for outrage on the right of american citizen american force be send to both coast of nicaragua to be in readiness should occasion arise to protect americans and their interest and remain there until the war be over and peace have return to that unfortunate country these event together with zelaya 's continued exaction bring he so clearly to the bar of public opinion that he be force to resign and to take refuge abroad in the above mention communication of the secretary of state to the charge d'affaires of the zelaya government the opinion be express that the revolution represent the wish of the majority of the nicaraguan people this have now be prove beyond doubt by the fact that since the complete

i exceedingly to announce that the argentine republic some month ago place with american manufacturer a contract for the construction of two battle ship and certain additional naval equipment the extent of this work and its importance to the argentine republic make the placing of the bid an earnest of friendly feeling toward the united states tariff negotiation the new tariff law in section 2 respect the maximum and minimum tariff of the united states which provision come into effect on april 1 1910 impose upon the president the responsibility of determine prior to that date whether or not any undue discrimination exist against the united states and its product in any country of the world with which we sustain commercial relation in the case of several country instance of apparent undue discrimination against american commerce be find to exist these discrimination be remove by negotiation prior to april 1 1910 when the maximum tariff be to come into operation with respect to importation from all those country in whose favor no proclamation apply the minimum tariff should be issue by the president one hundred and thirty four such proclamation be issue this series of proclamation embrace the entire commercial world and hence the minimum tariff of the united states have be give universal application thus testify to the satisfactory character of our trade relation with foreign country marked advantage to the commerce of the united states be obtain through these tariff settlement foreign nation be fully cognizant of the fact that under section 2 of the tariff act the president be require whenever he be satisfied that the treatment accord by they to the product of the united states be not such as to entitle they to the benefit of the minimum tariff of the united states to withdraw those benefit by proclamation give ninety day notice after which the maximum tariff will apply to their dutiable product enter the united states in its general operation this section of the tariff law have thus far prove a guaranty of continue commercial peace although there be unfortunately instance where foreign government deal arbitrarily with american interest within their jurisdiction in a manner injurious and inequitable the policy of broad and close trade relation with the dominion of canada which be initiate in the adjustment of the maximum and minimum provision of the tariff act of august 1909 have prove mutually beneficial it justify further effort for the readjustment of the commercial relation of the two country so that their commerce may follow the channel natural to contiguous country and be commensurate with the steady expansion of trade and industry on both side of the boundary line the reciprocation on the part of the dominion government of the sentiment which be express by this government be follow in october by the suggestion that it would be glad to have the negotiation which have be temporarily suspend during the summer resume in accordance with this suggestion the secretary of state by my direction dispatch two representative of the department of state as special commissioner to ottawa to confer with representative of the dominion government they be authorize to take such step for formulate a reciprocal trade agreement as might be necessary and to receive and consider any proposition which the dominion government might care to submit pursuant to the instruction issue conference be hold by these commissioner with official of the dominion government at ottawa in the early part of november the negotiation be conduct on both side in a spirit of mutual accommodation the discussion of the common commercial interest of the two country have for its object a satisfactory basis for a trade arrangement which offer the prospect of a free interchange for the product of the united states and of canada the conference be adjourn to be resume in washington in january when it be hope that the aspiration of both government for a mutually advantageous measure of reciprocity will be realize foster foreign trade all these tariff negotiation so vital to our commerce and industry and the duty of jealously guard the equitable and just treatment of our product capital and industry abroad devolve upon the department of state the argentine battle ship contract like the subsequent important one for argentine railway equipment and those for cuban government vessel be secure for our manufacturer largely through the good office of the department of state the effort of that department to secure for citizen of the united states equal opportunity in the market of the world and to expand american commerce have be most successful the volume of business obtain in new field of competition and upon new line be already very great and congress be urge to continue to support the department of state in its endeavor for further trade expansion our foreign trade merit the good support of the government and the most earnest endeavor of our manufacturer and merchant who if they do not already in all case need a foreign market be certain soon to become dependent on it therefore now be the time to secure a strong position in this field american branch bank abroad i can not leave this subject without emphasize the necessity of such legislation as will make possible and convenient the establishment of american bank and branch of american bank in foreign country only by such mean can our foreign trade be favorably finance necessary credit be arrange and proper avail be make of commercial opportunity in foreign country and most especially in latin america aid to our foreign merchant marine another instrumentality indispensable to the unhampered and natural development of american commerce be merchant marine all maritime and commercial nation recognize the importance of this factor the great commercial nation our competitor jealously foster their merchant marine perhaps nowhere be the need for rapid and direct mail passenger and freight communication quite so urgent as between the united states and latin america we can secure in no other quarter of the world such immediate benefit in friendship and commerce as would flow from the establishment of direct line of communication with the country of latin america adequate to meet the requirement of a rapidly increase appreciation of the reciprocal dependence of the country of the western hemisphere upon each other 's product sympathy and assistance i allude to this most important subject in my last annual message it have often be before you and i need not recapitulate the reason for its recommendation unless prompt action be take the completion of the panama canal will find this the only great commercial nation unable to avail in international maritime business of this great improvement in the mean of the world 's commercial intercourse quite aside from the commercial aspect unless we create a merchant marine where can we find the seafare population necessary as a natural naval reserve and where could we find in case of war the transport and subsidiary vessel without which a naval fleet be arm without a body for many reason i can not too strongly urge upon the congress the passage of a measure by mail subsidy or other subvention adequate to guarantee the establishment and rapid development of an american merchant marine and the restoration of the american flag to its ancient place upon the sea of course such aid ought only to be give under condition of publicity of each beneficiary 's business and account which would show that the aid receive be need to maintain the trade and be properly use for that purpose federal protection to aliens with our increase international intercourse it become incumbent upon i to repeat more emphatically than ever the recommendation which i make in my inaugural address that congress shall at once give to the courts of the united states jurisdiction to punish as a crime the violation of the right of alien secure by treaty with the united states in order that the general government of the united states shall be able when call upon by a friendly nation to redeem its solemn promise by treaty to secure to the citizen or subject of that nation resident in the united states freedom from violence and due process of law in respect to their life liberty and property merit system for diplomatic and consular service i also strongly commend to the favorable action of the congress the enactment of a law apply to the diplomatic and consular service the principle embody in section 1753 of the revised statutes of the united states in the civil service act of january 16 1883 and the executive orders of june 27 1906 and of november 26 1909 the excellent result which have attend the partial application of civil service principle to the diplomatic and consular service be an earnest of the benefit to be work by a wide and more permanent extension of those principle to both branch of the foreign service the marked improvement in the consular service during the four year since the principle of the civil service act be apply to that service in a limited way and the good result already noticeable from a similar application of civil service principle to the diplomatic service a year ago convince i that the enactment into law of the general principle of the exist executive regulation could not fail to effect further improvement of both branch of the foreign service offer as it would by its assurance of permanency of tenure and promotion on merit an inducement for the entry of capable young man into the service and an incentive to those already in to put forth their good effort to attain and maintain that degree of efficiency which the interest of our international relation and commerce demand government ownership of our embassy and legation premise during many year past appeal have be make from time to time to congress in favor of government ownership of embassy and legation premise abroad the argument in favor of such ownership have be many and oft repeat and be well known to the congress the acquisition by the government of suitable residence and office for its diplomatic officer especially in the capital of the latin american states and of europe be so important and necessary to an improved diplomatic service that i have no hesitation in urge upon the congress the passage of some measure similar to that favorably report by the house committee on foreign affairs on february 14 1910 report no 438 that would authorize the gradual and annual acquisition of premise for diplomatic use the work of the diplomatic service be devoid of partisanship its importance should appeal to every american citizen and should receive the generous consideration of the congress treasury department estimate for next year 's expense every effort have be make by each department chief to reduce the estimate cost of his department for the ensue fiscal year end june 30 1912 i say this in order that congress may understand that these estimate thus make present the small sum which will maintain the department bureau and office of the government and meet its other obligation under exist law and that a cut of these estimate would result in embarrass the executive branch of the government in the performance of its duty this remark do not apply to the river and harbor estimate except to those for expense of maintenance and the meeting of obligation under authorized contract nor do it apply to the public building bill nor to the navy building program of course as to these congress could withhold any part or all of the estimate for they without interfere with the discharge of the ordinary obligation of the government or the performance of the function of its department bureau and office a fifty two million cut the final estimate for the year end june 30 1912 as they have be send to the treasury on november 29 of this year for the ordinary expense of the government include those for public building river and harbor and the navy building program amount to $ 630,494,013.12 this be $ 52,964,887.36 less than the appropriation for the fiscal year end june 30 1911 it be $ 16,883,153.44 less than the total estimate include supplemental estimate submit to congress by the treasury for the year 1911 and be $ 5,574,659.39 less than the original estimate submit by the treasury for 1911.these figure do not include the appropriation for the panama canal the policy in respect to which ought to be and be to spend as much each year as can be economically and effectively expend in order to complete the canal as promptly as possible and therefore the ordinary motive for cut down the expense of the government do not apply to appropriation for this purpose it will be note that the estimate for the panama canal for the ensue year be more than fifty six million of dollar an increase of twenty million over the amount appropriate for this year a difference due to the fact that the estimate for 1912 include something over nineteen million for the fortification of the canal against the estimated expenditure of $ 630,494,013.12 the treasury have estimate receipt for next year $ 680,000,000 make a probable surplus of ordinary receipt over ordinary expenditure of about $ 50,000,000.a table show in detail the estimate and the comparison refer to follow typical economy the treasury department be one of the original department of the government with the change in the monetary system make from time to time and with the creation of national bank it be think necessary to organize new bureaus and division which be add in a somewhat haphazard way and result in a duplication of duty which might well now be end this lack of system and economic coordination have attract the attention of the head of that department who have be give his time for the last two year with the aid of expert and by consult his bureau chief to its reformation he have abolish four hundred place in the civil service without at all injure its efficiency merely to illustrate the character of the reform that be possible i shall comment on some of the specific change that be be make or ought to be make by legislative aid auditing system the auditing system in vogue be as old as the government and the method use be antiquate there be six auditor and seven assistant auditors for the nine department and under the present system the only function which the auditor of a department exercise be to determine on account present by disburse officer that the object of the expenditure be within the law and the appropriation make by congress for the purpose on its face and that the calculation in the account be correct he do not examine the merit of the transaction or determine the reasonableness of the price pay for the article purchase nor do he furnish any substantial check upon disbursing officer and the head of department or bureaus with sufficient promptness to enable the government to recoup itself in full measure for unlawful expenditure a careful plan be be devise and will be present to congress with the recommendation that the force of auditor and employee under they be greatly reduce thereby effect substantial economy but this economy will be small compare with the large economy that can be effect by consolidation and change of method the possibility in this regard have be show in the reduction of expense and the importance of method and efficiency in the office of the auditor for the post office department who without in the slight degree impair the comprehensiveness and efficiency of his work have cut down the expense of his office $ 120,000 a year statement of estimate of appropriation for the fiscal year 1912 and 1911 and of appropriation for 1911 show increase and decrease final estimate for 1912 as of november 29 original estimate submit by the treasury for 1911

especially the custom revenue a very great improvement have be effect and further improvement be contemplate by the detection of fraud in weigh sugar upwards of $ 3,400,000 have be recover from the beneficiary of the fraud and an entirely new system free from the possibility of such abuse have be devise the department have perfect the method of collect duty at the port of new york so as to save the government upwards of ten or eleven million dollar and the same spirit of change and reform have be infuse into the other custom office of the country the method use at many place be archaic there would seem to be no reason at all why the surveyor of the port who really act for the collector should not be a subordinate of the collector at a less salary and directly under his control and there be but little reason for the existence of the naval officer who be a kind of local auditor his work be mainly an examination of account which be conduct again in washington and which result in no great security to the government the naval officers in the various port be presidential appointee many of they draw good salary and those office should be abolish or with reduce force make part of the central auditing system there be entirely too many custom district and too many custom collector these district should be consolidate and the collector in charge of they who draw good salary many of they out of proportion to the collection make should be abolish or treat as mere branch office in accordance with the plan of the treasury department which will be present for the consideration of congress as an illustration the cost of collect $ 1 of revenue at typical small port like the port of york me be $ 50.04 at the port of annapolis md. it cost $ 309.41 to collect $ 1 of revenue at natchez $ 52.76 at alexandria va. $ 122.49.it be not essential to the preventing of smuggling that custom district should be increase in number the violation of the custom law can be quite as easily prevent and much more economically by the revenue cutter service and by the use of the special agent travel force of the treasury department a reorganization of the special custom agent have be perfect with a view to retain only those who have special knowledge of the custom law regulation and usual method of evasion and with this improvement there will be no danger to the government from the recommend consolidation and abolition of custom district an investigation of the appraising system now in vogue in new york city have show a sacrifice of the interest of the government by under appraisement which be in the course of be remedie by reorganization and the employment of competent expert prosecution have be institute grow out of the fraud there discover and be now await hearing in the federal courts very great improvement have be make in respect to the mint and assay office diminished appropriation have be ask for those whose continuance be unnecessary and this year 's estimate of expense be $ 326,000 less than two year ago there be an opportunity for far save in the abolition of several mint and assay office that have now become unnecessary modern machinery have be instal there more and well work have be do and the appropriation have be consequently diminish in the bureau of engraving and printing great economy have be effect useless division have be abolish with the result of save $ 440,000 this year in the total expense of the bureau despite increase business the treasurer 's office and that of the division of public moneys in part cover the same function and this be also true of the office of the register and the division of loans and currency plan for the elimination of the duplication in these office will be present to congress comptroller of the currency the office of the comptroller of the currency be one most important in the preservation of proper banking method in the national banking system of the united states and the present comptroller have impress his subordinate with the necessity of so conduct their investigation as to establish the principle that every bank failure be unnecessary because proper inspection and notice of threaten condition to the responsible director and officer can prevent it public buildings in our public building we still suffer from the method of appropriation which have be so much criticize in connection with our river and harbor some method should be devise for control the supply of public building so that they will harmonize with the actual need of the government then when it come to the actual construction there have be in the past too little study of the building plan and site with a view to the actual need of the government post office building which be in effect warehouse for the economical handling of transportation of thousand of ton of mail have be make monumental structure and often locate far from the convenient and economical spot in the actual construction of the building a close scrutiny of the method employ by the government architect or by architect employ by the government have result in decide economy it be hope that more time will give opportunity for a more thorough reorganization the last public building bill carry authorization for the ultimate expenditure of $ 33,011,500 and i approve it because of the many good feature it contain just as i approve the river and harbor bill but it be draw upon a principle that ought to be abandon it seem to i that the wise method of prepare a public building bill would be the preparation of a report by a commission of government expert whose duty it should be to report to congress the government 's need in the way of the construction of public building in every part of the country just as the army engineers make report with reference to the utility of propose improvement in river and harbor with the add function which i have recommend for the army engineers of include in their recommendation the relative importance of the various project find to be worthy of approval and execution revenues .as the treasury department be the one through which the income of the government be collect and its expenditure be disburse this seem a proper place to consider the operation of the exist tariff bill which become a law august 6 1909 as an income produce measure the exist tariff bill have never be exceed by any custom bill in the history of the country the corporation excise tax proportion to the net income of every business corporation in the country have work well the tax have be easily collect its prompt payment indicate that the incidence of the tax have not be heavy it offer moreover an opportunity for knowledge by the government of the general condition and business of all corporation and that mean by far the most important part of the business of the country in the original act provision be make for the publication of return this provision be subsequently amend by congress and the matter leave to the regulation of the president i have direct the issue of the need regulation and have make it possible for the public generally to know from an examination of the record the return of all corporation the stock of which be list on any public stock exchange or be offer for sale to the general public by advertisement or otherwise the return of those corporation whose stock be not so list or offer for sale be direct to be open to the inspection and examination of creditor and stockholder of the corporation whose record be seek the return of all corporation be subject to the inspection of any government officer or to the examination of any court in which the return make by the corporation be relevant and competent evidence the payne tariff act the schedule of the rate of duty in the payne tariff act have be subject to a great deal of criticism some of it just more of it unfounded and to much misrepresentation the act be adopt in pursuance of a declaration by the party which be responsible for it that a custom bill should be a tariff for the protection of home industry the measure of the protection to be the difference between the cost of produce the import article abroad and the cost of produce it at home together with such addition to that difference as might give a reasonable profit to the home producer the chief criticism of this tariff be a charge that in respect to a number of the schedule the declare measure be not follow but a high difference retain or insert by way of undue discrimination in favor of certain industry and manufacture little if any of the criticism of the tariff have be direct against the protective principle above state tariff board the time in which the tariff be prepare undoubtedly be so short as to make it impossible for the congress and its expert to acquire all the information necessary strictly to conform to the declare measure in order to avoid criticism of this kind in the future and for the .purpose of more nearly conform to the party promise congress at its last session make provision at my request for the continuance of a board create under the authority of the maximum and minimum clause of the tariff bill and authorize this board to expend the money appropriate under my direction for the ascertainment of the cost of production at home and abroad of the various article include in the schedule of the tariff the tariff board thus appoint and authorize have be diligent in prepare itself for the necessary investigation the hope of those who have advocate the use of this board for tariff purpose be that the question of the rate of a duty impose shall become more of a business question and less of a political question to be ascertain by expert of long training and accurate knowledge the halt in business and the shock to business due to the announcement that a new tariff bill be to be prepare and put in operation will be avoid by treat the schedule one by one as occasion shall arise for a change in the rate of each and only after a report upon the schedule by the tariff board competent to make such report it be not likely that the board will be able to make a report during the present session of congress on any of the schedule because a proper examination involve an enormous amount of detail and a great deal of care but i hope to be able at the opening of the new congress or at least during the session of that congress to bring to its attention the fact in regard to those schedule in the present tariff that may prove to need amendment the carrying out of this plan of course involve the full cooperation of congress in limit the consideration in tariff matter to one schedule at a time because if a propose amendment to a tariff bill be to involve a complete consideration of all the schedule and another revision then we shall only repeat the evil from which the business of this country have in time past suffer most grievously by stagnation and uncertainty pende a resettlement of a law affect all business directly or indirectly i can not too much emphasize the importance and benefit of the plan above propose for the treatment of the tariff it facilitate the removal of noteworthy defect in an important law without a disturbance of business prosperity which be even more important to the happiness and the comfort of the people than the elimination of instance of injustice in the tariff the inquiry which the member of the tariff board make during the last summer into the method pursue by other government with reference to the fixing of tariff and the determination of their effect upon trade show that each government maintain an office or bureau the officer and employee of which have make their life work the study of tariff matter of foreign and home price and cost of article import and the effect of the tariff upon trade so that whenever a change be think to be necessary in the tariff law this office be the source of the most reliable information as to the propriety of the change and its effect i be strongly convinced that we need in this government just such an office and that it can be secure by make the tariff board already appoint a permanent tariff commission with such duty power and emolument as it may seem wise to congress to give it have be propose to enlarge the board from three to five the present number be convenient but i do not know that an increase of two member would be objectionable whether or not the protective policy be to be continue and the degree of protection to be accord to our home industry be question which the people must decide through their choose representative but whatever policy be adopt it be clear that the necessary legislation should be base on an impartial thorough and continuous study of the fact banking and currency reform the method of impartial scientific study by expert as a preliminary to legislation which i hope to see ultimately adopt as our fix national policy with respect to the tariff river and harbor waterway and public building be also be pursue by the nonpartisan monetary commission of congress an exhaustive and most valuable study of the banking and currency system of foreign country have be complete a comparison of the business method and institution of our powerful and successful commercial rival with our own be sure to be of immense value i urge upon congress the importance of a nonpartisan and disinterested study and consideration of our banking and currency system it be idle to dream of commercial expansion and of the development of our national trade on a scale that measure up to our matchless opportunity unless we can lay a solid foundation in a sound and endure banking and currency system the problem be not partisan be not sectional it be national war department the war department have within its jurisdiction the management of the army and in connection therewith the coast defense the government of the dependency of the philippines and of porto rico the recommendation of plan for the improvement of harbor and waterway and their execution when adopt and by virtue of an executive order the supervision of the construction of the panama canal the army of the united states be a small body compare with the total number of people for the preservation of whose peace and good order it be a last resource the army now number about 80,000 man of whom about 18,000 be engage in the coast artillery and detail to the management and use of the gun in the fort and battery that protect our coast the rest of the army or about 60,000 be the mobile part of our national force and be divide into 31 regiment of infantry include the porto rican regiment 15 regiment of cavalry 6 regiment of field artillery a corps of ordnance of engineer and of signal a quartermaster 's department a commissary department and a medical corps the general plan for an army of the united states at peace should be that of a skeleton organization with an excess of train officer and thus capable of rapid enlargement by enlistment to be supplement in emergency by the national militia and a volunteer force in some measure this plan have be adopt in the very large proportion of cavalry and field artillery as compare with infantry in the present army and on a peace basis an infantry force can be train in six month a cavalry or a light artillery force not under one and one half or two year hence the importance of have ready a large number of the more skilled soldier the militia system for which congress by the constitution be authorize to provide be develop by the so call dick law under which the discipline the tactic the drill the rank the uniform and the various branch of the militia be assimilate as far as possible to those of the regular army under the militia law as the constitution provide the governors of the states appoint the militia officer but by appropriation from congress states have be induce to comply with the rule of assimilation between the regular army and the militia so that now there be a force the efficiency of which differ in different states which could be incorporate under a single command with the regular army and which for some time each year receive the benefit of drill and maneuver with condition approximate actual military service under the supervision of regular army officer in the army of the united states in addition to the regular force and the militia force which may be summon to the defense of the nation by the president there be also the volunteer force which make up a very large part of the army in the civil war and which in any war of long continuance would become its most important constituent there be an act which date from the civil war know as the volunteer act which make provision for the enlistment of volunteer in the army of the united states in time of war this be find to be so defective in the philippine war that a special act for the organization of volunteer regiment to take part in that war be adopt and it be much well adapt to the necessity of the case there be now pende in congress a bill repeal the present volunteer act and make provision for the organization of volunteer force in time of war which be admirably adapt to meet the exigency which would be then present the passage of the bill would not entail a dollar 's expense upon the government at this time or in the future until war come but when war do come the method therein direct be in accordance with the good military judgment as to what they ought to be and the act would prevent the necessity for the discussion of new legislation and the delay incident to its consideration and adoption i earnestly urge the passage of this volunteer bill i far recommend that congress establish a commission to determine as early as practicable a comprehensive policy for the organization mobilization and administration of the regular army the organized militia and the volunteer force in the event of war need for additional officer one of the great difficulty in the prompt organization and mobilization of militia and volunteer force be the absence of competent officer of the rank of captain to teach the new army by the unit of the company the business of be soldier and of take care of themselves so as to render effective service this need of army officer can only be supply by provision of law authorize the appointment of a great number of army officer than be need to supply the command of regular army troop now enlist in the service there be enough regular army officer to command the troop now enlist but congress have authorize and the department have follow the example of congress and exercise the authority confer by detail these army officer to duty other than that of the command of troop for instance there be a large number of army officer assign to duty with military college or in college in which military training be give then a large number of officer be assign to general staff duty and there be various other place to which army officer can be and be legally assign which take they away from their regiment and company in order that the militia of each state should be properly drill and make more like the regular army regular army officer should be detail to assist the adjutant general of each state in the supervision of the state militia but this be impossible unless provision be make by congress for a very considerable increase in the number of company and field officer of the army a bill be pende in congress for this purpose and i earnestly hope that in the interest of the proper development of a republican army an army small in the time of peace but possible of prompt and adequate enlargement in time of war shall become possible under the law of the united states proposed increase in army engineer a bill the strong argument for which can be base on the ground quite similar to that of the increase officer bill be a bill for the increase of sixty in the army engineers the army engineers be largely employ in the expenditure of the money appropriate for the improvement of river and harbor and in the construction of the panama canal this in addition to their military duty which include the building of fortification both on our coast and in our dependency require many more engineer than the army have and public work civil and military be therefore much delay i earnestly recommend the passage of this bill which pass the house at the last session and be now pende in the senate fortifications .i have direct that the estimate for appropriation for the improvement of coast defense in the united states should be reduce to a minimum while those for the completion of the need fortification at corregidor in the philippine islands and at pearl harbor in the hawaiian islands should be expedite as much as possible the proposition to make olongapo and subig bay the naval base for the pacific be give up and it be to be treat merely as a supply station while the fortification in the philippines be to be largely confine to corregidor island and the adjacent island which command entrance to manila bay and which be be render impregnable from land and sea attack the pacific naval base have be transfer to pearl harbor in the hawaiian islands this necessitate the heavy fortification of the harbor and the establishment of an important military station near honolulu i urge that all the estimate make by the war department for these purpose be approve by congressional appropriation philippine islands during the last summer at my request the secretary of war visit the philippine islands and have describe his trip in his report he find the islands in a state of tranquillity and grow prosperity due largely to the change in the tariff law which have open the market of america to the product of the philippines and have open the philippine market to american manufacture the

prosperity and progress in porto rico certain political change be embody in the bill to provide a civil government for porto rico and for other purpose which pass the house of representatives on june 15 1910 at the last session of congress and be now await the action of the senate the importance of those feature of this bill relate to public health and sanitation can not be overestimate the removal from politic of the judiciary by provide for the appointment of the municipal judge be excellent and i recommend that a step far be take by provide therein for the appointment of secretary and marshal of these court the provision in the bill for a partially elective senate the number of elective member be progressively increase be of doubtful wisdom and the composition of the senate as provide in the bill when introduce in the house seem well to meet condition exist in porto rico this be an important measure and i recommend its early consideration and passage river and harbors i have already express my opinion to congress in respect to the character of the river and harbor bill which should be enact into law and i have exercise as much power as i could under the law in direct the chief of engineers to make his report to congress conform to the need of the committee frame such a bill in determine which of the propose improvement be the more important and ought to be complete first and promptly panama canal at the instance of colonel goethals the army engineer officer in charge of the work on the panama canal i have just make a visit to the isthmus to inspect the work do and to consult with he on the ground as to certain problem which be likely to arise in the near future the progress of the work be most satisfactory if no unexpected obstacle present itself the canal will be complete well within the time fix by colonel goethals to wit january 1 1915 and within the estimate of cost $ 375,000,000.press report have reach the united states from time to time give account of slide of earth of very large yardage in the culebra cut and elsewhere along the line from which it might be infer that the work have be much retarded and that the time of completion have be necessarily postpone the report of doctor hayes of the geological survey whom i send within the last month to the isthmus to make an investigation show that this section of the canal zone be compose of sedimentary rock of rather weak structure and subject to almost immediate disintegration when expose to the air subsequent to the deposition of these sediment igneous rock hard and more durable have be thrust into they and be cold at the time of their intrusion united but indifferently with the sedimentary rock at the contact the result of these condition be that as the cut be deepen cause unbalanced pressure slide from the side of the cut have occur these be in part due to the flowing of surface soil and decomposed sedimentary rock upon incline surface of the underlie undecomposed rock and in part by the crushing of structurally weak bed under excessive pressure these slide occur on one side or the other of the cut through a distance of 4 or 5 mile and now that their character be understand allowance have be make in the calculation of yardage for the amount of slide which will have to be remove and the great slope that will have to be give to the bank in many place in order to prevent their recurrence such allowance do not exceed ten million of yard consider that the number of yard remove from this cut on an average of each month through the year be 1,300,000 and that the total remain to be excavate include slide be about 30,000,000 yard it be see that this addition to the excavation do not offer any great reason for delay while this feature of the material to be excavate in the cut will not seriously delay or obstruct the construction of a canal of the lock type the increase of excavation due to such slide in the cut make 85 foot deep for a sea level canal would certainly have be so great as to delay its completion to a time beyond the patience of the american people fortify the canal among question arise for present solution be whether the canal shall be fortify i have already state to the congress that i strongly favor fortification and i now reiterate this opinion and ask your consideration of the subject in the light of the report already before you make by a competent board if in our discretion we believe modern fortification to be necessary to the adequate protection and policing of the canal then it be our duty to construct they we have build the canal it be our property by convention we have indicate our desire for and indeed undertake its universal and equal use it be also well know that one of the chief object in the construction of the canal have be to increase the military effectiveness of our navy failure to fortify the canal would make the attainment of both these aim depend upon the mere moral obligation of the whole international public obligation which we would be powerless to enforce and which could never in any other way be absolutely safeguard against a desperate and irresponsible enemy canal toll another question which arise for consideration and possible legislation be the question of toll in the canal this question be necessarily affect by the probable tonnage which will go through the canal it be all a matter of estimate but one of the government commission in 1900 investigate the question and make a report he conclude that the total tonnage of the vessel employ in commerce that could use the isthmian canal in 1914 would amount to 6,843,805 ton net register and that this traffic would increase 25.1 per cent per decade that it be not probable that all the commerce include in the total would at once abandon the route at present follow and make use of the new canal and that it might take some time perhaps two year to readjust trade with reference to the new condition which the canal would establish he do not include moreover the tonnage of war vessel although it be to be infer that such vessel would make considerable use of the canal in the matter of toll he reach the conclusion that a dollar a net ton would not drive business away from the canal but that a high rate would do so in determine what the toll should be we certainly ought not to insist that they should at once amount to enough to pay the interest on the investment of $ 400,000,000 which the united states have make in the construction of the canal we ought not to do this first because the benefit to be derive by the united states from this expenditure be not to be measure solely by a return upon the investment if it be then the construction might well have be leave to private enterprise it be because an adequate return upon the money invest could not be expect immediately or in the near future and because there be peculiar political advantage to be derive from the construction of the canal that it fall to the government to advance the money and perform the work in addition to the benefit to our naval strength the canal greatly increase the trade facility of the united states it will undoubtedly cheapen the rate of transportation in all freight between the eastern and western seaboard then if we be to have a world canal and if we be anxious that the world 's trade shall use it we must recognize that we have an active competitor in the suez canal and that there be other mean of carriage between the two ocean by the tehuantepec railroad and by other railroad and freight route in central america in all these case the question whether the panama canal be to be use and its tonnage increase will be determine mainly by the charge for its use my own impression be that the toll ought not to exceed $ 1 per net ton on january 1 1911 the toll in the suez canal be to be 7 franc and 25 centime for i net ton by suez canal measurement which be a modification of danube measurement a dollar a ton will secure under the figure above a gross income from the panama canal of nearly $ 7,000,000 the cost of maintenance and operation be estimate to exceed $ 3,000,000 ultimately of course with the normal increase in trade we hope the income will approximate the interest charge upon the investment the inquiry already make of the chief engineer of the canal show that the present consideration of this question be necessary in order that the commerce of the world may have time to adjust itself to the new condition result from the opening of this new highway on the whole i should recommend that within certain limit the president be authorize to fix the toll of the canal and adjust they to what seem to be commercial necessity maintenance of canal the next question that arise be as to the maintenance management and general control of the canal after its completion it should be premise that it be an essential part of our navy establishment to have the coal oil and other ship supply a dry dock and repair shop conveniently locate with reference to naval vessel pass through the canal now if the government for naval purpose be to undertake to furnish these convenience to the navy and they be convenience equally require by commercial vessel there would seem to be strong reason why the government should take over and include in its management the furnishing not only to the navy but to the public dry dock and repair shop facility and the sale of coal oil and other ship supply the maintenance of a lock canal of this enormous size in a sparsely populated country and in the tropic where the danger from disease be always present require a large and complete and well train organization with full police power exercise the utmost care the visitor to the canal who be impressed with the wonderful freedom from tropical disease on the isthmus must not be mislead as to the constant vigilance that be need to preserve this condition the vast machinery of the lock the necessary amount of dredging the preservation of the bank of the canal from slide the operation and the maintenance of the equipment of the railway will all require a force not of course to be liken in any way to the present organization for construction but a skilled body of man who can keep in a state of usefulness this great instrument of commerce such an organization make it easy to include within its function the furnishing of dry dock fuel repair and supply facility to the trade of the world these will be more essential at the isthmus of panama than they be at port said or suez because there be no depot for coal supply and other commercial necessity within thousand of mile of the isthmus another important reason why these ancillary duty may well be undertake by the government be the opportunity for discrimination between patron of the canal that be offer where private concession be grant for the furnishing of these facility nothing would create great prejudice against the canal than the suspicion that certain line of traffic be favor in the furnishing of supply or that the supply be control by any large interest that might have a motive for increase the cost of the use of the canal it may be add that the termini be not ample enough to permit the full competition in respect to the furnishing of these facility and necessity to the world 's trade even if it be wise to invite such competition and the granting of the concession would necessarily under these circumstance take on the appearance of privilege or monopoly prohibition of railroad ownership of canal steamers i can not close this reference to the canal without suggest as a wise amendment to the interstate commerce law a provision prohibit interstate commerce railroad from own or control ship engage in the trade through the panama canal i believe such a provision may be need to save to the people of the united states the benefit of the competition in trade between the eastern and western seaboard which this canal be construct to secure department of justice the duty of the department of justice have be greatly increase by legislation of congress enact in the interest of the general welfare of the people and extend its activity into avenue plainly within its constitutional jurisdiction but which it have not be think wise or necessary for the general government heretofore to occupy i be glad to say that under the appropriation make for the department the attorney general have so improve its organization that a vast amount of litigation of a civil and criminal character have be dispose of during the current year this will explain the necessity for slightly increase the estimate for the expense of the department his report show the recovery make on behalf of the government of duty fraudulently withhold public land improperly patent fine and penalty for trespass prosecution and conviction under the antitrust law and prosecution under the interstate commerce law i invite especial attention to the prosecution under the federal law of the so call bucket shop and of those scheme to defraud in which the use of the mail be an essential part of the fraudulent conspiracy prosecution which have save ignorant and weak member of the public and be save they hundred of million of dollar the violation of the antitrust law present perhaps the most important litigation before the department and the number of case file show the activity of the government in enforce that statute national incorporation in a special message last year i bring to the attention of congress the propriety and wisdom of enact a general law provide for the incorporation of industrial and other company engage in interstate commerce and i renew my recommendation in that behalf payment of just claim i invite the attention of congress to the great number of claim which at the instance of congress have be consider by the court of claims and decide to be valid claim against the government the delay that occur in the payment of the money due under the claim injure the reputation of the government as an honest debtor and i earnestly recommend that those claim which come to congress with the judgment and approval of the court of claims should be promptly pay reform in judicial procedure one great cry need in the united states be cheapen the cost of litigation by simplify judicial procedure and expedite final judgment under present condition the poor man be at a woeful disadavantage in a legal contest with a corporation or a rich opponent the necessity for the reform exist both in the united states court and in all state court in order to bring it about however it naturally fall to the general government by its example to furnish a model to all states a legislative commission appoint by joint resolution of congress to revise the procedure in the united states court have as yet make no report under the law the supreme court of the united states have the power and be give the duty to frame the equity rule of procedure which be to obtain in the federal court of first instance in view of the heavy burden of press litigation which that court have have to carry with one or two of its member incapacitate through ill health it have not be able to take up problem of improve the equity procedure which have practically remain the same since the organization of the court in 1789 it be reasonable to expect that with all the vacancy upon the court fill it will take up the question of cheapen and simplify the procedure in equity in the court of the united states the equity business be much the more important in the federal court and i may add much the more expensive i be strongly convinced that the good method of improve judicial procedure at law be to empower the supreme court to do it through the medium of the rule of the court as in equity this be the way in which it have be do in england and thoroughly do the simplicity and expedition of procedure in the english court today make a model for the reform of other system several of the lord chancellors of england and of the chief justices have leave their last impress upon the history of their country by their constructive ability in propose and secure the passage of remedial legislation effecting law reform i can not conceive any high duty that the supreme court could perform than in lead the way to a simplification of procedure in the united states court relief of supreme court from unnecessary appeals no man ought to have as a matter of right a review of his case by the supreme court he should be satisfy by one hearing before a court of first instance and one review by a court of appeal the proper and chief usefulness of a supreme court and especially of the supreme court of the united states be in the case which come before it so to expound the law and especially the fundamental law the constitution as to furnish precedent for the inferior court in future litigation and for the executive officer in the construction of statute and the performance of their legal duty therefore any provision for review of case by the supreme court that cast upon that court the duty of pass on question of evidence and the construction of particular form of instrument like indictment or will or contract decision not of general application or importance merely clog and burden the court and render more difficult its high function which make it so important a part of the framework of our government the supreme court be now carry an unnecessary burden of appeal of this kind and i earnestly urge that it be remove the statute respect the review by the supreme court of the united states of decision of the court of appeals of the district of columbia ought to be so amend as to place that court in the same position with respect to the review of its decision as that of the various united states circuit courts of appeals the act of march 2 1907 authorize appeal by the government from certain judgment in criminal case where the defendant have not be put in jeopardy within the meaning of the constitution should be amend so that such appeal should be take to the circuit courts of appeals instead of to the supreme court in all case except those involve the construction of the constitution or the constitutionality of a statute with the same power in the supreme court to review on certiorari as be now exercise by that court over determination of the several circuit courts of appeals appeal in copyright case should reach final judgment in the court of appeal instead of the supreme court as now the decision of the court of appeal should be make final also in all case wherein jurisdiction rest on both diverse citizenship and the existence of a federal question and not as now be reviewable in the supreme court when the case involve more than one thousand dollar appeal from the united states court in porto rico should run to the circuit court of appeals of the third circuit instead of to the supreme court these suggest change would i be advise relieve the supreme court of the consideration of about 100 case annually the american bar association have have before it the question of reduce the burden of litigation involve in reversal on review and new trial or re hearing and in frivolous appeal in habeas corpus and criminal case their recommendation have be embody in bill now pende in congress the recommendation be not radical but they will accomplish much if adopt into law and i earnestly recommend the passage of the bill embody they injunction bill i wish to renew my urgent recommendation make in my last annual message in favor of the passage of a law which shall regulate the issuing of injunction in equity without notice in accordance with the good practice now in vogue in the court of the united states i regard this of especial importance first because it have be promise and second because it will deprive those who now complain of certain allege abuse in the improper issuing of injunction without notice of any real ground for further amendment and will take away all semblance of support for the extremely radical legislation they propose which will be most pernicious if adopt will sap the foundation of judicial power and legalize that cruel social instrument the secondary boycott judicial salaries i far recommend to congress the passage of the bill now pende for the increase in the salary of the federal judges by which the chief justice of the united states shall receive $ 17,500 and the associate justices of the supreme court $ 17,000 the circuit judges constitute the circuit court of appeals shall receive $ 10,000 and the district judges $ 9,000 these judge exercise a wise jurisdiction and their duty require of they a profound knowledge of the law great ability in the dispatch of business and care and delicacy in the exercise of their jurisdiction so as to avoid conflict whenever possible between the federal and the state court the position they occupy ought to be fill by man who have show the great ability in their professional work at the bar and it be the poor economy possible for the government to pay salary so low for judicial service as not to be able to command the good talent of the legal profession in every part of the country the cost of living be such especially in the large city that even the salary fix in the propose bill will enable the incumbent to accumulate little if anything to support their family after their death nothing be so important to the preservation of our country and its beloved institution as the maintenance of the independence of the judiciary and next to the life tenure an adequate salary be the most material contribution to the maintenance of independence on the part of our judges post office department postal savings bank at its last session congress make provision for the establishment of saving bank by the post office department of this government by which under the general control of trustee consist of the postmaster general the secretary of the treasury and the attorney general the system could be begin in a few city and town and enlarge to cover within its operation as many city and town and as large a part of the country as seem wise the initiation and establishment of such a system have require a great deal of study on the part of the expert in the post office and treasury departments but a system have now be devise which be believe to be more economical and simple in its operation than any similar system abroad arrangement have be perfect so that savings bank will be open in some city and town on the 1st of january and there will be a gradual extension of the benefit of the plan to the rest of the country wipe out of postal deficit as i have say the post office department be a great business department and i be glad to note the fact that under its present management principle of business economy and efficiency be be apply for many year there have be a deficit in the operation of the post office department which have be meet by appropriation from the treasury the appropriation estimate for last year from the treasury over and above the receipt of the department be $ 17,500,000 i be glad to record the fact that of that $ 17,500,000 estimate for $ 11,500,000 be save and return to the treasury the personal effort of the postmaster general secure the effective cooperation of the thousand of postmaster and other postal officer throughout the country in carry out his plan of reorganization and retrenchment the result be that the postmaster general have be able to make his estimate of expense for the present year so low as to keep within the amount the postal service be expect to earn it be gratify to report that the reduction in the deficit have be accomplish without any curtailment of postal facility on the contrary the service have be greatly extend during the year in all its branch a principle which the postmaster general have recommend and seek to have enforce in respect to all appointment have be that those appointee who have render good service should be reappointe this have greatly strengthen the interest of postmaster throughout the country in maintain efficiency and economy in their office because they believe generally that this would secure for they a further tenure extension of the classified service upon the recommendation of the postmaster general i have include in the classified service all assistant postmaster and i believe that this give a secure tenure to those who be the most important subordinate of postmaster will add much to the efficiency of their office and an economical administration a large number of the fourth class postmaster be now in the classified service i think it would be wise to put in the classified service the first second and third class postmaster it be more logical to do this than to classify the fourth class postmaster for the reason that the fourth class post office be invariably small and the postmaster be necessarily man who must combine some other business with the postmastership whereas the first second and third class postmaster be pay a sufficient amount to justify the requirement that they shall have no other business and that they shall devote their attention to their post office duty to classify first second and third class postmaster would require the passage of an act change the method of their appointment so as to take away the necessity for the advice and consent of the senate i be aware that this be invite from the senate a concession in respect to its quasi executive power that be considerable but i believe it to be in the interest of good administration and efficiency of service to make this change would take the postmaster out of politic would relieve congressman who now be burden with the necessity of make recommendation for these place of a responsibility that must be irksome and can create nothing but trouble and it would result in securing from postmaster great attention to business great fidelity and consequently great economy and efficiency in the post office which they conduct the franking privilege the unrestricted manner in which the franking privilege be now be use by the several branch of the federal service and by congress have lay it open to serious abuse a fact clearly establish through investigation recently institute by the department while it have be impossible without a well control of frank to determine the exact expense to the government of this practice there can be no doubt that it annually reach into the million it be believe that many abuse of the franking system could be prevent and consequently a marked economy effect by supply through the agency of the postal service special official envelope and stamp for the free mail of the government all such envelope and stamp to be issue on requisition to the various branch of the federal service require they and such record to be keep of all official stamp supply as will enable the post office department to maintain a proper postage account cover the entire volume of free government mail as the first step in the direction of this reform special stamp and stamp envelope have be provide for use instead of frank in the free transmission of the official mail result from the business of the new postal saving system by properly record the issuance of such stamp and envelope accurate record can be keep of the cost to the government of handle the postal saving mail which be certain to become an important item of expense and one that should be separately determine in keep with this plan it be hope that congress will authorize the substitution of special official stamp and stamp envelope for the various form of frank now use to carry free of postage the vast volume of departmental and congressional mail matter during the past year method of account similar to those employ in the most progressive of our business establishment have be introduce in the postal service and nothing have so impede the department 's plan in this regard as the impossibility of determine with any exactness how far the various expense of the postal service be increase by the present unrestricted use of the franking privilege it be believe that the adoption of a more exact method of deal with this problem as propose will prove to be of tremendous advantage in the work of place the postal service on a strictly businesslike basis second class mail matter in my last annual message i invite the attention of congress to the inadequacy of the postal rate impose upon second class mail matter in so far as that include magazine and show by figure prepare by expert of the post office department that the government be render a service to the magazine cost many million in excess of the compensation pay an answer be attempt to this by the representative of the magazine and a reply be file to this answer by the post office department the utter inadequacy of the answer consider in the light of the reply of the post office department i think must appeal to any fair minded person whether the answer be all that could be say in behalf of the magazine be another question i agree that the question be one of fact but i insist that if the fact be as the expert of the post office department show that we be furnish to the owner of magazine a service worth million more than they pay for it then justice require that the rate should be increase the increase in the receipt of the department result from this change may be devoted to increase the usefulness of the department in establish a parcel post and in reduce the cost of first class postage to one cent it have be say by the postmaster general that a fair adjustment might be make under which the advertising part of the magazine should be charge for at a different and high rate from that of the reading matter this would relieve many useful magazine that be not circulate at a profit and would not shut they out from the use of the mail by a prohibitory rate parcels post with respect to the parcel post i respectfully recommend its adoption on all rural delivery route and that 11 pound the international limit be make the limit of carriage in such post and this with a view to its general extension when the income of the post office will permit it and the postal savings banks shall have be fully establish the same argument be make against the parcel post that be make against the postal saving bank that it be introduce the government into a business which ought to be conduct by private person and be paternalism the post office department have a great plant and a great organization reach into the most remote hamlet of the united states and with this machinery it be able to do a great many thing economically that if a new organization be necessary it would be impossible to do without extravagant expenditure that be the reason why the postal saving bank can be carry on at a small additional cost and why it be possible to incorporate at a very inconsiderable expense a parcel post in the rural delivery system a general parcel post will involve a much great outlay navy department reorganization in the last annual report of the secretary of the navy and in my annual message attention be call to the new detail of officer in the navy department by which officer of flag rank be assign to duty as aides to the secretary in respect to naval operation personnel inspection and material this change be a substantial compliance with the recommendation of the commission on naval reorganization head by mr. justice moody and submit to president roosevelt on february 26 1909 through the advice of this committee of line officer the secretary be able to bring about a proper coordination of all the branch of the naval department with great military efficiency the secretary of the navy recommend that this new organization be recognize by legislation and thus make permanent i concur in the recommendation legislative recommendation the secretary in view of the conclusion of a recent court of inquiry on certain phase of marine corps administration recommend that the major general commandant of the marine corps be appoint for a four year term and that officer of the adjutant and inspector 's department be detail from the line he also ask for legislation to improve the condition now exist in the personnel of officer of the navy particularly with regard to the age and experience of flag officer and captain and point out that it be essential to the high efficiency of the navy that the age of our officer be reduce and that flag officer particularly should gain proper experience as flag officer in order to enable they to properly command fleet i concur in the secretary 's recommendation cover of naval supply fund into treasury i commend to your attention the report of the secretary on the change in the system of cost accounting in navy yard and also to the history of the naval supply fund and the present condition exist in regard to that matter under previous practice and what now seem to have be an erroneous construction of the law the supply fund of the navy be increase from $ 2,700,000 to something over $ 14,000,000 and a system of accounting be introduce which prevent the striking of a proper balance and a knowledge of the exact cost of maintain the naval establishment the system have now be abandon and a naval supply account establish by law july 1 1910 the naval supply fund of $ 2,700,000 be now on deposit in the treasury to the credit of the department the secretary recommend that the naval supply account be make permanent by law and that the $ 2,700,000 of the naval supply fund be cover into the treasury as unnecessary and i ask for legislative authority to do this this sum when cover into the treasury will be really a reduction in the recorded naval cost for this year estimate and building program the estimate of the navy department be $ 5,000,000 less than the appropriation for the same purpose last year and include in this be the building program of the same amount as that submit for your consideration last year it be merely carry out the plan of build two battleship a year with a few need auxiliary vessel i earnestly hope that this program will be adopt abolition of navy yards the secretary of the navy have give personal examination to every navy yard and have study the use of the navy yard with reference to the necessity of our fleet with a fleet considerably less than half the size of that of the british navy we have shipyard more than double the number and there be several of these shipyard expensively equip with modern machinery which after investigation the secretary of the navy believe to be entirely useless for naval purpose he ask authority to abandon certain of they and to move their machinery to other place where it can be make of use in make these recommendation the secretary be follow directly along progressive line which have be adopt in our great commercial and manufacturing consolidation in this country that be of dismantle unnecessary and inadequate plant and discontinue their existence where it have be demonstrate that it be unprofitable to continue their maintenance at an expense not commensurate to their product guantanamo proper naval base the secretary point out that the most important naval base in the west indies be guantanamo in the southeastern part of cuba its geographical situation be admirably adapt to protect the commercial path to the panama canal and he show that by the expenditure of less than half a million dollar with the machinery which he shall take from other navy yard he can create a naval station at guantanamo of sufficient size and equipment to serve the purpose of an emergency naval base i earnestly join in the recommendation that he be give the authority which he ask i be quite aware that such action be likely to arouse local opposition but i conceive it to be axiomatic that in legislate in the interest of the navy and for the general protection of the country by the navy mere local pride or pecuniary interest in the establishment of a navy yard or station ought to play no part the recommendation of the secretary be base upon the judgment of impartial naval officer entirely uninfluence by any geographical or sectional consideration john paul jones i unite with the secretary in the recommendation that an appropriation be make to construct a suitable crypt at annapolis for the custody of the remain of john paul jones peary .the complete success of our country in arctic exploration should not remain unnoticed for century there have be friendly rivalry in this field of effort between the foremost nation and between the brave and most accomplished man expedition to the unknown north have be encourage by enlightened government and deserved honor have be grant to the daring man who have conduct they the unparalleled accomplishment of an american in reach the north pole april 6 1909 approve by critical examination of the most expert scientist have add to the distinction of our navy to which he belong and reflect credit upon his country his unique success have receive generous acknowledgment from scientific body and institution of learn in europe and america i recommend fitting recognition by congress of the great achievement of robert edwin peary department of the interior appeals to court in land case the secretary of the interior recommend a change of the law in respect to the procedure in adjudicate claim for land by which appeal can be take from the decision of the department to the court of appeals of the district of columbia for a judicial consideration of the right of the claimant this change find complete analogy in the present provision for appeal from the decision of the commissioner of patents the judgment of the court in such case would be of decisive value to land claimant generally and to the department of the interior in the administration of the law would enable claimant to bring into court the final consideration of issue as to the title to government land and would i think obviate a good deal of the subsequent litigation that now arise in our western court the bill be pende i believe in the house having be favorably report from the committee on public lands and i recommend its enactment arrears wiped out one of the difficulty in the interior department and in the land office have be the delay attendant upon the consideration by the land office and the secretary of the interior of claim for patent of public land to individual i be glad to say that under the recent appropriation of the congress and the earnest effort of the secretary and his subordinate these arrear have be dispose of and the work of the department have be bring more nearly up to date in respect to the pende business than ever before in its history economy have be effect where possible without legislative assistance and these be show in the reduced estimate for the expense of the department during the current fiscal year and during the year to come conservation .the subject of the conservation of the public domain have command the attention of the people within the last two or three year agricultural lands there be no need for radical reform in the method of dispose of what be really agricultural land the present law have work well the enlarged homestead law have encourage the successful farming of land in the semiarid region reclamation .the total sum already accumulate in the fund provide by the act for the reclamation of arid land be about $ 69,449,058.76 and of this all but $ 6,241,058.76 have be allot to the various project of which there be thirty congress at its last session provide for the issuing of certificate of indebtedness not exceed twenty million of dollar to be redeem from the reclamation fund when the proceed of land sell and from the water rent should be sufficient meantime in accordance with the provision of the law i appoint a board of army engineer to examine the project and to ascertain which be feasible and worthy of completion that board have make a report upon the subject which i shall transmit in a separate message within a few day conservation address in september last conservation congress be hold at st. paul at which i deliver an address on the subject of conservation so far as it be within the jurisdiction and possible action of the federal government in that address i assemble from the official record the statistic and fact as to what have be do in this behalf in the administration of my predecessor and in my own and indicate the legislative measure which i believe to be wise in order to secure the good use in the public interest of what remain of our national domain there be in this address a very full discussion of the reason which lead i to the conclusion state for the purpose of save in an official record a comprehensive resume of the statistic and fact gather with some difficulty in that address and to avoid their repetition in the body of this message i venture to make the address an accompany appendix the statistic be correct to november 15th last specific recommendation for the reason state in the conservation address i recommend first that the limitation now impose upon the executive which forbid his reserve more forest land in oregon washington idaho montana colorado and wyoming be repeal second that the coal deposit of the government be lease after advertisement invite competitive bid for term not exceed fifty year with a minimum rental and royalty upon the coal mine to be readjust every ten or twelve year and with condition as to maintenance which will secure proper mining and as to assignment which will prevent combination to monopolize control of the coal in any one district or market i do not think that coal measure under 2,500 acre of surface would be too large an amount to lease to any one lessee the secretary of the interior think there be difficulty in the way of lease public coal land which objection he have set forth in his report the force of which i freely concede i entirely approve his state at length in his report the objection in order that the whole subject may be present to congress but after a full consideration i favor a leasing system and recommend it third that the law should provide the same separation in respect to government phosphate land of surface and mineral right that now obtain in coal land and that power to lease such land upon term and limitation similar to those above recommend for coal lease with an add condition enable the government to regulate and if need be to prohibit the export to foreign country of the product fourth that the law should allow a prospector for oil or gas to have the right to prospect for two year over a certain tract of government land the right to be evidence by a license for which he shall pay a small sum and that upon discovery a lease may be grant upon term secure a minimum rental and proper royalty to the government and also the conduct of the oil or gas well in accord with the good method for husband the supply of oil in the district the period of the lease should not be as long as those of coal but they should contain similar provision as to assignment to prevent monopolistic combination fifth that water power site be directly lease by the federal government after advertisement and bidding for not exceed fifty year upon a proper rental and with a condition fix rate charge to the public for unit of electric power both rental and rate to be readjust equitably every ten year by arbitration or otherwise with suitable provision against assignment to prevent monopolistic combination or that the law shall provide that upon application make by the authority of the state where the water power site be situate it may be patent to the state on condition that the state shall dispose of it under term like those just describe and shall enforce those term or upon failure to comply with the condition the water power site and all the plant and improvement on the site shall be forfeit and revert to the united states the president be give the power to declare the forfeiture and to direct legal proceeding for its enforcement either of these method would i think accomplish the proper public purpose in respect to water power site but one or the other should be promptly adopt necessity for prompt action i earnestly urge upon congress that at this session general conservation legislation of the character indicate be adopt at its last session this congress take most useful and proper step in the cause of conservation by allow the executive through withdrawal to suspend the action of the exist law in respect to much of the public domain i have not think that the danger of dispose of coal land in the united states under the present law in large quantity be so great as to call for their withdrawal because under the present provision it be reasonably certain that the government will receive the real value of the land but in respect to oil land or phosphate land and of gas land in the united states and in respect to coal land in alaska i have exercise the full power of withdrawal with the hope that the action of congress would follow promptly and prevent that tie up of the resource of the country in the western and less settled portion and in alaska which mean stagnation and retrogression the question of conservation be not a partisan one and i sincerely hope that even in the short time of the present session consideration may be give to those question which have now be much discuss and that action may be take upon they alaska .with reference to the government of alaska i have nothing to add to the recommendation i make in my last message on the subject i be convinced that the migratory character of the population its unequal distribution and its smallness of number which the new census show to be about 50,000 in relation to the enormous expanse of the territory make it altogether impracticable to give to those people who be in alaska to day and may not be there a year hence the power to elect a legislature to govern an immense territory to which they have a relation so little permanent it be far well for the development of the territory that it be commit to a commission to be appoint by the executive with limited legislative power sufficiently broad to meet the local need than to continue the present insufficient government with few remedial power or to make a popular government where there be not proper foundation upon which to rest it the suggestion that the appointment of a commission will lead to the control of the government by corporate or selfish and exploit interest have not the slight foundation in fact such a government work well in the philippines and would work well in alaska and those who be really interested in the proper development of that territory for the benefit of the people who live in it and the benefit of the people of the united states who own it should support the institution of such a government alaskan railways i have be ask to recommend that the credit of the government be extend to aid the construction of railroad in alaska i be not ready now to do so a great many million of dollar have already be expend in the construction of at least two railroad and if law be pass provide for the proper development of the resource of alaska especially for the opening up of the coal land i believe that the capital already invest will induce the investment of more capital sufficient to complete the railroad building and to furnish cheap coal not only to alaska but to the whole pacific coast the passage of a law permit the leasing of government coal land in alaska after public competition and the appointment of a commission for the government of the territory with enable power to meet the local need will lead to an improvement in alaska and the development of her resource that be likely to surprise the country national parks our national park have become so extensive and involve so much detail of action in their control that it seem to i there ought to be legislation create a bureau for their care and control the great natural wonder of this country and the surround territory should be include in another national park i refer to the grand canyon of the colorado pensions .the uniform policy of the government in the matter of grant pension to those gallant and devoted man who fight to save the life of the nation in the perilous day of the great civil war have always be of the most liberal character those man be now rapidly pass away the good obtainable official statistic show that they be die at the rate of something over three thousand a month and in view of their advance year this rate must inevitably in proportion rapidly increase to the man who risk everything on the field of battle to save the nation in the hour of its dire need we owe a debt which have not be and should not be compute in a begrudging or parsimonious spirit but while we should be actuate by this spirit to the soldier himself care should be exercise not to go to absurd length or distribute the bounty of the government to class of person who may at this late day from a mere mercenary motive seek to obtain some legal relation with an old veteran now totter on the brink of the grave the true spirit of the pension law be to be find in the noble sentiment express by mr. lincoln in his last inaugural address wherein in speak of the nation 's duty to its soldier when the struggle should be over he say we should care for he who shall have bear the battle and for his widow and orphan "department of agriculture value of this year 's crop the report of the secretary of agriculture invite attention to the stupendous value of the agricultural product of this country amount in all to $ 8,926,000,000 for this year this amount be large than that of 1909 by $ 305,000,000 the existence of such a crop indicate a good prospect for business throughout the country a notable change for the well be comment upon by the secretary in the fact that the south especially in those region where the boll weevil have interfere with the growth of cotton have give more attention to the cultivation of corn and other cereal so that there be a great diversification of crop in the south than ever before and all to the great advantage of that section department activity the report contain a most interesting account of the activity of the department in its various bureau show how closely the agricultural progress in this country be follow along the line of improvement recommend by the department through its publication and the result of its experiment station in every state and by the instruction give through the agricultural school aid by the federal government and follow the general curriculum urge by the head and bureau chief of the department the activity of the department have be greatly increase by the enactment of recent legislation by the pure food act the meat inspection act the cattle transportation act and the act concern the interstate shipment of game this department be one of those the scope of whose action be constantly widen and therefore it be impossible under exist legislation to reduce the cost and their estimate below those of precede year farmer income and cost of living an interesting review of the result of an examination make by the department into statistic and price show that on the average since 1891 farm product have increase in value 72 per cent while the thing which the farmer buy for use have increase but 12 per cent an indication that present condition be favorable to the farming community forest service i have already refer to the forest of the united states and their extent and have urge as i do again the removal of the limitation upon the power of the executive to reserve other tract of land in six western states in which withdrawal for this purpose be now forbid the secretary of agriculture give a very full description of the disastrous fire that occur during the last summer in the national forest a drought more intense than any record in the history of the west have introduce a condition into the forest which make fire almost inevitable and locomotive spark negligent camper and in some case incendiary furnish the need immediate cause at one time the fire be so extended that they cover a range of a hundred mile and the secretary estimate that stand timber of the value of 25 million of dollar be destroy seventy six person in the employ of the forest service be kill and many more injured and i regret to say that there be no provision in the law by which the expense for their hospital treatment or of their interment could be meet out of public fund the red cross contribute a thousand dollar and the remainder of the necessary expense be make up by private contribution chiefly from the force of the forest service and its official i recommend that suitable legislation be adopt to enable the secretary of agriculture to meet the moral obligation of the government in this respect appropriation for fire fighting the specific fund for fighting fire be only about $ 135,000 but there exist discretion in the secretary in case of an emergency to apply other fund in his control to this purpose and he do so to the extent of nearly a million of dollar which will involve the presentation of a deficiency estimate for the current fiscal year of over $ 900,000 the damage do be not therefore due to the lack of an appropriation by congress available to meet the emergency but the difficulty of fight it lie in the remote point where the fire begin and where it be impossible with the road and trail as they now exist promptly to reach they proper protection necessitate as the secretary point out the expenditure of a good deal more money in the development of road and trail in the forest the establishment of lookout station and telephone connection between they and place where assistance can be secure reforestation .the amount of reforestation show in the report of the forest service only about 15,000 acre as compare with the 150 million of acre of national forest seem small and i be glad to note that in this regard the secretary of agriculture and the chief of the forest service be look forward to far great activity in the use of available government land for this purpose progress have be make in learn by experiment the good method of reforest congress be appeal to now by the secretary of agriculture to make the appropriation need for enlarge the usefulness of the forest service in this regard i hope that congress will approve and adopt the estimate of the secretary for this purpose department of commerce and labor the secretary of the department of commerce and labor have have under his immediate supervision the application of the merit system of promotion to a large number of employee and his discussion of this method of promotion base on actual experience i commend to the attention of congress the census bureau the taking of the census have proceed with promptness and efficiency the secretary believe and i concur that it will be more thorough and accurate than any census which have heretofore be take but it be not perfect the motive that prompt man with a false civic pride to induce the padding of census return in order to increase the population of a particular city have be strong enough to lead to fraud in respect to a few city in this country and i have direct the attorney general to proceed with all the vigor possible against those who be responsible for these fraud they have be discover and they will not interfere with the accuracy of the census but it be of the high importance that official inquiry of this sort should not be embarrass by fraudulent conspiracy in some private or local interest bureau of light houses the reorganization of the light house board have effect a very considerable saving in the administration and the estimate for that service for the present year be $ 428,000 less than for the precede year in addition three tender for which appropriation be make be not be build because they be not at present need for the service the secretary be now ask for a large sum for the addition of light and other aid to the commerce of the sea include a number in alaska the trade along that coast be become so important that i respectfully urge the necessity for follow his recommendation bureau of corporation the commissioner of corporations have just complete the first part of a report on the lumber industry in the united states this part do not find the existence of a trust or combination in the manufacture of lumber the commissioner do find however a condition in the ownership of the stand timber of the united states other than the government timber that call for serious attention the direct investigation make by the commissioner cover an area which contain 80 per cent of the privately own timber of the country his report show that one half of the timber in this area be own by 200 individual and corporation that 14 per cent be own by 3 corporation and that there be very extensive interownership of stock as well as other circumstance all point to friendly relation among those who own a majority of this timber a relationship which might lead to a combination for the maintenance of a price that would be very detrimental to the public interest and would create the necessity of remove all tariff obstacle to the free importation of lumber from other country bureau of fishery i be glad to note in the secretary 's report the satisfactory progress which be be make in respect to the preservation of the seal of the pribiloff islands very active step be be take by the department of state to secure an arrangement which shall protect the pribiloff herd from the loss due to pelagic sealing meantime the government have secure seal pelt of the bachelor seal the killing of which do not interfere with the maintenance of the herd from the sale of which next month it be expect to realize about $ 450,000 a sum largely in excess of the rental pay by the lessee of the government under the previous contract coast and geodetic survey the coast and geodetic survey have be engage in survey the coast of the philippine archipelago this be a heavy work because of the extended character of the coast line in those islands but i be glad to note that about half of the need survey have be complete so large a part of the coast line of the archipelago have be unsurveye as to make navigation in the neighborhood of a number of the island and especially on the east side particularly dangerous bureau of labor the commissioner of labor have be actively engage in compose the difference between employer and employee engage in interstate transportation under the erdman act jointly with the chairman of the interstate commerce commission i can not speak in too high term of the success of these two officer in conciliation and settlement of controversy which but for their interposition would have result disastrously to all interest tax on phosphorous matches i invite attention to the very serious injury cause to all those who be engage in the manufacture of phosphorous match the disease incident to this be frightful and as match can be make from other material entirely innocuous i believe that the injurious manufacture could be discourage and ought to be discourage by the imposition of a heavy federal tax i recommend the adoption of this method of stamp out a very serious abuse eight hour law since 1868 it have be the declare purpose of this government to favor the movement for an eight hour day by a provision of law that none of the employee employ by or on behalf of the government should work long than eight hour in every twenty four the first declaration of this view be not accompany with any penal clause or with any provision for its enforcement and though president grant by a proclamation twice attempt to give it his sanction and to require the officer of the government to carry it out the purpose of the framer of the law be ultimately defeat by a decision of the supreme court holding that the statute as draw be merely a direction of the government to its agent and do not invalidate a contract make in behalf of the government which provide in the contract for labor for a day of long hour than eight thereafter in 1892 the present eight hour law be pass which provide that the service and employment of all laborer and mechanic who be now or may hereafter be employ by the government of the united states by the district of columbia or by any contractor or subcontractor on any of the public work of the united states and of the say district of columbia be hereby restrict to eight hour in any one calendar day this law have be construe to limit the application of the requirement to those who be directly employ by the government or to those who be employ upon public work situate upon land own by the united states this construction prevent its application to government battle ship and other vessel build in private shipyard and to heavy gun and armor plate contract for and make at private establishment pending bill the proposed act provide that no laborer or mechanic do any part of the work contemplate by a contract with the united states in the employ of the contractor or any subcontractor shall be require or permit to work more than eight hour a day in any one calendar day it seem to i from the past history that the government have be commit to a policy of encourage the limitation of the day 's work to eight hour in all work of construction initiate by itself and it seem to i illogical to maintain a difference between government work do on government soil and government work do in a private establishment when the work be of such large dimension and involve the expenditure of much labor for a considerable period so that the private manufacturer may adjust himself and his establishment to the special term of employment that he must make with his workman for this particular job to require however that every small contract of manufacture enter into by the government should be carry out by the contractor with man work at eight hour would be to impose an intolerable burden upon the government by limit its source of supply and exclude altogether the great majority of those who would otherwise compete for its business the proposed act recognize this in the exception which it make to contracts"for transportation by land or water for the transmission of intelligence and for such material or article as may usually be buy in the open market whether make to conform to particular specification or not or for the purchase of supply by the government whether manufacture to conform to particular specification or not "substitute for pending bill i recommend that instead of enact the propose bill the meaning of which be not clear and definite and might be give a construction embarrass to the public interest the present act be enlarge by provide that public work shall be construe to include not only building and work upon public ground but also ship armor and large gun when manufacture in private yard or factory provision for suspension in emergencies by president one of the great difficulty in enforce this eight hour law be that its application under certain emergency become exceedingly oppressive and there be a great temptation to subordinate official to evade it i think that it would be wise to allow the president by executive order to declare an emergency in special instance in which the limitation might not apply and in such case to permit the payment by the government of extra compensation for the time work each day in excess of eight hour i may add that my suggestion in respect to this legislation have the full concurrence of the commissioner of labor workmen 's compensation in view of the keen widespread interest now feel in the united states in a system of compensation for industrial accident to supplant our present thoroughly unsatisfactory system of employer liability a subject the importance of which congress have already recognize by the appointment of a commission i recommend that the international congress on industrial insurance be invite to hold its meeting in 1913 in washington and that an appropriation of $ 10,000 be make to cover the necessary expense of organize and carry on the meeting bureau of immigration distribute immigrant the immigration into this country be increase each year a large part of it come through the immigrant station at ellis island in the city of new york an examination of the station and the method pursue satisfy i that a difficult task be there perform by the commissioner and his force with common sense the strict fairness and with the most earnest desire to enforce the law equitably and mercifully it have be propose to enlarge the accommodation so as to allow more of the immigrant to come by that port i do not think it wise policy to do this i have no objection to on the contrary i recommend the construction of additional building for the purpose of facilitate a close and more careful examination of each immigrant as he come in but i deprecate the enlargement of the building and of the force for the purpose of permit the examination of more immigrant per day than be now examine if it be understand that no more immigrant can be take in at new york than be now take in and the steamship company thus be give a reason and a motive for transfer immigrant to other port we can be confident that they will be well distribute through the country and that there will not be that congestion in the city of new york which do not make for the well condition of the immigrant or increase his usefulness as a new member of this community everything which tend to send the immigrant west and south into rural life help the country amendment recommended i concur with the secretary in his recommendation as to the amendment to the immigration law in increase the fine against the company for violation of the regulation and in give great power to the commissioner to enforce more care on the part of the steamship company in accept immigrant the recommendation of the secretary in which he urge that the law may be amend so as to discourage the separation of family be i think a good one miscellaneous subject not include in department bureau of health in my message of last year i recommend the creation of a bureau of health in which should be embrace all those government agency outside of the war and navy departments which be now direct toward the preservation of public health or exercise function germane to that subject i renew this recommendation i greatly regret that the agitation in favor of this bureau have arouse a counteragitation against its creation on the ground that the establishment of such a bureau be to be in the interest of a particular school of medicine it seem to i that this assumption be wholly unwarranted and that those responsible for the government can be trust to secure in the personnel of the bureau the appointment of representative of all recognize school of medicine and in the management of the bureau entire freedom from narrow prejudice in this regard the imperial valley project by an act pass by congress the president be authorize to expend a million dollar to construct the need work to prevent injury to the land of the imperial valley from the overflow of the colorado river i appoint a competent engineer to examine the locality and to report a plan for construction he have do so in order to complete the work it be necessary to secure the consent of mexico for part of the work must be construct in mexican territory negotiation look to the securing of such authority be quite near success the southern pacific railroad company propose to assist we in the work by lend equipment and by the transportation of material at cost price and it be hope that the work may be complete before any danger shall arise from the spring flood in the river the work be be do under the supervision of the secretary of the interior and his consulting engineer general marshall late chief of engineers now retire this lead i to invite the attention of congress to the claim make by the southern pacific railroad company for an amount expend in a similar work of relief call for by a flood and great emergency this work as i be inform be undertake at the request of my predecessor and under promise to reimburse the railroad company it seem to i the equity of this claim be manifest and the only question involve be the reasonable value of the work do i recommend the payment of the claim in a sum find to be just district of columbia character of government the government of the district of columbia be a good government the police force while perhaps it might be give or acquire more military discipline in bearing and appearance be nevertheless an efficient body of man free from graft and discharge its important duty in this capital of the nation effectively the park and the street of the city and the district be generally keep clean and in excellent condition the commissioners of the district have its affair well in hand and while not extravagant be constantly look to those municipal improvement that be expensive but that must be make in a modern grow city like washington while all this be true nevertheless the fact that washington be govern by congress and that the citizen be not responsible and have no direct control through popular election in district matter properly subject the government to inquiry and criticism by its citizen manifest through the public press and otherwise such criticism should command the careful attention of congress washington be the capital of the nation and its maintenance as a great and beautiful city under national control every lover of his country have much at heart and it should present in every way a model in respect of economy of expenditure of sanitation of tenement reform of thorough public instruction of the proper regulation of public utility of sensible and extended charity of the proper care of criminal and of youth need reform of healthful playground and opportunity for popular recreation and of a beautiful system of park i be glad to think that progress be be make in all these direction but i venture to point out certain specific improvement toward these end which congress in its wisdom might adopt speak generally i think there ought to be more concentration of authority in respect to the accomplishment of some of these purpose with more economy of expenditure public parks attention be invite to the peculiar situation exist in regard to the park of washington the park system proper comprise some 343 different area be under the office of public buildings and grounds which however have nothing to do with the control of rock creek park the zoological park the ground of the department of agriculture the botanic garden the ground of the capitol and other public ground which be regularly open to the public and ought to be part of the park system exclusive of the ground of the soldier home and of washington barracks the public ground use as park in the district of columbia comprise over 3,100 acre under ten different controlling official or body this division of jurisdiction be most unfortunate large sum of money be spend yearly in beautify and keep in good condition these park and the ground connect with government building and institution the work do on all of they be of the same general character work for which the office of public buildings and grounds have be provide by congress with a special organization and equipment which be lack for the ground not under that office there can be no doubt that if all work of care and improvement upon the ground belong to the united states in the district of columbia be put as far as possible under one responsible head the result would be not only great efficiency and economy in the work itself but great harmony in the development of the public park and garden of the city congress at its last session provide for two more park call the meridian hill and montrose park and the district commissioners have also include in their estimate a sum to be use for the acquisition of much need park land adjoin the zoological park know as the klingle ford tract the expense of these three park include in the estimate of the commissioners aggregate $ 900,000 i think it would lead to economy if the improvement and care of all these park and other public ground above describe should be transfer to the office of public buildings and grounds which have an equipment well and economically adapt to carry out the public purpose in respect to improvement of this kind to prevent encroachment upon the park area it be recommend that the erection of any permanent structure on any land in the district of columbia belong to the united states be prohibit except by specific authority of congress the district of columbia in virginia i have already in previous communication to congress refer to the importance of acquire for the district of columbia at least a part of the territory on the other side of the potomac in virginia which be originally grant for the district by the state of virginia and then be retrocede by act of congress in 1846 it be very evident from conference that i have have with the senators and representatives from virginia that there be no hope of a regranting by the state of the land thus give back and i be frank to say that in so far as the tract include the town of alexandria and land remote from the potomac river there would be no particular advantage in bring that within national control but the land which lie along the potomac river above the railroad bridge and across the potomac include arlington cemetery fort myer the government experiment farm the village of rosslyn and the palisades of the potomac reach to where the old district line intersect the river be very sparsely settle and could be admirably utilize for increase the system of the park of washington it have be suggest to i by the same virginia senators and representatives that if the government be to acquire for a government park the land above describe which be not of very great value the present law of virginia would itself work the creation of federal jurisdiction over it and if that be not complete enough the legislature of virginia would in all probability so enlarge the jurisdiction as to enable congress to include it within the control of the government of the district of columbia and actually make it a part of washington i earnestly recommend that step be take to carry out this plan public utilities there be a sufficient number of corporation enjoy the use of public utility in the district of columbia to justify and require the enactment of a law provide for their supervision and regulation in the public interest consistent with the vested right secure to they by their charter a part of these corporation to wit the street railway have be put under the control of the interstate commerce commission but that commission recommend that the power be take from it and intimate broadly that its other and more important duty make it impossible for it to give the requisite supervision it seem to i wise to place this general power of supervision and regulation in the district commissioners it be say that their present duty be now absorb and would prevent the proper discharge by they of these new function but their present jurisdiction bring they so closely and frequently in contact with these corporation and make they to know in such detail how the corporation be discharge their duty under the law and how they be serve the public interest that the commissioners be peculiarly fit to do this work and i hope that congress will impose it upon they by intrust they with power in respect to such corporation similar to those of the public utility commission of new york city or similar board in massachusetts school system i do not think the present control of the school system of washington commend itself as the most efficient and economical and thorough instrument for the carrying on of public instruction the cost of education in the district of columbia be excessive as compare with the cost in other city of similar size and it be not apparent that the result be in general more satisfactory the average cost per pupil per day in washington be about 38 cent while the average cost in 13 other american city fairly comparable with washington in population and standard of education be about 25.5 cent for each dollar spend in salary of school teacher and officer in the district about 4.4 day of instruction per pupil be give while in the 13 city above refer to each dollar expend for salary afford on the average 6.8 day of instruction for the current fiscal year the estimate of the board of education amount to about three quarter of the entire revenue locally collect for district purpose if i may say so there seem to be a lack of definite plan in the expansion of the school system and the erection of new building and of proper economy in the use of these building that indicate the necessity for the concentration of control all plan for improvement and expansion in the school system be with the school board while the limitation of expense be with the district commissioners i think it would be much well to put complete control and responsibility in the district commissioners and then provide a board of school visitor to be appoint by the supreme court of the district or by the president from the different school district of washington who represent local need shall meet and make recommendation to the commissioners and to the superintendent of education an educator of ability and experience who should be an appointee of and responsible to the district commissioners permanent improvement among other item for permanent improvement appear in the district estimate for 1912 be one design to substitute for willow tree alley notorious in the record of the police and health departments a playground with a building contain bath a gymnasium and other helpful feature and i hope congress will approve this estimate fair as washington seem with her beautiful street and shade tree and free as the expanse of territory which she occupy would seem to make she from slum and insanitary congestion of population there be center in the interior of square where the very poor and the criminal class as well huddle together in filth and noisome surrounding and it be of primary importance that these nucleus of disease and suffering and vice should be remove and that there should be substitute for they small park as breathe space and model tenement have sufficient air space and meet other hygienic requirement the estimate for the reform of willow tree alley the bad of these place in the city be the beginning of a movement that ought to attract the earnest attention and support of congress for congress can not escape its responsibility for the existence of these human pest hole the estimate for the district of columbia for the fiscal year 1912 provide for the repayment to the united states of $ 616,000 one fourth of the float debt that will remain on june 30 1911 the bond debt will be reduce in 1912 by about the same amount the district of columbia be now in an excellent financial condition its own share of indebtedness will it be estimate be less than $ 6,000,000 on june 30 1912 as compare with about $ 9,00,000 on june 30 1909.the bond debt owe half and half by the united states and the district will be extinguish by 1924 and the float debt of the district probably long before that time the revenue have double in the last ten year while the population during the same period have increase but 18.78 per cent it be believe that if due economy be practice the district can soon emerge from debt even while finance its permanent improvement with reasonable rapidity from current revenue to this end i recommend the enactment into law of a bill now before congress and know as the judson bill which will insure the gradual extinguishment of the district 's debt while at the same time require that the many permanent improvement need to complete a fitting capital city shall be carry on from year to year and at a proper rate of progress with fund derive from the rapidly increase revenue freedmen 's bank i renew my recommendation that the claim of the depositor in the freedmen 's bank be recognize and pay by the passage of the pende bill on that subject negro exposition i also renew my recommendation that step be take look to the holding of a negro exposition in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the issuing by mr. lincoln of the emancipation proclamation civil service commission the civil service commission have continue its useful duty during the year the necessity for the maintenance of the provision of the civil service law be never great than to day officer responsible for the policy of the administration and their immediate personal assistant or deputy should not be include within the classified service but in my judgment public opinion have advance to the point where it would support a bill provide a secure tenure during efficiency for all purely administrative official i entertain the profound conviction that it would greatly aid the cause of efficient and economical government and of well politic if congress could enact a bill provide that the executive shall have the power to include in the classified service all local office under the treasury department the department of justice the post office department the interior department and the department of commerce and labor appointment to which now require the confirmation of the senate and that upon such classification the advice and consent of the senate shall cease to be require in such appointment by their certainty of tenure dependent on good service and by their freedom from the necessity for political activity these local officer would be induce to become more efficient public servant the civil service law be an attempt to solve the problem of the proper selection of those who enter the service a well system under that law for promotion ought to be devise but give the select employee there remain still the question of promote his efficiency and his usefulness to the government and that can be bring about only by a careful comparison of unit work do by the individual and a pointing out of the necessity for improvement in this regard where improvement be possible inquiry into economy and efficiency the increase in the activity and in the annual expenditure of the federal government have be so rapid and so great that the time have come to check the expansion of government activity in new direction until we have test the economy and efficiency with which the government of to day be be carry on the responsibility rest upon the head of the administration he be hold accountable by the public and properly so despite the unselfish and patriotic effort of the head of department and other charge with responsibility of government there have grow up in this country a conviction that the expense of government be too great the fundamental reason for the existence undetected of waste duplication and bad management be the lack of prompt accurate information the president of a private corporation do so vast a business as the government transact would through competent specialist maintain the close scrutiny on the comparative efficiency and the comparative cost in each division or department of the business he would know precisely what the duty and the activity of each bureau or division be in order to prevent overlapping no adequate machinery at present exist for supply the president of the united states with such information respect the business for which he be responsible for the first time in the history of the government congress in the last session supply this need and make an appropriation to enable the president to inquire into the economy and efficiency of the executive department and i be now assemble an organization for that purpose at the outset i find comparison between department and bureau impossible for the reason that in no two department be the estimate and expenditure display and classify alike the first step be to reduce all to a common standard for classification and judgment and this work be now be do when it be complete the foundation will be lay for a businesslike national budget and for such a just comparison of the economy and efficiency with which the several bureau and division be conduct as will enable the president and the head of departments to detect waste eliminate duplication encourage the intelligent and effective civil servant whose effort too often go unnoticed and secure the public service at the low possible cost the committees on appropriations of congress have diligently work to reduce the expense of government and have find their effort often block by lack of accurate information contain a proper analysis of requirement and of actual and reasonable cost the result of this inquiry should enable the executive in his communication to congress to give information to which congress be entitle and which will enable it to promote economy my experience lead i to believe that while government method be much criticise the bad result if we do have bad result be not due to a lack of zeal or willingness on the part of the civil servant on the contrary i believe that a fine spirit of willingness to work exist in the personnel which if properly encourage will produce result equal to those secure in the well manage private enterprise in handle government expenditure the aim be not profit the aim be the maximum of public service at the minimum of cost we wish to reduce the expenditure of the government and we wish to save money to enable the government to go into some of the beneficial project which we be debar from take up now because we ought not to increase our expenditure i have request the head of each department to appoint committee on economy and efficiency in order to secure full cooperation in the movement by the employee of the government themselves at a later date i shall send to congress a special message on this general subject i urge the continuance of the appropriation of $ 100,000 request for the fiscal year 1912.civil service retirement it be impossible to proceed far in such an investigation without perceive the need of a suitable mean of eliminate from the service the superannuate this can be do in one of two way either by straight civil pension or by some form of contributory plan careful study of experiment make by foreign government show that three serious objection to the civil pension payable out of the public treasury may be bring against it by the taxpayer the administrative officer and the civil employee respectively a civil pension be bind to become an enormous continuous and increase tax on the public exchequer it be demoralize to the service since it make difficult the dismissal of incompetent employee after they have partly earn their pension and it be disadvantageous to the main body of employee themselves since it be always take into account in fix salary and only the few who survive and remain in the service until pensionable age receive the value of their defer pay for this reason after a half century of experience under a most liberal pension system the civil servant of england succeed about a year ago in have the system so modify as to make it virtually a contributory plan with provision for refund of their theoretical contribution the experience of england and other country show that neither can a contributory plan be successful human nature be what it be which do not make provision for the return of contribution with interest in case of death or resignation before pensionable age follow to its logical conclusion this mean that the simple and most independent solution of the problem for both employee and the government be a compulsory saving arrangement the employee to set aside from his salary a sum sufficient with the help of a liberal rate of interest from the government to purchase an adequate annuity for he on retirement this accumulation to be inalienably his and claimable if he leave the service before reach the retirement age or by his heir in case of his death this be the principle upon which the gillett bill now pende be draw the gillett bill however go far and provide that the government shall contribute to the pension fund of those employee who be now so advanced in age that their personal contribution will not be sufficient to create their annuity before reach the retirement age in my judgment this provision should be amend so that the annuity of those employee shall be pay out of the salary appropriate for the position vacate by retirement and that the difference between the annuity thus grant and the salary may be use for the employment of efficient clerk at the low grade if the bill can be thus amend i recommend its passage as it will initiate a valuable system and ultimately result in a great saving in the public expenditure interstate commerce commission there have not be time to test the benefit and utility of the amendment to the interstate commerce law contain in the act approve june 18 1910 the law as enact do not contain all the feature which i recommend it do not specifically denounce as unlawful the purchase by one of two parallel and compete road of the stock of the other nor do it subject to the restrain influence of the interstate commerce commission the power of corporation engage in operate interstate railroad to issue new stock and bond nor do it authorize the making of temporary agreement between railroad limit to thirty day fix the same rate for traffic between the same place i do not press the consideration of any of these object upon congress at this session the object of the first provision be probably generally cover by the antitrust law the second provision be in the act refer to the consideration of a commission to be appoint by the executive and to report upon the matter to congress that commission have be appoint and be engage in the investigation and consideration of the question submit under the law it consist of president arthur t. hadley of yale university as chairman frederick strauss frederick n. judson walter l. fisher and prof. b. h. meyer with william e. s. griswold as secretary the third proposal lead to so much misconstruction of its object as be that of weaken the effectiveness of the antitrust law that i be not disposed to press it for further consideration it be intend to permit railroad company to avoid useless rate cutting by a mere temporary acquiescence in the same rate for the same service over compete railroad with no obligation whatever to maintain those rate for any time safety appliance and provision the protection of railroad employee from personal injury be a subject of the high importance and demand continue attention there have be two measure pende in congress one for the supervision of boiler and the other for the enlargement of dangerous clearance certainly some measure ought to be adopt look to a prevention of accident from these cause it seem to i that with respect to boiler a bill might well be draw require and enforce by penalty a proper system of inspection by the railway company themselves which would accomplish our purpose the entire removal of outside clearance would be attend by such enormous expense that some other remedy must be adopt by act of may 6 1910 the interstate commerce commission be authorize and direct to investigate accident to report their cause and its recommendation i suggest that the commission be request to make a special report as to injury from outside clearance and the good method of reduce they valuation of railroads the interstate commerce commission have recommend appropriation for the purpose of enable it to enter upon a valuation of all railroad this have always be within the jurisdiction of the commission but the requisite fund have be want statistic of the value of each railroad would be valuable for many purpose especially if we ultimately enact any limitation upon the power of the interstate railroad to issue stock and bond as i hope we may i think therefore that in order to permit a correct understanding of the fact it would be wise to make a reasonable appropriation to enable the interstate commerce commission to proceed with due dispatch to the valuation of all railroad i have no doubt that railroad company themselves can and will greatly facilitate this valuation and make it much less costly in time and money than have be suppose fraudulent bill of lading forged and fraudulent hill of lading purport to be issue against cotton some month since result in loss of several million of dollar to american and foreign banking and cotton interest foreign banker then notify american banker that after october 31 1910 they would not accept bill of exchange draw against bill of lading for cotton issue by american railroad company unless american banker would guarantee the integrity of the bill of lading the american banker rightly maintain that they be not justify in give such guarantee and that if they do so the united states would be the only country in the world whose bill be so discredited and whose foreign trade be carry on under such guaranty the foreign banker extend the time at which these guaranty be demand until december 31 1910 rely upon we for protection in the meantime as the money which they furnish to move our cotton crop be of great value to this country for the protection of our own people and the preservation of our credit in foreign trade i urge upon congress the immediate enactment of a law under which one who in good faith advance money or credit upon a bill of lading issue by a common carrier upon an interstate or foreign shipment can hold the carrier liable for the value of the good describe in the bill at the valuation specify in the bill at least to the extent of the advance make in reliance upon it such liability exist under the law of many of the states i see no objection to permit two class of bill of lading to be issue i those under which a carrier shall be absolutely liable as above suggest and 2 those with respect to which the carrier shall assume no liability except for the good actually deliver to the agent issue the bill the carrier might be permit to make a small separate specific charge in addition to the rate of transportation for such guarantee bill as an insurance premium against loss from the add risk thus remove the principal objection which i understand be make by the railroad company to the imposition of the liability suggest viz that the ordinary transportation rate would not compensate they for the liability assume by the absolute guaranty of the accuracy of the bill of lading i far recommend that a punishment of fine and imprisonment be impose upon railroad agent and shipper for fraud or misrepresentation in connection with the issue of bill of lading issue upon interstate and foreign shipment general conclusion as to interstate commerce and antitrust law except as above i do not recommend any amendment to the interstate commerce law as it stand i do not now recommend any amendment to the anti trust law in other word it seem to i that the exist legislation with reference to the regulation of corporation and the restraint of their business have reach a point where we can stop for a while and witness the effect of the vigorous execution of the law on the statute book in restrain the abuse which certainly do exist and which rouse the public to demand reform if this test develop a need for further legislation well and good but until then let we execute what we have due to the reform movement of the present decade there have undoubtedly be a great improvement in business method and standard the great body of business man of this country those who be responsible for its commercial development now have an earnest desire to obey the law and to square their conduct of business to its requirement and limitation these will doubtless be make clear by the decision of the supreme court in case pende before it it be in the interest of all the people of the country that for the time be the activity of government in addition to enforce earnestly and impartially the exist law should be direct to economy of administration to the enlargement of opportunity for foreign trade to the conservation and improvement of our agricultural land and our other natural resource to the building up of home industry and to the strengthening of confidence of capital in domestic investment
to the senate and house of representatives
 in my annual message of december 6 1910 i state that the policy of broad and close trade relation with the dominion of canada which be initiate in the adjustment of the maximum and minimum provision of the tariff act of august 5 1909 have prove mutually beneficial and that it justify further effort for the readjustment of the commercial relation of the two country i also inform you that by my direction the secretary of state have dispatch two representative of the department of state as special commissioner to ottawa to confer with representative of the dominion government that they be authorize to take step to formulate a reciprocal trade agreement and that the ottawa conference thus begin have be adjourn to be resume in washington
 on the 7th of the present month two cabinet minister come to washington as representative of the dominion government and the conference be continue between they and the secretary of state the result of the negotiation be that on the 21st instant a reciprocal trade agreement be reach the text of which be herewith transmit with accompany correspondence and other datum
 one by one the controversy result from the uncertainty which attend the partition of british territory on the american continent at the close of the revolution and which be inevitable under the then condition have be eliminate some by arbitration and some by direct negotiation the merit of these dispute many of they extend through a century need not now be review they relate to the settlement of boundary the definition of right of navigation the interpretation of treaty and many other subject
 through the friendly sentiment the energetic effort and the broadly patriotic view of successive administration and especially of that of my immediate predecessor all these question have be settle the most acute relate to the atlantic fishery and this longstanding controversy after amicable negotiation be refer to the hague tribunal the judgment of that august international court have be accept by the people of both country and a satisfactory agreement in pursuance of the judgment have end completely the controversy an equitable arrangement have recently be reach between our interstate commerce commission and the similar body in canada in regard to through rate on the transportation line between the two country
 the path having be thus open for the improvement of commercial relation a reciprocal trade agreement be the logical sequence of all that have be accomplish in dispose of matter of a diplomatic and controversial character the identity of interest of two people link together by race language political institution and geographical proximity offer the foundation the contribution to the industrial advancement of our own country by the migration across the boundary of the thrifty and industrious canadians of english scotch and french origin be now repay by the movement of large number of our own sturdy farmer to the northwest of canada thus give their labor their mean and their experience to the development of that section with its agricultural possibility
 the guide motive in seek adjustment of trade relation between two country so situated geographically should be to give play to productive force as far as practicable regardless of political boundary while equivalency should be seek in an arrangement of this character an exact balance of financial gain be neither imperative nor attainable no yardstick can measure the benefit to the two people of this free commercial intercourse and no trade agreement should be judge wholly by custom house statistic
 we have reach a stage in our own development that call for a statesmanlike and broad view of our future economic status and its requirement we have draw upon our natural resource in such a way as to invite attention to their necessary limit this have properly arouse effort to conserve they to avoid their waste and to restrict their use to our necessity we have so increase in population and in our consumption of food product and the other necessity of life hitherto supply largely from our own country that unless we materially increase our production we can see before we a change in our economic position from that of a country sell to the world food and natural product of the farm and forest to one consume and import they exclude cotton which be exceptional a radical change be already show in our export in the fall off in the amount of our agricultural product sell abroad and a corresponding mark increase in our manufacture export a farsighte policy require that if we can enlarge our supply of natural resource and especially of food product and the necessity of life without substantial injury to any of our produce and manufacturing class we should take step to do so now we have on the north of we a country contiguous to ours for three thousand mile with natural resource of the same character as ours which have not be draw upon as ours have be and in the development of which the condition as to wage and character of the wage earner and transportation to market differ but little from those prevail with we the difference be not great than it be between different state of our own country or between different province of the dominion of canada ought we not then to arrange a commercial agreement with canada if we can by which we shall have direct access to her great supply of natural product without an obstructing or prohibitory tariff this be not a violation of the protective principle as that have be authoritatively announce by those who uphold it because that principle do not call for a tariff between this country and one whose condition as to production population and wage be so like ours and when our common boundary line of three thousand mile in itself must make a radical distinction between our commercial treatment of canada and of any other country
 the dominion have greatly prosper it have an active aggressive and intelligent people they be come to the parting of the way they must soon decide whether they be to regard themselves as isolate permanently from our market by a perpetual wall or whether we be to be commercial friend if we give they reason to take the former view can we complain if they adopt method deny access to certain of their natural resource except upon condition quite unfavorable to we a notable instance of such a possibility may be see in the condition surround the supply of pulp wood and the manufacture of print paper for which we have make a conditional provision in the agreement believe to be equitable should we not now therefore before their policy have become too crystallized and fix for change meet they in a spirit of real concession facilitate commerce between the two country and thus greatly increase the natural resource available to our people
 i do not wish to hold out the prospect that the unrestricted interchange of food product will greatly and at once reduce their cost to the people of this country moreover the present small amount of canadian surplus for export as compare with that of our own production and consumption would make the reduction gradual exclude the element of transportation the price of staple food product especially of cereal be much the same the world over and the recent increase in price have be the result of a world wide cause but a source of supply as near as canada would certainly help to prevent speculative fluctuation would steady local price movement and would postpone the effect of a further world increase in the price of lead commodity enter into the cost of living if that be inevitable
 in the reciprocal trade agreement numerous addition be make to the free list these include not only food commodity such as cattle fish wheat and other grain fresh vegetable fruit and dairy product but also rough lumber and raw material useful to our own industry free lumber we ought to have by give our people access to canadian forest we shall reduce the consumption of our own which in the hand of comparatively few owner now have a value that require the enlargement of our available timber resource
 natural and especially food product be place on the free list the logical development of a policy of reciprocity in rate on secondary food product or foodstuff partly manufacture be where they can not also be entirely exempt from duty to lower the duty in accord with the exemption of the raw material from duty this have be follow in the trade agreement which have be negotiate as an example wheat be make free and the rate on flour be equalize on a low basis in the same way live animal be make free the duty on fresh meat and on secondary meat product and on canned meat be substantially lower fresh fruit and vegetable be place on the free list the duty on can good of these class be reduce
 both country in their industrial development have to meet the competition of lower price labor in other part of the world both follow the policy of encourage the development of home industry by protective duty within reasonable limit this have make it difficult to extend the principle of reciprocal rate to many manufactured commodity but after much negotiation and effort we have succeed in do so in various and important instance
 the benefit to our widespread agricultural implement industry from the reduction of canadian duty in the agreement be clear similarly the new widely distribute and expand motor vehicle industry of the united states be give access to the dominion market on advantageous term
 my purpose in make a reciprocal trade agreement with canada have be not only to obtain one which would be mutually advantageous to both country but one which also would be truly national in its scope as apply to our own country and would be of benefit to all section the current of business and the transportation facility that will be establish forward and back across the border can not but inure to the benefit of the boundary state some readjustment may be need but in a very short period the advantage of the free commercial exchange between community separate only by short distance will strikingly manifest itself that the broadening of the source of food supply that the opening of the timber resource of the dominion to our need that the addition to the supply of raw material will be limit to no particular section do not require demonstration the same observation apply to the market which the dominion offer we in exchange as an illustration it have be find possible to obtain free entry into canada for fresh fruit and vegetable a matter of special value to the south and to the pacific coast in dispose of their product in their season it also have be practicable to obtain free entry for the cottonseed oil of the south-- a most important product with a rapidly expand consumption in the dominion
 the entire foreign trade of canada in the last fiscal year 1910 be $ 655,000,000 the import be $ 376,000,000 and of this amount the united states contribute more than $ 223,000,000 the reduction in the duty impose by canada will largely increase this amount and give we even a large share of her market than we now enjoy great as that be
 the datum accompany the text of the trade agreement exhibit in detail the fact which be here set forth briefly and in outline only they furnish full information on which the legislation recommend may be base action on the agreement submit will not interfere with such revision of our own tariff on import from all country as congress may decide to adopt
 reciprocity with canada must necessarily be chiefly confine in its effect on the cost of live to food and forest product the question of the cost of clothing as affect by duty on textile and their raw material so much moot be not within the scope of an agreement with canada because she raise comparatively few wool sheep and her textile manufacture be unimportant
 this trade agreement if enter into will cement the friendly relation with the dominion which have result from the satisfactory settlement of the controversy that have last for a century and far promote good feeling between kindre people it will extend the market for numerous product of the united states among the inhabitant of a prosperous neighboring country with an increase population and an increase purchasing power it will deepen and widen the source of food supply in contiguous territory and will facilitate the movement and distribution of these foodstuff
 the geographical proximity the close relation of blood common sympathy and identical moral and social idea furnish very real and strike reason why this agreement ought to be view from a high plane
 since become a nation canada have be our good neighbor immediately contiguous across a wide continent without artificial or natural barrier except navigable water use in common
 she have cost we nothing in the way of preparation for defense against her possible assault and she never will she have seek to agree with we quickly when difference have disturb our relation she share with us common tradition and aspiration i feel i have correctly interpret the wish of the american people by express in the arrangement now submit to congress for its approval their desire for a more intimate and cordial relationship with canada i therefore earnestly hope that the measure will be promptly enact into law

country that unless we materially increase our production we can see before we a change in our economic position from that of a country sell to the world food and natural product of the farm and forest to one consume and import they exclude cotton which be exceptional a radical change be already show in our export in the fall off in the amount of our agricultural product sell abroad and a corresponding mark increase in our manufacture export a farsighte policy require that if we can enlarge our supply of natural resource and especially of food product and the necessity of life without substantial injury to any of our produce and manufacturing class we should take step to do so now we have on the north of we a country contiguous to ours for three thousand mile with natural resource of the same character as ours which have not be draw upon as ours have be and in the development of which the condition as to wage and character of the wage earner and transportation to market differ but little from those prevail with we the difference be not great than it be between different state of our own country or between different province of the dominion of canada ought we not then to

the satisfactory settlement of the controversy that have last for a century and far promote good feeling between kindre people it will extend the market for numerous product of the united states among the inhabitant of a prosperous neighboring country with an increase population and an increase purchasing power it will deepen and widen the source of food supply in contiguous territory and will facilitate the movement and distribution of these foodstuff the geographical proximity the close relation of blood common sympathy and identical moral and social idea furnish very real and strike reason why this agreement ought to be view from a high plane since become a nation canada have be our good neighbor immediately contiguous across a wide continent without artificial or natural barrier except navigable water use in common she have cost we nothing in the way of preparation for defense against her possible assault and she never will she have seek to agree with we quickly when difference have disturb our relation she share with us common tradition and aspiration i feel i have correctly interpret the wish of the american people by express in the arrangement now submit to congress for its approval their desire for a more intimate and cordial relationship with canada i therefore earnestly hope that the measure will be promptly enact into law
to the senate and house of representatives

 this message be the first of several which i shall send to congress during the interval between the opening of its regular session and its adjournment for the christmas holiday the amount of information to be communicate as to the operation of the government the number of important subject call for comment by the executive and the transmission to congress of exhaustive report of special commission make it impossible to include in one message of a reasonable length a discussion of the topic that ought to be bring to the attention of the national legislature at its first regular session

 the anti trust law the supreme court decision

 in may last the supreme court hand down decision in the suit in equity bring by the united states to enjoin the further maintenance of the standard oil trust and of the american tobacco trust and to secure their dissolution the decision be epoch making and serve to advise the business world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anti trust act of 1890 the decision do not depart in any substantial way from the previous decision of the court in construe and apply this important statute but they clarify those decision by far define the already admit exception to the literal construction of the act by the decree they furnish a useful precedent as to the proper method of deal with the capital and property of illegal trust these decision suggest the need and wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make it easy for the entire business community to square with the rule of action and legality thus finally establish and to preserve the benefit freedom and spur of reasonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress

 no change in the rule of decision merely in its form of expression

 the statute in its first section declare to be illegal every contract combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nation and in the second declare guilty of a misdemeanor every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of the several states or with foreign nation

 in two early case where the statute be invoke to enjoin a transportation rate agreement between interstate railroad company it be hold that it be no defense to show that the agreement as to rate complain of be reasonable at common law because it be say that the statute be direct against all contract and combination in restraint of trade whether reasonable at common law or not it be plain from the record however that the contract complain of in those case would not have be deem reasonable at common law in subsequent case the court say that the statute should be give a reasonable construction and refuse to include within its inhibition certain contractual restraint of trade which it denominate as incidental or as indirect

 these case of restraint of trade that the court except from the operation of the statute be instance which at common law would have be call reasonable in the standard oil and tobacco case therefore the court merely adopt the test of the common law and in define exception to the literal application of the statute only substitute for the test of be incidental or indirect that of be reasonable and this without vary in the slight the actual scope and effect of the statute in other word all the case under the statute which have now be decide would have be decide the same way if the court have originally accept in its construction the rule at common law

 it have be say that the court by introduce into the construction of the statute common law distinction have emasculate it this be obviously untrue by its judgment every contract and combination in restraint of interstate trade make with the purpose or necessary effect of control price by stifle competition or of establish in whole or in part a monopoly of such trade be condemn by the statute the most extreme critic can not instance a case that ought to be condemn under the statute which be not bring within its term as thus construe

 the suggestion be also make that the supreme court by its decision in the last two case have commit to the court the undefined and unlimited discretion to determine whether a case of restraint of trade be within the term of the statute this be wholly untrue a reasonable restraint of trade at common law be well understand and be clearly define it do not rest in the discretion of the court it must be limit to accomplish the purpose of a lawful main contract to which in order that it shall be enforceable at all it must be incidental if it exceed the need of that contract it be void

 the test of reasonableness be never apply by the court at common law to contract or combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade whose purpose be or whose necessary effect would be to stifle competition to control price or establish monopoly the court never assume power to say that such contract or combination or conspiracy might be lawful if the party to they be only moderate in the use of the power thus secure and do not exact from the public too great and exorbitant price it be true that many theorist and other engage in business violate the statute have hope that some such line could be draw by court but no court of authority have ever attempt it certainly there be nothing in the decision of the late two case from which such a dangerous theory of judicial discretion in enforce this statute can derive the slight sanction

 force and effectiveness of statute a matter of growth

 we have be twenty one year make this statute effective for the purpose for which it be enact the knight case be discourage and seem to remit to the states the whole available power to attack and suppress the evil of the trust slowly however the error of that judgment be correct and only in the last three or four year have the heavy hand of the law be lay upon the great illegal combination that have exercise such an absolute dominion over many of our industry criminal prosecution have be bring and a number be pende but jury have feel averse to convict for jail sentence and judge have be most reluctant to impose such sentence on man of respectable standing in society whose offense have be regard as merely statutory still as the offense becomes well understand and the committing of it partake more of studied and deliberate defiance of the law we can be confident that jury will convict individual and that jail sentence will be impose

 the remedy in equity by dissolution

 in the standard oil case the supreme and circuit courts find the combination to be a monopoly of the interstate business of refining transporting and market petroleum and its product effect and maintain through thirty seven different corporation the stock of which be hold by a new jersey company it in effect command the dissolution of this combination direct the transfer and pro rata distribution by the new jersey company of the stock hold by it in the thirty seven corporation to and among its stockholder and the corporation and individual defendant be enjoin from conspire or combine to restore such monopoly and all agreement between the subsidiary corporation tend to produce or bring about further violation of the act be enjoin

 in the tobacco case the court find that the individual defendant twenty nine in number have be engage in a successful effort to acquire complete dominion over the manufacture sale and distribution of tobacco in this country and abroad and that this have be do by combination make with a purpose and effect to stifle competition control price and establish a monopoly not only in the manufacture of tobacco but also of tin foil and licorice use in its manufacture and of its product of cigar cigarette and snuff the tobacco suit present a far more complicated and difficult case than the standard oil suit for a decree which would effectuate the will of the court and end the violation of the statute there be here no single hold company as in the case of the standard oil trust the main company be the american tobacco company a manufacturing selling and hold company the plan adopt to destroy the combination and restore competition involve the redivision of the capital and plant of the whole trust between some of the company constitute the trust and new company organize for the purpose of the decree and make party to it and numbering new and old fourteen

 situation after readjustment

 the american tobacco company old readjust capital $ 92 000,000 the liggett amp meyers tobacco company new capital $ 67,000,000 the p. lorillard company new capital $ 47,000,000 and the r. j. reynolds tobacco company old capital $ 7,525,000 be chiefly engage in the manufacture and sale of chew and smoke tobacco and cigar the former one tinfoil company be divide into two one of $ 825,000 capital and the other of $ 400,000 the one snuff company be divide into three company one with a capital of $ 15,000,000 another with a capital of $ 8,000,000 and a third with a capital of $ 8,000,000 the licorice company be two one with a capital of $ 5,758,300 and another with a capital of $ 200,000 there be also the british american tobacco company a british corporation do business abroad with a capital of $ 26,000,000 the porto rican tobacco company with a capital of $ 1,800,000 and the corporation of united cigar stores with a capital of $ 9,000,000

 under this arrangement each of the different kind of business will be distribute between two or more company with a division of the prominent brand in the same tobacco product so as to make competition not only possible but necessary thus the smoking tobacco business of the country be divide so that the present independent company have 21 39 per cent while the american tobacco company will have 33 08 per cent the liggett amp meyers 20.05 per cent the lorillard company 22.82 per cent and the reynolds company 2.66 per cent the stock of the other thirteen company both preferred and common have be take from the defendant american tobacco company and have be distribute among its stockholder all covenant restrict competition have be declare null and further performance of they have be enjoin the preferred stock of the different company have now be give voting power which be deny it under the old organization the ratio of the preferred stock to the common be as 78 to 40 this constitute a very decide change in the character of the ownership and control of each company

 in the original suit there be twenty nine defendant who be charge with be the conspirator through whom the illegal combination acquire and exercise its unlawful dominion under the decree these defendant will hold amount of stock in the various distributee company range from 41 per cent as a maximum to 28.5 per cent as a minimum except in the case of one small company the porto rican tobacco company in which they will hold 45 per cent the twenty nine individual defendant be enjoin for three year from buy any stock except from each other and the group be thus prevent from extend its control during that period all party to the suit and the new company who be make party be enjoin perpetually from in any way effect any combination between any of the company in violation of the statute by way of resumption of the old trust each of the fourteen company be enjoin from acquire stock in any of the other all these company be enjoin from have common director or officer or common buying or sell agent or common office or lend money to each other

 size of new company

 objection be make by certain independent tobacco company that this settlement be unjust because it leave company with very large capital in active business and that the settlement that would be effective to put all on an equality would be a division of the capital and plant of the trust into small fraction in amount more nearly equal to that of each of the independent company this contention result from a misunderstanding of the anti trust law and its purpose it be not intend thereby to prevent the accumulation of large capital in business enterprise in which such a combination can secure reduce cost of production sale and distribution it be direct against such an aggregation of capital only when its purpose be that of stifle competition enhance or control price and establish a monopoly if we shall have by the decree defeat these purpose and restore competition between the large unit into which the capital and plant have be divide we shall have accomplish the useful purpose of the statute

 confiscation not the purpose of the statute

 it be not the purpose of the statute to confiscate the property and capital of the offend trust method of punishment by fine or imprisonment of the individual offender by fine of the corporation or by forfeiture of its good in transportation be provide but the proceeding in equity be a specific remedy to stop the operation of the trust by injunction and prevent the future use of the plant and capital in violation of the statute

 effectiveness of decree

 i venture to say that not in the history of american law have a decree more effective for such a purpose be enter by a court than that against the tobacco trust as circuit judge noyes say in his judgment approve the decree

 the extent to which it have be necessary to tear apart this combination and force it into new form with the attendant burden ought to demonstrate that the federal anti trust statute be a drastic statute which accomplish effective result which so long as it stand on the statute book must be obey and which can not be disobey without incur far reach penalty and on the other hand the successful reconstruction of this organization should teach that the effect of enforce this statute be not to destroy but to reconstruct not to demolish but to re create in accordance with the condition which the congress have declare shall exist among the people of the united states

 common stock ownership

 it have be assume that the present pro rata and common ownership in all these company by former stockholder of the trust would insure a continuance of the same old single control of all the company into which the trust have by decree be disintegrate this be erroneous and be base upon the assumed inefficacy and innocuousness of judicial injunction the company be enjoin from cooperation or combination they have different manager director purchasing and sale agent if all or many of the numerous stockholder reach into the thousand attempt to secure concert action of the company with a view to the control of the market their number be so large that such an attempt could not well be conceal and its prime mover and all its participant would be at once subject to contempt proceeding and imprisonment of a summary character the immediate result of the present situation will necessarily be activity by all the company under different manager and then competition must follow or there will be activity by one company and stagnation by another only a short time will inevitably lead to a change in ownership of the stock as all opportunity for continue cooperation must disappear those critic who speak of this dis

 integration in the trust as a mere change of garment have not give consideration to the inevitable working of the decree and understand little the personal danger of attempt to evade or set at naught the solemn injunction of a court whose object be make plain by the decree and whose inhibition be set forth with a detail and comprehensiveness

 voluntary reorganization of other trust at hand

 the effect of these two decision have lead to decree dissolve the combination of manufacturer of electric lamp a southern wholesale grocer association an interlocutory decree against the powder trust with direction by the circuit court compelling dissolution and other combination of a similar history be now negotiate with the department of justice look to a disintegration by decree and reorganization in accordance with law it seem possible to bring about these reorganization without general business disturbance

 movement for repeal of the anti trust law

 but now that the anti trust act be see to be effective for the accomplishment of the purpose of its enactment we be meet by a cry from many different quarter for its repeal it be say to be obstructive of business progress to be an attempt to restore old fashioned method of destructive competition between small unit and to make impossible those useful combination of capital and the reduction of the cost of production that be essential to continue prosperity and normal growth

 in the recent decision the supreme court make clear that there be nothing in the statute which condemn combination of capital or mere bigness of plant organize to secure economy in production and a reduction of its cost it be only when the purpose or necessary effect of the organization and maintenance of the combination or the aggregation of immense size be the stifling of competition actual and potential and the enhancing of price and establish a monopoly that the statute be violate mere size be no sin against the law the merging of two or more business plant necessarily eliminate competition between the unit thus combine but this elimination be in contravention of the statute only when the combination be make for purpose of end this particular competition in order to secure control of and enhance price and create a monopoly

 lack of definiteness in the statute

 the complaint be make of the statute that it be not sufficiently definite in its description of that which be forbid to enable business man to avoid its violation the suggestion be that we may have a combination of two corporation which may run on for year and that subsequently the attorney general may conclude that it wa be a violation of the statute and that which be suppose by the combiner to be innocent then turn out to be a combination in violation of the statute the answer to this hypothetical case be that when man attempt to amass such stupendous capital as will enable they to suppress competition control price and establish a monopoly they know the purpose of their act man do not do such a thing without have it clearly in mind if what they do be merely for the purpose of reduce the cost of production without the thought of suppress competition by use of the bigness of the plant they be create then they can not be convict at the time the union be make nor can they be convict later unless it happen that later on they conclude to suppress competition and take the usual method for do so and thus establish for themselves a monopoly they can in such a case hardly complain if the motive which subsequently be disclose be attribute by the court to the original combination

 new remedy suggest

 much be say of the repeal of this statute and of constructive legislation intend to accomplish the purpose and blaze a clear path for honest merchant and business man to follow it may be that such a plan will be evolve but i submit that the discussion which have be bring out in recent day by the fear of the continued execution of the anti trust law have produce nothing but glitter generality and have offer no line of distinction or rule of action as definite and as clear as that which the supreme court itself lay down in enforce the statute

 supplemental legislation needed not repeal or amendment

 i see no objection and indeed i can see decide advantage in the enactment of a law which shall describe and denounce method of competition which be unfair and be badge of the unlawful purpose denounce in the anti trust law the attempt and purpose to suppress a competitor by undersell he at a price so unprofitable as to drive he out of business or the making of exclusive contract with customer under which they be require to give up association with other manufacturer and numerous kindre method for stifle competition and effecting monopoly should be describe with sufficient accuracy in a criminal statute on the one hand to enable the government to shorten its task by prosecute single misdemeanor instead of an entire conspiracy and on the other hand to serve the purpose of point out more in detail to the business community what must be avoid

 federal incorporation recommended

 in a special message to congress on january 7 1910 i venture to point out the disturbance to business that would probably attend the dissolution of these offending trust i say

 but such an investigation and possible prosecution of corporation whose prosperity or destruction affect the comfort not only of stockholder but of million of wage earner employee and associate tradesman must necessarily tend to disturb the confidence of the business community to dry up the now flow source of capital from its place of hoarding and produce a halt in our present prosperity that will cause suffering and strained circumstance among the innocent many for the fault of the guilty few the question which i wish in this message to bring clearly to the consideration and discussion of congress be whether in order to avoid such a possible business danger something can not be do by which these business combination may be offer a mean without great financial disturbance of change the character organization and extent of their business into one within the line of the law under federal control and supervision secure compliance with the anti trust statute

 generally in the industrial combination call trust the principal business be the sale of good in many state and in foreign market in other word the interstate and foreign business far exceed the business do in any one state this fact will justify the federal government in grant a federal charter to such a combination to make and sell in interstate and foreign commerce the product of useful manufacture under such limitation as will secure a compliance with the anti trust law it be possible so to frame a statute that while it offer protection to a federal company against harmful vexatious and unnecessary invasion by the states it shall subject it to reasonable taxation and control by the states with respect to its purely local business

 corporation organize under this act should be prohibit from acquire and hold stock in other corporation except for special reason upon approval by the proper federal authority thus avoid the creation under national auspex of the hold company with subordinate corporation in different states which have be such an effective agency in the creation of the great trust and monopoly

 if the prohibition of the anti trust act against combination in restraint of trade be to be effectively enforce it be essential that the national government shall provide for the creation of national corporation to carry on a legitimate business throughout the united states the conflict law of the different states of the union with respect to foreign corporation make it difficult if not impossible for one corporation to comply with their requirement so as to carry on business in a number of different state

 i renew the recommendation of the enactment of a general law provide for the voluntary formation of corporation to engage in trade and commerce among the states and with foreign nation every argument which be then advanced for such a law and every explanation which be at that time offer to possible objection have be confirm by our experience since the enforcement of the antitrust statute have result in the actual dissolution of active commercial organization

 it be even more manifest now than it be then that the denunciation of conspiracy in restraint of trade should not and do not mean the denial of organization large enough to be intrust with our interstate and foreign trade it have be make more clear now than it be then that a purely negative statute like the anti trust law may well be supplement by specific provision for the building up and regulation of legitimate national and foreign commerce

 government administrative expert need to aid courts in trust dissolution

 the drafting of the decree in the dissolution of the present trust with a view to their reorganization into legitimate corporation have make it especially apparent that the court be not provide with the administrative machinery to make the necessary inquiry preparatory to reorganization or to pursue such inquiry and they should be empower to invoke the aid of the bureau of corporations in determine the suitable reorganization of the disintegrate part the circuit court and the attorney general be greatly aid in frame the decree in the tobacco trust dissolution by an expert from the bureau of corporations

 federal corporation commission proposed

 i do not set forth in detail the term and section of a statute which might supply the constructive legislation permit and aid the formation of combination of capital into federal corporation they should be subject to rigid rule as to their organization and procedure include effective publicity and to the close supervision as to the issue of stock and bond by an executive bureau or commission in the department of commerce and labor to which in time of doubt they might well submit their propose plan for future business it must be distinctly understand that incorporation under federal law could not exempt the company thus form and its incorporator and manager from prosecution under the anti trust law for subsequent illegal conduct but the publicity of its procedure and the opportunity for frequent consultation with the bureau or commission in charge of the incorporation as to the legitimate purpose of its transaction would offer it as great security against successful prosecution for violation of the law as would be practical or wise

 stich a bureau or commission might well be invest also with the duty already refer to of aid court in the dissolution and recreation of trust within the law it should be an executive tribunal of the dignity and power of the comptroller of the currency or the interstate commerce commission which now exercise supervisory power over important class of corporation under federal regulation

 the drafting of such a federal incorporation law would offer ample opportunity to prevent many manifest evil in corporate management to day include irresponsibility of control in the hand of the few who be not the real owner

 incorporation voluntary

 i recommend that the federal charter thus to be grant shall be voluntary at least until experience justify mandatory provision the benefit to be derive from the operation of great business under the protection of such a charter would attract all who be anxious to keep within the line of the law other large combination that fail to take advantage of the federal incorporation will not have a right to complain if their failure be ascribe to unwillingness to submit their transaction to the careful official scrutiny competent supervision and publicity attendant upon the enjoyment of such a charter

 only supplemental legislation needed

 the opportunity thus suggest for federal incorporation it seem tome be suitable constructive legislation need to facilitate the squaring of great industrial enterprise to the rule of action lay down by the anti trust law this statute as construe by the supreme court must continue to be the line of distinction for legitimate business it must be enforce unless we be to banish individualism from all business and reduce it to one common system of regulation or control of price like that which now prevail with respect to public utility and which when apply to all business would be a long step toward state socialism

 importance of the anti trust act

 the anti trust act be the expression of the effort of a freedomlove people to preserve equality of opportunity it be the result of the confident determination of such a people to maintain their future growth by preserve uncontrolle and unrestricte the enterprise of the individual his industry his ingenuity his intelligence and his independent courage

 for twenty year or more this statute have be upon the statute book all know its general purpose and approve many of its violator be cynical over its assumed impotence it seem impossible of enforcement slowly the mill of the court ground and only gradually do the majesty of the law assert itself many of its statesman author die before it become a living force and they and other see the evil grow which they have hope to destroy now its efficacy be see now its power be heavy now its object be near achievement now we hear the call for its repeal on the plea that it interfere with business prosperity and we be advise in most general term how by some other statute and in some other way the evil we be just stamp out can be cure if we only abandon this work of twenty year and try another experiment for another term of year

 it be say that the act have not do good can this be say in the face of the effect of the northern securities decree that decree be in no way so drastic or inhibitive in detail as either the standard oil decree or the tobacco decree but do it not stop for all time the then powerful movement toward the control of all the railroad of the country in a single hand such a one man power could not have be a healthful influence in the republic even though exercise under the general supervision of an interstate commission

 do we desire to make such ruthless combination and monopoly lawful when all energy be direct not toward the reduction of the cost of production for the public benefit by a healthful competition but toward new way and mean for make permanent in a few hand the absolute control of the condition and price prevail in the whole field of industry then individual enterprise and effort will be paralyze and the spirit of commercial freedom will be dead

 the year just pass mark an important general movement on the part of the powers for broad arbitration in the recognition of the manifold benefit to mankind in the extension of the policy of the settlement of international dispute by arbitration rather than by war and in response to a widespread demand for an advance in that direction on the part of the people of the united states and of great britain and of france new arbitration treaty be negotiate last spring with great britain and france the term of which be de sign as express in the preamble of these treaty to extend the scope and obligation of the policy of arbitration adopt in our present treaty with those government to pave the way for this treat with the united states great britain negotiate an important modification in its alliance with japan and the french government also expedite the negotiation with signal good will the new treaty have be submit to the senate and be await its advice and consent to their ratification all the essential of these important treaty have long be know and it be my earnest hope that they will receive prompt and favorable action

 claim of alsop amp co settled

 i be glad to report that on july 5 last the american claim of alsop amp co. against the government of chile be finally dispose of by the decision of his britannic majesty george v to whom as amiable compositeur the matter have be refer for determination his majesty make an award of nearly $ 1,000,000 to the claimant which be promptly pay by chile the settlement of this controversy have happily eliminate from the relation between the republic of chile and the united states the only question which for two decade have give the two foreign office any serious concern and make possible the unobstructed development of the relation of friendship which it have be the aim of this government in every possible way to far and cultivate

 arbitration panama and costa rica colombia and haiti

 in further illustration of the practical and beneficent application of the principle of arbitration and the underlie broad spirit of conciliation i be happy to advert to the part of the united states in facilitate amicable settlement of dispute which menace the peace between panama and costa rica and between haiti and the dominican republic

 since the date of their independence colombia and costa rica have be seek a solution of a boundary dispute which come as an heritage from colombia to the new republic of panama upon its begin life as an independent nation although the disputant have submit this question for decision to the president of france under the term of an arbitration treaty the exact interpretation of the provision of the award render have be a matter of serious disagreement between the two country both contend for widely different line even under the term of the decision subsequently and since t903 this boundary question bad be the subject of fruitless diplomatic negotiation between the party in january 1910 at the request of both government the agent represent they meet in conference at the department of state and subsequently conclude a protocol submit this long pende controversy to the arbitral judgment of the chief justice of the united states who consent to act in this capacity a boundary commission accord to the international agreement have now be appoint and it be expect that the argument will shortly proceed and that this long stand dispute will be honorably and satisfactorily terminate

 again a few month ago it appear that the dominican republic and haiti be about to enter upon hostility because of complication grow out of an acrimonious boundary dispute which the effort of many year have fail to solve the government of the united states by a friendly interposition of good office succeed in prevail upon the party to place their reliance upon some form of pacific settlement accordingly on the friendly suggestion of this government the two government empower commissioner to meet at washington in conference at the state department in order to arrange the term of submission to arbitration of the boundary controversy

 chamizal arbitration not satisfactory

 our arbitration of the chamizal boundary question with mexico be unfortunately abortive but with the earnest effort on the part of both government which its importance command it be feel that an early practical adjustment should prove possible

 latin america

 venezuela

 during the past year the republic of venezuela celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of its independence the united states send in honor of this event a special embassy to caracas where the cordial reception and generous hospitality show it be most gratifying as a further proof of the good relation and friendship exist between that country and the united states

 mexico

 the recent political event in mexico receive attention from this government because of the exceedingly delicate and difficult situation create along our southern border and the necessity for take measure properly to safeguard american interest the government of the united states in its desire to secure a proper observance and enforcement of the so call neutrality statute of the federal government issue direction to the appropriate officer to exercise a diligent and vigilant regard for the requirement of such rule and law although a condition of actual armed conflict exist there be no official recognition of belligerency involve the technical neutrality obligation of international law

 on the 6th of march last in the absence of the secretary of state i have a personal interview with mr. wilson the ambassador of the united states to mexico in which he report to i that the condition in mexico be much more critical than the press dispatch disclose that president diaz be on a volcano of popular uprising that the small outbreak which have occur be only symptomatic of the whole condition that a very large per cent of the people be in sympathy with the insurrection that a general explosion be probable at any time in which case he fear that the 40,000 or more american resident in mexico might be assail and that the very large american investment might be injure or destroy

 after a conference with the secretary of war and the secretary of the navy i think it wise to assemble an army division of full strength at san antonio tex a brigade of three regiment at galveston a brigade of infantry in the los angeles district of southern california together with a squadron of battleship and cruiser and transport at galveston and a small squadron of ship at san diego at the same time through our representative at the city of mexico i express to president diaz the hope that no apprehension might result from unfounded conjecture as to these military maneuver and assure he that they have no significance which should cause concern to his government

 the mobilization be effect with great promptness and on the 15th of march through the secretary of war and the secretary of the navy in a letter address to the chief of staff i issue the following instruction

 it seem my duty as commander in chief to place troop in sufficient number where if congress shall direct that they enter mexico to save american life and property an effective movement may be promptly make meantime the movement of the troop to texas and elsewhere near the boundary accompany with sincere assurance of the utmost goodwill toward the present mexican government and with large and more frequent patrol along the border to prevent insurrectionary expedition from american soil will hold up the hand of the exist government and will have a healthy moral effect to prevent attack upon americans and their property in any subsequent general internecine strife again the sudden mobilization of a division of troop have be a great test of our army and full of useful instruction while the maneuver that be thus make possible can occupy the troop and their officer to great advantage

 the assumption by the press that i contemplate intervention on mexican soil to protect american life or property be of course gratuitous because i seriously doubt whether i have such authority under any circumstance and if i have i would not exercise it without express congressional approval indeed as you know i have already decline without mexican consent to order a troop of cavalry to protect the breakwater we be construct just across the border in mexico at the mouth of the colorado river to save the imperial valley although the insurrecto have scatter the mexican troop and be take our horse and supply and frightening our workman away my determined purpose however be to be in a position so that when danger to american life and property in mexico threaten and the exist government be render helpless by the insurrection i can promptly execute congressional order to protect they with effect

 meantime i send you this letter through the secretary to call your attention to some thing in connection with the presence of the division in the southwest which have doubtless occur to you but which i wish to emphasize

 in the first place i want to make the mobilization a first class training for the army and i wish you would give your time and that of the war college to advise and carry out maneuver of a useful character and plan to continue to do this during the next three month by that time we may expect that either ambassador wilson 's fear will have be realize and chaos and its consequence have ensue or that the present government of mexico will have so readjust matter as to secure tranquillity a result devoutly to be wish the troop can then be return to their post i understand from you in washington that gen. aleshire say that you could probably meet all the additional expense of this whole movement out of the present appropriation if the troop continue in texas for three month i sincerely hope this be so i observe from the newspaper that you have no blank cartridge but i presume that this be an error or that it will be easy to procure those for use as soon as your maneuver begin

 second texas be a state ordinarily peaceful but you can not put 20,000 troop into it without run some risk of a collision between the people of that state and especially the -mexican who live in texas near the border and who sympathize with the insurrecto and the federal soldier for that reason i beg you to be as careful as you can to prevent friction of any kind we be able in cuba with the army of pacification there of something more than 5,000 troop to maintain they for a year without any trouble and i hope you can do the same thing in texas please give your attention to this and advise all the officer in command of the necessity for very great circumspection in this regard

 third one of the great trouble in the concentration of troop be the danger of disease and i suppose that you have adopt the most modern method for prevent and if necessary for stamp out epidemic that be so much a part of a campaign that it hardly seem necessary for i to call attention to it

 finally i wish you to examine the question of the patrol of the border and put as many troop on that work as be practicable and more than be now engage in it in order to prevent the use of our borderland for the carrying out of the insurrection i have give assurance to the mexican ambassador on this point

 i sincerely hope that this experience will always be remember by the army and navy as a useful mean of education and i should be greatly disappointed if it result in any injury or disaster to our force from any cause i have take a good deal of responsibility in order this mobilization but i be ready to answer for it if only you and those under you use the utmost care to avoid the difficulty which i have point out

 you may have a copy of this letter make and leave with gen. carter and such other general in command as you may think wise and necessary to guide they in their course but to be regard as confidential

 i be more than happy to here record the fact that all apprehension as to the effect of the presence of so large a military force in texas prove groundless no disturbance occur the conduct of the troop be exemplary and the public reception and treatment of they be all that could have be desire and this notwithstanding the presence of a large number of mexican refugee in the border territory

 from time to time communication be receive from ambassador wilson who have return to mexico confirm the view that the massing of american troop in the neighborhood have have good effect by dispatch of april 3 1911 the ambassador say

 the continue gravity of the situation here and the chaos that would ensue should the constitutional authority be eventually overthrow thus greatly increase the danger to which american life and property be already subject confirm the wisdom of the president in take those military precaution which make every allowance for the dignity and the sovereignty of a friendly state be due to our national abroad

 charge as i be with the responsibility of safeguard these life and property i be bind to say to the department that our military disposition on the frontier have produce an effective impression on the mexican mind and may at any moment prove to be the only guaranty for the safety of our national and their property if it should eventuate that condition here require more active measure by the president and congress sporadic attack might be make upon the life and property of our national but the ultimate result would be order and adequate protection

 the insurrection continue and result in engagement between the regular mexican troop and the insurgent and this along the border so that in several instance bullet from the contending force strike american citizen engage in their lawful occupation on american soil

 proper protest be make against these invasion of american right to the mexican authority on april 17 1911 1 receive the follow telegram from the governor of arizona

 as a result of to day 's fighting across the international line but within gunshot range of the heart of douglas five americans wound on this side of the line everything point to repetition of these casualty on to morrow and while the federal seem disposed to keep their agreement not to fire into douglas the position of the insurrectionist be such that when fighting occur on the east and southeast of the intrenchment people live in douglas be put in danger of their life in my judgment radical measure be need to protect our innocent people and if anything can be do to stop the fighting at agua prieta the ittiation call for such action it be impossible to safeguard the people of douglas unless the town be vacate can anything be do to relieve situation now acute

 after a conference with the secretary of state the follow telegram be send to governor sloan on april is 1911 9 11 and make public

 your dispatch receive have make urgent demand upon mexican government to issue instruction to prevent fire across border by mexican federal troop and be wait reply meantime i have send direct warning to the mexican and insurgent force near douglas i infer from your dispatch that both party attempt to heed the warning but that in the strain and exigency of the contest wild bullet still find their way into douglas the situation might justify i in order our troop to cross the border and attempt to stop the fighting or to fire upon both combatant from the american side but if i take this step i must face the possibility of resistance and great bloodshed and also the danger of have our motive misconstrue and misrepresent and of thus inflame mexican popular indignation against many thousand americans now in mexico and jeopardize their life and property the pressure for general intervention under such condition it might not be practicable to resist it be impossible to foresee or reckon the consequence of such a course and we must use the great self restraint to avoid it pende my urgent representation to the mexican government i can not therefore order the troop at douglas to cross the border but i must ask you and the local authority in case the same danger recur to direct the people of douglas to place themselves where bullet can not reach they and thus avoid casualty i be loath to endanger americans in mexico where they be necessarily expose by take a radical step to prevent injury to americans on our side of the border who can avoid it by a temporary inconvenience

 i be glad to say that no further invasion of american right of any substantial character occur

 the presence of a large military and naval force available for prompt action near the mexican border prove to be most fortunate under the somewhat try condition present by this invasion of american right have no movement theretofore take place and because of these event it have be necessary then to bring about the mobilization it must have bad sinister significance on the other hand the presence of the troop before and at the time of the unfortunate killing and wounding of american citizen at douglas make clear that the restraint exercise by our government in regard to this occurrence be not due to lack of force or power to deal with it promptly and aggressively but be due to a real desire to use every mean possible to avoid direct intervention in the affair of our neighbor whose friendship we value and be most anxious to retain

 the policy and action of this government be base upon an earnest friendliness for the mexican people as a whole and it be a matter of gratification to note that this attitude of strict impartiality as to all faction in mexico and of sincere friendship for the neighboring nation without regard for party allegiance have be generally recognize and have result in an even close and more sympathetic understanding between the two republics and a warm regard one for the other action to suppress violence and restore tranquillity throughout the mexican republic be of peculiar interest to this government in that it concern the safeguarding of american life and property in that country the government of the united states have occasion to accord permission for the passage of a body of mexican rurale through douglas arizona to tia juana mexico for the suppression of general lawlessness which bad for some time exist in the region of northern lower california on may 25 1911 president diaz resign senor de la barra be choose provisional president election for president and vice president be thereafter hold throughout the republic and senor francisco 1 madero be formally declare elect on october 15 to the chief magistracy on november 6 president madero enter upon the duty of his office

 since the inauguration of president madero a plot have be unearth against the present government to begin a new insurrection pursue the same consistent policy which this administration have adopt from the beginning it direct an investigation into the conspiracy charge and this investigation have result in the indictment of gen. bernardo reyes and other and the seizure of a number of officer and man and horse and accoutrement assemble upon the soil of texas for the purpose of invade mexico similar proceeding have be take during the insurrection against the diaz government result in the indictment and prosecution of person find to be engage in violate the neutrality law of the united states in aid of that uprising

 the record of this government in respect of the recognition of constituted authority in mexico therefore be clear

 international opium commission

 in a special message transmit to the congress on the 11th of january 19ii in which i concur in the recommendation make by the secretary of state in regard to certain needful legislation for the control of our interstate and foreign traffic in opium and other menacing drug i quote from my annual message of december 7 1909 in which i announce that the result of the international opium commission hold at shanghai in february 1909 at the invitation of the united states have be lay before this government that the report of that commission show that china be make remarkable progress and admirable effort toward the eradication of the opium evil that the interested government have not permit their commercial interest to prevent their cooperation in this reform and as a result of collateral investigation of the opium question in this country i recommend that the manufacture sale and use of opium in the united states should be more rigorously control by legislation

 prior to that time and in continuation of the policy of this government to secure the cooperation of the interested nation the united states propose an international opium conference with full power for the purpose of clothing with the force of international law the resolution adopt by the above mention commission together with their essential corollary the other power concern cordially respond to the proposal of this government and i be glad to be able to announce representative of all the power assemble in conference at the hague on the first of this month

 since the passage of the opium exclusion act more than twenty states have be animate to modify their pharmacy law and bring they in accord with the spirit of that act thus stamp out to a measure the intrastate traffic in opium and other habit form drug but although i have urge on the congress the passage of certain measure for federal control of the interstate and foreign traffic in these drug no action have yet be take in view of the fact that there be now sit at the hague so important a conference which have under review the municipal law of the different nation for the mitigation of their opium and other allied evil a conference which will certainly deal with the international aspect of these evil it seem to i most essential that the congress should take immediate action on the anti narcotic legislation to which i have already call attention by a special message

 foreign trade relation of tyte united states

 in my last annual message i refer to the tariff negotiation of the department of state with foreign country in connection with the application by a series of proclamation of the minimum tariff of the united states to importation from the several country and i state that in its general operation section 2 of the new tariff law have prove a guaranty of continue commercial peace although there be unfortunately instance where foreign government deal arbitrarily with american interest within their jurisdiction in a manner injurious and inequitable during the past year some instance of discriminatory treatment have be remove but i regret to say that there remain a few case of differential treatment adverse to the commerce of the united states while none of these instance now appear to amount to undue discrimination in the sense of section 2 of the tariff law of august 5 1909 they be all exception to that complete degree of equality of tariff treatment that the department of state have consistently seek to obtain for american commerce abroad

 while the double tariff feature of the tariff law of 1909 have be amply justify by the result achieve in remove former and prevent new undue discrimination against american commerce it be believe that the time have come for the amendment of this feature of the law in such way as to provide a graduated mean of meet vary degree of discriminatory treatment of american commerce in foreign country as well as to protect the financial interest abroad of american citizen against arbitrary and injurious treatment on the part of foreign government through either legislative or administrative measure

 it would seem desirable that the maximum tariff of the united states should embrace within its purview the free list which be not the case at the present time in order that it might have reasonable significance to the government of those country from which the importation into the united states be confine virtually to article on the free list

 record of highest amount of foreign trade

 facility for foreign trade furnished by joint action of department of state and of commerce and labor

 there be widespread appreciation express by the business interest of the country as regard the practical value of the facility now offer by the department of state and the department of commerce and labor for the furtherance of american commerce conference with their officer at washington who have an expert knowledge of trade condition in foreign country and with consular officer and commercial agent of the department of commerce and labor who while on leave of absence visit the principal industrial center of the united states have be find of great value these trade conference be regard as a particularly promising method of governmental aid in foreign trade promotion the department of commerce and labor have arrange to give publicity to the expect arrival and the itinerary of consular officer and commercial agent while on leave in the united states in order that trade organization may arrange for conference with they

 as i have indicate it be increasingly clear that to obtain and maintain that equity and substantial equality of treatment essential to the flourish foreign trade which become year by year more important to the industrial and commercial welfare of the united states we should have a flexibility of tariff sufficient for the give and take of negotiation by the department of state on behalf of our commerce and industry

 crying need for american merchant marine

 i need hardly reiterate the conviction that there should speedily be build up an american merchant marine this be necessary to assure favorable transportation facility to our great ocean bear commerce as well as to supplement the navy with an adequate reserve of ship and man it would have the economic advantage of keep at home part of the vast sum now pay foreign shipping for carry american good all the great commercial nation pay heavy subsidy to their merchant marine so that it be obvious that without some wise aid from the congress the united states must lag behind in the matter of merchant marine in its present anomalous position

 extension of american banking to foreign country

 legislation to facilitate the extension of american bank to foreign country be another matter in which our foreign trade need assistance

 chamber of foreign commerce suggest

 the interest of our foreign commerce be nonpartisan and as a factor in prosperity be as broad as the land in the dissemination of useful information and in the coordination of effort certain unofficial association have do good work toward the promotion of foreign commerce it be cause for regret however that the great number of such association and the comparative lack of cooperation between they fail to secure an efficiency commensurate with the public interest through the agency of the department of commerce and labor and in some case directly the department of state transmit to reputable business interest information of commercial opportunity supplement the regular publish consular report some central organization in touch with association and chamber of commerce throughout the country and able to keep purely american interest in close touch with different phase of commercial affair would i believe be of great value such organization might be manage by a committee compose of a small number of those now actively carry on the work of some of the large association and there might be add to the committee as member ex officio one or two official of the department of state and one or two official from the department of commerce and labor and representative of the appropriate committee of congress the authority and success of such an organization would evidently be enhance if the congress should see fit to prescribe its scope and organization through legislation which would give to it some such official standing as that for example of the national red cross

 with these factor and the continuance of the foreign service establishment departmental diplomatic and consular upon the high plane where it have be place by the recent reorganization this government would be abreast of the time in foster the interest of its foreign trade and the rest must be leave to the energy and enterprise of our business man

 improvement of the foreign service

 the entire foreign service organization be be improve and develop with especial regard to the requirement of the commercial interest of the country the rapid growth of our foreign trade make it of the utmost importance that governmental agency through which that trade be to be aid and protect should possess a high degree of efficiency not only should the foreign representative be maintain upon a generous scale in so far as salary and establishment be concern but the selection and advancement of officer should be definitely and permanently regulate by law so that the service shall not fail to attract man of high character and ability the experience of the past few year with a partial application of civil service rule to the diplomatic and consular service leave no doubt in my mind of the wisdom of a wide and more permanent extension of those principle to both branch of the foreign service the man select for appointment by mean of the exist executive regulation have be of a far high average of intelligence and ability than the man appoint before the regulation be promulgate moreover the feeling that under the exist rule there be reasonable hope for permanence of tenure during good behavior and for promotion for meritorious service have serve to bring about a zealous activity in the interest of the country which never before exist or could exist it be my earnest conviction that the enactment into law of the general principle of the exist regulation can not fail to effect further improvement in both branch of the foreign service by provide great inducement for young man of character and ability to seek a career abroad in the service of the government and an incentive to those already in the service to put forth great effort to attain the high standard which the successful conduct of our international relation and commerce require

 i therefore again commend to the favorable action of the congress the enactment of a law apply to the diplomatic and consular service the principle embody in section 1753 of the revised statutes of the united states in the civil service act of january 16 1883 and the executive order of june 27 1906 and of november 26 1909 in its consideration of this important subject i desire to recall to the attention of the congress the very favorable report make on the lowden bill for the improvement of the foreign service by the foreign affairs committee of the house of representatives available statistic show the strictness with which the merit system have be apply to the foreign service during recent year and the absolute nonpartisan selection of consul and diplomatic service secretary who indeed far from be select with any view to political consideration have actually be choose to a disproportionate extent from states which would have be unrepresente in the foreign service under the system which it be to be hope be now permanently obsolete some legislation for the perpetuation of the present system of examination and promotion upon merit and efficiency would be of great value to our commerical and international interest

 part iii

 the white house december 20 1911

 to the senate and house of representatives

 in my annual message to congress december 1909 i state that under section 2 of the act of august 5 1909 i have appoint a tariff board of three member to cooperate with the state department in the administration of the maximum and minimum clause of that act to make a glossary or encyclopedia of the exist tariff so as to render its term intelligible to the ordinary reader and then to investigate industrial condition and cost of production at home and abroad with a view to determine to what extent exist tariff rate actually exemplify the protective principle viz that duty should be make adequate and only adequate to equalize the difference in cost of production at home and abroad

 i far state that i believe these investigation would be of great value as a basis for accurate legislation and that i should from time to time recommend to congress the revision of certain schedule in accordance with the finding of the board

 in the last session of the sixty first congress a bill create a permanent tariff board of five member of whom not more than three should be of the same political party pass each house but fail of enactment because of slight difference on which agreement be not reach before adjournment an appropriation act provide that the permanent tariff board if create by statute should report to congress on schedule k in december 1911

 therefore to carry out so far as lie within my power the purpose of this bill for a permanent tariff board i appoint in march 19li a board of five add two member of such party affiliation as would have fulfil the statutory requirement and direct they to make a report to i on schedule k of the tariff act in december of this year

 in my message of august 17 1911 accompany the veto of the wool bill i say that in my judgment schedule k should be revise and the rate reduce my veto be base on the ground that since the tariff board would make in december a detailed report on wool and wool manufacture with special reference to the relation of the exist rate of duty to relative cost here and abroad public policy and a fair regard to the interest of the producer and the manufacturer on the one hand and of the consumer on the other demand that legislation should not be hastily enact in the absence of such information that i be not myself possess at that time of adequate knowledge of the fact to determine whether or not the propose act be in accord with my pledge to support a fair and reasonable protective policy that such legislation might prove only temporary and inflict upon a great industry the evil of continued uncertainty

 i now herewith submit a report of the tariff board on schedule k. the board be unanimous in its finding on the basis of these finding i now recommend that the congress proceed to a consideration of this schedule with a view to its revision and a general reduction of its rate

 the report show that the present method of assess the duty on raw wool this be by a specific rate on the grease pound i. e. unscoured -operate to exclude wool of high shrinkage in scour but fine quality from the american market and thereby lessen the range of wool available to the domestic manufacturer that the duty on scour wool of 33 cent per pound be prohibitory and operate to exclude the importation of clean low price foreign wool of inferior grade which be nevertheless valuable material for manufacturing and which can not be import in the grease because of their heavy shrinkage such wool if import might be use to displace the cheap substitute now in use

 to make the precede paragraph a little plainer take the instance of a hundred pound of first class wool import under the present duty which be 11 11 cent a pound that would make the duty on the hundred pound $ 11 the merchantable part of the wool thus import be the weight of the wool of this hundred pound after scour if the wool shrink 80 per cent as some wool do then the duty in such a case would amount to $ 11 $ 11 on 20 pound of scour wool this of course would be prohibitory if the wool shrink only 50 per cent it would be $ 11 on 50 pound of wool and this be near to the average of the great bulk of wool that be import from australia which be the principal source of our import wool

 these discrimination could be overcome by assess a duty in ad valorem term but this method be open to the objection first that it increase administrative difficulty and tend to decrease revenue through undervaluation and second that as price advance the ad valorem rate increase the duty per pound at the time when the consumer most need relief and the producer can well stand competition while if price decline the duty be decrease at the time when the consumer be least burden by the price and the producer most need protection

 another method of meet the difficulty of tax the grease pound be to assess a specific duty on grease wool in term of its scour content this obviate the chief evil of the present system namely the discrimination due to different shrinkage and thereby tend greatly to equalize the duty the board report that this method be feasible in practice and could be administer without great expense the scour content of the wool be the basis on which user of wool make their calculation and a duty of this kind would fit the usage of the trade one effect of this method of assessment would be that regardless of the rate of duty there would be an increase in the supply and variety of wool by make available to the american market wool of both low and fine quality now exclude

 the report show in detail the difficulty involve in attempt to state in categorical term the cost of wool production and the great difference in cost as between different region and different type of wool it be find however that take all variety in account the average cost of production for the whole american clip be high than the cost in the chief compete country by an amount somewhat less than the present duty

 the report show that the duty on noil wool waste and shoddy which be adjust to the rate of 33 cent on scour wool be prohibitory in the same measure that the duty on scour wool be prohibitory in general they be assess at rate as high as or high than the duty pay on the clean content of wool actually import they should be reduce and so adjusted to the rate on wool as to bear their proper proportion to the real rate levy on the actual wool import

 the duty on many class of wool manufacture be prohibitory and greatly in excess of the difference in cost of production here and abroad

 this be true of top of yarn with the exception of worsted yarn of a very high grade and of low and medium grade cloth of heavy weight

 on top up to 52 cent a pound in value and on yarn of 65 cent in value the rate be 100 per cent with correspondingly high rate for low value on cheap and medium grade cloth the exist rate frequently run to 150 per cent and on some cheap good to over 200 per cent this be largely due to that part of the duty which be levy ostensibly to compensate the manufacturer for the enhance cost of his raw material due to the duty on wool as a matter of fact this compensatory duty for numerous class of good be much in excess of the amount need for strict compensation

 on the other hand the finding show that the duty which run to such high ad valorem equivalent be prohibitory since the good be not import but that the price of domestic fabric be not raise by the full amount of duty on a set of 1 yard sample of 16 english fabric which be completely exclude by the present tariff rate it be find that the total foreign value be $ 41.84 the duty which would have be assess have these fabric be import $ 76.90 the foreign value plus the amount of the duty $ 118.74 or a nominal duty of 183 per cent in fact however practically identical fabric of domestic make sell at the same time at $ 69.75 show an enhance price over the foreign market value of but 67 per cent

 although these duty do not increase price of domestic good by anything like their full amount it be none the less true that such prohibitive duty eliminate the possibility of foreign competition even in time of scarcity that they form a temptation to monopoly and conspiracie to control domestic price that they be much in excess of the difference in cost of production here and abroad and that they should be reduce to a point which accord with this principle

 the finding of the board show that in this industry the actual manufacturing cost aside from the question of the price of material be much high in this country than it be abroad that in the making of yarn and cloth the domestic woolen or worsted manufacturer have in general no advantage in the form of superior machinery or more efficient labor to offset the high wage pay in this country the finding show that the cost of turn wool into yarn in this country be about double that in the lead compete country and that the cost of turn yarn into cloth be somewhat more than double under the protective policy a great industry involve the welfare of hundred of thousand of people have be establish despite these handicap

 in recommend revision and reduction i therefore urge that action be take with these fact in mind to the end that an important and established industry may not be jeopardize

 the tariff board report that no equitable method have be find to levy purely specific duty on woolen and worst fabric and that except for a compensatory duty the rate must be ad valorem on such manufacture it be important to realize however that no flat ad valorem rate on such fabric can be make to work fairly and effectively any single rate which be high enough to equalize the difference in manufacturing cost at home and abroad on highly finish good involve such labor would be prohibitory on cheap good in which the labor cost be a small proportion of the total value conversely a rate only adequate to equalize this difference on cheap good would remove protection from the fine good manufacture the increase in which have be one of the striking feature of the trade 's development in recent year i therefore recommend that in any revision the importance of a graduated scale of ad valorem duty on cloth be carefully consider and apply

 i venture to say that no legislative -body have ever have present to it a more complete and exhaustive report than this on so difficult and complicated a subject as the relative cost of wool and woolens the world over it be a monument to the thoroughness industry impartiality and accuracy of the man engage in its making they be choose from both political party but have allow no partisan spirit to prompt or control their inquiry they be unanimous in their finding i feel sure that after the report have be print and study the value of such a compendium of exact knowledge in respect to this schedule of the tariff will convince all of the wisdom of make such a board permanent in order that it may treat each schedule of the tariff as it have treat this and then keep its bureau of information up to date with current change in the economic world

 it be no part of the function of the tariff board to propose rate of duty their function be merely to present finding of fact on which rate of duty may be fairly determined in the light of adequate knowledge in accord with the economic policy to be follow this be what the present report do

 the finding of fact by the board show ample reason for the revision downward of schedule k in accord with the protective principle and present the datum as to relative cost and price from which may be determine what rate will fairly equalize the difference in production cost i recommend that such revision be proceed with at once

 part iv

 on the financial condition of the treasury need banking and currency reform and departmental question

 the white house december 21 1911

 to the senate and house of representatives

 the financial condition of the government as show at the close of the last fiscal year june 30 1911 be very satisfactory the ordinary receipt into the general fund exclude postal revenue amount to $ 701,372,374.99 and the disbursement from the general fund for current expense and capital outlay exclude postal and panama canal disbursement include the interest on the public debt amount to $ 654,137,907 89 leave a surplus of $ 47,234,377.10

 the postal revenue receipt amount to $ 237,879,823,60 while the payment make for the postal service from the postal revenue amount to $ 237,660,705.48 which leave a surplus of postal receipt over disbursement of $ 219,118.12 the first time in 27 year in which a surplus occur

 the interest bear debt of the united states june 30 1911 amount to $ 915,353,igo the debt on which interest have cease amount to $ 1,879,830.26 and the debt bear no interest include greenback national bank note to be redeem and fractional currency amount to $ 386,751,917 43 or a total of interest and noninterest bear debt amount to $ 1,303,984,937.69

 the actual disbursement exclusive of those for the panama canal and for the postal service for the year end june 30 1911 be $ 654,137,997.89 the actual disbursement for the year end june 30 1910 exclusive of the panama canal and the postal service disbursement be $ 659,705,391.08 make a decrease of $ 5,567,393.19 in yearly expenditure in the year 1911 under that of 1910 for the year end june 30 1912 the estimate receipt exclusive of the postal revenue be $ 666,000,000 while the total estimate exclusive of those for the panama canal and the postal expenditure payable from the postal revenue amount to $ 645,842,799.34 this be a decrease in the 1912 estimate from that of the 1911 estimate of $ 1,534,367 22

 for the year end june 30 1913 the estimate receipt exclusive of the postal revenue be $ 667,000,000 while the total estimate appropriation exclusive of the panama canal and postal disbursement payable from postal revenue will amount to $ 637,920,803.35 this be a decrease in the 1913 estimate from that of the 1912 estimate of $ 7,921,995.99

 as to the postal revenue the expansion of the business in that department the normal increase in the post office and the extension of the service will increase the outlay to the sum of $ 260,938,463 but as the department be self sustain this year the postmaster general be assure that next year the receipt will at least equal the expenditure and probably exceed they by more than the surplus of this year it be fair and equitable therefore in determine the economy with which the government have be run to exclude the transaction of a department like the post office department which rely for its support upon its receipt in calculation heretofore make for comparison of economy in each year it have be the proper custom only to include in the statement the deficit in the post office department which be pay out of the treasury

 a calculation of the actual increase in the expense of government arise from the increase in the population and the general expansion of governmental function except those of the post office for a number of year show a normal increase of about 4 per cent a year by direct the exercise of great care to keep down the expense and the estimate we have succeed in reduce the total disbursement each year

 the credit of the united states

 the credit of this government be show to be well than that of any other government by the sale of the panama canal 3 per cent bond these bond do not give their owner the privilege of use they as a basis for bank note circulation nor be there any other privilege extend to they which would affect their general market value their sale therefore measure the credit of the government the premium which be realize upon the bond make the actual interest rate of the transaction 2.909 per cent

 efficiency and economy in the treasury department

 i in the treasury department the efficiency and economy work have be keep steadily up provision be make for the elimination of 134 position during the come year two hundred and sixty seven statutory position be eliminate during the last year in the office of the treasury in washington and 141 position in the year 1910 make an elimination of 542 statutory position since march 4 1909 and this have be do without the discharge of anybody because the normal resignation and death have be equal to the elimination of the place a system of transfer having take care of the person whose position be drop out in the field service if the department too 1,259 position have be eliminate down to the present time make a total net reduction of all treasury position to the number of 1,801 meantime the efficiency of the work of the departmeat have increase

 monetary reform

 a matter of first importance that will come before congress for action at this session be monetary reform the congress have itself arrange an early introduction of this great question through the report of its monetary commission this commission be appoint to recommend a solution of the banking and currency problem so long confront the nation and to furnish the fact and datum necessary to enable the congress to take action the commission be appoint when an impressive and urgent popular demand for legislative relief suddenly arise out of the distressing situation of the people cause by the deplorable panic of 1907 the congress decide that while it could not give immediately the relief require it would provide a commission to furnish the mean for prompt action at a later date

 in order to do its work with thoroughness and precision this commission have take some time to make its report the country be undoubtedly hope for as prompt action on the report as the convenience of the congress can permit the recognition of the gross imperfection and mark inadequacy of our banking and currency system even in our most quiet financial period be of long standing and later there have mature a recognition of the fact that our system be responsible for the extraordinary devastation waste and business paralysis of our recur period of panic though the member of the monetary commission have for a considerable time be work in the open and while large number of the people have be openly work with they and while the press have largely note and discuss this work as it have proceed so that the report of the commission promise to represent a national movement the detail of the report be still be consider i can not therefore do much more at this time than commend the immense importance of monetary reform urge prompt consideration and action when the commission 's report be receive and express my satisfaction that the plan to be propose promise to embrace main feature that having meet the approval of a great preponderance of the practical and professional opinion of the country be likely to meet equal approval in congress

 it be exceedingly fortunate that the wise and undisputed policy of maintain unchanged the main feature of our banking system render it at once impossible to introduce a central bank for a central bank would certainly have be resist and a plan into which it could have be introduce would probably have be defeat but as a central bank could not be a part of the only plan discuss or consider that troublesome question be eliminate and ingenious and novel as the propose national reserve association appear it simply be a logical outgrowth of what be good in our present system and be in fact the fulfillment of that system

 exactly how the management of that association should be organize be a question still open it seem to be desirable that the bank which would own the association should in the main manage it it will be an agency of the bank to act for they and they can be trust well than anybody else chiefly to conduct it it be mainly banker work but there must be some form of government supervision and ultimate control and i favor a reasonable representation of the government in the management i entertain no fear of the introduction of politic or of any undesirable influence from a properly measure government representation

 i trust that all bank of the country possess the requisite standard will be place upon a footing of perfect equality of opportunity both the national system and the state system should be fairly recognize leave they eventually to coalesce if that shall prove to be their tendency but such evolution can not develop impartially if the bank of one system be give or permit any advantage of opportunity over those of the other system and i trust also that the new legislation will carefully and completely protect and assure the individuality and the independence of each bank to the end that any tendency there may ever be toward a consolidation of the money or banking power of the nation shall be defeat

 it will always be possible of course to correct any feature of the new law which may in practice prove to be unwise so that while this law be sure to be enact under condition of unusual knowledge and authority it also will include it be well to remember the possibility of future amendment

 with the present prospect of this long await reform encourage we it would be singularly unfortunate if this monetary question should by any chance become a party issue and i sincerely hope it will not the exceeding amount of consideration it have receive from the people of the nation have be wholly nonpartisan and the congress set its nonpartisan seal upon it when the monetary commission be appoint in commend the question to the favorable consideration of congress i speak for and in the spirit of the great number of my fellow citizen who without any thought of party or partisanship feel with remarkable earnestness that this reform be necessary to the interest of all the people

 the war department

 there be now before congress a dill the purpose of which be to increase the efficiency and decrease the expense of the army it contain four principal feature first a consolidation of the general staff with the adjutant general 's and the inspector general 's departments second a consolidation of the quartermaster 's department with the subsistence and the pay departments third the creation of an army service corps and fourth an extension of the enlistment period from three to five year

 with the establishment of an army service corps as propose in the bill i be thoroughly in accord and be convinced that the establishment of such a corps will result in a material economy and a very great increase of efficiency in the army it have repeatedly be recommend by i and my predecessor i also believe that a consolidation of the staff corps can be make with a result increase in efficiency and economy but not along the line provide in the bill under consideration

 i be oppose to any plan the result of which would be to break up or interfere with the essential principle of the detail system in the staff corps establish by the act of february 2 1901 and i be oppose to any plan the result of which would be to give to the officer select as chief of staff or to any other member of the general staff corps great permanency of office than he now have under the exist law neither the chief of staff nor any other member of the general staff corps can remain in office for a period of more than four year and there must be an interval of two year between successive tour of duty

 the bill refer to provide that certain person shall become permanent member of the general staff corps and that certain other be subject to redetail without an interval of two year such provision be fraught with danger to the welfare of the army and

 would practically nullify the main purpose of the law create the

 in make the consolidation no reduction should be make in the total number of officer of the army of whom there be now too few to perform the duty impose by law i have in the past recommend an increase in the number of officer by 6oo in order to provide sufficient officer to perform all class of staff duty and tc reduce the number of line officer detach from their command congress at the last session increase the total number of officer by 2oo but this be not enough promotion in the line of the army be too slow officer do not attain command rank at an age early enough properly to exercise it it would be a mistake far to retard this already slow promotion by throw back into the line of the arm a number of high rank officer to be absorb as be rovide in the

 another feature of the bill which i believe to be a mistake be the propose increase in the term of enlistment from three to five ear i believe it would be well to enlist man for six year release they at the end of three year from active service and put they in reserve for the remain three year reenlistment should be largely confine to the noncommissioned officer and other enlisted man in the skilled grade this plan by the payment of a comparatively small compensation during the three year of reserve would keep a large bodv of man at the call of the government train and ready for

 the army of the united states be in good condition it show itself able to meet an emergency in the successful mobilization of an army division of from i5,ooo to 2o ooo man which take place along the border of mexico during the recent disturbance in that country the marvelous freedom from the ordinary camp disease of typhoid fever and measle be refer to in the report of the secretary of war and show such an effectiveness in the sanitary regulation and treatment of the medical corps and in the discipline of the army itself as to invoke the high commendation

 memorial amphitheater at arlington

 i beg to renew my recommendation of last year that the congress appropriate for a memorial amphitheater at arlington va. the fund require to construct it upon the plan already approve

 the panama canal

 the very satisfactory progress make on the panama canal last year have continue and there be every reason to believe that the canal

 will be complete as early as the 1st of july 1913 unless something unforeseen occur this be about 18 month before the time promise by the engineer

 we be now near enough the completion of the canal to make it imperatively necessary that legislation should be enact to fix the method by which the canal shall be maintain and control and the zone govern the fact be that to day there be no statutory law by authority of which the president be maintain the government of the zone such authority be give in an amendment to the spooner act which expire by the term of its own limitation some year ago since that time the government have continue under the advice of the attorney general that in the absence of action by congress there be necessarily an imply authority on the part of the executive to maintain a government in a territory in which he have to see that the law be execute the fact that we have be able thus to get along during the important day of construction without legislation expressly formulate the government of the zone or delegate the creation of it to the president be not a reason for suppose that we may continue the same kind of a government after the construction be finish the imply authority of the president to maintain a civil government in the zone may be derive from the mandatory direction give he in the original spooner act by which he be command to build the canal but certainly now that the canal be about to be complete and to be put under a permanent management there ought to be specific statutory authority for its regulation and control and for the government of the zone which we hold for the chief and main purpose of operate the canal

 i fully concur with the secretary of war that the problem be simply the management of a great public work and not the government of a local republic that every provision must be direct toward the successful maintenance of the canal as an avenue of commerce and that all provision for the government of those who live within the zone should be subordinate to the main purpose

 the zone be 40 mile long and 10 mile wide now it have a population of 50,000 or 60,000 but as soon as the work of construction be complete the town which make up this population will be desert and only comparatively few native will continue their residence there the control of they ought to approximate a military government one judge and two justice of the peace will be sufficient to attend to all the judicial and litigated business there be with a few fundamental law of congress the zone should be govern by the order of the president issue through the war department as it be today provision can be make for the guaranty of life liberty and property but beyond those the government should be that of a military reservation manage in connection with this great highway of trade

 furnish supply and repairs

 in my last annual message i discuss at length the reason for the government 's assume the task of furnish to all ship that use the canal whether our own naval vessel or other the supply of coal and oil and other necessity with which they must be replenish either before or after pass through the canal together with the dock facility and repair of every character this it be think wise to do through the government because the government must establish for itself for its own naval vessel large depot and dry dock and warehouse and these may easily be enlarge so as to secure to the world public use the canal reasonable price and a certainty that there will be no discrimination between those who wish to avail themselves of such facility

 toll

 i renew my recommendation with respect to the toll of the canal that within limit which shall seem wise to congress the power of fix toll be give to the president in order to arrive at a proper conclusion there must be some experiment and this can not be do if congress do not delegate the power to one who can act expeditiously

 power exists to relieve american shipping

 i be very confident that the united states have the power to relieve from the payment of toll any part of our shipping that congress deem wise we own the canal it be our money that build it we have the right to charge toll for its use those toll must be the same to everyone but when we be deal with our own ship the practice of many government of subsidize their own merchant vessel be so well establish in general that a subsidy equal to the toll an equivalent remission of toll can not be hold to be a discrimination in the use of the canal the practice in the suez canal make this clear the experiment in toll to be make by the president would doubtless disclose how great a burden of toll the coastwise trade between the atlantic and the pacific coast could bear without prevent its usefulness in competition with the transcontinental railroad one of the chief reason for build the canal be to set up this competition and to bring the two shore close together as a practical trade problem it may be that the toll will have to be wholly remit i do not think this be the good principle because i believe that the cost of such a government work as the panama canal ought to be impose gradually but certainly upon the trade which it create and make possible so far as we can consistent with the development of the world 's trade through the canal and the benefit which it be intend to secure to the east and west coastwise trade we ought to labor to secure from the canal toll a sufficient amount ultimately to meet the debt which we have assume and to pay the interest

 the philippine islands

 in respect to the philippines i urgently join in the recommendation of the secretary of war that the act of february 6 1905 limit the indebtedness that may be incur by the philippine government for the construction of public work be increase from $ 5,000,000 to $ 15,ooo ooo the finance of that government be in excellent condition the maximum sum mention be quite low as compare with the amount of indebtedness of other government with similar resource and the success which have attend the expenditure of the $ 5,000,000 in the useful improvement of the harbor and other place in the islands justifie and require additional expenditure for like purpose

 naturalization

 i also join in the recommendation that the legislature of the philippine islands be authorize to provide for the naturalization of filipinos and other who by the present law be treat as alien so as to enable they to become citizen of the philippine islands

 friar land

 pende an investigation by congress at its last session through one of its committee into the disposition of the friar land secretary dickinson direct that the friar land should not be sell in excess of the limit fix for the public land until congress should pass upon the subject or should have conclude its investigation this order have be an obstruction to the disposition of the land and i expect to direct the secretary of war to return to the practice under the opinion of the attorney general which will enable we to dispose of the land much more promptly and to prepare a sink fund with which to meet the $ 7,000,000 of bond issue for the purchase of the land i have no doubt whatever that the attorney general 's construction be a proper one and that it be in the interest of everyone that the land shall be promptly dispose of the danger of create a monopoly of ownership in land under the statute as construe be nothing there be only two tract of 60,000 acre each unimproved and in remote province that be likely to be dispose of in bulk and the rest of the land be subject to the limitation that they shall be first offer to the present tenant and lessor who hold they in small tract

 river and harbors

 the estimate for the river and harbor improvement reach $ 32,000,000 for the come year i wish to urge that whenever a project have be adopt by congress as one to be complete the more money which can be economically expend in its construction in each year the great the ultimate economy this have especial application to the improvement of the mississippi river and its large branch it seem to i that an increase in the amount- of money now be annually expend in the improvement of the ohio river which have be formally adopt by congress would be in the interest of the public a similar change ought to be make during the present congress in the amount to be appropriate for the missouri river the engineer say that the cost of the improvement of the missouri river from kansas city to st. louis in order to secure 6 foot as a permanent channel will reach $ 20,000,000 there have be at least three recommendation from the chief of engineers that if the improvement be adopt $ 2,000,000 should be expend upon it annually this particular improvement be especially entitle to the attention of congress because a company have be organize in kansas city with a capital of $ 1,000,000 which have build steamer and barge and be actually use the river for transportation in order to show what can be do in the way of affect rate between kansas city and st. louis and in order to manifest their good faith and confidence in respect of the improvement i urgently recommend that the appropriation for this improvement be increase from $ 600,000 as recommend now in the completion of a contract to $ 2,000,000 annually so that the work may be do in 10 year

 waterway from the lakes to the gulf

 the project for a navigable waterway from lake michigan to the mouth of the illinois river and thence via the mississippi to the gulf of mexico be one of national importance in view of the work already accomplish by the sanitary district of chicago an agency of the state of illinois which have construct the most difficult and costly stretch of this waterway and make it an asset of the nation and in view of the fact that the people of illinois have authorize the expenditure of $ 20,000,000 to carry this waterway 62 mile far to utica i feel that it be fitting that this work should be supplement by the government and that the expenditure recommend by the special board of engineer on the waterway from utica to the mouth of the illinois river be make upon line which while provide a waterway for the nation should otherwise benefit that state to the full extent i recommend that the term of service of say special board of engineer be continue and that it be empower to reopen the question of the treatment of the low illinois river and to negotiate with a properly constitute commission represent the state of illinois and to agree upon a plan for the improvement of the low illinois river and upon the extent to which the united states may properly cooperate with the state of illinois in secure the construction of a navigable waterway from lockport to the mouth of the illinois river in conjunction with the development of water power by that state between lockport and utica

 the department of justice

 removal of clerk of federal court

 the report of the attorney general show that he have subject to close examination the account of the clerk of the federal court that he have find a good many which disclose irregularity or dishonesty but that he have have considerable difficulty in secure an effective prosecution or removal of the clerk thus derelict i be certainly not unduly prejudiced against the federal court but the fact be that the long and confidential relation which grow out of the tenure for life on the part of the judge and the practical tenure for life on the part of the clerk be not calculate to secure the strictness of deal by the judge with the clerk in respect to his fee and account which assure in the clerk 's conduct a freedom from overcharge and carelessness the relationship between the judge and the clerk make it ungracious for member of the bar to complain of the clerk or for department examiner to make charge against he to be hear by the court and an order of removal of a clerk and a judgment for the recovery of fee be in some case reluctantly enter by the judge for this reason i recommend an amendment to the law whereby the president shall be give power to remove the clerk for cause this provision need not interfere with the right of the judge to appoint his clerk or to remove he

 french spoliation award

 in my last message i recommend to congress that it authorize the payment of the finding or judgment of the court of claims in the matter of the french spoliation case there have be no appropriation to pay these judgment since 1905 the finding and award be obtain after a very bitter fight the government succeed in about 75 per cent of the case the amount of the award ought as a matter of good faith on the part of the government to be pay

 e mployer liability and workmen 's compensation commission

 the limitation of the liability of the master to his servant for personal injury to such as be occasion by his fault have be abandon in most civilized country and provision make whereby the employee injure in the course of his employment be compensate for his loss of working ability irrespective of negligence the principle upon which such provision proceed be that accidental injury to workman in modern industry with its vast complexity and inherent danger arise from complicated machinery and the use of the great force of steam and electricity should be regard as risk of the industry and the loss bear in some equitable proportion by those who for their own profit engage therein in recognition of this the last congress authorize the appointment of a commission to investigate the subject of employer liability and workman 's compensation and to report the result of their investigation through the president to congress this commission be appoint and have be at work hold hearing gather datum and consider the subject and it be expect will be able to report by the first of the year in accordance with the provision of the law it be hope and expect that the commission will suggest legislation which will enable we to put in the place of the present wasteful and sometimes unjust system of employer liability a plan of compensation which will afford some certain and definite relief to all employee who be injure in the course of their employment in those industry which be subject to the regulating power of congress

 measures to prevent delay and unnecessary cost of litigation

 in promotion of the movement for the prevention of delay and unnecessary cost in litigation i be glad to say that the supreme court have take step to reform the present equity rule of the federal court and that we may in the near future expect a revision of they which will be a long step in the right direction

 on january 3 1911 postal saving depository be establish experimentally in 48 states and territories after three month successful operation the system be extend as rapidly as feasible to the 7,500 post office of the first second and third class constitute the presidential grade by the end of the year practically all of these will have be designate and then the system will be extend to all fourth class post office do a money order business

 in select post office for depository consideration be give to the efficiency of the postmaster and only those office where the rating be satisfactory to the department have be designate withhold designation from postmaster with unsatisfactory rating have have a salutary effect on the service

 the deposit have keep pace with the extension of the system amount to only $ 60,652 at the end of the first month 's operation in the experimental office they increase to $ 679,310 by july and now after 11 month of operation have reach a total of $ 11,000,000 this sum be distribute among 2,71o bank and protect tinder the law by bond deposit with the treasurer of the united states

 under the method adopt for the conduct of the system certificate be issue as evidence of deposit and account with depositor be keep by the post office instead of by the department compare with the practice in other country of enter deposit in pass book and keep at the central office a ledger account with each depositor the use of the certificate have result in great economy of administration

 the depositor thus far number approximately 150,000 they include 40 nationality native americans largely predominate and english and italians come next

 the first conversion of deposit into united states bond bear interest at the rate of 2.5 per cent occur on july 1 1911 the amount of deposit exchange be $ 41,900 or a little more than 6 per cent of the total outstanding certificate of deposit on june 30 of this issue bond to the value of $ 6,120 be in coupon form and $ 35,780 in register form

 parcel post

 step should be take immediately for the establishment of a rural parcel post in the estimate of appropriation need for the maintenance of the postal service for the ensue fiscal year an item of $ 150,000 have be insert to cover the preliminary expense of establish a parcel post on rural mail route as well as to cover an investigation have for its object the final establishment of a general parcel post on all railway and steamboat transportation route the department believe that after the initial expense of establish the system be defray and the parcel post be in full operation on the rural route it will not only bring in sufficient revenue to meet its cost but also a surplus that can be utilize in pay the expense of a parcel post in the city delivery service

 it be hope that congress will authorize the immediate establishment of a limited parcel post on such rural route as may be select provide for the delivery along the route of parcel not exceed eleven pound which be the weight limit for the international parcel post or at the post office from which such route emanate or on another route emanating from the same office such preliminary service will prepare the way for the more thorough and comprehensive inquiry contemplate in ask for the appropriation mention enable the department to gain definite information concern the practical operation of a general system and at the same time extend the benefit of the service to a class of people who above all other be specially in need of it

 the suggestion that we have a general parcel post have awaken great opposition on the part of some who think that it will have the effect to destroy the business of the country storekeeper instead of do this i think the change will greatly increase business for the benefit of all the reduction in the cost of live it will bring about ought to make its come certain

 the navy department

 on the 2d of november last i review the fight fleet of battleship and other vessel assemble in new york harbor consist of 24 battleship 2 armored cruiser 2 cruiser 22 destroyer 12 torpedo boat 8 submarine and other attendant vessel make 98 vessel of all class of a tonnage of 576,634 ton those who see the fleet be strike with its preparedness and with its high military efficiency all americans should be proud of its personnel

 the fleet be deficient in the number of torpedo destroyer in cruiser and in collier as well as in large battleship cruiser which be now become a very important feature of foreign navy notably the british german and japanese

 the building plan for this year contemplate two battleship and two collier this be because the other and small vessel can be build much more rapidly in case of emergency than the battleship and we certainly ought to continue the policy of two battleship a year until after the panama canal be finish and until in our first line and in our reserve line we can number 40 available vessel of proper armament and size

 the reorganization of the navy and the appointment of four aid to the secretary have continue to demonstrate their usefulness it would be difficult now to administer the affair of the navy without the expert counsel and advice of these aid and i renew the recommendation which i make last year that the aid be recognize by statute

 it be certain that the navy with its present size should have admiral in active command high than rear admiral the recognize grade in order be admiral of the fleet admiral vice admiral and rear admiral our great battleship fleet be command by a rear admiral with four other rear admiral under his order this be not as it should be and when question of precedence arise between our naval officer and those of european navy the american rear admiral though in command of ten time the force of a foreign vice admiral must yield precedence to the latter such an absurdity ought not to prevail and it can be avoid by the creation of two or three position of flag rank above that of rear admiral

 i attend the opening of the new training school at north chicago ill. and be glad to note the opportunity which this give for draw upon young man of the country from the interior from farm store shop and office which insure a high average of intelligence and character among they and which they show in the very wonderful improvement in discipline and drill which only a few short week presence at the naval station have make

 i invite your attention to the consideration of the new system of detention and of punishment for army and navy enlist man which have obtain in great britain and which have make greatly for the well control of the man we should adopt a similar system here

 like the treasury department and the war department the navy department have give much attention to economy in administration and have cut down a number of unnecessary expense and reduce its estimate except for construction and the increase that that involve

 i urge upon congress the necessity for an immediate increase of 2,000 man in the enlisted strength of the navy provide for in the estimate four thousand more be now need to man all the available vessel

 there be in the service to day about 47,750 enlisted man of all rating

 careful computation show that in april 1912 49,166 man will be require for vessel in commission and 3,000 apprentice seaman should be keep under training at all time

 abolition of navy yards

 the secretary of the navy have recommend the abolition of certain of the small and unnecessary navy yard and in order to furnish a complete and comprehensive report have refer the question of all navy yard to the joint board of the army and navy this board will shortly make its report and the secretary of the navy advise i that his recommendation on the subject will be present early in the come year the measure of economy contain in a proper handling of this subject be so great and so important to the interest of the nation that i shall present it to congress as a separate subject apart from my annual message concentration of the necessary work for naval vessel in a few navy yard on each coast be a vital necessity if proper economy in government expenditure be to be attain

 amalgamation of staff corps in the navy

 the secretary of the navy be strive to unify the various corp of the navy to the extent possible and thereby stimulate a navy spirit as distinguish from a corps spirit in this he have my warm support

 all officer be to be naval officer first and specialist afterwards this mean that officer will take up at least one specialty such as ordnance construction or engineering this be practically what be do now only some of the specialist like the pay officer and naval constructor be not of the line it be propose to make they all of the line

 all combatant corp should obviously be of the line this necessitate amalgamate the pay officer and also those engage in the technical work of produce the finished ship this be at present the case with the single exception of the naval constructor whom it be now propose to amalgamate with the line

 council of national defense

 i urge again upon congress the desirability of establish the council of national defense the bill to establish this council be before congress last winter and it be hope that this legislation will pass during the present session the purpose of the council be to determine the general policy of national defense and to recommend to congress and to the president such measure relate to it as it shall deem necessary and expedient

 no such machinery be now provide by which the readiness of the army and navy may be improve and the program of military and naval requirement shall be coordinate and properly scrutinize with a view of the necessity of the whole nation rather than of separate department

 department of agriculture and commerce and labor

 for the consideration of matter which be pende or have be dispose of in the agricultural department and in the department of commerce and labor i refer to the very excellent report of the secretary of those department i shall not be able to submit to congress until after the christmas holiday the question of conservation of our resource arise in alaska and the west and the question of the rate for second class mail matter in the post office department

 commission on efficiency and economy

 the law do not require the submission of the report of the commission on economy and efficiency until the 31st of december i shall therefore not be able to submit a report of the work of that commission until the assembling of congress after the holiday

 civil retirement and contributory pension system

 i have already advocate in my last annual message the adoption of a civil service retirement system with a contributory feature to it so as to reduce to a minimum the cost to the government of the pension to be pay after considerable reflection i be very much opposed to a pension system that involve no contribution from the employee i think the experience of other government justify this view but the cry necessity for some such contributory system with possibly a preliminary governmental outlay in order to cover the initial cost and to set the system go at once while the contribution be accumulate be manifest on every side nothing will so much promote the economy and efficiency of the government as such a system

 elimination of all local offices from politics

 i wish to renew again my recommendation that all the local office throughout the country include collector of internal revenue collector of custom postmaster of all four class immigration commissioner and marshal should be by law cover into the classified service the necessity for confirmation by the senate be remove and the president and the other whose time be now take up in distribute this patronage under the custom that have prevail since the beginning of the government in accordance with the recommendation of the senators and congressman of the majority party should be relieve from this burden i be confident that such a change would greatly reduce the cost of administer the government and that it would add greatly to its efficiency it would take away the power to use the patronage of the government for political purpose when officer be recommend by senator and congressmen from political motive and for political service render it be impossible to expect that while in office the appointee will not regard their tenure as more or less dependent upon continue political service for their patron and no regulation however stiff or rigid will prevent this because such regulation in view of the method and motive for selection be plainly inconsistent and deem hardly worthy of respect

part 1 on our foreign relations to the senate and house of representatives the foreign relation of the united states actually and potentially affect the state of the union to a degree not widely realize and hardly surpass by any other factor in the welfare of the whole nation the position of the united states in the moral intellectual and material relation of the family of nation should be a matter of vital interest to every patriotic citizen the national prosperity and power impose upon us duty which we can not shirk if we be to be true to our ideal the tremendous growth of the export trade of the united states have already make that trade a very real factor in the industrial and commercial prosperity of the country with the development of our industry the foreign commerce of the united states must rapidly become a still more essential factor in its economic welfare whether we have a farseeing and wise diplomacy and be not recklessly plunge into unnecessary war and whether our foreign policy be base upon an intelligent grasp of present day world condition and a clear view of the potentiality of the future or be govern by a temporary and timid expediency or by narrow view befit an infant nation be question in the alternative consideration of which must convince any thoughtful citizen that no department of national polity offer great opportunity for promote the interest of the whole people on the one hand or great chance on the other of permanent national injury than that which deal with the foreign relation of the united states the fundamental foreign policy of the united states should be raise high above the conflict of partisanship and wholly dissociate from difference as to domestic policy in its foreign affair the united states should present to the world a united front the intellectual financial and industrial interest of the country and the publicist the wage earner the farmer and citizen of whatever occupation must cooperate in a spirit of high patriotism to promote that national solidarity which be indispensable to national efficiency and to the attainment of national ideal the relation of the united states with all foreign power remain upon a sound basis of peace harmony and friendship a great insistence upon justice to american citizen or interest wherever it may have be deny and a strong emphasis of the need of mutuality in commercial and other relation have only serve to strengthen our friendship with foreign country by place those friendship upon a firm foundation of reality as well as aspiration before briefly review the more important event of the last year in our foreign relation which it be my duty to do as charge with their conduct and because diplomatic affair be not of a nature to make it appropriate that the secretary of state make a formal annual report i desire to touch upon some of the essential to the safe management of the foreign relation of the united states and to endeavor also to define clearly certain concrete policy which be the logical modern corollary of the undisputed and traditional fundamental of the foreign policy of the united states reorganization of the state department at the beginning of the present administration the united states having fully enter upon its position as a world power with the responsibility thrust upon it by the result of the spanish american war and already engage in lay the groundwork of a vast foreign trade upon which it should one day become more and more dependent find itself without the machinery for give thorough attention to and take effective action upon a mass of intricate business vital to american interest in every country in the world the department of state be an archaic and inadequate machine lack most of the attribute of the foreign office of any great modern power with an appropriation make upon my recommendation by the congress on august 5 1909 the department of state be completely reorganize there be create division of latinamerican affairs and of far eastern near eastern and western european affairs to these division be call from the foreign service diplomatic and consular officer possess experience and knowledge gain by actual service in different part of the world and thus familiar with political and commercial condition in the region concern the work be highly specialized the result be that where previously this government from time to time would emphasize in its foreign relation one or another policy now american interest in every quarter of the globe be be cultivate with equal assiduity this principle of politico geographical division possess also the good feature of make possible rotation between the officer of the departmental the diplomatic and the consular branch of the foreign service and thus keep the whole diplomatic and consular establishment tinder the department of state in close touch and equally inspire with the aim and policy of the government through the newly create division of information the foreign service be keep fully informed of what transpire from day to day in the international relation of the country and contemporary foreign comment affect american interest be promptly bring to the attention of the department the law office of the department be greatly strengthen there be add foreigntrade adviser to cooperate with the diplomatic and consular bureaus and the politico geographical division in the innumerable matter where commercial diplomacy or consular work call for such special knowledge the same officer together with the rest of the new organization be able at all time to give to american citizen accurate information as to condition in foreign country with which they have business and likewise to cooperate more effectively with the congress and also with the other executive department merit system in consular and diplomatic corps expert knowledge and professional training must evidently be the essence of this reorganization without a train foreign service there would not be man available for the work in the reorganize department of state president cleveland have take the first step toward introduce the merit system in the foreign service that have be follow by the application of the merit principle with excellent result to the entire consular branch almost nothing however have be do in this direction with regard to the diplomatic service in this age of commercial diplomacy it be evidently of the first importance to train an adequate personnel in that branch of the service therefore on november 26 1909 by an executive order i place the diplomatic service up to the grade of secretary of embassy inclusive upon exactly the same strict nonpartisan basis of the merit system rigid examination for appointment and promotion only for efficiency as have be maintain without exception in the consular service statistics as to merit and nonpartisan character of appointment how faithful to the merit system and how nonpartisan have be the conduct of the diplomatic and consular services in the last four year may be judge from the follow three ambassador now serve hold their present rank at the beginning of my administration of the ten ambassador whom i have appoint five be by promotion from the rank of minister nine minister now serve hold their present rank at the beginning of my administration of the thirty minister whom i have appoint eleven be promote from the low grade of the foreign service or from the department of state of the nineteen mission in latin america where our relation be close and our interest be great fifteen chief of mission be service man three having enter the service during this administration thirty seven secretary of embassy or legation who have receive their initial appointment after pass successfully the require examination be choose for ascertained fitness without regard to political affiliation a dearth of candidate from southern and western states have alone make it impossible thus far completely to equalize all the states representation in the foreign service in the effort to equalize the representation of the various states in the consular service 1 have make sixteen of the twenty nine new appointment as consul which have occur during my administration from the southern states this be 55 per cent every other consular appointment make include the promotion of eleven young man from the consular assistant and student interpreter corps have be by promotion or transfer base solely upon efficiency show in the service in order to assure to the business and other interest of the united states a continuance of the result benefit of this reform i earnestly renew my previous recommendation of legislation make it permanent along some such line as those of the measure now pende in congress larger provision for embassies and legation and for other expense of our foreign representatives recommended in connection with legislation for the amelioration of the foreign service i wish to invite attention to the advisability of place the salary appropriation upon a well basis i believe that the good result would be obtain by a moderate scale of salary with adequate fund for the expense of proper representation base in each case upon the scale and cost of live at each post control by a system of accounting and under the general direction of the department of state in line with the object which i have seek of place our foreign service on a basis of permanency i have at various time advocate provision by congress for the acquisition of government own building for the residence and office of our diplomatic officer so as to place they more nearly on an equality with similar officer of other nation and to do away with the discrimination which otherwise must necessarily be make in some case in favor of man have large private fortune the act of congress which i approve on february 17 1911 be a right step in this direction the secretary of state have already make the limited recommendation permit by the act for any one year and it be my hope that the bill introduce in the house of representatives to carry out these recommendation will be favorably act on by the congress during its present session in some latin american country the expense of governmentowned legation will be less than elsewhere and it be certainly very urgent that in such country as some of the republics of central america and the caribbean where it be peculiarly difficult to rent suitable quarter the representative of the united states should be justly and adequately provide with dignified and suitable official residence indeed it be high time that the dignity and power of this great nation should be fittingly signalize by proper building for the occupancy of the nation 's representative everywhere abroad diplomacy a hand maid of commercial intercourse and peace the diplomacy of the present administration have seek to respond to modern idea of commercial intercourse this policy have be characterize as substitute dollar for bullet it be one that appeal alike to idealistic humanitarian sentiment to the dictate of sound policy and strategy and to legitimate commercial aim it i be an effort frankly direct to the increase of american trade upon the axiomatic principle that the government of the united states shall extend all proper support to every legitimate and beneficial american enterprise abroad how great have be the result of this diplomacy couple with the maximum and minimum provision of the tariff law will be see by some consideration of the wonder ful increase in the export trade of the united states because modern diplomacy be commercial there have be a disposition in some quarter to attribute to it none but materialistic aim how strikingly erroneous be such an impression may be see from a study of the result by which the diplomacy of the united states can be judge successful efforts in promotion of peace in the field of work toward the ideal of peace this government negotiate but to my regret be unable to consummate two arbitration treaty which set the high mark of the aspiration of nation toward the substitution of arbitration and reason for war in the settlement of international dispute through the effort of american diplomacy several war have be prevent or end i refer to the successful tripartite mediation of the argentine republic brazil and the united states between peru and ecuador the bringing of the boundary dispute between panama and costa rica to peaceful arbitration the staying of warlike preparation when haiti and the dominican republic be on the verge of hostility the stopping of a war in nicaragua the halting of internecine strife in honduras the government of the united states be thank for its influence toward the restoration of amicable relation between the argentine republic and bolivia the diplomacy of the united states be active in seek to assuage the remain ill feeling between this country and the republic of colombia in the recent civil war in china the united states successfully join with the other interested power in urge an early cessation of hostility an agreement have be reach between the government of chile and peru whereby the celebrated tacnaarica dispute which have so long embitter international relation on the west coast of south america have at last be adjust simultaneously come the news that the boundary dispute between peru and ecuador have enter upon a stage of amicable settlement the position of the united states in reference to the tacna arica dispute between chile and peru have be one of nonintervention but one of friendly influence and pacific counsel throughout the period during which the dispute in question have be the subject of interchange of view between this government and the two government immediately concern in the general easing of international tension on the west coast of south america the tripartite mediation to which i have refer have be a most potent and beneficent factor china in china the policy of encourage financial investment to enable that country to help itself have have the result of give new life and practical application to the open door policy the consistent purpose of the present administration have be to encourage the use of american capital in the development of china by the promotion of those essential reform to which china be pledge by treaty with the united states and other power the hypothecation to foreign banker in connection with certain industrial enterprise such as the hukuang railway of the national revenue upon which these reform depend lead the department of state early in the administration to demand for american citizen participation in such enterprise in order that the united states might have equal right and an equal voice in all question pertain to the disposition of the public revenue concern the same policy of promote international accord among the power have similar treaty right as ourselves in the matter of reform which could not be put into practical effect without the common consent of all be likewise adopt in the case of the loan desire by china for the reform of its currency the principle of international cooperation in matter of common interest upon which our policy have already be base in all of the above instance have admittedly be a great factor in that concert of the power which have be so happily conspicuous during the perilous period of transition through which the great chinese nation have be pass central america need our help in debt adjustment in central america the aim have be to help such country as nicaragua and honduras to help themselves they be the immediate beneficiary the national benefit to the united states be twofold first it be obvious that the monroe doctrine be more vital in the neighborhood of the panama canal and the zone of the caribbean than anywhere else there too the maintenance of that doctrine fall most heavily upon the united states it be therefore essential that the country within that sphere shall be remove from the jeopardy involve by heavy foreign debt and chaotic national finance and from the ever present danger of international complication due to disorder at home hence the united states have be glad to encourage and support american banker who be willing to lend a help hand to the financial rehabilitation of such country because this financial rehabilitation and the protection of their customhouse from be the prey of wouldbe dictator would remove at one stroke the menace of foreign creditor and the menace of revolutionary disorder the second advantage of the united states be one affect chiefly all the southern and gulf port and the business and industry of the south the republics of central america and the caribbean possess great natural wealth they need only a measure of stability and the mean of financial regeneration to enter upon an era of peace and prosperity bring profit and happiness to themselves and at the same time create condition sure to lead to a flourish interchange of trade with this country i wish to call your especial attention to the recent occurrence in nicaragua for i believe the terrible event record there during the revolution of the past summer the useless loss of life the devastation of property the bombardment of defenseless city the killing and wounding of woman and child the torturing of noncombatant to exact contribution and the suffering of thousand of human being might have be avert have the department of state through approval of the loan convention by the senate be permit to carry out its now well develop policy of encourage the extending of financial aid to weak central american states with the primary object of avoid just such revolution by assist those republic to rehabilitate their finance to establish their currency on a stable basis to remove the customhouse from the danger of revolution by arrange for their secure administration and to establish reliable bank during this last revolution in nicaragua the government of that republic having admit its inability to protect american life and property against act of sheer lawlessness on the part of the malcontent and having request this government to assume that office it become necessary to land over 2,000 marine and bluejacket in nicaragua owe to their presence the constituted government of nicaragua be free to devote its attention wholly to its internal trouble and be thus enable to stamp out the rebellion in a short space of time when the red cross supply send to granada have be exhaust 8,000 person having be give food in one day upon the arrival of the american force our man supply other unfortunate needy nicaraguans from their own haversack i wish to congratulate the officer and man of the united states navy and marine corps who take part in reestablish order in nicaragua upon their splendid conduct and to record with sorrow the death of seven american marine and bluejacket since the reestablishment of peace and order election have be hold amid condition of quiet and tranquility nearly all the american marine have now be withdraw the country should soon be on the road to recovery the only apparent danger now threaten nicaragua arise from the shortage of fund although american banker have already render assistance they may naturally be loath to advance a loan adequate to set the country upon its foot without the support of some such convention as that of june 1911 upon which the senate have not yet act enforcement of neutrality law in the general effort to contribute to the enjoyment of peace by those republic which be near neighbor of the united states the administration have enforce the so call neutrality statute with a new vigor and those statute be greatly strengthen in restrict the exportation of arm and munition by the joint resolution of last march it be still a regrettable fact that certain american port be make the rendezvous of professional revolutionist and other engage in intrigue against the peace of those republics it must be admit that occasionally a revolution in this region be justify as a real popular movement to throw off the shackle of a vicious and tyrannical government such be the nicaraguan revolution against the zelaya regime a nation enjoy our liberal institution can not escape sympathy with a true popular movement and one so well justified in very many case however revolution in the republic in question have no basis in principle but be due merely to the machination of conscienceless and ambitious man and have no effect but to bring new suffering and fresh burden to an already oppress people the question whether the use of american port as foci of revolutionary intrigue can be well deal with by a further amendment to the neutrality statute or whether it would be safe to deal with special case by special law be one worthy of the careful consideration of the congress visit of secretary knox to central america and the caribbean impress with the particular importance of the relation between the united states and the republics of central america and the caribbean region which of necessity must become still more intimate by reason of the mutual advantage which will be present by the opening of the panama canal i direct the secretary of state last february to visit these republic for the purpose of give evidence of the sincere friendship and good will which the government and people of the united states bear toward they ten republic be visit everywhere he be receive with a cordiality of welcome and a generosity of hospitality such as to impress i deeply and to merit our warm thank the appreciation of the government and people of the country visit which have be appropriately show in various way leave i no doubt that his visit will conduce to that close union and well understanding between the united states and those republic which i have have it much at heart to promote our mexican policy for two year revolution and counter revolution have distraught the neighboring republic of mexico brigandage have involve a great deal of depredation upon foreign interest there have constantly recur question of extreme delicacy on several occasion very difficult situation have arise on our frontier throughout this try period the policy of the united states have be one of patient nonintervention steadfast recognition of constitute authority in the neighboring nation and the exertion of every effort to care for american interest i profoundly hope that the mexican nation may soon resume the path of order prosperity and progress to that nation in its sore trouble the sympathetic friendship of the united states have be demonstrate to a high degree there be in mexico at the beginning of the revolution some thirty or forty thousand american citizen engage in enterprise contribute greatly to the prosperity of that republic and also benefit the important trade between the two country the investment of american capital in mexico have be estimate at $ 1,000,000,000 the responsibility of endeavor to safeguard those interest and the danger inseparable from propinquity to so turbulent a situation have be great but i be happy to have be able to adhere to the policy above outline a policy which i hope may be soon justify by the complete success of the mexican people in regain the blessing of peace and good order agricultural credit a most important work accomplish in the past year by the american diplomatic officer in europe be the investigation of the agricultural credit system in the european country both as a means to afford relief to the consumer of this country through a more thorough development of agricultural resource and as a means of more sufficiently maintain the agricultural population the project to establish credit facility for the farmer be a concern of vital importance to this nation no evidence of prosperity among well establish farmer should blind we to the fact that lack of capital be prevent a development of the nation 's agricultural resource and an adequate increase of the land under cultivation that agricultural production be fast fall behind the increase in population and that in fact although these well establish farmer be maintain in increase prosperity because of the natural increase in population we be not develop the industry of agriculture we be not breed in proportionate number a race of independent and independence love landowner for a lack of which no growth of city can compensate our farmer have be our mainstay in time of crisis and in future it must still largely be upon their stability and common sense that this democracy must rely to conserve its principle of self government the need of capital which american farmer feel to day have be experience by the farmer of europe with their century old farm many year ago the problem have be successfully solve in the old world and it be evident that the farmer of this country might profit by a study of their system i therefore order through the department of state an investigation to be make by the diplomatic officer in europe and i have lay the result of this investigation before the governor of the various states with the hope that they will be use to advantage in their forthcoming meeting increase of foreign trade in my last annual message i say that the fiscal year end june 30 1911 be noteworthy as mark the high record of export of american product to foreign country the fiscal year 1912 show that this rate of advance have be maintain the total domestic export have a valuation approximately of $ 2,200,000,000 as compare with a fraction over $ 2,000,000,000 the previous year it be also significant that manufactured and partly manufacture article continue to be the chief commodity form the volume of our augmented export the demand of our own people for consumption require that an increase proportion of our abundant agricultural product be keep at home in the fiscal year 1911 the export of article in the various stage of manufacture not include foodstuff partly or wholly manufacture amount approximately to $ 907,500,000 in the fiscal year 1912 the total be nearly $ 1,022,000,000 a gain of $ 114,000,000.advantage of maximum and minimum tariff provision the importance which our manufacture have assume in the commerce of the world in competition with the manufacture of other country again draw attention to the duty of this government to use its utmost endeavor to secure impartial treatment for american product in all market healthy commercial rivalry in international intercourse be well assure by the possession of proper mean for protect and promote our foreign trade it be natural that competitive country should view with some concern this steady expansion of our commerce if in some instance the measure take by they to meet it be not entirely equitable a remedy should be find in former message i have describe the negotiation of the department of state with foreign government for the adjustment of the maximum and minimum tariff as provide in section 2 of the tariff law of 1909 the advantage secure by the adjustment of our trade relation under this law have continue during the last year and some additional case of discriminatory treatment of which we have reason to complain have be remove the department of state have for the first time in the history of this country obtain substantial most favor nation treatment from all the country of the world there be however other instance which while apparently not constitute undue discrimination in the sense of section 2 be nevertheless exception to the complete equity of tariff treatment for american product that the department of state consistently have seek to obtain for american commerce abroad necessity for supplementary legislation these development confirm the opinion convey to you in my annual message of 1911 that while the maximum and minimum provision of the tariff law of 1909 have be fully justify by the success achieve in remove previously exist undue discrimination against american product yet experience have show that this feature of the law should be amend in such way as to provide a fully effective mean of meet the vary degree of discriminatory treatment of american commerce in foreign country still encounter as well as to protect against injurious treatment on the part of foreign government through either legislative or administrative measure the financial interest abroad of american citizen whose enterprise enlarge the market for american commodity i can not too strongly recommend to the congress the passage of some stich enable measure as the bill which be recommend by the secretary of state in his letter of december 13 1911 the object of the propose legislation be in brief to enable the executive to apply as the case may require to any or all commodity whether or not on the free list from a country which discriminate against the united states a graduated scale of duty tip to the maximum of 25 per cent ad valorem provide in the present law flat tariff be out of date nation no long accord equal tariff treatment to all other nation irrespective of the treatment from they receive stich a flexible power at the command of the executive would serve to moderate any unfavorable tendency on the part of those country from which the importation into the united states be substantially confine to article on the free list as well as of the country which find a lucrative market in the united states for their product under exist custom rate it be very necessary that the american government should be equip with weapon of negotiation adapt to modern economic condition in order that we may at all time be in a

the international convention adopt by the conference conform almost entirely to the principle contain in the propose antinarcotic legislation which have be before the last two congress it be most unfortunate that this government having take the initiative in the international action which eventuate in the important international opium convention fail to do its share in the great work by

duty of the united states to assist the republic of liberia in accordance with our historical interest and moral guardianship of a community found by american citizen as it be also the duty of the

during the past summer the revolution against the administration which follow the assassination of president caceres a year ago last november bring the dominican republic to the verge of administrative chaos without offer any guaranty of eventual stability in the ultimate success of either party in pursuance of the treaty relation of the united states with the dominican republic which be threaten by the necessity of suspend the operation under american administration of the customhouse on the haitian frontier it be find necessary to dispatch special commissioner to the island to reestablish the customhouse and with a guard sufficient to insure need protection to the custom administration the effort which have be make appear to have result in the restoration of normal condition throughout the republic the good office which the commissioner be able to exercise be instrumental in bring the contend party together and in furnish a basis of adjustment which it be hope will result in permanent benefit to the dominican people mindful of its treaty relation and owe to the position of the government of the united states as mediator between the dominican republic and haiti in their boundary dispute and because of the further fact that the revolutionary activity on the haitian dominican frontier have become so active as practically to obliterate the line of demarcation that have be heretofore recognize pende the definitive settlement of the boundary in controversy it be find necessary to indicate to the two island government a provisional de facto boundary line this be do without prejudice to the right or obligation of either country in a final settlement to be reach by arbitration the tentative line choose be one which under the circumstance bring to the knowledge of this government seem to conform to the good interest of the disputant the border patrol which it have be find necessary to reestablish for custom purpose between the two country be instruct provisionally to observe this line the republic of cuba last may be in the throe of a lawless uprising that for a time threaten the destruction of a great deal of valuable property much of it own by americans and other foreigner as well as the existence of the government itself the armed force of cuba be inadequate to guard property from attack and at the same time properly to operate against the rebel a force of american marine be dispatch from our naval station at guantanamo into the province of oriente for the protection of american and other foreign life and property the cuban government be thus able to use all its force in put down the outbreak which it succeed in do in a period of six week the presence of two american warship in the harbor of habana during the most critical period of this disturbance contribute in great measure to allay the fear of the inhabitant include a large foreign colony there have be under discussion with the government of cuba for some time the question of the release by this government of its leasehold right at bahia honda on the northern coast of cuba and the enlargement in exchange therefor of the naval station which have be establish at guantanamo bay on the south as the result of the negotiation thus carry on an agreement have be reach between the two government provide for the suitable enlargement of the guantanamo bay station upon term which be entirely fair and equitable to all party concern at the request alike of the government and both political party in panama an american commission undertake supervision of the recent presidential election in that republic where our treaty relation and indeed every geographical consideration make the maintenance of order and satisfactory condition of peculiar interest to the government of the united states the election pass without disorder and the new administration have enter upon its function the government of great britain have ask the support of the united states for the protection of the interest of british holder of the foreign bond debt of guatemala while this government be hopeful of an arrangement equitable to the british bondholder it be naturally unable to view the question apart from its relation to the broad subject of financial stability in central america in which the policy of the united states do not permit it to escape a vital interest through a renewal of negotiation between the government of guatemala and american banker the aim of which be a loan for the rehabilitation of guatemalan finance a way appear to be open by which the government of guatemala could promptly satisfy any equitable and just british claim and at the same time so improve its whole financial position as to contribute greatly to the increase prosperity of the republic and to redound to the benefit of foreign investment and foreign trade with that country fail such an arrangement it may become impossible for the government of the united states to escape its obligation in connection with such measure as may become necessary to exact justice to legitimate foreign claim in the recent revolution in nicaragua which it be generally admit might well have result in a general central american conflict but for the intervention of the united states the government of honduras be especially menace but fortunately peaceful condition be maintain within the border of that republic the financial condition of that country remain unchanged no mean having be find for the final adjustment of press outstanding foreign claim this make it the more regrettable that the financial convention between the united states and honduras have thus far fail of ratification the government of the united states continue to hold itself ready to cooperate with the government of honduras which it be believe can not much long delay the meeting of its foreign obligation and it be hope at the proper time american banker will be willing to cooperate for this purpose necessity for greater governmental effort in retention and expansion of our foreign trade it be not possible to make to the congress a communication upon the present foreign relation of the united states so detailed as to convey an adequate impression of the enormous increase in the importance and activity of those relation if this government be really to preserve to the american people that free opportunity in foreign market which will soon be indispensable to our prosperity even great effort must be make otherwise the american merchant manufacturer and exporter will find many a field in which american trade should logically predominate preempt through the more energetic effort of other government and other commercial nation there be many way in which through hearty cooperation the legislative and executive branch of this government can do much the absolute essential be the spirit of united effort and singleness of purpose i will allude only to a very few specific example of action which ought then to result america can not take its proper place in the most important field for its commercial activity and enterprise unless we have a merchant marine american commerce and enterprise can not be effectively foster in those field unless we have good american bank in the country refer to we need american newspaper in those country and proper mean for public information about they we need to assure the permanency of a train foreign service we need legislation enable the member of the foreign service to be systematically bring in direct contact with the industrial manufacturing and export interest of this country in order that american business man may enter the foreign field with a clear perception of the exact condition to be deal with and the officer themselves may prosecute their work with a clear idea of what american industrial and manufacturing interest require conclusion congress should fully realize the condition which obtain in the world as we find ourselves at the threshold of our middle age as a nation we have emerge full grown as a peer in the great concourse of nation we have pass through various formative period we have be self center in the struggle to develop our domestic resource and deal with our domestic question the nation be now too mature to continue in its foreign relation those temporary expedient natural to a people to whom domestic affair be the sole concern in the past our diplomacy have often consist in normal time in a mere assertion of the right to international existence we be now in a large relation with broad right of our own and obligation to other than ourselves a number of great guide principle be lay down early in the history of this government the recent task of our diplomacy have be to adjust those principle to the condition of to day to develop their corollary to find practical application of the old principle expand to meet new situation thus be be evolve basis upon which can rest the superstructure of policy which must grow with the destine progress of this nation the successful conduct of our foreign relation demand a broad and a modern view we can not meet new question nor build for the future if we confine ourselves to outworn dogma of the past and to the perspective appropriate at our emergence from colonial time and condition the opening of the panama canal will mark a new era in our international life and create new and worldwide condition which with their vast correlation and consequence will obtain for hundred of year to come we must not wait for event to overtake we unawares with continuity of purpose we must deal with the problem of our external relation by a diplomacy modern resourceful magnanimous and fittingly expressive of the high ideal of a great nation part ii on fiscal judicial military and insular affairs the white house december 6 1912.to the senate and house of representatives on the 3d of december i send a message to the congress which be confine to our foreign relation the secretary of state make no report to the president or to congress and a review of the history of the transaction of the state department in one year must therefore be include by the president in his annual message or congress will not be fully informed of they a full discussion of all the transaction of the government with a view to inform the congress of the important event of the year and recommend new legislation require more space than one message of reasonable length afford i have therefore adopt the course of send three or four message during the first ten day of the session so as to include reference to the more important matter that should be bring to the attention of the congress business conditions the condition of the country with reference to business could hardly be well while the four year of the administration now draw to a close have not develop great speculative expansion or a wide field of new investment the recovery and progress make from the depressing condition follow the panic of 1907 have be steady and the improvement have be clear and easily trace in the statistic the business of the country be now on a solid basis credit be not unduly extend and every phase of the situation seem in a state of preparedness for a period of unexampled prosperity manufacturing concern be run at their full capacity and the demand for labor be never so constant and grow the foreign trade of the country for this year will exceed $ 4,000,000,000 while the balance in our favor that of the excess of export over import will

removed be the good time for we to prepare our financial system to withstand a storm the most cry need this country have be a proper banking and currency system the exist one be inadequate and everyone who have study the question admit it it be the business of the national government to provide a medium automatically contract and expand in volume to meet the need of trade our present system lack the indispensable quality of elasticity the only part of our monetary medium that have elasticity be the bank note currency the peculiar provision of the law require national bank to maintain reserve to meet the call of the depositor operate to increase the money stringency when it arise rather than to expand the supply of currency and relieve it it operate upon each bank and furnish a motive for the withdrawal of currency from the channel of trade by each bank to save itself and offer no inducement whatever for the use of the reserve to expand the supply of currency to meet the exceptional demand after the panic of 1907 congress realize that the present system be not adapt to the country 's need and that under it panic be possible that might properly be avoid by legislative provision accordingly a monetary commission be appoint which make a report in february 1912 the system which they recommend involve a national reserve association which be in certain of its faculty and function a bank and which be give through its governing authority the power by issue circulate note for approve commercial paper by fix discount and by other method of transfer of currency to expand the supply of the monetary medium where it be most need to prevent the export or hoarding of gold and generally to exercise such supervision over the supply of money in every part of the country as to prevent a stringency and a panic the stock in this association be to be distribute to the bank of the whole united states state and national in a mixed proportion to bank unit and to capital stock pay in the control of the association be vest in a board of director to be elect by representative of the bank except certain ex officio director three cabinet officer and the comptroller of the currency the president be to appoint the governor of the association from three person to be select by the director while the two deputy governor be to be elect by the board of director the detail of the plan be work out with great care and ability and the plan in general seem to i to furnish the basis for a proper solution of our present difficulty i feel that the government might very properly be give a great voice in the executive committee of the board of director without danger of inject politic into its management but i think the federation system of bank be a good one provide proper precaution be take to prevent bank of large capital from absorb power through ownership of stock in other bank the objection to a central bank it seem to i be obviate if the ownership of the reserve association be distribute among all the bank of a country in which banking be free the earning of the reserve association be limit in percentage tit a reasonable and fix amount and the profit over and above this be to be turn into the government treasury it be quite probable that still great security against control by money center may be work into the plan certain it be however that the objection which be make in the past history of this country to a central bank as furnish a monopoly of financial power to private individual would not apply to an association whose ownership and control be so widely distribute and be divide between all the bank of the country state and national on the one hand and the chief executive through three department head and his comptroller of the currency on the other the ancient hostility to a national bank with its branch in which be concentrate the privilege of do a banking business and carry on the financial transaction of the government have prevent the establishment of such a bank since it be abolish in the jackson administration our present national banking law have obviate objection grow out of the same cause by provide a free banking system in which any set of stockholder can establish a national bank if they comply with the condition of law it seem to i that the national reserve association meet the same objection in a similar way that be by give to each bank state and national in accordance with its size a certain share in the stock of the reserve association nontransferable and only to be hold by the bank while it perform its function as a partner in the reserve association the report of the commission recommend provision for the imposition of a graduate tax on the expand currency of such a character as to furnish a motive for reduce the issue of note whenever their presence in the money market be not require by the exigency of trade in other word the whole system have be work out with the great care theoretically it present a plan that ought to command support practically it may require modification in various of its provision in order to make the security against abuse by combination among the bank impossible but in the face of the crying necessity that there be for improvement in our present system i urgently invite the attention of congress to the propose plan and the report of the commission with the hope that an earnest consideration may suggest amendment and change within the general plan which will lead to its adoption for the benefit of the country there be no class in the community more interested in a safe and sane banking and currency system one which will prevent panic and automatically furnish in each trade center the currency need in the carrying on of the business at that center than the wage earner there be no class in the community whose experience well qualify they to make suggestion as to the sufficiency of a currency and banking system than the banker and business man ought we therefore to ignore their recommendation and reject their financial judgment as to the proper method of reform our financial system merely because of the suspicion which exist against they in the mind of many of our fellow citizen be it not the duty of congress to take up the plan suggest examine it from all standpoint give impartial consideration to the testimony of those whose experience ought to fit they to give the good advice on the subject and then to adopt some plan which will secure the benefit desired?a banking and currency system seem far away from the wage earner and the farmer but the fact be that they be vitally interested in a safe system of currency which shall graduate its volume to the amount need and which shall prevent time of artificial stringency that frighten capital stop employment prevent the meeting of the pay roll destroy local market and produce penury and want the tariff i have regard it as my duty in former message to the congress to urge the revision of the tariff upon principle of protection it be my judgment that the custom duty ought to be revise downward but that the reduction ought not to be below a rate which would represent the difference in the cost of production between the article in question at home and abroad and for this and other reason i veto several bill which be present to i in the last session of this congress now that a new congress have be elect on a platform of a tariff for revenue only rather than a protective tariff and be to revise the tariff on that basis it be needless for i to occupy the time of this congress with argument or recommendation in favor of a protective tariff before pass from the tariff law however know as the payne tariff law of august 5 1909 1 desire to call attention to section 38 of that act assess a special excise tax on corporation it contain a provision require the levy of an additional 50 per cent to the annual tax in case of neglect to verify the prescribed return or to file it before the time require by law this additional charge of 50 per cent operate in some case as a harsh penalty for what may have be a mere inadvertence or unintentional oversight and the law should be so amend as to mitigate the severity of the charge in such instance provision should also be make for the refund of additional taxis heretofore collect because of such infraction in those case where the penalty impose have be so disproportionate to the offense as equitably to demand relief budget the estimate for the next fiscal year have be assemble by the secretary of the treasury and by he transmit to congress i purpose at a late day to submit to congress a form of budget prepare for i and recommend by the president 's commission on economy and efficiency with a view of suggest the useful and inform character of a properly frame budget war department the war department combine within its jurisdiction function which in other country usually occupy three department it not only have the management of the army and the coast defense but its jurisdiction extend to the government of the philippines and of porto rico and the control of the receivership of the custom revenue of the dominican republic it also include the recommendation of all plan for the improvement of harbor and waterway and their execution when adopt and by virtue of an executive order the supervision of the construction of the panama canal army reorganization our small army now consist of 83,809 man exclude the 5,000 philippine scout leave out of consideration the coast artillery force whose position be fix in our various seacoast defense and the present garrison of our various insular possession we have to day within the continental united states a mobile army of only about 35,000 man this little force must be still far draw upon to supply the new garrison for the great naval base which be be establish at pearl harbor in the hawaiian islands and to protect the lock now rapidly approach completion at panama the force remain in the united states be now scatter in nearly 50 post situate for a variety of historical reason in 24 state these post contain only fraction of regiment average less than 700 man each in time of peace it have be our historical policy to administer these unit separately by a geographical organization in other word our army in time of peace have never be a united organization but merely scatter group of company battalion and regiment and the first task in time of war have be to create out of these scatter unit an army fit for effective teamwork and cooperation to the task of meet these patent defect the war department have be address itself during the past year for many year we have no officer or division whose business it be to study these problem and plan remedy for these defect with the establishment of the general staff nine year ago a body be create for this purpose it have necessarily require time to overcome even in its own personnel the habit of mind engender by a century of lack of method but of late year its work have become systematic and effective and it have recently be address itself vigorously to these problem a comprehensive plan of army reorganization be prepare by the war college division of the general staff this plan be thoroughly discuss last summer at a series of open conference hold by the secretary of war and attend by representative from all branch of the army and from congress in print form it have be distribute to member of congress and throughout the army and the national guard and widely through institution of learn and elsewhere in the united states in it for the first time we have a tentative chart for future progress under the influence of this study definite and effective step have be take toward army reorganization so far as such reorganization lie within the executive power hitherto there have be no difference of policy in the treatment of the organization of our foreign garrison from those of troop within the united states the difference of situation be vital and the foreign garrison should be prepare to defend itself at an instant 's notice against a foe who may command the sea unlike the troop in the united states it can not count upon reinforcement or recruitment it be an outpost upon which will fall the brunt of the first attack in case of war the historical policy of the united states of carry its regiment during time of peace at half strength have no application to our foreign garrison during the past year this defect have be remedie as to the philippines garrison the former garrison of 12 reduce regiment have be replace by a garrison of 6 regiment at full strength give fully the same number of rifleman at an estimate economy in cost of maintenance of over $ 1,000,000 per year this garrison be to be permanent its regimental unit instead of be transfer periodically back and forth from the united states will remain in the island the officer and man compose these unit will however serve a regular tropical detail as usual thus involve no great hardship upon the personnel and greatly increase the effectiveness of the garrison a similar policy be propose for the hawaiian and panama garrison as fast as the barrack for they be complete i strongly urge upon congress that the necessary appropriation for this purpose should be promptly make it be in my opinion of first importance that these national outpost upon which a successful home defense will primarily depend should be finish and place in effective condition at the early possible day the home army simultaneously with the foregoing step the war department have be proceed with the reorganization of the army at home the formerly disassociate unit be be unite into a tactical organization of three division each consist of two or three brigade of infantry and so far as practicable a proper proportion of divisional cavalry and artillery of course the extent to which this reform can be carry by the executive be practically limited to a paper organization the scatter unit can be bring under a proper organization but they will remain physically scatter until congress supply the necessary fund for group they in more concentrated post until that be do the present difficulty of drill our scatter group together and thus train they for the proper team play can not be remove but we shall at least have an army which will know its own organization and will be inspect by its proper commander and to which as a unit emergency order can be issue in time of war or other emergency moreover the organization which in many respect be necessarily a skeleton will furnish a guide for future development the separate regiment and company will know the brigade and division to which they belong they will be maneuver together whenever maneuver be establish by congress and the gap in their organization will show the pattern into which can be fill new troop as the nation grow and a large army be provide regular army reserve one of the most important reform accomplish during the past year have be the legislation enact in the army appropriation bill of last summer provide for a regular army reserve hitherto our national policy have assume that at the outbreak of war our regiment would be immediately raise to full strength but our law have provide no mean by which this could be accomplish or by which the loss of the regiment when once send to the front could be repair in this respect we have neglect the lesson learn by other nation the new law provide that the soldier after serve four year with color shall pass into a reserve for three year at his option he may go into the reserve at the end of three year remain there for four year while in the reserve he can be call to active duty only in case of war or other national emergency and when so call and only in such case will receive a stated amount of pay for all of the period in which he have be a member of the reserve the legislation be imperfect in my opinion in certain particular but it be a most important step in the right direction and i earnestly hope that it will be carefully study and perfect by congress the national guard under exist law the national guard constitute after the regular army the first line of national defense its organization discipline training and equipment under recent legislation have be assimilate as far as possible to those of the regular army and its practical efficiency under the effect of this training have very greatly increase our citizen soldier under present condition have reach a stage of development beyond which they can not reasonably be ask to go without further direct assistance in the form of pay from the federal government on the other hand such pay from the national treasury would not be justify unless it produce a proper equivalent in additional efficiency on the part of the national guard the organized militia to day can not be order outside of the limit of the united states and thus can not lawfully be use for general military purpose the officer and man be ambitious and eager to make themselves thus available and to become an efficient national reserve of citizen soldiery they be the only force of train man other than the regular army upon which we can rely the so call militia pay bill in the form agree on between the authority of the war department and the representative of the national guard in my opinion adequately meet these condition and offer a proper return for the pay which it be propose to give to the national guard i believe that its enactment into law would be a very long step toward provide this nation with a first line of citizen soldiery upon which its main reliance must depend in case of any national emergency plan for the organization of the national guard into tactical division on the same line as those adopt for the regular army be be formulate by the war college division of the general staff national volunteers the national guard consist of only about 110,000 man in any serious war in the past it have always be necessary and in such a war in the future it doubtless will be necessary for the nation to depend in addition to the regular army and the national guard upon a large force of volunteer there be at present no adequate provision of law for the raising of such a force there be now pende in congress however a bill which make such provision and which i believe be admirably adapt to meet the exigency which would be present in case of war the passage of the bill would not entail a dollar 's expense upon the government at this time or in the future until war come but if war come the method therein direct be in accordance with the good military judgment as to what they ought to be and the act would prevent the necessity for a discussion of any legislation and the delay incident to its consideration and adoption i earnestly urge its passage consolidation of the supply corps the army appropriation act of 191:2 also carry legislation for the consolidation of the quartermaster 's department the subsistence department and the pay corps into a single supply department to be know as the quartermaster 's corps it also provide for the organization of a special force of enlisted man to be know as the service corps gradually to replace many of the civilian employee engage in the manual labor necessary in every army i believe that both of these enactment will improve the administration of our military establishment the consolidation of the supply corps have already be effect and the organization of the service corps be be put into effect all of the forego reform be in the direction of economy and efficiency except for the slight increase necessary to garrison our outpost in hawaii and panama they do not call for a large army but they do tend to produce a much more efficient one the only substantial new appropriation require be those which as i have point out be necessary to complete the fortification and barrack at our naval basis and outpost beyond the sea porto rico porto rico continue to show notable progress both commercially and in the spread of education its external commerce have increase 17 per cent over the precede year bring the total value up to $ 92,631,886 or more than five time the value of the commerce of the island in 1901 during the year 16o,657 pupils be enrol in the public school as against 145,525 for the precede year and as compare with 26,000 for the first year of american administration special effort be under way for the promotion of vocational and industrial training the need of which be particularly press in the island when the bubonic plague break out last june the quick and efficient response of the people of porto rico to the demand of modern sanitation be strikingly show by the thorough campaign which be institute against the plague and the hearty public opinion which support the government 's effort to check its progress and to prevent its recurrence the failure thus far to grant american citizenship continue to be the only ground of dissatisfaction the bill confer such citizenship have pass the house of representatives and be now await the action of the senate i be heartily in favor of the passage of this bill i believe that the demand for citizenship be just and that it be amply earn by sustained loyalty on the part of the inhabitant of the island but it should be remember that the demand must be and in the mind of most porto ricans be entirely disassociate from any thought of statehood i believe that no substantial approve public opinion in the united states or in porto rico contemplate statehood for the island as the ultimate form of relation between we i believe that the aim to be strive for be the full possible allowance of legal and fiscal self government with american citizenship as to the bond between we in other word a relation analogous to the present relation between great britain and such self govern colony as canada and australia this would conduce to the full and most self sustain development of porto rico while at the same time it would grant she the economic and political benefit of be under the american flag philippines a bill be pende in congress which revolutionize the carefully work out scheme of government under which the philippine islands be now govern and which propose to render they virtually autonomous at once and absolutely independent in eight year stich a proposal can only be found on the assumption that we have now discharge our trusteeship to the filipino people and our responsibility for they to the world and that they be now prepared for selfgovernment as well as national sovereignty a thorough and unbiased knowledge of the fact clearly show that these assumption be absolutely without justification as to this i believe that there be no substantial difference of opinion among any of those who have have the responsibility of face philippine problem in the administration of the island and i believe that no one to whom the future of this people be a responsible concern can countenance a policy fraught with the dire consequence to those on whose behalf it be ostensibly urge in the philippine islands we have embark upon an experiment unprecedented in deal with dependent people we be develop there condition exclusively for their own welfare we find an archipelago contain 24 tribe and race speak a great variety of language and with a population over 80 per cent of which could neither read nor write through the unify force of a common education of commercial and economic development and of gradual participation in local self government we be endeavor to evolve a homogeneous people fit to determine when the time arrive their own destiny we be seek to arouse a national spirit and not as under the old colonial theory to suppress such a spirit the character of the work we have be do be keenly recognize in the orient and our success thus far follow with not a little envy by those who initiate the same policy find themselves hamper by condition grow up in early day and under different theory of administration but our work be far from do our duty to the filipinos be far from discharged over half a million filipino student be now in the philippine school help to mold the man of the future into a homogeneous people but there still remain more than a million filipino child of school age yet to be reach free from american control the integrate force of a common education and a common language will cease and the educational system now well start will slip back into inefficiency and disorder an enormous increase in the commercial development of the island have be make since they be virtually grant full access to our market three year ago with every prospect of increase development and diversified industry free from american control such development be bind to decline every observer speak of the great progress in public work for the benefit of the filipinos of harbor improvement of road and railway of irrigation and artesian well public building and well mean of communication but large part of the island be still unreached still even unexplored road and railway be need in many part irrigation system be still to be instal and well to be drive whole village and town be still without mean of communication other than almost impassable road and trail even the great progress in sanitation which have successfully suppress smallpox the bubonic plague and asiatic cholera have find the cause of and a cure for beriberi have segregate the leper have help to make manila the most healthful city in the orient and to free life throughout the whole archipelago from its former dread disease be nevertheless incomplete in many essential of permanence in sanitary policy even more remain to be accomplish if free from american control sanitary progress be bind to be arrest and all that have be achieve likely to be lose concurrent with the economic social and industrial development of the island have be the development of the political capacity of the people by their progressive participation in government the filipinos be be steadily and hopefully train for self government under spanish control they share in no way in the government under american control they have share largely and increasingly within the last dozen year they have gradually be give complete autonomy in the municipality the right to elect two third of the provincial governing board and the low house of the insular legislature they have four native member out of nine member of the commission or upper house the chief justice and two justice of the supreme court about one half of the high judicial position and all of the justice of the peach be native in the classified civil service the proportion of filipinos increase from 51 per cent in 1904 to 67 per cent in 1911 thus to day all the municipal employee over go per cent of the provincial employee and 60 per cent of the official and employee of the central government be filipinos the ideal which have be keep in mind in our political guidance of the island have be real popular self government and not mere paper independence i be happy to say that the filipinos have do well enough in the place they have fill and in the discharge of the political power with which they have be intrust to warrant the belief that they can be educate and train to complete self government but the present satisfactory result be due to constant support and supervision at every step by americans if the task we have undertake be high than that assume by other nation its accomplishment must demand even more patience we must not forget that we find the filipinos wholly untraine in government up to our advent all other experience seek to repress rather than encourage political power it take long time and much experience to ingrain political habit of steadiness and efficiency popular self government ultimately must rest upon common habit of thought and upon a reasonably develop public opinion no such foundation for selfgovernment let alone independence be now present in the philippine islands disregard even their racial heterogeneity and the lack of ability to think as a nation it be sufficient to point out that under liberal franchise privilege only about 3 per cent of the filipinos vote and only 5 per cent of the people be say to read the public press to confer independence upon the filipinos now be therefore to subject the great mass of their people to the dominance of an oligarchical and probably exploit minority such a course will be as cruel to those people as it would be shameful to we our true course be to pursue steadily and courageously the path we have thus far follow to guide the filipinos into self sustain pursuit to continue the cultivation of sound political habit through education and political practice to encourage the diversification of industry and to realize the advantage of their industrial education by conservatively approve cooperative method at once check the danger of concentrated wealth and build up a sturdy independent citizenship we should do all this with a disinterested endeavor to secure for the filipinos economic independence and to fit they for complete self government with the power to decide eventually accord to their own large good whether such self government shall be accompany by independence a present declaration even of future independence would retard progress by the dissension and disorder it would arouse on our part it would be a disingenuous attempt under the guise of confer a benefit on they to relieve ourselves from the heavy and difficult burden which thus far we have be bravely and consistently sustain it would be a disguised policy of scuttle it would make the helpless filipino the football of oriental politic tinder the protection of a guaranty of their independence which we would be powerless to enforce regulation of water power there be pende before congress a large number of bill propose to grant privilege of erect dam for the purpose of create water power in our navigable river the pendency of these bill have bring out an important defect in the exist general dam act that act do not in my opinion grant sufficient power to the federal government in deal with the construction of such dam to exact protective condition in the interest of navigation it do not permit the federal government as a condition of its permit to require that a part of the value thus create shall be apply to the further general improvement and protection of the stream i believe this to be one of the most important matter of internal improvement now confront the government most of the navigable river of this country be comparatively long and shallow in order that they may be make fully useful for navigation there have come into vogue a method of improvement know as canalization or the slack water method which consist in build a series of dam and lock each of which will create a long pool of deep navigable water at each of these dam there be usually create also water power of commercial value if the water power thus create can be make available for the further improvement of navigation in the stream it be manifest that the improvement will be much more quickly effect on the one hand and on the other that the burden on the general taxpayer of the country will be very much reduce private interest seek permit to build water power dam in navigable stream usually urge that they thus improve navigation and that if they do not impair navigation they should be allow to take for themselves the entire profit of the water power development whatever they may do by way of relieve the government of the expense of improve navigation should be give due consideration but it must be apparent that there may be a profit beyond a reasonably liberal return upon the private investment which be a potential asset of the government in carry out a comprehensive policy of waterway development it be no objection to the retention and use of such an asset by the government that a comprehensive waterway policy will include the protection and development of the other public use of water which can not and should not be ignore in make and execute plan for the protection and development of navigation it be also equally clear that inasmuch as the water power thus create be or may be an incident of a general scheme of waterway improvement within the constitutional jurisdiction of the federal government the regulation of such water power lie also within that jurisdiction in my opinion constructive statesmanship require that legislation should be enact which will permit the development of navigation in these great river to go hand in hand with the utilization of this by product of water power create in the course of the same improvement and that the general dam act should be so amend as to make this possible i deem it highly important that the nation should adopt a consistent and harmonious treatment of these water power project which will preserve for this purpose their value to the government whose right it be to grant the permit any other policy be equivalent to throw away a most valuable national asset the panama canal during the past year the work of construction upon the canal have progress most satisfactorily about 87 per cent of the excavation work have be complete and more than 93 per cent of the concrete for all the lock be in place in view of the great interest which have be manifest as to some slide in the culebra cut i be glad to say that the report of col goethals should allay any apprehension on this point it be gratify to note that none of the slide which occur during this year would have interfere with the passage of the ship have the canal in fact be in operation and when the slope pressure will have be finally adjust and the growth of vegetation will minimize erosion in the bank of the cut the slide problem will be practically solve and an ample stability assure for the culebra cut although the official date of the opening have be set for january 1 1915 the canal will in fact from present indication be open for shipping during the latter half of 1913 no fix date can as yet be set but shipping interest will be advise as soon as assurance can be give that vessel can pass through without unnecessary delay recognize the administrative problem in the management of the canal congress in the act of august 24 1912 have make admirable provision for executive responsibility in the control of the canal and the government of the canal zone the problem of most efficient organization be receive careful consideration so that a scheme of organization and control well adapt to the condition of the canal may be formulate and put in operation as expeditiously as possible act tinder the authority confer on i by congress i have by executive proclamation promulgate the follow schedule of toll for ship pass through the canal base upon the thorough report of emory r. johnson special commissioner on traffic and toll i. on merchant vessel carry passenger or cargo $ 1.20 per net vessel ton each 100 cubic foot of actual earning capacity 2 on vessel in ballast without passenger or cargo 40 per cent less than the rate of toll for vessel with passenger or cargo 3 upon naval vessel other than transport collier hospital ship and supply ship 50 cent per displacement ton 4 upon army and navy transport collier hospital ship and supply ship $ 1.20 per net ton the vessel to be measure by the same rule as be employ in determine the net tonnage of merchant vessel rule for the determination of the tonnage upon which toll charge be base be now in course of preparation and will be promulgate in due season panama canal treaty the proclamation which i have issue in respect to the panama canal toll be in accord with the panama canal act pass by this congress august 24 1912 we have be advise that the british government have prepare a protest against the act and its enforcement in so far as it relieve from the payment of toll american ship engage in the american coastwise trade on the ground that it violate british right tinder the hay pauncefote treaty concern the panama canal when the protest be present it will be promptly consider and an effort make to reach a satisfactory adjustment of any differ ence there may be between the two government workmen 's compensation act the promulgation of an efficient workman 's compensation act adapt to the particular condition of the zone be await adequate appropriation by congress for the payment of claim arise thereunder i urge that speedy provision be make in order that we may install upon the zone a system of settle claim for injury in good accord with modern humane social and industrial theory promotion for col goethals as the completion of the canal grow near and as the wonderful executive work of col goethals become more conspicuous in the eye of the country and of the world it seem to i wise and proper to make provision by law for such reward to he as may be commensurate with the service that he have render to his country i suggest that this reward take the form of an appointment of col goethals as a major general in the army of the united states and that the law authorize such appointment be accompany with a provision permit his designation as chief of engineers upon the retirement of the present incumbent of that office navy department the navy of the united states be in a great state of efficiency and be more powerful than it have ever be before but in the emulation which exist between different country in respect to the increase of naval and military armament this condition be not a permanent one in view of the many improvement and increase by foreign government the slight halt on our part in respect to new construction throw we back and reduce we from a naval power of the first rank and place we among the nation of the second rank in the past 15 year the navy have expand rapidly and yet far less rapidly than our country from now on reduced expenditure in the navy mean reduce military strength the world 's history have show the importance of sea power both for adequate defense and for the support of important and definite policy i have the pleasure of attend this autumn a mobilization of the atlantic fleet and be glad to observe and note the preparedness of the fleet for instant action the review bring before the president and the secretary of the navy a great and more powerful collection of vessel than have ever be gather in american water the condition of the fleet and of the officer and enlisted man and of the equipment of the vessel entitle those in authority to the great credit i again commend to congress the giving of legislative sanction to the appointment of the naval aid to the secretary of the navy these aid and the council of aids appoint by the secretary of the navy to assist he in the conduct of his department have prove to be of the high utility they have furnish an executive com mittee of the most skilled naval expert who have coordinate the action of the various bureaus in the navy and by their advice have enable the secretary to give an administration at the same time economical and most efficient never before have the united states have a navy that compare in efficiency with its present one but never before have the requirement with respect to naval warfare be high and more exact than now a year ago congress refuse to appropriate for more than one battleship in this i think a great mistake of policy be make and i urgently recommend that this congress make tip for the mistake of the last session by appropriation authorize the construction of three battleship in addition to destroyer fuel ship and the other auxiliary vessel as show in the building program of the general board we be confront by a condition in respect to the navy of the world which require we if we would maintain our navy as an insurance of peace to augment our naval force by at least two battleship a year and by battle cruiser gunboat torpedo destroyer and submarine boat in a proper proportion we have no desire for war we would go as far as any nation in the world to avoid war but we be a world power our population our wealth our definite policy our responsibility in the pacific and the atlantic our defense of the panama canal together with our enormous world trade and our missionary outpost on the frontier of civilization require we to recognize our position as one of the foremost in the family of nation and to clothe ourselves with sufficient naval power to give force to our reasonable demand and to give weight to our influence in those direction of progress that a powerful christian nation should advocate i observe that the secretary of the navy devote some space to a change in the disciplinary system in vogue in that branch of the service i think there be nothing quite so unsatisfactory to either the army or the navy as the severe punishment necessarily inflict by court martial for desertion and purely military offense and i be glad to hear that the british have solve this important and difficult matter in a satisfactory way i commend to the consideration of congress the detail of the new disciplinary system and recommend that law be pass put the same into force both in the army and the navy i invite the attention of congress to that part of the report of the secretary of the navy in which he recommend the formation of a naval reserve by the organization of the ex sailor of the navy i repeat my recommendation make last year that proper provision should be make for the rank of the commander in chief of the squadron and fleet of the navy the inconvenience attend the necessary precedence that most foreign admiral have over our own whenever they meet in official function ought to be avoid it impair the prestige of our navy and be a defect that can be very easily remove department of justice this department have be very active in the enforcement of the law it have be well organize and with a large force than ever before in the history of the government the prosecution which have be successfully conclude and which be now pende testify to the effectiveness of the departmental work the prosecution of trust under the sherman antitrust law have go on without restraint or diminution and decree similar to those enter in the standard oil and the tobacco case have be enter in other suit like the suit against the powder trust and the bathtub trust i be very strongly convinced that a steady consistent course in this regard with a continue of supreme court decision upon new phase of the trust question not already finally decide be go to offer a solution of this much discuss and troublesome issue in a quiet calm and judicial way without any radical legislation change the governmental policy in regard to combination now denounce by the sherman antitrust law i have already recommend as an aid in this matter legislation which would declare unlawful certain well know phase of unfair competition in interstate trade and i have also advocate voluntary national incorporation for the large industrial enterprise with provision for a close supervision by the bureau of corporations or a board appoint for the purpose so as to make more certain compliance with the antitrust law on the one hand and to give great security to the stockholder against possible prosecution on the other i believe however that the orderly course of litigation in the court and the regular prosecution of trust charge with the violation of the antitrust law be produce among business man a clear and clear perception of the line of distinction between business that be to be encourage and business that be to be condemn and that in this quiet way the question of trust can be settle and competition retain as an economic force to secure reasonableness in price and freedom and independence in trade reform of court procedure i be glad to bring to the attention of congress the fact that the supreme court have radically alter the equity rule govern the procedure on the equity side of all federal court and though as these change have not be yet put in practice so as to enable we to state from actual result what the reform will accomplish they be of such a character that we can reasonably prophesy that they will greatly reduce the time and cost of litigation in such court the court have adopt many of the short method of the present english procedure and while it may take a little while for the profession to accustom itself to these method it be certain greatly to facilitate litigation the action of the supreme court have be so drastic and so full of appreciation of the necessity for a great reform in court procedure that i have no hesitation in follow tip this action with a recommendation which i foreshadow in my message of three year ago that the section of the statute govern the procedure in the federal court on the common law side should be so amend as to give to the supreme court the same right to make rule of procedure in common law as they have since the beginning of the court exercise in equity i do not doubt that a full consideration of the subject will enable the court while give effect to the substantial difference in right and remedy between the system of common law and the system of equity so to unite the two procedure into the form of one civil action and to shorten the procedure in such civil action as to furnish a model to all the state court exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the federal court of first instance under the statute now in force the common law procedure in each federal court be make to conform to the procedure in the state in which the court be hold in these day when we should be make progress in court procedure such a conformity statute make the federal method too dependent upon the action of state legislature i can but think it a great opportunity for congress to intrust to the high tribunal in this country evidently imbue with a strong spirit in favor of a reform of procedure the power to frame a model code of procedure which while preserve all that be valuable and necessary of the right and remedy at common law and in equity shall lessen the burden of the poor litigant to a minimum in the expedition and cheapness with which his cause can be fight or defend through federal court to final judgment workman 's compensation act the workman 's compensation act report by the special commission appoint by congress and the executive which pass the senate and be now pende in the house the passage of which i have in previous message urge upon congress i venture again to call to its attention the opposition to it which develop in the senate but which be overcome by a majority in that body seem to i to grow out rather of a misapprehension of its effect than of opposition to its principle i say again that i think no act can have a well effect directly upon the relation between the employer and employee than this act apply to railroad and common carrier of an interstate character and i be sure that the passage of the act would greatly relieve the court of the heavy burden of litigation that they have and would enable they to dispatch other business with a speed never before attain in court of justice in this country part iii concern the work of the departments of the post office interior agriculture and commerce and labor and district of columbia the white house december 19 1912.to the senate and house of representatives this be the third of a series of message in which i have bring to the attention of the congress the important transaction of the government in each of its department during the last year and have discuss need reform heads of department should have seat on the floor of congress i recommend the adoption of legislation which shall make it the duty of head of department the member of the president 's cabinet -at convenient time to attend the session of the house and the senate which shall provide seat for they in each house and give they the opportunity to take part in all discussion and to answer question of which they have have due notice the rigid holding apart of the executive and the legislative branch of this government have not work for the great advantage of either there have be much lose motion in the machinery due to the lack of cooperation and interchange of view face to face between the representative of the executive and the member of the two legislative branch of the government it be never intend that they should be separate in the sense of not be in constant effective touch and relationship to each other the legislative and the executive each perform its own appropriate function but these function must be coordinate time and time again debate have arise in each house upon issue which the information of a particular department head would have enable he if present to end at once by a simple explanation or statement time and time again a forceful and earnest presentation of fact and argument by the representative of the executive whose duty it be to enforce the law would have bring about a useful reform by amendment which in the absence of such a statement have fail of passage i do not think i be mistake in say that the presence of the member of the cabinet on the floor of each house would greatly contribute to the enactment of beneficial legislation nor would this in any degree deprive either the legislative or the executive of the independence which separation of the two branch have be intend to promote it would only facilitate their cooperation in the public interest on the other hand i be sure that the necessity and duty impose upon department head of appear in each ilouse and in answer to search question of render upon their foot an account of what they have do or what have be do by the administration will spur each member of the cabinet to close attention to the detail of his department to great familiarity with its need and to great care to avoid the just criticism which the answer bring out in question put and discussion arise between the member of either house and the member of the cabinet may properly evoke objection be make that the member of the administration have no vote could exercise no power on the floor of the house and could not assume that attitude of authority and control which the english parliamentary government have and which enable they to meet the responsibility the english system thrust upon they i agree that in certain respect it would be more satisfactory if member of the cabinet could at the same time be member of both houses with voting power but this be impossible under our system and while a lack of this feature may detract from the influence of the department chief it will not prevent the good result which i have describe above both in the matter of legislation and in the matter of administration the enactment of such a law would be quite within the power of congress without constitutional amendment and it have such possibility of usefulness that we might well make the experiment and if we be disappoint the misstep can be easily retrace by a repeal of the enable legislation this be not a new proposition in the house of representatives in the thirty eighth congress the proposition be refer to a select committee of seven member the committee make an extensive report and urge the adoption of the reform the report show that our history have not be without illustration of the necessity and the example of the practice by point out that in early day secretary be repeatedly call to the presence of either rouse for consultation advice and information it also refer to remark of mr. justice story in his commentaries on the constitution in which he urgently present the wisdom of such a change this report be to be find in volume i of the reports of committees of the first session of the thirty eighth congress april 6 1864.again on february 4 1881 a select committee of the senate recommend the passage of a similar bill and make a report in which while approve the separation of the three branch the executive legislative and judicial they point out as a reason for the propose change that although have a separate existence the branch be to cooperate each with the other as the different member of the human body must cooperate with each other in order to form the figure and perform the duty of a perfect man "the report conclude as follow this system will require the selection of the strong man to be head of department and will require they to be well equipped with the knowledge of their office it will also require the strong man to be the leader of congress and participate in debate it will bring these strong man in contact perhaps into conflict to advance the public weal and thus stimulate their ability and their effort and will thus assuredly result to the good of the country if it should appear by actual experience that the head of department in fact have not time to perform the additional duty impose on they by this bill the force in their office should be increase or the duty devolve on they personally should be diminish an undersecretary should be appoint to whom could be confide that routine of administration which require only order and accuracy the principal officer could then confine their attention to those duty which require wise discretion and intellectual activity thus they would have abundance of time for their duty under this bill indeed your committee believe that the public interest would be subserve if the secretary be relieve of the harass care of distribute clerkship and closely supervise the mere machinery of the department your committee believe that the adoption of this bill and the effective execution of its provision will be the first step toward a sound civil service reform which will secure a large wisdom in the adoption of policy and a well system in their execution.(signe geo h. pendleton w. b. allison d. w. voorhees j. g.

report postal savings bank system the postal savings bank system have be extend so that it now include 4,004 fourth class post office as well as 645 branch office and station in the large city there be now 12,812 depository at which patron of the system may open account the number of depositor be 300,000 and the amount of their deposit be approximately $ 28,000,000 not include $ 1,314,140 which have be with draw by depositor for the purpose of buy postal saving bond experience demonstrate the value of dispense with the pass book and introduce in its place a certificate of deposit the gross

it thus appear that the system lack $ 300,000 a year of pay interest and expense it be estimate however that when the deposit have reach the sum of $ 50,000,000 which at the present rate they soon will do the system will be self sustaining by law the postal saving fund deposit at each post office be require to be redeposit in local bank state and national bank to the number of 7,357 have

recommend the adoption of a system of parcel post in the postal appropriation act of last year a general system be provide and its installation be direct by the 1st of january this have entail upon the post office department a great deal of very heavy labor but the postmaster general inform i that on the date select to wit the 1st of january near at hand the department will be in readiness to meet successfully the requirement of the public classification of postmaster a trial during the past three year of the system of classify fourth class postmaster in that part of the country lie between the mississippi river on the west canada on the north the atlantic ocean on the east and mason and dixon 's line on the south have be sufficiently satisfactory to justify the postal authority in recommend the extension of the order to include all the fourth class postmaster in the country in september 1912 upon the suggestion of the postmaster general i direct he to prepare an order which should put the system in effect except in alaska guam hawaii porto rico and samoa under date of october 15 1 issue such an order which affect 36,000 postmaster by the order the post office be divide into group a and b. group a include all postmaster whose compensation be $ 500 or more and group b those whose compensation be less than that sum different method be pursue in the selection of the postmaster for group a and group b. criticism have be make of this order on the ground that the motive for it be political nothing could be far from the truth the order be make before the election and in the interest of efficient public service i have several time request congress to give i authority to put first- second- and third class postmaster and all other local officer include internal revenue officer custom officer united states marshal and the local agent of the other department under the classification of the civil service law by take away the necessity for confirm such appointment by the senate i deeply regret the failure of congress to follow these recommendation the change would have take out of politic practically every local officer and would have entirely cure the evil grow out of what under the present law must always remain a remnant of the spoils system compensation to railway for carry mail it be expect that the establishment of a parcel post on january 1st will largely increase the amount of mail matter to be transport by the railway and congress should be prompt to provide a way by which they may receive the additional compensation to which they will be entitle the postmaster general urge that the department 's plan for a complete readjustment of the system of pay the railway for carry the mail be adopt substitute space for weight as the principal factor in fix compensation under this plan it will be possible to determine without delay what additional payment should be make on account of the parcel post the postmaster general 's recommendation be base on the result of a far reach investigation begin early in the administration with the object of determine what it cost the railway to carry the mail the statistic obtain during the course of the inquiry show that while many of the railway and particularly the large system be make profit from mail transportation certain of the line be actually carry the mail at a loss as a result of the investigation the department after give the subject careful consideration decide to urge the abandonment of the present plan of fix compensation on the basis of the weight of the mail carry a plan that have prove to be exceedingly expensive and in other respect unsatisfactory under the method propose the railway company will annually submit to the department report show what it cost they to carry the mail and this cost will be apportion on the basis of the car space engage payment to be allow at the rate thus determined in amount that will cover the cost and a reasonable profit if a railway be not satisfied with the manner in which the department apportion the cost in fix compensation it be to have the right tinder the new plan of appeal to the interstate commerce commission this feature of the propose law would seem to insure a fair treatment of the railway it be hope that congress will give the matter immediate attention and that the method of compensation recommend by the department or some other suitable plan will be promptly authorize department of the interior the interior department in the problem of administration include within its jurisdiction present more difficult question than any other this have be due perhaps to temporary cause of a political character but more especially to the inherent difficulty in the performance of some of the function which be assign to it its chief duty be the guardianship of the public domain and the disposition of that domain to private ownership under homestead mining and other law by which patent from the government to the individual be authorize on certain condition during the last decade the public seem to become suddenly aware that a very large part of its domain have pass from its control into private ownership under law not well adapt to modern condition and also that in the doing of this the provision of exist law and regulation adopt in accordance with law have not be strictly observe and that in the transfer of title much fraud have intervene to the pecuniary benefit of dishonest person there arise thereupon a demand for conservation of the public domain its protection against fraudulent diminution and the preservation of that part of it from private acquisition which it seem necessary to keep for future public use the movement excellent in the intention which prompt it and useful in its result have nevertheless have some bad effect which the western country have recently be feel and in respect of which there be danger of a reaction toward old abuse unless we can attain the golden mean which consist in the prevention of the mere expioitation of the public domain for private purpose while at the same time facilitate its development for the benefit of the local public the land law need complete revision to secure proper conservation on the one hand of land that ought to be keep in public use and on the other hand prompt disposition of those land which ought to be dispose in private ownership or turn over to private use by properly guard lease in addition to this there be not enough official in our land department with legal knowledge sufficient promptly to make the decision which be call for the whole land law system should be reorganize and not until it be reorganize will decision be make as promptly as they ought or will man who have earn title to public land under the statute receive their patent within a reasonably short period the present administration have do what it could in this regard but the necessity for reform and change by a revision of the law and an increase and reorganization of the force remain and i submit to congress the wisdom of a full examination of this subject in order that a very large and important part of our people in the west may be relieve from a just cause of irritation i invite your attention to the discussion by the secretary of the interior of the need for legislation with respect to mining claim lease of coal land in this country and in alaska and for similar disposition of oil phosphate and potash land and also to his discussion of the proper use to be make of water power site hold by the government many of these land be now be withhold from use by the public under the general withdrawal act which be pass by the last congress that act be not for the purpose of dispose of the question but it be for the purpose of preserve the land until the question could be solve i earnestly urge that the matter be of the high importance to our western fellow citizen and ought to command the immediate attention of the legislative branch of the government another function which the interior department have to perform be that of the guardianship of indians in spite of everything which have be say in criticism of the policy of our government toward the indians the amount of wealth which be now hold by it for these ward per capita show that the government have be generous but the management of so large an estate with the great variety of circumstance that surround each tribe and each case call for the exercise of the high business discretion and the machinery provide in the indian bureau for the discharge of this function be entirely inadequate the position of indian commissioner demand the exercise of business ability of the first order and it be difficult to secure such talent for the salary provide the condition of health of the indian and the prevalence in the tribe of curable disease have be exploit recently in the press in a message to congress at its last session i bring this subject to its attention and invite a special appropriation in order that our facility for overcome disease among the indians might be properlv increase but no action be then take by congress on the subject nor have such appropriation be make since the commission appoint by authority of the congress to report on proper method of secure railroad development in alaska be formulate its report and i expect to have an opportunity before the end of this session to submit its recommendation department of agriculture the far reach utility of the educational system carry on by the department of agriculture for the benefit of the farmer of our country call for no elaboration each year there be a growth in the variety of fact which it bring out for the benefit of the farmer and each year confirm the wisdom of the expenditure of the appropriation make for that department pure food law the department of agriculture be charge with the execution of the pure food law the passage of this encounter much opposition from manufacturer and other who fear the effect upon their business of the enforcement of its provision the opposition arouse the just indignation of the public and lead to an intense sympathy with the severe and rigid enforcement of the provision of the new law it have to deal in many instance with the question whether or not product of large business enterprise in the form of food preparation be deleterious to the public health and while in a great majority of instance this issue be easily determinable there be not a few case in which it be hard to draw the line between a useful and a harmful food preparation in case like this when a decision involve the destruction of great business enterprise represent the investment of large capital and the expenditure of great energy and ability the danger of serious injustice be very considerable in the enforcement of a new law under the spur of great public indignation the public official charge with execute the law might do injustice in heated controversy through unconscious pride of opinion and obstinacy of conclusion for this reason president roosevelt feel justify in create a board of expert know as the remsen board to whom in case of much importance an appeal might be take and a review have of a decision of the bureau of chemistry in the agricultural department i heartily agree that it be wise to create this board in order that injustice might not be do the question which arise be not generally those involve palpable injury to health but they be upon the narrow and doubtful line in respect of which it be well to be in some error not dangerous than to be radically destructive i think that the time have come for congress to recognize the necessity for some such tribunal of appeal and to make specific statutory provision for it while we be struggle to suppress an evil of great proportion like that of impure food we must provide machinery in the law itself to prevent its become an instrument of oppression and we ought to enable those whose business be threaten with annihilation to have some tribunal and some form of appeal in which they have a complete day in court agricultural credits i refer in my first message to the question of improve the system of agricultural credit the secretary of agriculture have make an investigation into the matter of credit in this country and i commend a consideration of the information which through his agent he have be able to collect it do not in any way minimize the importance of the proposal but it give more accurate information upon some of the phase of the question than we have heretofore have department of commerce and labor i commend to congress an examination of the report of the secretary of commerce and labor and especially that part in which he discuss the office of the bureau of corporations the value to commerce of a propose trade commission and the step which he have take to secure the organization of a national chamber of commerce i heartily commend his view that the plan of a trade commission which look to the fixing of price be altogether impractical and ought not for a moment to be consider as a possible solution of the trust question the trust question in the enforcement of the sherman antitrust law be gradually solve itself be maintain the principle and restore the practice of competition and if the law be quietly but firmly enforce business will adjust itself to the statutory requirement and the unrest in commercial circle provoke by the trust discussion will disappear panama pacific international exposition in conformity with a joint resolution of congress an executive proclamation be issue last february invite the nation of the world to participate in the panama pacific international exposition to be hold at san francisco to celebrate the construction of the panama canal a sympathetic response be immediately forthcoming and several nation have already select the site for their building in furtherance of my invitation a special commission visit european country during the past summer and receive assurance of hearty cooperation in the task of bring together a universal industrial military and naval display on an unprecedented scale it be evident that the exposition will be an accurate mirror of the world 's activity as they appear 400 year after the date of the discovery of the pacific ocean it be the duty of the united states to make the nation welcome at san francisco and to facilitate such acquaintance between they and ourselves as will promote the expansion of commerce and familiarize the world with the new trade route through the panama canal the action of the state government and individual assure a comprehensive exhibit of the resource of this country and of the progress of the people this participation by state and individual should be supplement by an adequate showing of the varied and unique activity of the national government the united states can not with good grace invite foreign government to erect building and make expensive exhibit while itself refuse to participate nor would it be wise to forego the opportunity to join with other nation in the inspire interchange of idea tend to promote intercourse friendship and commerce it be the duty of the government to foster and build up commerce through the canal just as it be the duty of the government to construct it i earnestly recommend the appropriation at this session of such a sum as will enable the united states to construct a suitable building install a governmental exhibit and otherwise participate in the panama pacific international exposition in a manner commensurate with the dignity of a nation whose guest be to be the people of the world i recommend also such legislation as will facilitate the entry of material intend for exhibition and protect foreign exhibitor against infringement of patent and the unauthorized copying of pattern and design all alien send to san francisco to construct and care for foreign building and exhibit should be admit without restraint or embarrassment the district of columbia and the city of washington the city of washington be a beautiful city with a population of 352,936 of whom 98,667 be color the annual municipal budget be about $ 14,ooo ooo the presence of the national capital and other governmental structure constitute the chief beauty and interest of the city the public ground be extensive and the opportunity for improve the city and make it still more attractive be very great under a plan adopt some year ago one half the cost of run the city be pay by taxation upon the property real and personal of the citizen and resident and the other half be bear by the general government the city be expand at a remarkable rate and this can only be account for by the coming here from other part of the country of well to do people who having finish their business career elsewhere build and make this their permanent place of residence on the whole the city as a municipality be very well govern it be well light the water supply be good the street be well paved the police force be well discipline crime be not flagrant and while it have purlieus and center of vice like other large city they be not exploit they do not exercise any influence or control in the government of the city and they be suppress in as far as it have be find practicable municipal graft be inconsiderable there be interior court in the city that be noisome and center of disease and the refuge of criminal but congress have begin to clean these out and progress have be make in the case of the most notorious of these which be know as willow tree alley this movement should continue the mortality for the past year be at the rate of 17.80 per 1,000 of both race among the white it be 14.61 per thousand and among the black 26.12 per thousand these be the low mortality rate ever record in the district one of the most cry need in the government of the district be a tribunal or public authority for the purpose of supervise the corporation engage in the operation of public utility such a bill be pende in congress and ought to pass washington should show itself under the direction of congress to be a city with a model form of government but as long as such authority over public utility be withhold from the municipal government it must always be de- fective without undue criticism of the present street railway accommodation it can be truly say that under the spur of a public utility commission they might be substantially improve while the school system of washington perhaps might be better in the economy of its management and the distribution of its building its usefulness have nevertheless greatly increase in recent year and it now offer excellent facility for primary and secondary education from time to time there be considerable agitation in washington in favor of grant the citizen of the city the franchise and constitute an elective government i be strongly opposed to this change the history of washington disclose a number of experiment of this kind which have always be abandon as unsatisfactory the truth be this be a city govern by a popular body to wit the congress of the united states select from the people of the united states who own washington the people who come here to live do so with the knowledge of the origin of the city and the restriction and therefore voluntarily give up the privilege of live in a municipality govern by popular vote washington be so unique in its origin and in its use for housing and localize the sovereignty of the nation that the people who live here must regard its peculiar character and must be content to subject themselves to the control of a body select by all the people of the nation i agree that there be certain inconvenience grow out of the government of a city by a national legislature like congress and it would perhaps be possible to lessen these by the delegation by congress to the district commissioners of great legislative power for the enactment of local law than they now possess especially those of a police character every loyal american have a personal pride in the beauty of washington and in its development and growth there be no one with a proper appreciation of our capital city who would favor a niggardly policy in respect to expenditure from the national treasury to add to the attractiveness of this city which belong to every citizen of the entire country and which no citizen visit without a sense of pride of ownership we have have restore by a commission of fine arts at the instance of a committee of the senate the original plan of the french engineer l'enfant for the city of washington and we know with great certainty the course which the improvement of washington should take why should there be delay in make this improvement in so far as it involve the extension of the parking system and the construction of greatly need public building appropriate building for the state department the department of justice and the department of commerce and labor have be project plan have be approve and nothing be want but the appropriation for the beginning and completion of the structure a hall of archive be also badly need but nothing have be do toward its construction although the land for it have long be buy and pay for plan have be make for the union of potomac park with the valley of rock creek and rock creek park and the necessity for the connection between the soldier home and rock creek park call for no comment i ask again why there should be delay in carry out these plan we have the money in the treasury the plan be national in their scope and the improvement should be treat as a national project the plan will find a hearty approval throughout the country i be quite sure from the information which i have that at comparatively small expense from that part of the district of columbia which be retrocede to virginia the portion include the arlington estate fort myer and the palisade of the potomac can be acquire by purchase and the jurisdiction of the state of virginia over this land cede to the nation this ought to be do the construction of the lincoln memorial and of a memorial bridge from the base of the lincoln monument to arlington would be an appropriate and symbolic expression of the union of the north and the south at the capital of the nation i urge upon congress the appointment of a commission to undertake these national improvement and to submit a plan for their execution and when the plan have be submit and approve and the work carry out washington will really become what it ought to be the most beautiful city in the world
there have be a change of government it begin two year ago whenthe house of representatives become democratic by a decisive majority it have now be complete the senate about to assemble will also be democratic the office of president and vice president have be put into the handsof democrats what do the change mean that be the question that be uppermostin our mind to day that be the question i be go to try to answer in order if i may to interpret the occasion

 it mean much more than the mere success of a party the success ofa party mean little except when the nation be use that party for a largeand definite purpose no one can mistake the purpose for which the nationnow seek to use the democratic party it seek to use it to interpreta change in its own plan and point of view some old thing with whichwe have grow familiar and which have begin to creep into the very habitof our thought and of our life have alter their aspect as we have latterlylooke critically upon they with fresh awakened eye have drop theirdisguise and show themselves alien and sinister some new thing aswe look frankly upon they willing to comprehend their real character have come to assume the aspect of thing long believe in and familiar stuff of our own conviction we have be refresh by a new insight intoour own life

 we see that in many thing that life be very great it be incomparablygreat in its material aspect in its body of wealth in the diversityand sweep of its energy in the industry which have be conceive andbuilt up by the genius of individual man and the limitless enterprise ofgroup of man it be great also very great in its moral force nowhereelse in the world have noble man and woman exhibit in more striking formsthe beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in theireffort to rectify wrong alleviate suffering and set the weak in theway of strength and hope we have build up moreover a great system ofgovernment which have stand through a long age as in many respect a modelfor those who seek to set liberty upon foundation that will endure againstfortuitous change against storm and accident our life contain everygreat thing and contain it in rich abundance

 but the evil have come with the good and much fine gold have be corrode with rich have come inexcusable waste we have squander a great partof what we might have use and have not stop to conserve the exceedingbounty of nature without which our genius for enterprise would have beenworthless and impotent scorn to be careful shamefully prodigal aswell as admirably efficient we have be proud of our industrial achievement but we have not hitherto stop thoughtfully enough to count the humancost the cost of life snuff out of energy overtax and break the fearful physical and spiritual cost to the man and woman and childrenupon whom the dead weight and burden of it all have fall pitilessly theyear through the groan and agony of it all have not yet reach our ear the solemn move undertone of our life come up out of the mine andfactorie and out of every home where the struggle have its intimate andfamiliar seat with the great government go many deep secret thing whichwe too long delay to look into and scrutinize with candid fearless eye the great government we love have too often be make use of for privateand selfish purpose and those who use it have forget the people

 at last a vision have be vouchsafe we of our life as a whole we seethe bad with the good the debased and decadent with the sound and vital with this vision we approach new affair our duty be to cleanse to reconsider to restore to correct the evil without impair the good to purify andhumanize every process of our common life without weaken or sentimentalizingit there have be something crude and heartless and unfeele in our hasteto succeed and be great our thought have be let every man look out forhimself let every generation look out for itself while we rear giantmachinery which make it impossible that any but those who stand at thelever of control should have a chance to look out for themselves we hadnot forget our moral we remember well enough that we have set upa policy which be mean to serve the humblest as well as the most powerful with an eye single to the standard of justice and fair play and rememberedit with pride but we be very heedless and in a hurry to be great

 we have come now to the sober second thought the scale of heedlessnesshave fall from our eye we have make up our mind to square every processof our national life again with the standard we so proudly set up at thebeginning and have always carry at our heart our work be a work ofrestoration

 we have itemize with some degree of particularity the thing that oughtto be alter and here be some of the chief item a tariff which cutsus off from our proper part in the commerce of the world violate thejust principle of taxation and make the government a facile instrumentin the hand of private interest a banking and currency system base uponthe necessity of the government to sell its bond fifty year ago and perfectlyadapte to concentrate cash and restrict credit an industrial systemwhich take it on all its side financial as well as administrative holdscapital in lead string restrict the liberty and limit the opportunitiesof labor and exploit without renew or conserve the natural resourcesof the country a body of agricultural activity never yet give the efficiencyof great business undertaking or serve as it should be through the instrumentalityof science take directly to the farm or afford the facility of creditbest suit to its practical need watercourse undeveloped waste placesunreclaime forest untended fast disappear without plan or prospectof renewal unregarded waste heap at every mine we have study as perhapsno other nation have the most effective mean of production but we havenot study cost or economy as we should either as organizer of industry as statesman or as individual

 nor have we study and perfect the mean by which government maybe put at the service of humanity in safeguard the health of the nation the health of its man and its woman and its child as well as theirright in the struggle for existence this be no sentimental duty thefirm basis of government be justice not pity these be matter of justice there can be no equality or opportunity the first essential of justicein the body politic if man and woman and child be not shield in theirlive their very vitality from the consequence of great industrial andsocial process which they can not alter control or singly cope with society must see to it that it do not itself crush or weaken or damageit own constituent part the first duty of law be to keep sound the societyit serve sanitary law pure food law and law determine conditionsof labor which individual be powerless to determine for themselves areintimate part of the very business of justice and legal efficiency

 these be some of the thing we ought to do and not leave the othersundone the old fashion never to be neglect fundamental safeguardingof property and of individual right this be the high enterprise of thenew day to lift everything that concern our life as a nation to the lightthat shine from the hearthfire of every man&#39;s conscience and vision ofthe right it be inconceivable that we should do this as partisan itis inconceivable we should do it in ignorance of the fact as they areor in blind haste we shall restore not destroy we shall deal with oureconomic system as it be and as it may be modify not as it might beif we have a clean sheet of paper to write upon and step by step we shallmake it what it should be in the spirit of those who question their ownwisdom and seek counsel and knowledge not shallow self satisfaction orthe excitement of excursion whither they can not tell justice and onlyjustice shall always be our motto

 and yet it will be no cool process of mere science the nation have beendeeply stir stir by a solemn passion stir by the knowledge ofwrong of ideal lose of government too often debauch and make an instrumentof evil the feeling with which we face this new age of right and opportunitysweep across our heartstring like some air out of god&#39;s own presence where justice and mercy be reconcile and the judge and the brother areone we know our task to be no mere task of politic but a task which shallsearch we through and through whether we be able to understand our timeand the need of our people whether we be indeed their spokesman and interpreter whether we have the pure heart to comprehend and the rectify will tochoose our high course of action

mr. speaker mr. president gentlemen of the congress
 i be very glad indeed to have this opportunity to address the two houses directly and to verify for myself the impression that the president of the united states be a person not a mere department of the government hail congress from some isolated island of jealous power send message not speak naturally and with his own voice&mdash;that he be a human be try to cooperate with other human being in a common service after this pleasant experience i shall feel quite normal in all our dealing with one another
 i have call the congress together in extraordinary session because a duty be lay upon the party now in power at the recent election which it ought to perform promptly in order that the burden carry by the people under exist law may be lighten as soon as possible and in order also that the business interest of the country may not be keep too long in suspense as to what the fiscal change be to be to which they will be require to adjust themselves it be clear to the whole country that the tariff duty must be alter they must be change to meet the radical alteration in the condition of our economic life which the country have witness within the last generation while the whole face and method of our industrial and commercial life be be change beyond recognition the tariff schedule have remain what they be before the change begin or have move in the direction they be give when no large circumstance of our industrial development be what it be to day our task be to square they with the actual fact the soon that be do the soon we shall escape from suffer from the fact and the soon our man of business will be free to thrive by the law of nature the nature of free business instead of by the law of legislation and artificial arrangement
 we have see tariff legislation wander very far afield in our day&mdash;very far indeed from the field in which our prosperity might have have a normal growth and stimulation no one who look the fact squarely in the face or know anything that lie beneath the surface of action can fail to perceive the principle upon which recent tariff legislation have be base we long ago pass beyond the modest notion of protect the industry of the country and move boldly forward to the idea that they be entitle to the direct patronage of the government for a long time&mdash;a time so long that the man now active in public policy hardly remember the condition that precede it&mdash;we have seek in our tariff schedule to give each group of manufacturer or producer what they themselves think that they need in order to maintain a practically exclusive market as against the rest of the world consciously or unconsciously we have build up a set of privilege and exemption from competition behind which it be easy by any even the crude form of combination to organize monopoly until at last nothing be normal nothing be oblige to stand the test of efficiency and economy in our world of big business but everything thrive by concerted arrangement only new principle of action will save we from a final hard crystallization of monopoly and a complete loss of the influence that quicken enterprise and keep independent energy alive
 it be plain what those principle must be we must abolish everything that bear even the semblance of privilege or of any kind of artificial advantage and put our business man and producer under the stimulation of a constant necessity to be efficient economical and enterprising master of competitive supremacy well worker and merchant than any in the world aside from the duty lay upon article which we do not and probably can not produce therefore and the duty lay upon luxury and merely for the sake of the revenue they yield the object of the tariff duty henceforth lay must be effective competition the whetting of american wit by contest with the wit of the rest of the world
 it would be unwise to move toward this end headlong with reckless haste or with stroke that cut at the very root of what have grow up amongst we by long process and at our own invitation it do not alter a thing to upset it and break it and deprive it of a chance to change it destroy it we must make change in our fiscal law in our fiscal system whose object be development a more free and wholesome development not revolution or upset or confusion we must build up trade especially foreign trade we need the outlet and the enlarged field of energy more than we ever do before we must build up industry as well and must adopt freedom in the place of artificial stimulation only so far as it will build not pull down in deal with the tariff the method by which this may be do will be a matter of judgment exercise item by item to some not accustomed to the excitement and responsibility of great freedom our method may in some respect and at some point seem heroic but remedy may be heroic and yet be remedy it be our business to make sure that they be genuine remedy our object be clear if our motive be above just challenge and only an occasional error of judgment be chargeable against we we shall be fortunate
 we be call upon to render the country a great service in more matter than one our responsibility should be meet and our method should be thorough as thorough as moderate and well consider base upon the fact as they be and not work out as if we be beginner we be to deal with the fact of our own day with the fact of no other and to make law which square with those fact it be good indeed it be necessary to begin with the tariff i will urge nothing upon you now at the opening of your session which can obscure that first object or divert our energy from that clearly define duty at a later time i may take the liberty of call your attention to reform which should press close upon the heel of the tariff change if not accompany they of which the chief be the reform of our banking and currency law but just now i refrain for the present i put these matter on one side and think only of this one thing&mdash;of the change in our fiscal system which may well serve to open once more the free channel of prosperity to a great people whom we would serve to the utmost and throughout both rank and file
 i thank you for your courtesy

mr. speaker mr. president gentlemen of the congress
 it be under the compulsion of what seem to i a clear and imperative duty that i have a second time this session seek the privilege of address you in person i know of course that the heated season of the year be upon we that work in these chamber and in the committee room be likely to become a burden as the season lengthen and that every consideration of personal convenience and personal comfort perhaps in the case of some of we consideration of personal health even dictate an early conclusion of the deliberation of the session but there be occasion of public duty when these thing which touch we privately seem very small when the work to be do be so pressing and so fraught with big consequence that we know that we be not at liberty to weigh against it any point of personal sacrifice we be now in the presence of such an occasion it be absolutely imperative that we should give the business man of this country a banking and currency system by mean of which they can make use of the freedom of enterprise and of individual initiative which we be about to bestow upon they
 we be about to set they free we must not leave they without the tool of action when they be free we be about to set they free by remove the trammel of the protective tariff ever since the civil war they have wait for this emancipation and for the free opportunity it will bring with it it have be reserve for we to give it to they some fall in love indeed with the slothful security of their dependence upon the government some take advantage of the shelter of the nursery to set up a mimic mastery of their own within its wall now both the tonic and the discipline of liberty and maturity be to ensue there will be some readjustment of purpose and point of view there will follow a period of expansion and new enterprise freshly conceive it be for we to determine now whether it shall be rapid and facile and of easy accomplishment this it can not be unless the resourceful business man who be to deal with the new circumstance be to have at hand and ready for use the instrumentality and convenience of free enterprise which independent man need when act on their own initiative
 it be not enough to strike the shackle from business the duty of statesmanship be not negative merely it be constructive also we must show that we understand what business need and that we know how to supply it no man however casual and superficial his observation of the condition now prevail in the country can fail to see that one of the chief thing business need now and will need increasingly as it gain in scope and vigor in the year immediately ahead of we be the proper mean by which readily to vitalize its credit corporate and individual and its originative brain what will it profit we to be free if we be not to have the good and most accessible instrumentality of commerce and enterprise what will it profit we to be quit of one kind of monopoly if we be to remain in the grip of another and more effective kind how be we to gain and keep the confidence of the business community unless we show that we know how both to aid and to protect it what shall we say if we make fresh enterprise necessary and also make it very difficult by leave all else except the tariff just as we find it the tyranny of business big and little lie within the field of credit we know that shall we not act upon the knowledge do we not know how to act upon it if a man can not make his asset available at pleasure his asset of capacity and character and resource what satisfaction be it to he to see opportunity beckoning to he on every hand when other have the key of credit in their pocket and treat they as all but their own private possession it be perfectly clear that it be our duty to supply the new banking and currency system the country need and it will need it immediately more than it have ever need it before
 the only question be when shall we supply it&mdash;now or later after the demand shall have become reproach that we be so dull and so slow shall we hasten to change the tariff law and then be laggard about make it possible and easy for the country to take advantage of the change there can be only one answer to that question we must act now at whatever sacrifice to ourselves it be a duty which the circumstance forbid we to postpone i should be recreant to my deep conviction of public obligation do i not press it upon you with solemn and urgent insistence
 the principle upon which we should act be also clear the country have seek and see its path in this matter within the last few years&mdash;see it more clearly now than it ever see it before&mdash;much more clearly than when the last legislative proposal on the subject be make we must have a currency not rigid as now but readily elastically responsive to sound credit the expand and contracting credit of everyday transaction the normal ebb and flow of personal and corporate dealing our banking law must mobilize reserve must not permit the concentration anywhere in a few hand of the monetary resource of the country or their use for speculative purpose in such volume as to hinder or impede or stand in the way of other more legitimate more fruitful use and the control of the system of banking and of issue which our new law be to set up must be public not private must be vest in the government itself so that the bank may be the instrument not the master of business and of individual enterprise and initiative
 the committee of the congress to which legislation of this character be refer have devote careful and dispassionate study to the mean of accomplish these object they have honor i by consult i they be ready to suggest action i have come to you as the head of the government and the responsible leader of the party in power to urge action now while there be time to serve the country deliberately and as we should in a clear air of common counsel i appeal to you with a deep conviction of duty i believe that you share this conviction i therefore appeal to you with confidence i be at your service without reserve to play my part in any way you may call upon i to play it in this great enterprise of exigent reform which it will dignify and distinguish we to perform and discredit we to neglect

friend and fellow citizens

 i need not tell you what the battle of gettysburg mean these gallant man in blue and gray sit all about we here many of they meet upon this ground in grim and deadly struggle upon these famous field and hillside their comrade die about they in their presence it be an impertinence to discourse upon how the battle go how it end what it signify but fifty year have go by since then and i crave the privilege of speak to you for a few minute of what those fifty year have mean

 what have they mean they have mean peace and union and vigor and the maturity and might of a great nation how wholesome and heal the peace have be we have find one another again as brother and comrade in arm enemy no long generous friend rather our battle long past the quarrel forgotten?except that we shall not forget the splendid valor the manly devotion of the man then array against one another now grasp hand and smile into each other&#39;s eye how complete the union have become and how dear to all of we how unquestioned how benign and majestic as state after state have be add to this our great family of free man how handsome the vigor the maturity the might of the great nation we love with undivided heart how full of large and confident promise that a life will be work out that will crown its strength with gracious justice and with a happy welfare that will touch all alike with deep contentment we be debtor to those fifty crowded year they have make we heir to a mighty heritage

 but do we deem the nation complete and finish these venerable man crowd here to this famous field have set we a great example of devotion and utter sacrifice they be willing to die that the people might live but their task be do their day be turn into evening they look to we to perfect what they establish their work be hand on to we to be do in another way but not in another spirit our day be not over it be upon we in full tide

 have affair pause do the nation stand still be what the fifty year have work since those day of battle finish round out and complete here be a great people great with every force that have ever beat in the lifeblood of mankind and it be secure there be no one within its border there be no power among the nation of the earth to make it afraid but have it yet square itself with its own great standard set up at its birth when it make that first noble naive appeal to the moral judgment of mankind to take notice that a government have now at last be establish which be to serve man not master it be secure in everything except the satisfaction that its life be right adjust to the uttermost to the standard of righteousness and humanity the day of sacrifice and cleansing be not closed we have hard thing to do than be do in the heroic day of war because hard to see clearly require more vision more calm balance of judgment a more candid searching of the very spring of right

 look around you upon the field of gettysburg picture the array the fierce heat and agony of battle column hurl against column battery bellowing to battery valor yes greater no man shall see in war and self sacrifice and loss to the uttermost the high recklessness of exalt devotion which do not count the cost we be make by these tragic epic thing to know what it cost to make a nation?the blood and sacrifice of multitude of unknown man lift to a great stature in the view of all generation by know no limit to their manly willingness to serve in army thus marshal from the rank of free man you will see as it be a nation embattle the leader and the lead and may know if you will how little except in form its action differ in day of peace from its action in day of war

 may we break camp now and be at ease be the force that fight for the nation disperse disband go to their home forgetful of the common cause be our force disorganize without constituted leader and the might of man consciously unite because we contend not with army but with principality and power and wickedness in high place be we content to lie still do our union mean sympathy our peace contentment our vigor right action our maturity self comprehension and a clear confidence in choose what we shall do war fit we for action and action never cease

 i have be choose the leader of the nation i can not justify the choice by any quality of my own but so it have come about and here i stand whom do i command the ghostly host who fight upon these battlefield long ago and be go these gallant gentleman stricken in year whose fighting day be over their glory win what be the order for they and who rally they i have in my mind another host whom these set free of civil strife in order that they might work out in day of peace and settle order the life of a great nation that host be the people themselves the great and the small without class or difference of kind or race or origin and undivide in interest if we have but the vision to guide and direct they and order their life aright in what we do our constitution be their article of enlistment the order of the day be the law upon our statute book what we strive for be their freedom their right to lift themselves from day to day and behold the thing they have hope for and so make way for still well day for those whom they love who be to come after they the recruit be the little child crowd in the quartermaster&#39;s store be in the mine and forest and field in the shop and factory every day something must be do to push the campaign forward and it must be do by plan and with an eye to some great destiny

 how shall we hold such thought in our heart and not be move i would not have you live even to day wholly in the past but would wish to stand with you in the light that stream upon we now out of that great day go by here be the nation god have build by our hand what shall we do with it who stand ready to act again and always in the spirit of this day of reunion and hope and patriotic fervor the day of our country&#39; life have but broaden into morning do not put uniform by put the harness of the present on lift your eye to the great tract of life yet to be conquer in the interest of righteous peace of that prosperity which lie in a people&#39; heart and outlast all war and error of man come let we be comrade and soldier yet to serve our fellow man in quiet counsel where the blare of trumpet be neither hear nor heed and where the thing be do which make bless the nation of the world in peace and righteousness and love
your honor mr. chairman ladies and gentleman

 no american could stand in this place to day and think of the circumstance which we be come together to celebrate without be most profoundly stir there have come over i since i sit down here a sense of deep solemnity because it have seem to i that i see ghost crowd a great assemblage of spirit no long visible but whose influence we still feel as we feel the molding power of history itself the man who sit in this hall to whom we now look back with a touch of deep sentiment be man of flesh and blood face to face with extremely difficult problem the population of the united states then be hardly three time the present population of the city of philadelphia and yet that be a nation as this be a nation and the man who speak for it be set their hand to a work which be to last not only that their people might be happy but that an example might be lift up for the instruction of the rest of the world

 i like to read the quaint old account such as mr. day have read to we this afternoon stranger come then to america to see what the young people that have spring up here be like and they find man in counsel who know how to construct government they find man deliberate here who have none of the appearance of novice none of the hesitation of man who do not know whether the work they be do be go to last or not man who address themselves to a problem of construction as familiarly as we attempt to carry out the tradition of a government establish these 137 year

 i feel to day the compulsion of these man the compulsion of example which be set up in this place and of what do their example remind we they remind we not merely of public service but of public service shoot through with principle and honor they be not histrionic man they do not say

 look upon we as upon those who shall hereafter be illustrious

 they say

 look upon we who be do the first free work of constitutional liberty in the world and who must do it in soberness and truth or it will not last

 politic lady and gentleman be make up in just about equal part of comprehension and sympathy no man ought to go into politic who do not comprehend the task that he be go to attack he may comprehend it so completely that it daunt he that he doubt whether his own spirit be stout enough and his own mind able enough to attempt its great undertaking but unless he comprehend it he ought not to enter it after he have comprehend it there should come into his mind those profound impulse of sympathy which connect he with the rest of mankind for politic be a business of interpretation and no man be fit for it who do not see and seek more than their own advantage and interest

 we have stumble upon many unhappy circumstance in the hundred year that have go by since the event that we be celebrate almost all of they have come from self center man man who see in their own interest the interest of the country and who do not have vision enough to read it in wide term in the universal term of equity and justice and the right of mankind i hear a great many people at fourth of july celebration laud the declaration of independence who in between julys shiver at the plain language of our bill of right the declaration of independence be indeed the first audible breath of liberty but the substance of liberty be write in such document as the declaration of right attach for example to the first constitution of virginia which be a model for the similar document read elsewhere into our great fundamental charter that document speak in very plain term the man of that generation do not hesitate to say that every people have a right to choose its own form of government?not once but as often as it pleases?and to accommodate those form of government to its exist interest and circumstance not only to establish but to alter be the fundamental principle of self government

 we be just as much under compulsion to study the particular circumstance of our own day as the gentleman be who sit in this hall and set we precedent not of what to do but of how to do it liberty inhere in the circumstance of the day human happiness consist in the life which human being be lead at the time that they live i can feed my memory as happily upon the circumstance of the revolutionary and constitutional period as you can but i can not feed all my purpose with they in washington now every day problem arise which wear some new phase and aspect and i must fall back if i would serve my conscience upon those thing which be fundamental rather than upon those thing which be superficial and ask myself this question how be you go to assist in some small part to give the american people and by example the people of the world more liberty more happiness more substantial prosperity and how be you go to make that prosperity a common heritage instead of a selfish possession i come here to day partly in order to feed my own spirit i do not come in compliment when i be ask to come i know immediately upon the utterance of the invitation that i have to come that to be absent would be as if i refuse to drink once more at the original fountain of inspiration for our own government

 the man of the day which we now celebrate have a very great advantage over we lady and gentleman in this one particular life be simple in america then all man share the same circumstance in almost equal degree we think of washington for example as an aristocrat as a man separate by training separate by family and neighborhood tradition from the ordinary people of the rank and file of the country have you forget the personal history of george washington do you not know that he struggle as poor boy now struggle for a meager and imperfect education that he work at his surveyor&#39;s task in the lonely forest that he know all the roughness all the hardship all the adventure all the variety of the common life of that day and that if he stand a little stiffly in this place if he look a little aloof it be because life have deal hardly with he all his sinew have be stiffen by the rough work of make america he be a man of the people whose touch have be with they since the day he see the light first in the old dominion of virginia and the man who come after he man some of whom have drunk deep at the source of philosophy and of study be nevertheless also man who on this side of the water know no complicated life but the simple life of primitive neighborhood our task be very much more difficult that sympathy which alone interpret public duty be more difficult for a public man to acquire now than it be then because we live in the midst of circumstance and condition infinitely complex

 no man can boast that he understand america no man can boast that he have live the life of america as almost every man who sit in this hall in those day could boast no man can pretend that except by common counsel he can gather into his consciousness what the varied life of this people be the duty that we have to keep open eye and open heart and accessible understanding be a very much more difficult duty to perform than it be in their day yet how much more important that it should be perform for fear we make infinite and irreparable blunder the city of washington be in some respect self contain and it be easy there to forget what the rest of the united states be think about i count it a fortunate circumstance that almost all the window of the white house and its office open upon unoccupied space that stretch to the bank of the potomac and then out into virginia and on to the heaven themselves and that as i sit there i can constantly forget washington and remember the united states not that i would intimate that all of the united states lie south of washington but there be a serious thing back of my thought if you think too much about be reelect it be very difficult to be worth reelecting you be so apt to forget that the comparatively small number of person numerous as they seem to be when they swarm who come to washington to ask for thing do not constitute an important proportion of the population of the country that it be constantly necessary to come away from washington and renew one&#39;s contact with the people who do not swarm there who do not ask for anything but who do trust you without their personal counsel to do your duty unless a man get these contact he grow weak and weak he need they as hercules need the touch of mother earth if you lift he up too high or he lift himself too high he lose the contact and therefore lose the inspiration

 i love to think of those plain man however far from plain their dress sometimes be who assemble in this hall one be startled to think of the variety of costume and color which would now occur if we be let loose upon the fashion of that age men&#39;s lack of taste be largely conceal now by the limitation of fashion yet these man who sometimes dress like the peacock be nevertheless of the ordinary flight of their time they be bird of a feather they be bird come from a very simple breeding they be much in the open heaven they be begin when there be so little to distract their attention to show that they could live upon fundamental principle of government we talk those principle but we have not time to absorb they we have not time to let they into our blood and thence have they translate into the plain mandate of action

 the very smallness of this room the very simplicity of it all all the suggestion which come from its restoration be reassure things?thing which it become a man to realize therefore my theme here to day my only thought be a very simple one do not let we go back to the annal of those session of congress to find out what to do because we live in another age and the circumstance be absolutely different but let we be man of that kind let we feel at every turn the compulsion of principle and of honor which thy feel let we free our vision from temporary circumstance and look abroad at the horizon and take into our lung the great air of freedom which have blow through this country and steal across the sea and bless people everywhere and look east and west and north and south let we remind ourselves that we be the custodian in some degree of the principle which have make man free and government just
gentleman of the congress in pursuance of my constitutional duty to give to the congress information of the state of the union i take the liberty of address you on several matter which ought as it seem to i particularly to engage the attention of your honorable body as of all who study the welfare and progress of the nation i shall ask your indulgence if i venture to depart in some degree from the usual custom of set before you in formal review the many matter which have engage the attention and call for the action of the several department of the government or which look to they for early treatment in the future because the list be long very long and would suffer in the abbreviation to which i should have to subject it i shall submit to you the report of the head of the several department in which these subject be set forth in careful detail and beg that they may receive the thoughtful attention of your committee and of all member of the congress who may have the leisure to study they their obvious importance as constitute the very substance of the business of the government make comment and emphasis on my part unnecessary the country i be thankful to say be at peace with all the world and many happy manifestation multiply about we of a grow cordiality and sense of community of interest among the nation foreshadow an age of settle peace and good will more and more readily each decade do the nation manifest their willingness to bind themselves by solemn treaty to the process of peace the process of frankness and fair concession so far the united states have stand at the front of such negotiation she will i earnestly hope and confidently believe give fresh proof of her sincere adherence to the cause of international friendship by ratify the several treaty of arbitration await renewal by the senate in addition to these it have be the privilege of the department of state to gain the assent in principle of no less than 31 nation represent four fifth of the population of the world to the negotiation of treaty by which it shall be agree that whenever difference of interest or of policy arise which can not be resolve by the ordinary process of diplomacy they shall be publicly analyze discuss and report upon by a tribunal choose by the party before either nation determine its course of action there be only one possible standard by which to determine controversy between the united states and other nation and that be com- pound of these two element our own honor and our obligation to the peace of the world a test so compounded ought easily to be make to govern both the establishment of new treaty obligation and the interpretation of those already assume there be but one cloud upon our horizon that have show itself to the south of we and hang over mexico there can be no certain prospect of peace in america until gen. huerta have surrender his usurped authority in mexico until it be understand on all hand indeed that such pretended government will not be countenance or deal with by the government of the united states we be the friend of constitutional government in america we be more than its friend we be its champion because in no other way can our neighbor to whom we would wish in every way to make proof of our friendship work out their own development in peace and liberty mexico have no government the attempt to maintain one at the city of mexico have break down and a mere military despotism have be set up which have hardly more than the semblance of national authority it originate in the usurpation of victoriano huerta who after a brief attempt to play the part of constitutional president have at last cast aside even the pretense of legal right and declare himself dictator as a consequence a condition of affair now exist in mexico which have make it doubtful whether even the most elementary and fundamental right either of her own people or of the citizen of other country resident within her territory can long be successfully safeguard and which threaten if long continue to imperil the interest of peace order and tolerable life in the land immediately to the south of we even if the usurper have succeed in his purpose in despite of the constitution of the republic and the right of its people he would have set up nothing but a precarious and hateful power which could have last but a little while and whose eventual downfall would have leave the country in a more deplorable condition than ever but he have not succeed he have forfeit the respect and the moral support even of those who be at one time willing to see he succeed little by little he have be completely isolate by a little every day his power and prestige be crumble and the collapse be not far away we shall not 1 believe be oblige to alter our policy of watchful waiting and then when the end come we shall hope to see constitutional order restore in distressed mexico by the concert and energy of such of her leader as prefer the liberty of their people to their own ambition i turn to matter of domestic concern you already have under consideration a bill for the reform of our system of banking and currency for which the country wait with impatience as for something fundamental to its whole business life and necessary to set credit free from arbitrary and artificial restraint i need not say how earnestly i hope for its early enactment into law i take leave to beg that the whole energy and attention of the senate be concentrate upon it till the matter be successfully dispose of and yet i feel that the request be not need that the member of that great house need no urging in this service to the country i present to you in addition the urgent necessity that special provision be make also for facilitate the credit need by the farmer of the country the pende currency bill do the farmer a great service it put they upon an equal footinig with other business man and master of enterprise as it should and upon its passage they will find themselves quit of many of the difficulty which now hamper they in the field of credit the farmer of course ask and should be give no special privilege such as extend to they the credit of the government itself what they need and should obtain be legislation which will make their own abundant and substantial credit resource available as a foundation for joint concerted local action in their own behalf in get the capital they must use it be to this we should now address ourselves it have singularly enough come to pass that we have allow the industry of our farm to lag behind the other activity of the country in its development i need not stop to tell you how fundamental to the life of the nation be the production of its food our thought may ordinarily be concentrate upon the city and the hive of industry upon the cry of the crowded market place and the clangor of the factory but it be from the quiet interspace of the open valley and the free hillside that we draw the source of life and of prosperity from the farm and the ranch from the forest and the mine without these every street would be silent every office desert every factory fall into disrepair and yet the farmer do not stand upon the same footing with the forester and the miner in the market of credit he be the servant of the season nature determine how long he must wait for his crop and will not be hurry in her process he may give his note but the season of its maturity depend upon the season when his crop mature lie at the gate of the market where his product be sell and the security he give be of a character not know in the broker 's office or as familiarly as it might be on the counter of the banker the agricultural department of the government be seek to assist as never before to make farm an efficient business of wide co operative effort in quick touch with the market for foodstuff the farmer and the government will henceforth work together as real partner in this field where we now begin to see our way very clearly and where many intelligent plan be already be put into execution the treasury of the united states have by a timely and well consider distribution of its deposit facilitate the moving of the crop in the present season and prevent the scarcity of available fund too often experience at such time but we must not allow ourselves to depend upon extraordinary expedient we must add the mean by which the farmer may make his credit constantly and easily available and command when he will the capital by which to support and expand his business we lag behind many other great country of the modern world in attempt to do this system of rural credit have be study and develop on the other side of the water while we leave our farmer to shift for themselves in the ordinary money market you have but to look about you in any rural district to see the result the handicap and embarrassment which nave be put upon those who produce our food conscious of this backwardness and neglect on our part the congress recently authorize the creation of a special commission to study the various system of rural credit which have be put into operation in europe and this commission be already prepare to report its report ought to make it easy for we to determine what method will be well suited to our own farmer i hope and believe that the committee of the senate and house will address themselves to this matter with the most fruitful result and i believe that the study and recently form plan of the department of agriculture may be make to serve they very greatly in their work of frame appropriate and adequate legislation it would be indiscreet and presumptuous in anyone to dogmatize upon so great and many side a question but i feel confident that common counsel will produce the result we must all desire turn from the farm to the world of business which center in the city and in the factory and i think that all thoughtful observer will agree that the immediate service we owe the business community of the country be to prevent private monopoly more effectually than it have yet be prevent i think it will be easily agree that we should let the sherman anti trust law stand unaltered as it be with its debatable ground about it but that we should as much as possible reduce the area of that debatable ground by further and more explicit legislation and should also supplement that great act by legislation which will not only clarify it but also facilitate its administration and make it fair to all concern no doubt we shall all wish and the country will expect this to be the central subject of our deliberation during the present session but it be a subject so manysided and so deserving of careful and discriminating discussion that 1 shall take the liberty of address you upon it in a special message at a later date than this it be of capital importance that the business man of this country should be relieve of all uncertainty of law with regard to their enterprise and investment and a clear path indicate which they can travel without anxiety it be as important that they should be relieve of embarrassment and set free to prosper as that private monopoly should be destroy the way of action should be throw wide open i turn to a subject which i hope can be handle promptly and without serious controversy of any kind i mean the method of select nominee for the presidency of the united states i feel confident that i do not misinterpret the wish or the expectation of the country when i urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary election throughout the country at which the voter of the several party may choose their nominee for the presidency without the intervention of nominate convention i venture the suggestion that this legislation should provide for the retention of party convention but only for the purpose of declare and accept the verdict of the primary and formulate the platform of the party and i suggest that these convention should consist not of delegate choose for this single purpose but of the nominee for congress the nominee for vacant seat in the senate of the united states the senators whose term have not yet close the national committee and the candidate for the presidency themselves in order that platform may be frame by those responsible to the people for carry they into effect these be all matter of vital domestic concern and besides they outside the charmed circle of our own national life in which our affection command we as well as our conscience there stand out our obligation toward our territory over sea here we be trustee porto rico hawaii the philippines be ours indeed but not ours to do what we please with such territory once regard as mere possession be no long to be selfishly exploit they be part of the domain of public conscience and of serviceable and enlighten statesmanship we must administer they for the people who live in they and with the same sense of responsibility to they as toward our own people in our domestic affair no doubt we shall successfully enough bind porto rico and the hawaiian islands to ourselves by tie of justice and interest and affection but the performance of our duty toward the philippines be a more difficult and debatable matter we can satisfy the obligation of generous justice toward the people of porto rico by give they the ample and familiar right and privilege accord our own citizen in our own territory and our obligation toward the people of hawaii by perfect the provision for self government already grant they but in the philippines we must go far we must hold steadily in view their ultimate independence and we must move toward the time of that independence as steadily as the way can be clear and the foundation thoughtfully and permanently lay act under the authority confer upon the president by congress i have already accord the people of the island a majority in both house of their legislative body by appoint five instead of four native citizen to the membership of the commission i believe that in this way we shall make proof of their capacity in counsel and their sense of responsibility in the exercise of political power and that the success of this step will be sure to clear our view for the step which be to follow step by step we should extend and perfect the system of self government in the island make test of they and modify they as experience disclose their success and their failure that we should more and more put under the control of the native citizen of the archipelago the essential instrument of their life their local instrumentality of government their school all the common interest of their community and so by counsel and experience set tip a government which all the world will see to be suitable to a people whose affair be under their own control at last i hope and believe we be begin to gain the confidence of the filipino people by their counsel and experience rather than by our own we shall learn how good to serve they and how soon it will be possible and wise to withdraw our supervision let we once find the path and set out with firm and confident tread upon it and we shall not wander from it or linger upon it a duty face we with regard to alaska which seem to i very pressing and very imperative perhaps i should say a double duty for it concern both the political and the material development of the territory the people of alaska should be give the full territorial form of government and alaska as a storehouse should be unlocked one key to it be a system of railway these the government should itself build and administer and the port and terminal it should itself control in the interest of all who wish to use they for the service and development of the country and its people but the construction of railway be only the first step be only thrust in the key to the storehouse and throw back the lock and open the door how the tempting resource of the country be to be exploit be another matter to which i shall take the liberty of from time to time call your attention for it be a policy which must be work out by well consider stage not upon theory but upon line of practical expediency it be part of our general problem of conservation we have a free hand in work out the problem in alaska than in the states of the union and yet the principle and object be the same wherever we touch it we must use the resource of the country not lock they up there need be no conflict or jealousy as between state and federal authority for there can be no essential difference of purpose between they the resource in question must be use but not destroy or waste use but not monopolize upon any narrow idea of individual right as against the abide interest of community that a policy can be work out by conference and concession which will release these resource and yet not jeopard or dissipate they i for one have no doubt and it can be do on line of regulation which need be no less acceptable to the people and government of the states concern than to the people and government of the nation at large whose heritage these resource be we must bend our counsel to this end a common purpose ought to make agreement easy three or four matter of special importance and significance i beg that you will permit i to mention in closing our bureau of mines ought to be equip and empower to render even more effectual service than it render now in improve the condition of mine labor and make the mine more economically productive as well as more safe this be an all important part of the work of conservation and the conservation of human life and energy lie even near to our interest than the preservation from waste of our material resource we owe it in mere justice to the railway employee of the country to provide for they a fair and effective employer liability act and a law that we can stand by in this matter will be no less to the advantage of those who administer the railroad of the country than to the advantage of those whom they employ the experience of a large number of the states abundantly prove that we ought to devote ourselves to meet press demand of plain justice like this as earnestly as to the accomplishment of political and economic reform social justice come first law be the machinery for its realization and be vital only as it express and embody it an international congress for the discussion of all question that affect safety at sea be now sit in london at the suggestion of our own government so soon as the conclusion of that congress can be learn and consider we ought to address ourselves among other thing to the prompt alleviation of the very unsafe unjust and burdensome condition which now surround the employment of sailor and render it extremely difficult to obtain the service of spirited and competent man such as every ship need if it be to be safely handle and bring to port may i not express the very real plea be i have experience in co operate with this congress and share with it the labor of common service to which it have devote itself so unreservedly during the past seven month of uncomplaine concentration upon the business of legislation surely it be a proper and pertinent part of my report on the state of the union to express my admiration for the diligence the good temper and the full comprehension of public duty which have already be manifest by both the houses and i hope that it may not be deem an impertinent intrusion of myself into the picture if i say with how much and how constant satisfaction i have avail myself of the privilege of put my time and energy at their disposal alike in counsel and in action
gentleman of the congress

 in my report on the state of the union which i have the privilege of reading to you on the 2d of december last i venture to reserve for discussion at a later date the subject of additional legislation regard the very difficult and intricate matter of trust and monopoly the time now seem opportune to turn to that great question not only because the currency legislation which absorb your attention and the attention of the country in december be now disposed of but also because opinion seem to be clear about we with singular rapidity in this other great field of action in the matter of the currency it clear suddenly and very happily after the much debate act be pass in respect of the monopoly which have multiply about we and in regard to the various mean by which they have be organize and maintain it seem to be come to a clear and all but universal agreement in anticipation of our action as if by way of preparation make the way easy to see and easy to set out upon with confidence and without confusion of counsel

 legislation have its atmosphere like everything else and the atmosphere of accommodation and mutual understanding which we now breathe with so much refreshment be matter of sincere congratulation it ought to make our task very much less difficult and embarrassing than it would have be have we be oblige to continue to act amidst the atmosphere of suspicion and antagonism which have so long make it impossible to approach such question with dispassionate fairness constructive legislation when successful be always the embodiment of convincing experience and of the mature public opinion which finally spring out of that experience legislation be a business of interpretation not of origination and it be now plain what the opinion be to which we must give effect in this matter it be not recent or hasty opinion it spring out of the experience of a whole generation it have clarify itself by long contest and those who for a long time battle with it and seek to change it be now frankly and honorably yield to it and seek to conform their action to it

 the great business man who organize and finance monopoly and those who administer it in actual everyday transaction have year after year until now either deny its existence or justify it as necessary for the effective maintenance and development of the vast business process of the country in the modern circumstance of trade and manufacture and finance but all the while opinion have make head against they the average business man be convince that the way of liberty be also the way of peace and the way of success as well and at last the master of business on the great scale have begin to yield their preference and purpose perhaps their judgment also in honorable surrender

 what we be purpose to do therefore be happily not to hamper or interfere with business as enlightened business man prefer to do it or in any sense to put it under the ban the antagonism between business and government be over we be now about to give expression to the good business judgment of america to what we know to be the business conscience and honor of the land the government and business man be ready to meet each other half way in a common effort to square business method with both public opinion and the law the well inform man of the business world condemn the method and process and consequence of monopoly as we condemn they and the instinctive judgment of the vast majority of business man everywhere go with they we shall now be their spokesman that be the strength of our position and the sure prophecy of what will ensue when our reasonable work be do

 when serious contest end when man unite in opinion and purpose those who be to change their way of business join with those who ask for the change it be possible to effect it in the way in which prudent and thoughtful and patriotic man would wish to see it bring about with as few as slight as easy and simple business readjustment as possible in the circumstance nothing essential disturb nothing tear up by the root no part rent asunder which can be leave in wholesome combination fortunately no measure of sweeping or novel change be necessary it will be understand that our object be not to unsettle business or anywhere seriously to break its establish course athwart on the contrary we desire the law we be now about to pass to be the bulwark and safeguard of industry against the force that have disturb it what we have to do can be do in a new spirit in thoughtful moderation without revolution of any untoward kind

 we be all agree that private monopoly be indefensible and intolerable and our program be found upon that conviction it will be a comprehensive but not a radical or unacceptable program and these be its item the change which opinion deliberately sanction and for which business wait

 it wait with acquiescence in the first place for law which will effectually prohibit and prevent such interlocking of the personnel of the directorate of great corporations?bank and railroad industrial commercial and public service bodies?as in effect result in make those who borrow and those who lend practically one and the same those who sell and those who buy but the same person trade with one another under different name and in different combination and those who affect to compete in fact partner and master of some whole field of business sufficient time should be allow of course in which to effect these change of organization without inconvenience or confusion

 such a prohibition will work much more than a mere negative good by correct the serious evil which have arise because for example the man who have be the direct spirit of the great investment bank have usurp the place which belong to independent industrial management work in its own behoof it will bring new man new energy a new spirit of initiative new blood into the management of our great business enterprise it will open the field of industrial development and origination to score of man who have be oblige to serve when their ability entitle they to direct it will immensely hearten the young man come on and will greatly enrich the business activity of the whole country

 in the second place business man as well as those who direct public affair now recognize and recognize with painful clearness the great harm and injustice which have be do to many if not all of the great railroad system of the country by the way in which they have be finance and their own distinctive interest subordinate to the interest of the man who finance they and of other business enterprise which those man wish to promote the country be ready therefore to accept and accept with relief as well as approval a law which will confer upon the interstate commerce commission the power to superintend and regulate the financial operation by which the railroad be henceforth to be supply with the money they need for their proper development to meet the rapidly grow requirement of the country for increase and improved facility of transportation we can not postpone action in this matter without leave the railroad expose to many serious handicap and hazard and the prosperity of the railroad and the prosperity of the country be inseparably connect upon this question those who be chiefly responsible for the actual management and operation of the railroad have speak very plainly and very earnestly with a purpose we ought to be quick to accept it will be one step and a very important one toward the necessary separation of the business of production from the business of transportation

 the business of the country await also have long await and have suffer because it could not obtain far and more explicit legislative definition of the policy and meaning of the exist antitrust law nothing hamper business like uncertainty nothing daunt or discourage it like the necessity to take chance to run the risk of fall under the condemnation of the law before it can make sure just what the law be surely we be sufficiently familiar with the actual process and method of monopoly and of the many hurtful restraint of trade to make definition possible at any rate up to the limit of what experience have disclose these practice be now abundantly disclose can be explicitly and item by item forbid by statute in such term as will practically eliminate uncertainty the law itself and the penalty be make equally plain

 and the business man of the country desire something more than that the menace of legal process in these matter be make explicit and intelligible they desire the advice the definite guidance and information which can be supply by an administrative body an interstate trade commission

 the opinion of the country would instantly approve of such a commission it would not wish to see it empower to make term with monopoly or in any sort to assume control of business as if the government make itself responsible it demand such a commission only as an indispensable instrument of information and publicity as a clearing house for the fact by which both the public mind and the manager of great business undertaking should be guide and as an instrumentality for do justice to business where the process of the court or the natural force of correction outside the court be inadequate to adjust the remedy to the wrong in a way that will meet all the equity and circumstance of the case

 produce industry for example which have pass the point up to which combination may be consistent with the public interest and the freedom of trade can not always be dissect into their component unit as readily as railroad company or similar organization can be their dissolution by ordinary legal process may oftentime involve financial consequence likely to overwhelm the security market and bring upon it breakdown and confusion there ought to be an administrative commission capable of direct and shape such corrective process not only in aid of the court but also by independent suggestion if necessary

 inasmuch as our object and the spirit of our action in these matter be to meet business half way in its process of self correction and disturb its legitimate course as little as possible we ought to see to it and the judgment of practical and sagacious man of affair everywhere would applaud we if we do see to it that penalty and punishment should fall not upon business itself to its confusion and interruption but upon the individual who use the instrumentality of business to do thing which public policy and sound business practice condemn every act of business be do at the command or upon the initiative of some ascertainable person or group of person these should be hold individually responsible and the punishment should fall upon they not upon the business organization of which they make illegal use it should be one of the main object of our legislation to divest such person of their corporate cloak and deal with they as with those who do not represent their corporation but merely by deliberate intention break the law business man the country through would i be sure applaud we if we be to take effectual step to see that the officer and director of great business body be prevent from bring they and the business of the country into disrepute and danger

 other question remain which will need very thoughtful and practical treatment enterprise in these modern day of great individual fortune be oftentime interlock not by be under the control of the same director but by the fact that the great part of their corporate stock be own by a single person or group of person who be in some way ultimately relate in interest we be agree i take it that hold company should be prohibit but what of the control private ownership of individual or actually cooperative group of individual shall the private owner of capital stock be suffer to be themselves in effect hold company we do not wish i suppose to forbid the purchase of stock by any person who please to buy they in such quantity as he can afford or in any way arbitrarily to limit the sale of stock to bona fide purchaser shall we require the owner of stock when their voting power in several company which ought to be independent of one another would constitute actual control to make election in which of they they will exercise their right to vote this question i venture for your consideration

 there be another matter in which imperative consideration of justice and fair play suggest thoughtful remedial action not only do many of the combination effect or seek to be effect in the industrial world work an injustice upon the public in general they also directly and seriously injure the individual who be put out of business in one unfair way or another by the many dislodging and exterminate force of combination i hope that we shall agree in give private individual who claim to have be injure by these process the right to found their suit for redress upon the fact and judgment prove and enter in suit by the government where the government have upon its own initiative sue the combination complain of and win its suit and that the statute of limitation shall be suffer to run against such litigant only from the date of the conclusion of the government&#39;s action it be not fair that the private litigant should be oblige to set up and establish again the fact which the government have prove he can not afford he have not the power to make use of such process of inquiry as the government have command of thus shall individual justice be do while the process of business be rectify and square with the general conscience

 i have lay the case before you no doubt as it lie in your own mind as it lie in the thought of the country what must every candid man say of the suggestion i have lay before you of the plain obligation of which i have remind you that these be new thing for which the country be not prepare no but that they be old thing now familiar and must of course be undertake if we be to square our law with the thought and desire of the country until these thing be do conscientious business man the country over will be unsatisfie they be in these thing our mentor and colleague we be now about to write the additional article of our constitution of peace the peace that be honor and freedom and prosperity
gentleman of the congress
 it be my duty to call your attention to a situation which have arise in our dealing with general victoriano huerta at mexico city which call for action and to ask your advice and cooperation in act upon it
 on the 9th of april a paymaster of the u.s.s. dolphin land at the iturbide bridge landing at tampico with a whaleboat and boat&#39;s crew to take off certain supply need by his ship and while engage in load the boat be arrest by an officer and squad of man of the army of general huerta neither the paymaster nor anyone of the boat&#39;s crew be arm two of the man be in the boat when the arrest take place and be oblige to leave it and submit to be take into custody notwithstanding the fact that the boat carry both at her bow and at her stern the flag of the united states the officer who make the arrest be proceed up one of the street of the town with his prisoner when meet by an officer of high authority who order he to return to the landing and await order and within an hour and a half from the time of the arrest order be receive from the commander of the huertista force at tampico for the release of the paymaster and his man the release be follow by apology from the commander and later by an expression of regret by general huerta himself general huerta urge that martial law obtain at the time at tampico that order have be issue that no one should be allow to land at the iturbide bridge and that our sailor have no right to land there our naval commander at the port have not be notify of any such prohibition and even if they have be the only justifiable course open to the local authority would have be to request the paymaster and his crew to withdraw and to lodge a protest with the command officer of the fleet admiral mayo regard the arrest as so serious an affront that he be not satisfied with the apology offer but demand that the flag of the united states be salute with special ceremony by the military commander of the port
 the incident can not be regard as a trivial one especially as two of the man arrest be take from the boat itself&mdash;that be to say from the territory of the united states&mdash;but have it stand by itself it might have be attribute to the ignorance or arrogance of a single officer unfortunately it be not an isolated case a series of incident have recently occur which can not but create the impression that the representative of general huerta be willing to go out of their way to show disregard for the dignity and right of this government and feel perfectly safe in do what they please make free to show in many way their irritation and contempt a few day after the incident at tampico an orderly from the u.s.s. minnesota be arrest at vera cruz while ashore in uniform to obtain the ship&#39;s mail and be for a time throw into jail an official dispatch from this government to its embassy at mexico city be withhold by the authority of the telegraphic service until peremptorily demand by our charge d&#39;affaire in person so far as i can learn such wrong and annoyance have be suffer to occur only against representative of the united states i have hear of no complaint from other government of similar treatment subsequent explanation and formal apology do not and could not alter the popular impression which it be possible it have be the object of the huertista authority to create that the government of the united states be be single out and might be single out with impunity for slight and affront in retaliation for its refusal to recognize the pretension of general huerta to be regard as the constitutional provisional president of the republic of mexico
 the manifest danger of such a situation be that such offense might grow from bad to bad until something happen of so gross and intolerable a sort as to lead directly and inevitably to armed conflict it be necessary that the apology of general huerta and his representative should go much far that they should be such as to attract the attention of the whole population to their significance and such as to impress upon general huerta himself the necessity of see to it that no further occasion for explanation and profess regret should arise i therefore feel it my duty to sustain admiral mayo in the whole of his demand and to insist that the flag of the united states should be salute in such a way as to indicate a new spirit and attitude on the part of the huertistas
 such a salute general huerta have refuse and i have come to ask your approval and support in the course i now purpose to pursue
 this government can i earnestly hope in no circumstance be force into war with the people of mexico mexico be tear by civil strife if we be to accept the test of its own constitution it have no government general huerta have set his power up in the city of mexico such as it be without right and by method for which there can be no justification only part of the country be under his control if armed conflict should unhappily come as a result of his attitude of personal resentment toward this government we should be fight only general huerta and those who adhere to he and give he their support and our object would be only to restore to the people of the distracted republic the opportunity to set up again their own law and their own government
 but i earnestly hope that war be not now in question i believe that i speak for the american people when i say that we do not desire to control in any degree the affair of our sister republic our feeling for the people of mexico be one of deep and genuine friendship and everything that we have so far do or refrain from do have proceed from our desire to help they not to hinder or embarrass they we would not wish even to exercise the good office of friendship without their welcome and consent the people of mexico be entitle to settle their own domestic affair in their own way and we sincerely desire to respect their right the present situation need have none of the grave implication of interference if we deal with it promptly firmly and wisely
 no doubt i could do what be necessary in the circumstance to enforce respect for our government without recourse to the congress and yet not exceed my constitutional power as president but i do not wish to act in a matter possibly of so grave consequence except in close conference and cooperation with both the senate and house i therefore come to ask your approval that i should use the armed force of the united states in such way and to such an extent as may be necessary to obtain from general huerta and his adherent the full recognition of the right and dignity of the united states even amidst the distressing condition now unhappily obtain in mexico
 there can in what we do be no thought of aggression or of selfish aggrandizement we seek to maintain the dignity and authority of the united states only because we wish always to keep our great influence unimpaire for the use of liberty both in the united states and wherever else it may be employ for the benefit of mankind

lady and gentlemen
 i have not come here to day with a prepared address the committee in charge of the exercise of the day have graciously excuse i on the ground of public obligation from prepare such an address but i will not deny myself the privilege of join with you in an expression of gratitude and admiration for the man who perish for the sake of the union they do not need our praise they do not need that our admiration should sustain they there be no immortality that be safe than theirs we come not for their sake but for our own in order that we may drink at the same spring of inspiration from which they themselves selve drank
 a peculiar privilege come to the man who fight for the union there be no other civil war in history lady and gentleman the sting of which be remove before the man who do the fighting pass from the stage of life so that we owe these man something more than a legal reestablishment of the union we owe they the spiritual reestablishment of the union as well for they not only reunite states they reunite the spirit of man that be their unique achievement unexample anywhere else in the annal of mankind that the very man whom they overcome in battle join in praise and gratitude that the union be save there be something peculiarly beautiful and peculiarly touch about that whenever a man who be still try to devote himself to the service of the nation come into a presence like this or into a place like this his spirit must be peculiarly move a mandate be lay upon he which seem to speak from the very grave themselves those who serve this nation whether in peace or in war should serve it without thought of themselves i can never speak in praise of war lady and gentleman you would not desire i to do so but there be this peculiar distinction belong to the soldier that he go into an enterprise out of which he himself can not get anything at all he be give everything that he hath even his life in order that other may live not in order that he himself may obtain gain and prosperity and just so soon as the task of peace be perform in the same spirit of self sacrifice and devotion peace society will not be necessary the very organization and spirit of society will be a guaranty of peace
 therefore this peculiar thing come about that we can stand here and praise the memory of these soldier in the interest of peace they set we the example of self sacrifice which if follow in peace will make it unnecessary that man should follow war any more
 we be repute to be somewhat careless in our discrimination between word in the use of the english language and yet it be interesting to note that there be some word about which we be very careful we bestow the adjective great somewhat indiscriminately a man who have make conquest of his fellow man for his own gain may display such genius in war such uncommon quality of organization and leadership that we may call he great but there be a word which we reserve for man of another kind and about which we be very careful that be the word noble we never call a man noble who serve only himself and if you will look about through all the nation of the world upon the statue that man have erected&mdash;upon the inscribed tablet where they have wish to keep alive the memory of the citizen whom they desire most to honor&mdash;you will find that almost without exception they have erect the statue to those who have a splendid surplus of energy and devotion to spend upon their fellow man nobility exist in america without patent we have no house of lords but we have a house of fame to which we elevate those who be the noble man of our race who forgetful of themselves study and serve the public interest who have the courage to face any number and any kind of adversary to speak what in their heart they believe to be the truth
 we admire physical courage but we admire above all thing else moral courage i believe that soldier will bear i out in say that both come in time of battle i take it that the moral courage come in go into the battle and the physical courage in stay in there be battle which be just as hard to go into and just as hard to stay in as the battle of arm and if the man will but stay and think never of himself there will come a time of grateful recollection when man will speak of he not only with admiration but with that which go deep with affection and with reverence
 so that this flag call upon we daily for service and the more quiet and self deny the service the great the glory of the flag we be dedicate to freedom and that freedom mean the freedom of the human spirit all free spirit ought to congregate on an occasion like this to do homage to the greatness of america as illustrate by the greatness of her son
 it have be a privilege lady and gentleman to come and say these simple word which i be sure be merely put your thought into language i thank you for the opportunity to lay this little wreath of mine upon these consecrate grave

mr. chairman and fellow citizens
 we be assemble to celebrate the one hundred and thirty eighth anniversary of the birth of the united states i suppose that we can more vividly realize the circumstance of that birth stand on this historic spot than it would be possible to realize they anywhere else the declaration of independence be write in philadelphia it be adopt in this historic building by which we stand i have just have the privilege of sit in the chair of the great man who preside over the deliberation of those who give the declaration to the world my hand rest at this moment upon the table upon which the declaration be sign we can feel that we be almost in the visible and tangible presence of a great historic transaction
 have you ever read the declaration of independence or attend with close comprehension to the real character of it when you have hear it read if you have you will know that it be not a fourth of july oration the declaration of independence be a document preliminary to war it be a vital piece of practical business not a piece of rhetoric and if you will pass beyond those preliminary passage which we be accustom to quote about the right of man and read into the heart of the document you will see that it be very express and detail that it consist of a series of definite specification concern actual public business of the day not the business of our day for the matter with which it deal be past but the business of that first revolution by which the nation be set up the business of 1776 its general statement its general declaration can not mean anything to we unless we append to it a similar specific body of particular as to what we consider the essential business of our own day
 liberty do not consist my fellow citizen in mere general declaration of the right of man it consist in the translation of those declaration into definite action therefore stand here where the declaration be adopt read its businesslike sentence we ought to ask ourselves what there be in it for we there be nothing in it for we unless we can translate it into the term of our own condition and of our own life we must reduce it to what the lawyer call a bill of particular it contain a bill of particular but the bill of particular of 1776 if we would keep it alive we must fill it with a bill of particular of the year 1914
 the task to which we have constantly to readdress ourselves be the task of prove that we be worthy of the man who draw this great declaration and know what they would have do in our circumstance patriotism consist in some very practical things&mdash;practical in that they belong to the life of every day that they wear no extraordinary distinction about they that they be connect with commonplace duty the way to be patriotic in america be not only to love america but to love the duty that lie near to our hand and know that in perform it we be serve our country there be some gentleman in washington for example at this very moment who be show themselves very patriotic in a way which do not attract wide attention but seem to belong to mere everyday obligation the member of the house and senate who stay in hot washington to maintain a quorum of the houses and transact the all important business of the nation be do an act of patriotism i honor they for it and i be glad to stay there and stick by they until the work be do
 it be patriotic also to learn what the fact of our national life be and to face they with candor i have hear a great many fact state about the present business condition of this country for example&mdash;a great many allegation of fact at any rate but the allegation do not tally with one another and yet i know that truth always match with truth and when i find some insist that everything be go wrong and other insist that everything be go right and when i know from a wide observation of the general circumstance of the country take as a whole that thing be go extremely well i wonder what those who be cry out that thing be wrong be try to do be they try to serve the country or be they try to serve something small than the country be they try to put hope into the heart of the man who work and toil every day or be they try to plant discouragement and despair in those heart and why do they cry that everything be wrong and yet do nothing to set it right if they love america and anything be wrong amongst we it be their business to put their hand with our to the task of set it right when the fact be know and acknowledge the duty of all patriotic man be to accept they in candor and to address themselves hopefully and confidently to the common counsel which be necessary to act upon they wisely and in universal concert
 i have have some experience in the last fourteen month which have not be entirely reassuring it be universally admit for example my fellow citizen that the banking system of this country need reorganization we set the good mind that we could find to the task of discover the good method of reorganization but we meet with hardly anything but criticism from the banker of the country we meet with hardly anything but resistance from the majority of those at least who speak at all concern the matter and yet so soon as that act be pass there be a universal chorus of applause and the very man who have oppose the measure join in that applause if it be wrong the day before it be pass why be it right the day after it be pass where have be the candor of criticism not only but the concert of counsel which make legislative action vigorous and safe and successful
 it be not patriotic to concert measure against one another it be patriotic to concert measure for one another
 in one sense the declaration of independence have lose its significance it have lose its significance as a declaration of national independence nobody outside of america believe when it be utter that we could make good our independence now nobody anywhere would dare to doubt that we be independent and can maintain our independence as a declaration of independence therefore it be a mere historic document our independence be a fact so stupendous that it can be measure only by the size and energy and variety and wealth and power of one of the great nation in the world but it be one thing to be independent and it be another thing to know what to do with your independence it be one thing to come to your majority and another thing to know what you be go to do with your life and your energy and one of the most serious question for sober minded man to address themselves to in the united states be this what be we go to do with the influence and power of this great nation be we go to play the old role of use that power for our aggrandizement and material benefit only you know what that may mean it may upon occasion mean that we shall use it to make the people of other nation suffer in the way in which we say it be intolerable to suffer when we utter our declaration of independence
 the department of state at washington be constantly call upon to back up the commercial enterprise and the industrial enterprise of the united states in foreign country and it at one time go so far in that direction that all its diplomacy come to be designate as dollar diplomacy it be call upon to support every man who want to earn anything anywhere if he be an american but there ought to be a limit to that there be no man who be more interested than i be in carry the enterprise of american business man to every quarter of the globe i be interested in it long before i be suspect of be a politician i have be preach it year after year as the great thing that lie in the future for the united states to show her wit and skill and enterprise and influence in every country in the world but observe the limit to all that which be lay upon we perhaps more than upon any other nation in the world we set this nation up at any rate we profess to set it up to vindicate the right of man we do not name any difference between one race and another we do not set up any barrier against any particular people we open our gate to all the world and say let all man who wish to be free come to we and they will be welcome we say this independence of ours be not a selfish thing for our own exclusive private use it be for everybody to whom we can find the mean of extend it we can not with that oath take in our youth we can not with that great ideal set before we when we be a young people and number only a scant 3,000,000 take upon ourselves now that we be 100,000,000 strong any other conception of duty than we then entertain if american enterprise in foreign country particularly in those foreign country which be not strong enough to resist we take the shape of impose upon and exploit the mass of the people of that country it ought to be check and not encourage i be willing to get anything for an american that money and enterprise can obtain except the suppression of the right of other man i will not help any man buy a power which he ought not to exercise over his fellow being
 you know my fellow countryman what a big question there be in mexico eighty five per cent of the mexican people have never be allow to have any genuine participation in their own government or to exercise any substantial right with regard to the very land they live upon all the right that man most desire have be exercise by the other fifteen per cent do you suppose that that circumstance be not sometimes in my thought i know that the american people have a heart that will beat just as strong for those million in mexico as it will beat or have beat for any other million elsewhere in the world and that when once they conceive what be at stake in mexico they will know what ought to be do in mexico i hear a great deal say about the loss of property in mexico and the loss of the life of foreigner and i deplore these thing with all my heart undoubtedly upon the conclusion of the present disturb condition in mexico those who have be unjustly deprive of their property or in any wise unjustly put upon ought to be compensate men&#39;s individual right have no doubt be invade and the invasion of those right have be attend by many deplorable circumstance which ought sometime in the proper way to be account for but back of it all be the struggle of a people to come into its own and while we look upon the incident in the foreground let we not forget the great tragic reality in the background which tower above the whole picture
 a patriotic american be a man who be not niggardly and selfish in the thing that he enjoy that make for human liberty and the right of man he want to share they with the whole world and he be never so proud of the great flag under which he live as when it come to mean to other people as well as to himself a symbol of hope and liberty i would be ashamed of this flag if it ever do anything outside america that we would not permit it to do inside of america
 the world be become more complicated every day my fellow citizen no man ought to be foolish enough to think that he understand it all and therefore i be glad that there be some simple thing in the world one of the simple thing be principle honesty be a perfectly simple thing it be hard for i to believe that in most circumstance when a man have a choice of way he do not know which be the right way and which be the wrong way no man who have choose the wrong way ought even to come into independence square it be holy ground which he ought not to tread upon he ought not to come where immortal voice have utter the great sentence of such a document as this declaration of independence upon which rest the liberty of a whole nation
 and so i say that it be patriotic sometimes to prefer the honor of the country to its material interest would you rather be deem by all the nation of the world incapable of keep your treaty obligation in order that you might have free toll for american ship the treaty under which we give up that right may have be a mistaken treaty but there be no mistake about its meaning
 when i have make a promise as a man i try to keep it and i know of no other rule permissible to a nation the most distinguished nation in the world be the nation that can and will keep its promise even to its own hurt and i want to say parenthetically that i do not think anybody be hurt i can not be enthusiastic for subsidy to a monopoly but let those who be enthusiastic for subsidy ask themselves whether they prefer subsidy to unsullied honor
 the most patriotic man lady and gentleman be sometimes the man who go in the direction that he think right even when he see half the world against he it be the dictate of patriotism to sacrifice yourself if you think that that be the path of honor and of duty do not blame other if they do not agree with you do not die with bitterness in your heart because you do not convince the rest of the world but die happy because you believe that you try to serve your country by not sell your soul those be grim day the day of 1776 those gentleman do not attach their name to the declaration of independence on this table expect a holiday on the next day and that 4th of july be not itself a holiday they attach their signature to that significant document know that if they fail it be certain that every one of they would hang for the failure they be commit treason in the interest of the liberty of 3,000,000 people in america all the rest of the world be against they and smile with cynical incredulity at the audacious undertaking do you think that if they could see this great nation now they would regret anything that they then do to draw the gaze of a hostile world upon they every idea must be start by somebody and it be a lonely thing to start anything yet if it be in you you must start it if you have a man&#39;s blood in you and if you love the country that you profess to be work for
 i be sometimes very much interested when i see gentleman suppose that popularity be the way to success in america the way to success in this great country with its fair judgment be to show that you be not afraid of anybody except god and his final verdict if i do not believe that i would not believe in democracy if i do not believe that i would not believe that people can govern themselves if i do not believe that the moral judgment would be the last judgment the final judgment in the mind of man as well as the tribunal of god i could not believe in popular government but i do believe these thing and therefore i earnestly believe in the democracy not only of america but of every awakened people that wish and intend to govern and control its own affair
 it be very inspiring my friend to come to this that may be call the original fountain of independence and liberty in american and here drink draught of patriotic feeling which seem to renew the very blood in one&#39;s vein down in washington sometimes when the day be hot and the business press intolerably and there be so many thing to do that it do not seem possible to do anything in the way it ought to be do it be always possible to lift one&#39;s think above the task of the moment and as it be to realize that great thing of which we be all part the great body of american feeling and american principle no man could do the work that have to be do in washington if he allow himself to be separate from that body of principle he must make himself feel that he be a part of the people of the united states that he be try to think not only for they but with they and then he can not feel lonely he not only can not feel lonely but he can not feel afraid of anything
 my dream be that as the year go on and the world know more and more of america it will also drink at these fountain of youth and renewal that it also will turn to america for those moral inspiration which lie at the basis of all freedom that the world will never fear america unless it feel that it be engage in some enterprise which be inconsistent with the right of humanity and that america will come into the full light of the day when all shall know that she put human right above all other right and that her flag be the flag not only of america but of humanity
 what other great people have devote itself to this exalt ideal to what other nation in the world can all eye look for an instant sympathy that thrill the whole body politic when man anywhere be fight for their right i do not know that there will ever be a declaration of independence and of grievance for mankind but i believe that if any such document be ever draw it will be draw in the spirit of the american declaration of independence and that america have lift high the light which will shine unto all generation and guide the foot of mankind to the goal of justice and liberty and peace

my fellow countryman

 i suppose that every thoughtful man in america have ask himself during these last troubled week what influence the european war may exert upon the united states and i take the liberty of address a few word to you in order to point out that it be entirely within our own choice what its effect upon we will be and to urge very earnestly upon you the sort of speech and conduct which will well safeguard the nation against distress and disaster

 the effect of the war upon the united states will depend upon what american citizen say and do every man who really love america will act and speak in the true spirit of neutrality which be the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all concern the spirit of the nation in this critical matter will be determine largely by what individual and society and those gather in public meeting do and say upon what newspaper and magazine contain upon what minister utter in their pulpit and man proclaim as their opinion on the street

 the people of the united states be draw from many nation and chiefly from the nation now at war it be natural and inevitable that there should be the utmost variety of sympathy and desire among they with regard to the issue and circumstance of the conflict some will wish one nation other another to succeed in the momentous struggle it will be easy to excite passion and difficult to allay it those responsible for exciting it will assume a heavy responsibility responsibility for no less a thing than that the people of the united states whose love of their country and whose loyalty to its government should unite they as americans all bind in honor and affection to think first of she and her interest may be divide in camp of hostile opinion hot against each other involve in the war itself in impulse and opinion if not in action

 such division among we would be fatal to our peace of mind and might seriously stand in the way of the proper performance of our duty as the one great nation at peace the one people hold itself ready to play a part of impartial mediation and speak the counsel of peace and accommodation not as a partisan but as a friend

 i venture therefore my fellow countryman to speak a solemn word of warning to you against that deepest most subtle most essential breach of neutrality which may spring out of partisanship out of passionately take side the united states must be neutral in fact as well as in name during these day that be to try man 's soul we must be impartial in thought as well as in action must put a curb upon our sentiment as well as upon every transaction that might be construe as a preference of one party to the struggle before another

 my thought be of america i be speak i feel sure the earnest wish and purpose of every thoughtful american that this great country of our which be of course the first in our thought and in our heart should show herself in this time of peculiar trial a nation fit beyond other to exhibit the fine poise of undisturbed judgment the dignity of self control the efficiency of dispassionate action a nation that neither sit in judgment upon other nor be disturb in her own counsel and which keep herself fit and free to do what be honest and disinterested and truly serviceable for the peace of the world

 shall we not resolve to put upon ourselves the restraint which will bring to our people the happiness and the great and lasting influence for peace we covet for they

mr. president gentlemen of the american bar association

 i be very deeply gratified by the greeting that your president have give i and by your response to it my only strength lie in your confidence

 we stand now in a peculiar case our first thought i suppose as lawyer be of international law of those bond of right and principle which draw the nation together and hold the community of the world to some standard of action we know that we see in international law as it be the moral process by which law itself come into existence i know that as a lawyer i have myself at time feel that there be no real comparison between the law of a nation and the law of nation because the latter lack the sanction that give the former strength and validity and yet if you look into the matter more closely you will find that the two have the same foundation and that those foundation be more evident and conspicuous in our day than they have ever be before

 the opinion of the world be the mistress of the world and the process of international law be the slow process by which opinion work its will what impress i be the constant thought that that be the tribunal at the bar of which we all sit i would call your attention incidentally to the circumstance that it do not observe the ordinary rule of evidence which have sometimes suggest to i that the ordinary rule of evidence have show some sign of grow antique everything rumor include be hear in this court and the standard of judgment be not so much the character of the testimony as the character of the witness the motive be disclose the purpose be conjecture and that opinion be finally accept which seem to be not the good found in law perhaps but the good found in integrity of character and of moral that be the process which be slowly work its will upon the world and what we should be watchful of be not so much jealous interest as sound principle of action the disinterested course be always the big course to pursue not only but it be in the long run the most profitable course to pursue if you can establish your character you can establish your credit

 what i want to suggest to this association in bid they very hearty welcome to the city be whether we sufficiently apply these same idea to the body of municipal law which we seek to administer citation seem to play so much large a role now than principle there be a time when the thoughtful eye of the judge rest upon the change of social circumstance and almost palpably see the law arise out of human life have we get to a time when the only way to change law be by statute the change of law by statute seem to i like mend a garment with a patch whereas law should grow by the life that be in it not by the life that be outside of it

 i once say to a lawyer with whom i be discuss some question of precedent and in whose presence i be venture to doubt the rational validity at any rate of the particular precedent he cite after all isn&#39;t our object justice and he say god forbid we should be very much confused if we make that our standard our standard be to find out what the rule have be and how the rule that have be applie to the case that be i should hate to think that the law be base entirely upon have been i should hate to think that the law do not derive its impulse from look forward rather than from look backward or rather that it do not derive its instruction from look about and see what the circumstance of man actually be and what the impulse of justice necessarily be

 understand i gentleman i be not venture in this presence to impeach the law for the present by the force of circumstance i be in part the embodiment of the law and it would be very awkward to disavow myself but i do wish to make this intimation that in this time of world change in this time when we be go to find out just how in what particular and to what extent the real fact of human life and the real moral judgment of mankind prevail it be worth while look inside our municipal law and see whether the judgment of the law be make square with the moral judgment of mankind for i believe that we be custodian not of command but of a spirit we be custodian of the spirit of righteousness of the spirit of equal handed justice of the spirit of hope which believe in the perfectibility of the law with the perfectibility of human life itself

 public life like private life would be very dull and dry if it be not for this belief in the essential beauty of the human spirit and the belief that the human spirit could be translate into action and into ordinance not entire you can not go any fast than you can advance the average moral judgment of the mass but you can go at least as fast as that and you can see to it that you do not lag behind the average moral judgment of the mass i have in my life deal with all sort and condition of man and i have find that the flame of moral judgment burn just as bright in the man of humble life and limited experience as in the scholar and the man of affair and i would like his voice always to be hear not as a witness not as speak in his own case but as if he be the voice of man in general in our court of justice as well as the voice of the lawyer remember what the law have be my hope be that be stir to the depth by the extraordinary circumstance of the time in which we live we may recover from those depth something of a renewal of that vision of the law with which man may be suppose to have start out in the old day of the oracle who commune with the intimation of divinity
the session upon which you be now enter will be the closing session of the sixty third congress a congress i venture to say which will long be remember for the great body of thoughtful and constructive work which it have do in loyal response to the thought and need of the country i should like in this address to review the notable record and try to make adequate assessment of it but no doubt we stand too near the work that have be do and be ourselves too much part of it to play the part of historian toward it our program of legislation with regard to the regulation of business be now virtually complete it have be put forth as we intend as a whole and leave no conjecture as to what be to follow the road at last lie clear and firm before business it be a road which it can travel without fear or embarrassment it be the road to ungrudged unclouded success in it every honest man every man who believe that the public interest be part of his own interest may walk with perfect confidence moreover our thought be now more of the future than of the past while we have work at our task of peace the circumstance of the whole age have be alter by war what we have do for our own land and our own people we do with the good that be in we whether of character or of intelligence with sober enthusiasm and a confidence in the principle upon which we be act which sustain we at every step of the difficult undertaking but it be do it have pass from our hand it be now an established part of the legislation of the country its usefulness its effect will disclose themselves in experience what chiefly strike we now as we look about we during these closing day of a year which will be forever memorable in the history of the world be that we face new task have be face they these six month must face they in the month to come face they without partisan feeling like man who have forget everything but a common duty and the fact that we be representative of a great people whose thought be not of we but of what america owe to herself and to all mankind in such circumstance as these upon which we look amazed and anxious war have interrupt the mean of trade not only but also the process of production in europe it be destroy man and resource wholesale and upon a scale unprecedented and appalling there be reason to fear that the time be near if it be not already at hand when several of the country of europe will find it difficult to do for their people what they have hitherto be always easily able to do,&mdash;many essential and fundamental thing at any rate they will need our help and our manifold service as they have never need they before and we should be ready more fit and ready than we have ever be it be of equal consequence that the nation whom europe have usually supply with innumerable article of manufacture and commerce of which they be in constant need and without which their economic development halt and stand still can now get only a small part of what they formerly import and eagerly look to we to supply their all but empty market this be particularly true of our own neighbor the states great and small of central and south america their line of trade have hitherto run chiefly athwart the sea not to our port but to the port of great britain and of the old continent of europe i do not stop to inquire why or to make any comment on probable cause what interest we just now be not the explanation but the fact and our duty and opportunity in the presence of it here be market which we must supply and we must find the mean of action the united states this great people for whom we speak and act should be ready as never before to serve itself and to serve mankind ready with its resource its energy its force of production and its mean of distribution it be a very practical matter a matter of way and mean we have the resource but be we fully ready to use they and if we can make ready what we have have we the mean at hand to distribute it we be not fully ready neither have we the mean of distribution we be willing but we be not fully able we have the wish to serve and to serve greatly generously but we be not prepared as we should be we be not ready to mobilize our resource at once we be not prepared to use they immediately and at their good without delay and without waste to speak plainly we have grossly err in the way in which we have stunt and hinder the development of our merchant marine and now when we need ship we have not get they we have year after year debate without end or conclusion the good policy to pursue with regard to the use of the ore and forest and water power of our national domain in the rich states of the west when we should have act and they be still lock up the key be still turn upon they the door shut fast at which thousand of vigorous man full of initiative knock clamorously for admittance the water power of our navigable stream outside the national domain also even in the eastern states where we have work and plan for generation be still not use as it might be because we will and we will not because the law we have make do not intelligently balance encouragement against restraint we withhold by regulation i have come to ask you to remedy and correct these mistake and omission even at this short session of a congress which would certainly seem to have do all the work that could reasonably be expect of it the time and the circumstance be extraordinary and so must our effort be also fortunately two great measure finely conceive the one to unlock with proper safeguard the resource of the national domain the other to encourage the use of the navigable water outside that domain for the generation of power have already pass the house of representatives and be ready for immediate consideration and action by the senate with the deep earnestness i urge their prompt passage in they both we turn our back upon hesitation and makeshift and formulate a genuine policy of use and conservation in the good sense of those word we owe the one measure not only to the people of that great western country for whose free and systematic development as it seem to i our legislation have do so little but also to the people of the nation as a whole and we as clearly owe the other fulfillment of our repeat promise that the water power of the country should in fact as well as in name be put at the disposal of great industry which can make economical and profitable use of it the right of the public be adequately guard the while and monopoly in the use prevent to have begin such measure and not complete they would indeed mar the record of this great congress very seriously i hope and confidently believe that they will be complete and there be another great piece of legislation which await and should receive the sanction of the senate i mean the bill which give a large measure of self government to the people of the philippines how well in this time of anxious questioning and perplexed policy could we show our confidence in the principle of liberty as the source as well as the expression of life how well could we demonstrate our own self possession and steadfastness in the course of justice and disinterestedness than by thus go calmly forward to fulfill our promise to a dependent people who will now look more anxiously than ever to see whether we have indeed the liberality the unselfishness the courage the faith we have boast and profess i can not believe that the senate will let this great measure of constructive justice await the action of another congress its passage would nobly crown the record of these two year of memorable labor but i think that you will agree with i that this do not complete the toll of our duty how be we to carry our good to the empty market of which i have speak if we have not the ship how be we to build tip a great trade if we have not the certain and content mean of transportation upon which all profitable and useful commerce depend and how be we to get the ship if we wait for the trade to develop without they to correct the many mistake by which we have discourage and all but destroy the merchant marine of the country to retrace the step by which we have it seem almost deliberately withdraw our flag from the sea except where here and there a ship of war be bid carry it or some wander yacht display it would take a long time and involve many detailed item of legislation and tile trade which we ought immediately to handle would disappear or find other channel while we debate the item the case be not unlike that which confront we when our own continent be to be open up to settlement and industry and we need long line of railway extended mean of transportation prepare beforehand if development be not to lag intolerably and wait interminably we lavishly subsidize the building of transcontinental railroad we look back upon that with regret now because the subsidy lead to many scandal of which we be ashamed but we know that the railroad have to be build and if we have it to do over again we should of course build they but in another way therefore i propose another way of provide the mean of transportation which must precede not tardily follow the development of our trade with our neighbor state of america it may seem a reversal of the natural order of thing but it be true that the route of trade must be actually opened&mdash;by many ship and regular sailing and moderate charges&mdash;before stream of merchandise will flow freely and profitably through they hence the pende shipping bill discuss at the last session but as yet pass by neither house in my judgment such legislation be imperatively need and can not wisely be postpone the government must open these gate of trade and open they wide open they before it be altogether profitable to open they or altogether reasonable to ask private capital to open they at a venture it be not a question of the government monopolize the field it should take action to make it certain that transportation at reasonable rate will be promptly provide even where the carriage be not at first profitable and then when the carriage have become sufficiently profitable to attract and engage private capital and engage it in abundance the government ought to withdraw i very earnestly hope that the congress will be of this opinion and that both houses will adopt this exceedingly important bill the great subject of rural credit still remain to be deal with and it be a matter of deep regret that the difficulty of the subject have seem to render it impossible to complete a bill for passage at this session but it can not be perfect yet and therefore there be no other constructive measure the necessity for which i will at this time call your attention to but i would be negligent of a very manifest duty be i not to call the attention of the senate to the fact that the propose convention for safety at sea await its confirmation and that the limit fix in the convention itself for its acceptance be the last day of the present month the conference in which this convention originate be call by the united states the representative of the united states play a very influential part indeed in frame the provision of the propose convention and those provision be in themselves for the most part admirable it would hardly be consistent with the part we have play in the whole matter to let it drop and go by the board as if forget and neglect it be ratify in may by the german government and in august by the parliament of great britain it mark a most hopeful and decide advance in international civilization we should show our earnest good faith in a great matter by add our own acceptance of it there be another matter of which i must make special mention if i be to discharge my conscience lest it should escape your attention it may seem a very small thing it affect only a single item of appropriation but many human life and many great enterprise hang upon it it be the matter of make adequate provision for the survey and chart of our coast it be immediately press and exigent in connection with the immense coast line of alaska a coast line great than that of the united states themselves though it be also very important indeed with regard to the old coast of the continent we can not use our great alaskan domain ship will not ply thither if those coast and their many hidden danger be not thoroughly survey and chart the work be incomplete at almost every point ship and life have be lose in thread what be suppose to be well know main channel we have not provide adequate vessel or adequate machinery for the survey and charting we have use old vessel that be not big enough or strong enough and which be so nearly unseaworthy that our inspector would not have allow private owner to send they to sea this be a matter which as i have say seem small but be in reality very great its importance have only to be look into to be appreciate before i close may i say a few word upon two topic much discuss out of door upon which it be highly important that our judgment should be clear definite and steadfast?one of these be economy in government expenditure the duty of economy be not debatable it be manifest and imperative in the appropriation we pass we be spend the money of the great people whose servant we be not our own we be trustee and responsible steward in the spending the only thing debatable and upon which we should be careful to make our thought and purpose clear be the kind of economy demand of we i assert with the great confidence that the people of the united states be not jealous of the amount their government cost if they be sure that they get what they need and desire for the outlay that the money be be spend for object of which they approve and that it be be apply with good business sense and management government grow piecemeal both in their task and in the mean by which those task be to be perform and very few government be organize i venture to say as wise and experienced business man would organize they if they have a clean sheet of paper to write upon certainly the government of the united states be not i think that it be generally agree that there should be a systematic reorganization and reassembling of its part so as to secure great efficiency and effect considerable saving in expense but the amount of money save in that way would i believe though no doubt considerable in itself run it may be into the million be relatively small small i mean in proportion to the total necessary outlay of the government it would be thoroughly worth effecting as every saving would great or small our duty be not alter by the scale of the saving but my point be that the people of the united states do not wish to curtail the activity of this government they wish rather to enlarge they and with every enlargement with the mere growth indeed of the country itself there must come of course the inevitable increase of expense the sort of economy we ought to practice may be effect and ought to be effect by a careful study and assessment of the task to be perform and the money spend ought to be make to yield the good possible return in efficiency and achievement and like good steward we should so account for every dollar of our appropriation as to make it perfectly evident what it be spend for and in what way it be spend it be not expenditure but extravagance that we should fear be criticize for not pay for the legitimate enterprise and undertaking of a great government whose people command what it should do but add what will benefit only a few or pour money out for what need not have be undertake at all or might have be postpone or well and more economically conceive and carry out the nation be not niggardly it be very generous it will chide we only if we forget for whom we pay money out and whose money it be we pay these be large and general standard but they be not very difficult of application to particular case the other topic i shall take leave to mention go deeply into the principle of our national life and policy it be the subject of national defense it can not be discuss without first answer some very search question it be say in some quarter that we be not prepared for war what be mean by be prepare be it mean that we be not ready upon brief notice to put a nation in the field a nation of man train to arm of course we be not ready to do that and we shall never be in time of peace so long as we retain our present political principle and institution and what be it that it be suggest we should be prepare to do to defend ourselves against attack we have always find mean to do that and shall find they whenever it be necessary without call our people away from their necessary task to render compulsory military service in time of peace allow i to speak with great plainness and directness upon this great matter and to avow my conviction with deep earnestness i have try to know what america be what her people think what they be what they most cherish and hold dear i hope that some of their fine passion be in my own heart,&mdash;some of the great conception and desire which give birth to this government and which have make the voice of this people a voice of peace and hope and liberty among the people of the world and that speak my own thought i shall at least in part speak theirs also however faintly and inadequately upon this vital matter we be at peace with all the world no one who speak counsel base on fact or draw from a just and candid interpretation of reality can say that there be reason to fear that from any quarter our independence or the integrity of our territory be threaten dread of the power of any other nation we be incapable of we be not jealous of rivalry in the field of commerce or of any other peaceful achievement we mean to live our own life as we will but we mean also to let live we be indeed a true friend to all the nation of the world because we threaten none covet the possession of none desire the overthrow of none our friendship can be accept and be accept without reservation because it be offer in a spirit and for a purpose which no one need ever question or suspect therein lie our greatness we be the champion of peace and of concord and we should be very jealous of this distinction which we have seek to earn just now we should be particularly jealous of it because it be our dear present hope that this character and reputation may presently in god 's providence bring we an opportunity such as have seldom be vouchsafe any nation the opportunity to counsel and obtain peace in the world and reconciliation and a heal settlement of many a matter that have cool and interrupt the friendship of nation this be the time above all other when we should wish and resolve to keep our strength by self possession our influence by preserve our ancient principle of action from the first we have have a clear and settle policy with regard to military establishment we never have have and while we retain our present principle and ideal we never shall have a large stand army if ask be you ready to defend yourself we reply most assuredly to the utmost and yet we shall not turn america into a military camp we will not ask our young man to spend the good year of their life make soldier of themselves there be another sort of energy in we it will know how to declare itself and make itself effective should occasion arise and especially when half the world be on fire we shall be careful to make our moral insurance against the spread of the conflagration very definite and certain and adequate indeed let we remind ourselves therefore of the only thing we can do or will do we must depend in every time of national peril in the future as in the past not upon a stand army nor yet upon a reserve army but upon a citizenry train and accustom to arm it will be right enough right american policy base upon our accustomed principle and practice to provide a system by which every citizen who will volunteer for the training may be make familiar with the use of modern arm the rudiment of drill and maneuver and the maintenance and sanitation of camp we should encourage such training and make it a means of discipline which our young man will learn to value it be right that we should provide it not only but that we should make it as attractive as possible and so induce our young man to undergo it at such time as they can command a little freedom and can seek the physical development they need for mere health 's sake if for nothing more every mean by which such thing can be stimulate be legitimate and such a method smack of true american idea it be right too that the national guard of the states should be develop and strengthen by every mean which be not inconsistent with our obligation to our own people or with the establish policy of our government and this also not because the time or occasion specially call for such measure but because it should be our constant policy to make these provision for our national peace and safety more than this carry with it a reversal of the whole history and character of our polity more than this propose at this time permit i to say would mean merely that we have lose our self possession that we have be throw off our balance by a war with which we have nothing to do whose cause can not touch we whose very existence afford we opportunity of friendship and disinterested service which should make we ashamed of any thought of hostility or fearful preparation for trouble this be assuredly the opportunity for which a people and a government like ours be raise up the opportunity not only to speak but actually to embody and exemplify the counsel of peace and amity and the last concord which be base on justice and fair and generous dealing a powerful navy we have always regard as our proper and natural mean of defense and it have always be of defense that we have think never of aggression or of conquest but who shall tell we now what sort of navy to build we shall take leave to be strong upon the sea in the future as in the past and there will be no thought of offense or of provocation in that our ship be our natural bulwark when will the expert tell we just what kind we should construct and when will they be right for ten year together if the relative efficiency of craft of different kind and use continue to change as we have see it change under our very eye in these last few month but i turn away from the subject it be not new there be no new need to discuss it we shall not alter our attitude toward it because some amongst we be nervous and excited we shall easily and sensibly agree upon a policy of defense the question have not change its aspect because the time be not normal our policy will not be for an occasion it will be conceive as a permanent and settled thing which we will pursue at all season without haste and after a fashion perfectly consistent with the peace of the world the abide friendship of state and the unhampere freedom of all with whom we deal let there be no misconception the country have be misinform we have not be negligent of national defense we be not unmindful of the great responsibility rest upon we we shall learn and profit by the lesson of every experience and every new circumstance and what be need will be adequately do i close as i begin by remind you of the great task and duty of peace which challenge our good power and invite we to build what will last the task to which we can address ourselves now and at all time with free hearted zest and with all the fine gift of constructive wisdom we possess to develop our life and our resource to supply our own people and the people of the world as their need arise from the abundant plenty of our field and our mart of trade to enrich the commerce of our own states and of the world with the product of our mine our farm and our factory with the creation of our thought and the fruit of our character this be what will hold our attention and our enthusiasm steadily now and in the year to come as we strive to show in our life as a nation what liberty and the inspiration of an emancipate spirit may do for man and for society for individual for state and for mankind
to the house of representatives
 it be with unaffected regret that i find myself constrain by clear conviction to return this bill h.r. 6060 an act to regulate the immigration of alien to and the residence of alien in the united states without my signature not only do i feel it to be a very serious matter to exercise the power of veto in any case because it involve oppose the single judgment of the president to the judgment of a majority of both the houses of the congress a step which no man who realize his own liability to error can take without great hesitation but also because this particular bill be in so many important respect admirable well conceive and desirable its enactment into law would undoubtedly enhance the efficiency and improve the method of handle the important branch of the public service to which it relate but candor and a sense of duty with regard to the responsibility so clearly impose upon i by the constitution in matter of legislation leave i no choice but to dissent
 in two particular of vital consequence this bill embody a radical departure from the traditional and long establish policy of this country a policy in which our people have conceive the very character of their government to be express the very mission and spirit of the nation in respect of its relation to the people of the world outside their border it seek to all but close entirely the gate of asylum which have always be open to those who could find nowhere else the right and opportunity of constitutional agitation for what they conceive to be the natural and inalienable right of man and it exclude those to whom the opportunity of elementary education have be deny without regard to their character their purpose or their natural capacity
 restriction like these adopt early in our history as a nation would very materially have alter the course and cool the humane ardor of our politic the right of political asylum have bring to this country many a man of noble character and elevated purpose who be mark as an outlaw in his own less fortunate land and who have yet become an ornament to our citizenship and to our public council the child and the compatriot of these illustrious americans must stand amazed to see the representative of their nation now resolve in the fullness of our national strength and at the maturity of our great institution to risk turn such man back from our shore without test of quality or purpose it be difficult for i to believe that the full effect of this feature of the bill be realize when it be frame and adopt and it be impossible for i to assent to it in the form in which it be here cast
 the literacy test and the test and restriction which accompany it constitute an even more radical change in the policy of the nation hitherto we have generously keep our door open to all who be not unfit by reason of disease or incapacity for self support or such personal record and antecedent as be likely to make they a menace to our peace and order or to the wholesome and essential relationship of life in this bill it be propose to turn away from test of character and of quality and impose test which exclude and restrict for the new test here embody be not test of quality or of character or of personal fitness but test of opportunity those who come seek opportunity be not to be admit unless they have already have one of the chief of the opportunity they seek the opportunity of education the object of such provision be restriction not selection
 if the people of this country have make up their mind to limit the number of immigrant by arbitrary test and so reverse the policy of all the generation of americans that have go before they it be their right to do so i be their servant and have no license to stand in their way but i do not believe that they have i respectfully submit that no one can quote their mandate to that effect have any political party ever avow a policy of restriction in this fundamental matter go to the country on it and be commission to control its legislation do this bill rest upon the conscious and universal assent and desire of the american people i doubt it it be because i doubt it that i make bold to dissent from it i be willing to abide by the verdict but not until it have be render let the platform of party speak out upon this policy and the people pronounce their wish the matter be too fundamental to be settle otherwise
 i have no pride of opinion in this question i be not foolish enough to profess to know the wish and ideal of america well than the body of her choose representative know they i only want instruction direct from those whose fortune with our and all men&#39;s be involve

gentlemen of the congress since i last have the privilege of address you on the state of the union the war of nation on the other side of the sea which have then only begin to disclose its portentous proportion have extend its threatening and sinister scope until it have sweep within its flame some portion of every quarter of the globe not except our own hemisphere have alter the whole face of international affair and now present a prospect of reorganization and reconstruction such as statesman and people have never be call upon to attempt before we have stand apart studiously neutral it be our manifest duty to do so not only do we have no part or interest in the policy which seem to have bring the conflict on it be necessary if a universal catastrophe be to be avoid that a limit should be set to the sweep of destructive war and that some part of the great family of nation should keep the process of peace alive if only to prevent collective economic ruin and the breakdown throughout the world of the industry by which its population be feed and sustain it be manifestly the duty of the self govern nation of this hemisphere to redress if possible the balance of economic loss and confusion in the other if they could do nothing more in the day of readjustment and recuperation we earnestly hope and believe that they can be of infinite service in this neutrality to which they be bid not only by their separate life and their habitual detachment from the politic of europe but also by a clear perception of international duty the state of america have become conscious of a new and more vital community of interest and moral partnership in affair more clearly conscious of the many common sympathy and interest and duty which bid they stand together there be a time in the early day of our own great nation and of the republic fight their way to independence in central and south america when the government of the united states look upon itself as in some sort the guardian of the republic to the south of she as against any encroachment or effort at political control from the other side of the water feel it its duty to play the part even without invitation from they and i think that we can claim that the task be undertake with a true and disinterested enthusiasm for the freedom of the americas and the unmolested self government of her independent people but it be always difficult to maintain such a role without offense to the pride of the people whose freedom of action we seek to protect and without provoke serious misconception of our motive and every thoughtful man of affair must welcome the altered circumstance of the new day in whose light we now stand when there be no claim of guardianship or thought of ward but instead a full and honorable association as of partner between ourselves and our neighbor in the interest of all america north and south our concern for the independence and prosperity of the state of central and south america be not alter we retain unabate the spirit that have inspire we throughout the whole life of our government and which be so frankly put into word by president monroe we still mean always to make a common cause of national independence and of political liberty in america but that purpose be now well understand so far as it concern ourselves it be know not to be a selfish purpose it be know to have in it no thought of take advantage of any government in this hemisphere or play its political fortune for our own benefit all the government of america stand so far as we be concern upon a footing of genuine equality and unquestioned independence we have be put to the test in the case of mexico and we have stand the test whether we have benefit mexico by the course we have pursue remain to be see her fortune be in her own hand but we have at least prove that we will not take advantage of she in her distress and undertake to impose upon she an order and government of our own choosing liberty be often a fierce and intractable thing to which no bound can be set and to which no bound of a few man 's choosing ought ever to be set every american who have drink at the true fountain of principle and tradition must subscribe without reservation to the high doctrine of the virginia bill of rights which in the great day in which our government be set up be everywhere amongst we accept as the creed of free man that doctrine be that government be or ought to be institute for the common benefit protection and security of the people nation or community that of all the various mode and form of government that be the good which be capable of produce the great degree of happiness and safety and be most effectually secure against the danger of maladministration and that when any government shall be find inadequate or contrary to these purpose a majority of the community hath an indubitable inalienable and indefeasible right to reform alter or abolish it in such manner as shall be judge most conducive to the public weal we have unhesitatingly apply that heroic principle to the case of mexico and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic which have so much of which to purge itself and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in the radical but necessary process we will aid and befriend mexico but we will not coerce she and our course with regard to she ought to be sufficient proof to all america that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish control the moral be that the state of america be not hostile rival but cooperate friend and that their grow sense of community or interest alike in matter political and in matter economic be likely to give they a new significance as factor in international affair and in the political history of the world it present they as in a very deep and true sense a unit in world affair spiritual partner stand together because think together quick with common sympathy and common ideal separated they be subject to all the cross current of the confused politic of a world of hostile rivalry unite in spirit and purpose they can not be disappoint of their peaceful destiny this be pan americanism it have none of the spirit of empire in it it be the embodiment the effectual embodiment of the spirit of law and independence and liberty and mutual service a very notable body of man recently meet in the city of washington at the invitation and as the guest of this government whose deliberation be likely to be look back to as mark a memorable turning point in the history of america they be representative spokesman of the several independent state of this hemisphere and be assemble to discuss the financial and commercial relation of the republic of the two continent which nature and political fortune have so intimately link together i earnestly recommend to your perusal the report of their proceeding and of the action of their committee you will get from they i think a fresh conception of the ease and intelligence and advantage with which americans of both continent may draw together in practical cooperation and of what the material foundation of this hopeful partnership of interest must consist,-of how we should build they and of how necessary it be that we should hasten their building there be i venture to point out an especial significance just now attach to this whole matter of draw the americans together in bond of honorable partnership and mutual advantage because of the economic readjustment which the world must inevitably witness within the next generation when peace shall have at last resume its healthful task in the performance of these task i believe the americas to be destine to play their part together i be interested to fix your attention on this prospect now because unless you take it within your view and permit the full significance of it to command your thought i can not find the right light in which to set forth the particular matter that lie at the very font of my whole thought as i address you to day i mean national defense no one who really comprehend the spirit of the great people for whom we be appoint to speak can fail to perceive that their passion be for peace their genius well display in the practice of the art of peace great democracy be not belligerent they do not seek or desire war their thought be of individual liberty and of the free labor that support life and the uncensored thought that quicken it conquest and dominion be not in our reckoning or agreeable to our principle but just because we demand unmoleste development and the undisturbed government of our own life upon our own principle of right and liberty we resent from whatever quarter it may come the aggression we ourselves will not practice we insist upon security in prosecute our self choose line of national development we do more than that we demand it also for other we do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and free national development to the incident and movement of affair which affect only ourselves we feel it wherever there be a people that try to walk in these difficult path of independence and right from the first we have make common cause with all partisan of liberty on this side the sea and have deem it as important that our neighbor should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be.- have set america aside as a whole for the use of independent nation and political freeman out of such thought grow all our policy we regard war merely as a means of assert the right of a people against aggression and we be as fiercely jealous of coercive or dictatorial power within our own nation as of aggression from without we will not maintain a stand army except for use which be as necessary in time of peace as in time of war and we shall always see to it that our military peace establishment be no large than be actually and continuously need for the use of day in which no enemy move against we but we do believe in a body of free citizen ready and sufficient to take care of themselves and of the government which they have set up to serve they in our constitution themselves we have command that the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe and our confidence have be that our safety in time of danger would lie in the rise of the nation to take care of itself as the farmer rise at lexington but war have never be a mere matter of man and gun it be a thing of disciplined might if our citizen be ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summon they must know how modern fighting be do and what to do when the summon come to render themselves immediately available and immediately effective and the government must be their servant in this matter must supply they with the training they need to take care of themselves and of it the military arm of their government which they will not allow to direct they they may properly use to serve they and make their independence secure,-and not their own independence merely but the right also of those with whom they have make common cause should they also be put in jeopardy they must be fit to play the great role in the world and particularly in this hemisphere for which they be qualified by principle and by chastened ambition to play it be with these ideal in mind that the plan of the department of war for more adequate national defense be conceive which will be lay before you and which i urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinize and discuss they seem to i the essential first step and they seem to i for the present sufficient they contemplate an increase of the stand force of the regular army from its present strength of five thousand and twenty three officer and one hundred and two thousand nine hundred and eightyfive enlisted man of all service to a strength of seven thousand one hundred and thirty six officer and one hundred and thirty four thousand seven hundred and seven enlisted man or 141,843 all tell all service rank and file by the addition of fifty two company of coast artillery fifteen company of engineer ten regiment of infantry four regiment of field artillery and four aero squadron besides seven hundred and fifty officer require for a great variety of extra service especially the all important duty of train the citizen force of which i shall presently speak seven hundred and ninety two noncommissioned officer for service in drill recruiting and the like and the necessary quota of enlisted man for the quartermaster corps the hospital corps the ordnance department and other similar auxiliary service these be the addition necessary to render the army adequate for its present duty duty which it have to perform not only upon our own continental coast and border and at our interior army post but also in the philippines in the hawaiian islands at the isthmus and in porto rico by way of make the country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly and upon a large scale should occasion arise the plan also contemplate supplement the army by a force of four hundred thousand disciplined citizen raise in increment of one hundred and thirty three thousand a year throughout a period of three year this it be propose to do by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable man of the country would be ask to bind themselves to serve with the color for purpose of training for short period throughout three year and to come to the color at call at any time throughout an additional furlough period of three year this force of four hundred thousand man would be provide with personal accoutrement as fast as enlisted and their equipment for the field make ready to be supply at any time they would be assemble for training at state interval at convenient place in association with suitable unit of the regular army their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two month in the year it would depend upon the patriotic feeling of the young man of the country whether they respond to such a call to service or not it would depend upon the patriotic spirit of the employer of the country whether they make it possible for the young man in their employ to respond under favorable condition or not i for one do not doubt the patriotic devotion either of our young man or of those who give they employment,--those for whose benefit and protection they would in fact enlist i would look forward to the success of such an experiment with entire confidence at least so much by way of preparation for defense seem to i to be absolutely imperative now we can not do less the programme which will be lay before you by the secretary of the navy be similarly conceive it involve only a shortening of the time within which plan long mature shall be carry out but it do make definite and explicit a programme which have heretofore be only implicit hold in the mind of the committees on naval affairs and disclose in the debate of the two houses but nowhere formulate or formally adopt it seem to i very clear that it will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt a comprehensive plan for put the navy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency and to press that plan to completion within the next five year we have always look to the navy of the country as our first and chief line of defense we have always see it to be our manifest course of prudence to be strong on the sea year by year we have be create a navy which now rank very high indeed among the navy of the maritime nation we should now definitely determine how we shall complete what we have begin and how soon the programme to be lay before you contemplate the construction within five year of ten battleship six battle cruiser ten scout cruiser fifty destroyer fifteen fleet submarine eighty five coast submarine four gunboat one hospital ship two ammunition ship two fuel oil ship and one repair ship it be propose that of this number we shall the first year provide for the construction of two battleship two battle cruiser three scout cruiser fifteen destroyer five fleet submarine twenty five coast submarine two gunboat and one hospital ship the second year two battleship one scout cruiser ten destroyer four fleet submarine fifteen coast submarine one gunboat and one fuel oil ship the third year two battleship one battle cruiser two scout cruiser five destroyer two fleet sub marine and fifteen coast submarine the fourth year two battleship two battle cruiser two scout cruiser ten destroyer two fleet submarine fifteen coast submarine one ammunition ship and one fuel oil ship and the fifth year two battleship one battle cruiser two scout cruiser ten destroyer two fleet submarine fifteen coast submarine one gunboat one ammunition ship and one repair ship the secretary of the navy be ask also for the immediate addition to the personnel of the navy of seven thousand five hundred sailor twenty five hundred apprentice seaman and fifteen hundred marine this increase would be sufficient to care for the ship which be to be complete within the fiscal year 1917 and also for the number of man which must be put in training to man the ship which will be complete early in 1918 it be also necessary that the number of midshipman at the naval academy at annapolis should be increase by at least three hundred in order that the force of officer should be more rapidly add to and authority be ask to appoint for engineering duty only approve graduate of engineering college and for service in the aviation corp a certain number of man take from civil life if this full programme should be carry out we should have build or build in 1921 accord to the estimate of survival and standard of classification follow by the general board of the department an effective navy consist of twenty seven battleship of the first line six battle cruiser twenty five battleship of the second line ten armored cruiser thirteen scout cruiser five first class cruiser three second class cruiser ten third class cruiser one hundred and eight destroyer eighteen fleet submarine one hundred and fifty seven coast submarine six monitor twenty gunboat four supply ship fifteen fuel ship four transport three tender to torpedo vessel eight vessel of special type and two ammunition ship this would be a navy fit to our need and worthy of our tradition but army and instrument of war be only part of what have to be consider if we be to provide for the supreme matter of national self sufficiency and security in all its aspect there be other great matter which will be thrust upon our attention whether we will or not there be for example a very pressing question of trade and shipping involve in this great problem of national adequacy it be necessary for many weighty reason of national efficiency and development that we should have a great merchant marine the great merchant fleet we once use to make we rich that great body of sturdy sailor who use to carry our flag into every sea and who be the pride and often the bulwark of the nation we have almost drive out of existence by inexcusable neglect and indifference and by a hope lessly blind and provincial policy of so call economic protection it be high time we repair our mistake and resume our commercial independence on the sea for it be a question of independence if other nation go to war or seek to hamper each other 's commerce our merchant it seem be at their mercy to do with as they please we must use their ship and use they as they determine we have not ship enough of our own we can not handle our own commerce on the sea our independence be provincial and be only on land and within our own border we be not likely to be permit to use even the ship of other nation in rivalry of their own trade and be without mean to extend our commerce even where the door be wide open and our good desire such a situation be not to be endure it be of capital importance not only that the united states should be its own carrier on the sea and enjoy the economic independence which only an adequate merchant marine would give it but also that the american hemisphere as a whole should enjoy a like independence and self sufficiency if it be not to be draw into the tangle of european affair without such independence the whole question of our political unity and self determination be very seriously clouded and complicated indeed moreover we can develop no true or effective american policy without ship of our own,--not ship of war but ship of peace carry good and carry much more create friendship and render indispensable service to all interest on this side the water they must move constantly back and forth between the americas they be the only shuttle that can weave the delicate fabric of sympathy -comprehension confidence and mutual dependence in which we wish to clothe our policy of america for americans the task of build up an adequate merchant marine for america private capital must ultimately undertake and achieve as it have undertake and achieve every other like task amongst we in the past with admirable enterprise intelligence and vigor and it seem to i a manif dictate of wisdom that we should promptly remove every legal obstacle that may stand in the way of this much to be desire revival of our old independence and should facilitate in every possible way the building purchase and american registration of ship but capital can not accomplish this great task of a sudden it must embark upon it by degree as the opportunity of trade develop something must be do at once do to open route and develop opportunity where they be as yet undeveloped do to open the artery of trade where the current have not yet learn to run,-especially between the two american continent where they be singularly enough yet to be create and quicken and it be evident that only the government can undertake such beginning and assume the initial financial risk when the risk have pass and private capital begin to find its way in sufficient abundance into these new channel the government may withdraw but it can not omit to begin it should take the first step and should take they at once our good must not lie pile up at our port and store upon side track in freight car which be daily need on the road must not be leave without mean of transport to any foreign quarter we must not await the permission of foreign ship owner and foreign government to send they where we will with a view to meet these press necessity of our commerce and avail ourselves at the early possible moment of the present unparalleled opportunity of link the two americas together in bond of mutual interest and service an opportunity which may never return again if we miss it now proposal will be make to the present congress for the purchase or construction of ship to be own and direct by the government similar to those make to the last congress but modify in some essential particular i recommend these proposal to you for your prompt acceptance with the more confidence because every month that have elapse since the former proposal be make have make the necessity for such action more and more manifestly imperative that need be then foresee it be now acutely feel and everywhere realize by those for whom trade be wait but who can find no conveyance for their good i be not so much interested in the particular of the programme as i be in take immediate advantage of the great opportunity which await we if we will but act in this emergency in this matter as in all other a spirit of common counsel should prevail and out of it should come an early solution of this press problem there be another matter which seem to i to be very intimately associate with the question of national safety and preparation for defense that be our policy towards the philippines and the people of porto rico our treatment of they and their attitude towards we be manifestly of the first consequence in the development of our duty in the world and in get a free hand to perform those duty we must be free from every unnecessary burden or embarrassment and there be no well way to be clear of embarrassment than to fulfil our promise and promote the interest of those dependent on we to the utmost bill for the alteration and reform of the government of the philippines and for render full political justice to the people of porto rico be submit to the sixty third congress they will be submit also to you i need not particularize their detail you be most of you already familiar with they but i do recommend they to your early adoption with the sincere conviction that there be few measure you could adopt which would more serviceably clear the way for the great policy by which we wish to make good now and always our right to lead in enterprisc of peace and good will and economic and political freedom the plan for the armed force of the nation which i have outline and for the general policy of adequate preparation for mobilization and defense involve of course very large additional expenditure of money,-expenditure which will considerably exceed the estimate revenue of the government it be make my duty by law whenever the estimate of expenditure exceed the estimate of revenue to call the attention of the congress to the fact and suggest any mean of meet the deficiency that it may be wise or possible for i to suggest i be ready to believe that it would be my duty to do so in any case and i feel particularly bind to speak of the matter when it appear that the deficiency will arise directly out of the adoption by the congress of measure which i myself urge it to adopt allow i therefore to speak briefly of the present state of the treasury and of the fiscal problem which the next year will probably disclose on the thirtieth of june last there be an available balance in the general fund of the treasury of $ 104,170,105.78 the total estimate receipt for the year 1916 on the assumption that the emergency revenue measure pass by the last congress will not be extend beyond its present limit the thirty first of december 1915 and that the present duty of one cent per pound on sugar will be discontinue after the first of may 1916 will be $ 670,365,500 the balance of june last and these estimate revenue come therefore to a grand total of $ 774,535,605 78 the total estimate disbursement for the present fiscal year include twenty five million for the panama canal twelve million for probable deficiency appropriation and fifty thousand dollar for miscellaneous debt redemption will be $ 753,891,000 and the balance in the general fund of the treasury will be reduce to $ 20,644,605.78 the emergency revenue act if continue beyond its present time limitation would produce during the half year then remain about forty one million the duty of one cent per pound on sugar if continue would produce during the two month of the fiscal year remain after the first of may about fifteen million these two sum amount together to fifty six million if add to the revenue of the second half of the fiscal year would yield the treasury at the end of the year an available balance of $ 76,644,605 78.the additional revenue require to carry out the programme of military and naval preparation of which i have speak would as at present estimate be for the fiscal year 1917 $ 93,800,000 those figure take with the figure for the present fiscal year which i have already give disclose our financial problem for the year 1917 assume that the taxis impose by the emergency revenue act and the present duty on sugar be to be discontinue and that the balance at the close of the present fiscal year will be only $ 20,644,605.78 that the disbursement for the panama canal will again be about twenty five million and that the additional expenditure for the army and navy be authorize by the congress the deficit in the general fund of the treasury on the thirtieth of june 1917 will be nearly two hundred and thirty five million to this sum at least fifty million should be add to represent a safe work balance for the treasury and twelve million to include the usual deficiency estimate in 1917 and these addition would make a total deficit of some two hundred and ninety seven million if the present taxis should be continue throughout this year and the next however there would be a balance in the treasury of some seventy six and a half million at the end of the present fiscal year and a deficit at the end of the next year of only some fifty million or reckon in sixty two million for deficiency appropriation and a safe treasury balance at the end of the year a total deficit of some one hundred and twelve million the obvious moral of the figure be that it be a plain counsel of prudence to continue all of the present taxis or their equivalent and confine ourselves to the problem of provide one hundred and twelve million of new revenue rather than two hundred and ninety seven million how shall we obtain the new revenue we be frequently remind that there be many million of bond which the treasury be authorize under exist law to sell to reimburse the sum pay out of current revenue for the construction of the panama canal and it be true that bond to the amount of approximately $ 222,000,000 be now available for that purpose prior to 1913 $ 134,631,980 of these bond have actually be sell to recoup the expenditure at the isthmus and now constitute a considerable item of the public debt but i for one do not believe that the people of this country approve of postpone the payment of their bill borrow money be short sighted finance it can be justify only when permanent thing be to be accomplish which many generation will certainly benefit by and which it seem hardly fair that a single generation should pay for the object we be now propose to spend money for can not be so classified except in the sense that everything wisely do may be say to be do in the interest of posterity as well as in our own it seem to i a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that in what we be now i hope about to undertake we should pay as we go the people of the country be entitle to know just what burden of taxation they be to carry and to know from the outset now the new bill should be pay by internal taxation to what source then shall we turn this be so peculiarly a question which the gentleman of the house of representatives be expect under the constitution to propose an answer to that you will hardly expect i to do more than discuss it in very general term we should be follow an almost universal example of modern government if we be to draw the great part or even the whole of the revenue we need from the income taxis by somewhat lower the present limit of exemption and the figure at which the surtax shall begin to be impose and by increase step by step throughout the present graduation the surtax itself the income taxis as at present apportion would yield sum sufficient to balance the book of the treasury at the end of the fiscal year 1917 without anywhere make the burden unreasonably or oppressively heavy the precise reckoning be fully and accurately set out in the report of the secretary of the treasury which will be immediately lay before you and there be many additional source of revenue which can justly be resort to without hamper the industry of the country or put any too great charge upon individual expenditure a tax of one cent per gallon on gasoline and naphtha would yield at the present estimate production $ 10,000,000 a tax of fifty cent per horse power on automobile and internal explosion engine $ 15,000,000 a stamp tax on bank cheque probably $ 18,000,000 a tax of twenty five cent per ton on pig iron $ 10,000,000 a tax of twenty five cent per ton on fabricate iron and steel probably $ 10,000,000 in a country of great industry like this it ought to be easy to distribute the burden of taxation without make they anywhere bear too heavily or too exclusively upon any one set of person or undertaking what be clear be that the industry of this generation should pay the bill of this generation i have speak to you to day gentlemen upon a single theme the thorough preparation of the nation to care for its own security and to make sure of entire freedom to play the impartial role in this hemisphere and in the world which we all believe to have be providentially assign to it i have have in my mind no thought of any immediate or particular danger arise out of our relation with other nation we be at peace with all the nation of the world and there be reason to hope that no question in controversy between this and other government will lead to any serious breach of amicable relation grave as some difference of attitude and policy have be land may yet turn out to be i be sorry to say that the grave threat against our national peace and safety have be utter within our own border there be citizen of the united states i blush to admit bear under other flag but welcome under our generous naturalization law to the full freedom and opportunity of america who have pour the poison of disloyalty into the very artery of our national life who have seek to bring the authority and good name of our government into contempt to destroy our industry wherever they think it effective for their vindictive purpose to strike at they and to debase our politic to the use of foreign intrigue their number be not great as compare with the whole number of those sturdy host by which our nation have be enrich in recent generation out of virile foreign stock but it be great enough to have bring deep disgrace upon we and to have make it necessary that we should promptly make use of process of law by which we may be purge of their corrupt distemper america never witness anything like this before it never dream it possible that man swear into its own citizenship man draw out of great free stock such as supply some of the good and strong element of that little but how heroic nation that in a high day of old stake its very life to free itself from every entanglement that have darken the fortune of the old nation and set up a new standard here that man of such origin and such free choice of allegiance would ever turn in malign reaction against the government and people who bad welcome and nurture they and seek to make this proud country once more a hotbed of european passion a little while ago such a thing would have seem incredible because it be incredible we make no preparation for it we would have be almost ashamed to prepare for it as if we be suspicious of ourselves our own comrade and neighbor but the ugly and incredible thing have actually come about and we be without adequate federal law to deal with it i urge you to enact such law at the early possible moment and feel that in do so i be urge you to do nothing less than save the honor and self respect of the nation such creature of passion disloyalty and anarchy must be crush out they be not many but they be infinitely malignant and the hand of our power should close over they at once they have form plot to destroy property they have enter into conspiracy against the neutrality of the government they have seek to pry into every confidential transaction of the government in order to serve interest alien to our own it be possible to deal with these thing very effectually i need not suggest the term in which they may be deal with i wish that it could be say that only a few man mislead by mistaken sentiment of allegiance to the government under which they be bear have be guilty of disturb the self possession and misrepresent the temper and principle of the country during these day of terrible war when it would seem that every man who be truly an american would instinctively make it his duty and his pride to keep the scale of judgment even and prove himself a partisan of no nation but his own but it can not there be some man among we and many resident abroad who though bear and breed in the united states and call themselves americans have so forget themselves and their honor as citizen as to put their passionate sympathy with one or the other side in the great european conflict above their regard for the peace and dignity of the united states they also preach and practice disloyalty no law i suppose can reach corruption of the mind and heart but i should not speak of other without also speak of these and express the even deep humiliation and scorn which every self possess and thoughtfully patriotic american must feel when lie think of they and of the discredit they be daily bring upon we while we speak of the preparation of the nation to make sure of her security and her effective power we must not fall into the patent error of suppose that her real strength come from armament and mere safeguard of write law it come of course from her people their energy their success in their undertaking their free opportunity to use the natural resource of our great home land and of the land outside our continental border which look to we for protection for encouragement and for assistance in their development from the organization and freedom and vitality of our economic life the domestic question which engage the attention of the last congress be more vital to the nation in this its time of test than at any other time we can not adequately make ready for any trial of our strength unless we wisely and promptly direct the force of our law into these all important field of domestic action a matter which it seem to i we should have very much at heart be the creation of the right instrumentality by which to mobilize our economic resource in any time of national necessity i take it for grant that i do not need your authority to call into systematic consultation with the direct officer of the army and navy man of recognize leadership and ability from among our citizen who be thoroughly familiar for example with the transportation facility of the country and therefore competent to advise how they may be coordinate when the need arise those who can suggest the good way in which to bring about prompt cooperation among the manufacturer of the country should it be necessary and those who could assist to bring the technical skill of the country to the aid of the government in the solution of particular problem of defense i only hope that if i should find it feasible to constitute such an advisory body the congress would be willing to vote the small sum of money that would be need to defray the expense that would probably be necessary to give it the clerical and administrative machinery with which to do serviceable work what be more important be that the industry and resource of the country should be available and ready for mobilization it be the more imperatively necessary therefore that we should promptly devise mean for do what we have not yet do that we should give intelligent federal aid and stimulation to industrial and vocational education as we have long do in the large field of our agricultural industry that at the same time that we safeguard and conserve the natural resource of the country we should put they at the disposal of those who will use they promptly and intelligently as be seek to be do in the admirable bill submit to the last congress from its committee on the public land bill which i earnestly recommend in principle to your consideration that we should put into early operation some provision for rural credit which will add to the extensive borrowing facility already afford the farmer by the reserve bank act adequate instrumentality by which long credit may be obtain on land mortgage and that we should study more carefully than they have hitherto be study the right adaptation of our economic arrangement to change condition many condition about which we have repeatedly legislate be be alter from decade to decade it be evident under our very eye and be likely to change even more rapidly and more radically in the day immediately ahead of we when peace have return to the world and the nation of europe once more take up their task of commerce and industry with the energy of those who must bestir themselves to build anew just what these change will be no one can certainly foresee or confidently predict there be no calculable because no stable element in the problem the most we can do be to make certain that we have the necessary instrumentality of information constantly at our service so that we may be sure that we know exactly what we be deal with when we come to act if it should be necessary to act at all we must first certainly know what it be that we be seek to adapt ourselves to i may ask the privilege of address you more at length on this important matter a little later in your session in the meantime may i make this suggestion the transportation problem be an exceedingly serious and press one in this country there have from time to time of late be reason to fear that our railroad would not much long be able to cope with it successfully as at present equip and coordinate i suggest that it would be wise to provide for a commission of inquiry to ascertain by a thorough canvass of the whole question whether our law as at present frame and administer be as serviceable as they might be in the solution of the problem it be obviously a problem that lie at the very foundation of our efficiency as a people such an inquiry ought to draw out every circumstance and opinion worth consider and we need to know all side of the matter if we mean to do anything in the field of federal legislation no one i be sure would wish to take any backward step the regulation of the railway of the country by federal commission have have admirable result and have fully justify the hope and expectation of those by whom the policy of regulation be originally propose the question be not what should we undo it be whether there be anything else we can do that would supply we with effective mean in the very process of regulation for better the condition under which the railroad be operate and for make they more useful servant of the country as a whole it seem to i that it might be the part of wisdom therefore before further legislation in this field be attempt to look at the whole problem of coordination and efficiency in the full light of a fresh assessment of circumstance and opinion as a guide to deal with the several part of it for what we be seek now what in my mind be the single thought of this message be national efficiency and security we serve a great nation we should serve it in the spirit of its peculiar genius it be the genius of common man for self government industry justice liberty and peace we should see to it that it lack no instrument no facility or vigor of law to make it sufficient to play its part with energy safety and assure success in this we be no partisan but herald and prophet of a new age
gentleman of the congress
 a situation have arise in the foreign relation of the country of which it be my plain duty to inform you very frankly
 it will be recall that in february 1915 the imperial german government announce its intention to treat the water surround great britain and ireland as embrace within the seat of war and to destroy all merchant ship own by its enemy that might be find within any part of that portion of the high sea and that it warn all vessel of neutral as well as of belligerent ownership to keep out of the water it have thus proscribe or else enter they at their peril the government of the united states earnestly protest it take the position that such a policy could not be pursue without the practical certainty of gross and palpable violation of the law of nation particularly if submarine craft be to be employ as its instrument inasmuch as the rule prescribe by that law rule found upon principle of humanity and establish for the protection of the life of non combatant at sea could not in the nature of the case be observe by such vessel it base its protest on the ground that person of neutral nationality and vessel of neutral ownership would be expose to extreme and intolerable risk and that no right to close any part of the high sea against their use or to expose they to such risk could lawfully be assert by any belligerent government the law of nation in these matter upon which the government of the united states base its protest be not of recent origin or found upon merely arbitrary principle set up by convention it be base on the contrary upon manifest and imperative principle of humanity and have long be establish with the approval and by the express assent of all civilized nation
 notwithstanding the earnest protest of our government the imperial german government at once proceed to carry out the policy it have announce it express the hope that the danger involve at any rate the danger to neutral vessel would be reduce to a minimum by the instruction which it have issue to its submarine commander and assure the government of the united states that it would take every possible precaution both to respect the right of neutral and to safeguard the life of non combatant
 what have actually happen in the year which have since elapse have show that those hope be not justify those assurance insusceptible of be fulfil in pursuance of the policy of submarine warfare against the commerce of its adversary thus announce and enter upon by the imperial german government in despite of the solemn protest of this government the commander of german undersea vessel have attack merchant ship with great and great activity not only upon the high sea surround great britain and ireland but wherever they could encounter they in a way that have grow more and more ruthless more and more indiscriminate as the month have go by less and less observant of restraint of any kind and have deliver their attack without compunction against vessel of every nationality and bind upon every sort of errand vessel of neutral ownership even vessel of neutral ownership bind from neutral port to neutral port have be destroy along with vessel of belligerent ownership in constantly increase number sometimes the merchantman attack have be warn and summon to surrender before be fire on or torpedo sometimes passenger or crew have be vouchsafe the poor security of be allow to take to the ship&#39;s boat before she be send to the bottom but again and again no warning have be give no escape even to the ship&#39; boat allow to those on board what this government foresaw must happen have happen tragedy have follow tragedy on the sea in such fashion with such attendant circumstance as to make it grossly evident that warfare of such a sort if warfare it be can not be carry on without the most palpable violation of the dictate alike of right and of humanity whatever the disposition and intention of the imperial german government it have manifestly prove impossible for it to keep such method of attack upon the commerce of its enemy within the bound set by either the reason or the heart of mankind
 in february of the present year the imperial german government inform this government and the other neutral government of the world that it have reason to believe that the government of great britain have arm all merchant vessel of british ownership and have give they secret order to attack any submarine of the enemy they might encounter upon the sea and that the imperial german government feel justify in the circumstance in treat all armed merchantman of belligerent ownership as auxiliary vessel of war which it would have the right to destroy without warn the law of nation have long recognize the right of merchantman to carry arm for protection and to use they to repel attack though to use they in such circumstance at their own risk but the imperial german government claim the right to set these understanding aside in circumstance which it deem extraordinary even the term in which it announce its purpose thus still far to relax the restraint it have previously profess its willingness and desire to put upon the operation of its submarine carry the plain implication that at least vessel which be not armed would still be exempt from destruction without warn and that personal safety would be accord their passenger and crew but even that limitation if it be ever practicable to observe it have in fact constitute no check at all upon the destruction of ship of every sort
 again and again the imperial german government have give this government its solemn assurance that at least passenger ship would not be thus deal with and yet it have again and again permit its undersea commander to disregard those assurance with entire impunity great liner like the lusitania and the arabic and mere ferryboat like the sussex have be attack without a moment&#39;s warning sometimes before they have even become aware that they be in the presence of an armed vessel of the enemy and the life of non combatant passenger and crew have be sacrifice wholesale in a manner which the government of the united states can not but regard as wanton and without the slight color of justification no limit of any kind have in fact be set to the indiscriminate pursuit and destruction of merchantman of all kind and nationality within the water constantly extend in area where these operation have be carry on and the roll of americans who have lose their life on ship thus attack and destroy have grow month by month until the ominous toll have mount into the hundred
 one of the late and most shocking instance of this method of warfare be that of the destruction of the french cross channel steam sussex it must stand forth as the sinking of the steamer lusitania do as so singularly tragical and unjustifiable as to constitute a truly terrible example of the inhumanity of submarine warfare as the commander of german vessel have for the past twelvemonth been conduct it if this instance stand alone some explanation some disavowal by the german government some evidence of criminal mistake or wilful disobedience on the part of the commander of the vessel that fire the torpedo might be seek or entertain but unhappily it do not stand alone recent event make the conclusion inevitable that it be only one instance even though it be one of the most extreme and distressing instance of the spirit and method of warfare which the imperial german government have mistakenly adopt and which from the first expose that government to the reproach of thrust all neutral right aside in pursuit of its immediate object
 the government of the united states have be very patient at every stage of this distressing experience of tragedy after tragedy in which its own citizen be involve it have seek to be restrain from any extreme course of action or of protest by a thoughtful consideration of the extraordinary circumstance of this unprecedented war and actuate in all that it say or do by the sentiment of genuine friendship which the people of the united states have always entertain and continue to entertain towards the german nation it have of course accept the successive explanation and assurance of the imperial german government as give in entire sincerity and good faith and have hope even against hope that it would prove to be possible for the german government so to order and control the act of its naval commander as to square its policy with the principle of humanity as embody in the law of nation it have be willing to wait until the significance of the fact become absolutely unmistakable and susceptible of but one interpretation
 that point have now unhappily be reach the fact be susceptible of but one interpretation the imperial german government have be unable to put any limit or restraint upon its warfare against either freight or passenger ship it have therefore become painfully evident that the position which this government take at the very outset be inevitable namely that the use of submarine for the destruction of an enemy&#39;s commerce be of necessity because of the very character of the vessel employ and the very method of attack which their employment of course involve incompatible with the principle of humanity the long established and incontrovertible right of neutral and the sacred immunity of non combatant
 i have deem it my duty therefore to say to the imperial german government that if it be still its purpose to prosecute relentless and indiscriminate warfare against vessel of commerce by the use of submarine notwithstanding the now demonstrate impossibility of conduct that warfare in accordance with what the government of the united states must consider the sacred and indisputable rule of international law and the universally recognize dictate of humanity the government of the united states be at last force to the conclusion that there be but one course it can pursue and that unless the imperial german government should now immediately declare and effect an abandonment of its present method of warfare against passenger and freight carry vessel this government can have no choice but to sever diplomatic relation with the government of the german empire altogether
 this decision i have arrive at with the keen regret the possibility of the action contemplate i be sure all thoughtful americans will look forward to with unaffected reluctance but we can not forget that we be in some sort and by the force of circumstance the responsible spokesman of the right of humanity and that we can not remain silent while those right seem in process of be sweep utterly away in the maelstrom of this terrible war we owe it to a due regard for our own right as a nation to our sense of duty as a representative of the right of neutral the world over and to a just conception of the right of mankind to take this stand now with the utmost solemnity and firmness
 i have take it and take it in the confidence that it will meet with your approval and support all sober minded man must unite in hope that the imperial german government which have in other circumstance stand as the champion of all that we be now contend for in the interest of humanity may recognize the justice of our demand and meet they in the spirit in which they be make

senator james gentlemen of the notification committee fellow citizens

 i can not accept the leadership and responsibility which the national democratic convention have again in such generous fashion ask i to accept without first express my profound gratitude to the party for the trust it repose in i after four year of fiery trial in the midst of affair of unprecedented difficulty and the keen sense of add responsibility with which this honor fill i have almost say burden i as i think of the great issue of national life and policy involve in the present and immediate future conduct of our government i shall seek as i have always seek to justify the extraordinary confidence thus repose in i by strive to purge my heart and purpose of every personal and of every misleading party motive and devote every energy i have to the service of the nation as a whole pray that i may continue to have the counsel and support of all forward look man at every turn of the difficult business

 for i do not doubt that the people of the united states will wish the democratic party to continue in control of the government they be not in the habit of reject those who have actually serve they for those who be make doubtful and conjectural promise of service least of all be they likely to substitute those who promise to render they particular service and prove false to that promise for those who have actually render those very service

 boasting be always an empty business which please nobody but the boaster and i have no disposition to boast of what the democratic party have accomplish it have merely do its duty it have merely fulfil its explicit promise but there can be no violation of good taste in call attention to the manner in which those promise have be carry out or in advert to the interesting fact that many of the thing accomplish be what the opposition party have again and again promise to do but have leave undo indeed that be manifestly part of the business of this year of reckoning and assessment there be no mean of judge the future except by assess the past constructive action must be weigh against destructive comment and reaction the democrats either have or have not understand the varied interest of the country the test be contain in the record

 what be that record what be the democrats call into power to do what thing have long wait to be do and how do the democrats do they it be a record of extraordinary length and variety rich in element of many kind but consistent in principle throughout and susceptible of brief recital

 the republican party be put out of power because of failure practical failure and moral failure because it have serve special interest and not the country at large because under the leadership of its preferred and establish guide of those who still make its choice it have lose touch with the thought and the need of the nation and be live in a past age and under a fix illusion the illusion of greatness it have frame tariff law base upon a fear of foreign trade a fundamental doubt as to american skill enterprise and capacity and a very tender regard for the profitable privilege of those who have gain control of domestic market and domestic credit and yet have enact anti trust law which hamper the very thing they mean to foster which be stiff and inelastic and in part unintelligible it have permit the country throughout the long period of its control to stagger from one financial crisis to another under the operation of a national banking law of its own framing which make stringency and panic certain and the control of the large business operation of the country by the banker of a few reserve center inevitable have make as if it mean to reform the law but have faint heartedly fail in the attempt because it could not bring itself to do the one thing necessary to make the reform genuine and effectual namely break up the control of small group of banker it have be oblivious or indifferent to the fact that the farmer upon whom the country depend for its food and in the last analysis for its prosperity be without stand in the matter of commercial credit without the protection of standard in their market transaction and without systematic knowledge of the market themselves that the laborer of the country the great army of man who man the industry it be profess to father and promote carry their labor as a mere commodity to market be subject to restraint by novel and drastic process in the court be without assurance of compensation for industrial accident without federal assistance in accommodate labor dispute and without national aid or advice in find the place and the industry in which their labor be most need the country have no national system of road construction and development little intelligent attention be pay to the army and not enough to the navy the other republic of america distrust we because they find that we think first of the profit of american investor and only as an afterthought of impartial justice and helpful friendship its policy be provincial in all thing its purpose be out of harmony with the temper and purpose of the people and the timely development of the nation&#39;s interest

 so thing stand when the democratic party come into power how do they stand now alike in the domestic field and in the wide field of the commerce of the world american business and life and industry have be set free to move as they never move before

 the tariff have be revise not on the principle of repel foreign trade but upon the principle of encourage it upon something like a footing of equality with our own in respect of the term of competition and a tariff board have be create whose function it will be to keep the relation of american with foreign business and industry under constant observation for the guidance alike of our business man and of our congress american energy be now direct towards the market of the world

 the law against trust have be clarify by definition with a view to make it plain that they be not direct against big business but only against unfair business and the pretense of competition where there be none and a trade commission have be create with power of guidance and accommodation which have relieve business man of unfounded fear and set they upon the road of hopeful and confident enterprise

 by the federal reserve act the supply of currency at the disposal of active business have be render elastic take its volume not from a fix body of investment security but from the liquid asset of daily trade and these asset be assess and accept not by distant group of banker in control of unavailable reserve but by banker at the many center of local exchange who be in touch with local condition everywhere

 effective measure have be take for the re creation of an american merchant marine and the revival of the american carry trade indispensable to our emancipation from the control which foreigner have so long exercise over the opportunity the route and the method of our commerce with other country

 the interstate commerce commission be about to be reorganize to enable it to perform its great and important function more promptly and more efficiently we have create extend and improve the service of the parcel post

 so much we have do for business what other party have understand the task so well or execute it so intelligently and energetically what other party have attempt it at all the republican leader apparently know of no mean of assist business but protection how to stimulate it and put it upon a new footing of energy and enterprise they have not suggest

 for the farmer of the country we have virtually create commercial credit by mean of the federal reserve act and the rural credits act they now have the standing of other business man in the money market we have successfully regulate speculation in future and establish standard in the marketing of grain by an intelligent warehouse act we have assist to make the standard crop available as never before both for systematic marketing and as a security for loan from the bank we have greatly add to the work of neighborhood demonstration on the farm itself of improved method of cultivation and through the intelligent extension of the function of the department of agriculture have make it possible for the farmer to learn systematically where his good market be and how to get at they

 the workingman of america have be give a veritable emancipation by the legal recognition of a man&#39;s labor as part of his life and not a mere marketable commodity by exempt labor organization from process of the court which treat their member like fractional part of mob and not like accessible and responsible individual by release our seaman from involuntary servitude by make adequate provision for compensation for industrial accident by provide suitable machinery for mediation and conciliation in industrial dispute and by put the federal department of labor at the disposal of the workingman when in search of work

 we have effect the emancipation of the child of the country by release they from hurtful labor we have institute a system of national aid in the building of highroad such as the country have be feel after for a century we have seek to equalize taxation by mean of an equitable income tax we have take the step that ought to have be take at the outset to open up the resource of alaska we have provide for national defense upon a scale never before seriously propose upon the responsibility of an entire political party we have drive the tariff lobby from cover and oblige it to substitute solid argument for private influence

 this extraordinary recital must sound like a platform a list of sanguine promise but it be not it be a record of promise make four year ago and now actually redeem in constructive legislation

 these thing must profoundly disturb the thought and confound the plan of those who have make themselves believe that the democratic party neither understand nor be ready to assist the business of the country in the great enterprise which it be its evident and inevitable destiny to undertake and carry through the breaking up of the lobby must especially disconcert they for it be through the lobby that they seek and be sure they have find the heart of thing the game of privilege can be play successfully by no other mean

 this record must equally astonish those who fear that the democratic party have not open its heart to comprehend the demand of social justice we have in four year come very near to carry out the platform of the progressive party as well as our own for we also be progressive

 there be one circumstance connect with this program which ought to be very plainly state it be resist at every step by the interest which the republican party have cater to and foster at the expense of the country and these same interest be now earnestly pray for a reaction which will save their privileges,?for the restoration of their swear friend to power before it be too late to recover what they have lose they fight with particular desperation and infinite resourcefulness the reform of the banking and currency system know that to be the citadel of their control and most anxiously be they hope and plan for the amendment of the federal reserve act by the concentration of control in a single bank which the old familiar group of banker can keep under their eye and direction but while the big man who use to write the tariff and command the assistance of the treasury have be hostile,?all but a few with vision,?the average business man know that he have be deliver and that the fear that be once every day in his heart that the man who control credit and direct enterprise from the committee room of congress would crush he be there no more and will not return,?unless the party that consult only the big man should return to power,?the party of masterly inactivity and cunning resourcefulness in stand pat to resist change

 the republican party be just the party that can not meet the new condition of a new age it do not know the way and it do not wish new condition it try to break away from the old leader and could not they still select its candidate and dictate its policy still resist change still hanker after the old condition still know no method of encourage business but the old method when it change its leader and its purpose and bring its idea up to date it will have the right to ask the american people to give it power again but not until then a new age an age of revolutionary change need new purpose and new idea

 in foreign affair we have be guide by principle clearly conceive and consistently live up to perhaps they have not be fully comprehend because they have hitherto govern international affair only in theory not in practice they be simple obvious easily state and fundamental to american ideal

 we have be neutral not only because it be the fixed and traditional policy of the united states to stand aloof from the politic of europe and because we have have no part either of action or of policy in the influence which bring on the present war but also because it be manifestly our duty to prevent if it be possible the indefinite extension of the fire of hate and desolation kindle by that terrible conflict and seek to serve mankind by reserve cur strength and our resource for the anxious and difficult day of restoration and healing which must follow when peace will have to build its house anew

 the right of our own citizen of course become involve that be inevitable where they do this be our guide principle that property right can be vindicate by claim for damage and no modern nation can decline to arbitrate such claim but the fundamental right of humanity can not be the loss of life be irreparable neither can direct violation of a nation&#39;s sovereignty await vindication in suit for damage the nation that violate these essential right must expect to be check and call to account by direct challenge and resistance it at once make the quarrel in part our own these be plain principle and we have never lose sight of they or depart from they whatever the stress or the perplexity of circumstance or the provocation to hasty resentment the record be clear and consistent throughout and stand distinct and definite for anyone to judge who wish to know the truth about it

 the sea be not broad enough to keep the infection of the conflict out of our own politic the passion and intrigue of certain active group and combination of man amongst we who be bear under foreign flag inject the poison of disloyalty into our own most critical affair lay violent hand upon many of our industry and subject we to the shame of division of sentiment and purpose in which america be contemn and forget it be part of the business of this year of reckoning and settlement to speak plainly and act with unmistakable purpose in rebuke of these thing in order that they may be forever hereafter impossible i be the candidate of a party but i be above all thing else an american citizen i neither seek the favor nor fear the displeasure of that small alien element amongst we which put loyalty to any foreign power before loyalty to the united states

 while europe be at war our own continent one of our own neighbor be shake by revolution in that matter too principle be plain and it be imperative that we should live up to it if we be to deserve the trust of any real partisan of the right as free man see it we have profess to believe and we do believe that the people of small and weak state have the right to expect to be deal with exactly as the people of big and powerful state would be we have act upon that principle in deal with the people of mexico

 our recent pursuit of bandit into mexican territory be no violation of that principle we venture to enter mexican territory only because there be no military force in mexico that could protect our border from hostile attack and our own people from violence and we have commit there no single act of hostility or interference even with the sovereign authority of the republic of mexico herself it be a plain case of the violation of our own sovereignty which could not wait to be vindicate by damage and for which there be no other remedy the authority of mexico be powerless to prevent it

 many serious wrong against the property many irreparable wrong against the person of americans have be commit within the territory of mexico herself during this confused revolution wrong which could not be effectually check so long as there be no constituted power in mexico which be in a position to check they we could not act directly in that matter ourselves without deny mexicans the right to any revolution at all which disturb we and make the emancipation of her own people await our own interest and convenience

 for it be their emancipation that they be seeking,?blindly it may be and as yet ineffectually but with profound and passionate purpose and within their unquestionable right apply what true american principle you will,?any principle that an american would publicly avow the people of mexico have not be suffer to own their own country or direct their own institution outsider man out of other nation and with interest too often alien to their own have dictate what their privilege and opportunity should be and who should control their land their life and their resources,?some of they americans press for thing they could never have get in their own country the mexican people be entitle to attempt their liberty from such influence and so long as i have anything to do with the action of our great government i shall do everything in my power to prevent anyone stand in their way i know that this be hard for some person to understand but it be not hard for the plain people of the united states to understand it be hard doctrine only for those who wish to get something for themselves out of mexico there be man and noble woman too not a few of our own people thank god whose fortune be invest in great property in mexico who yet see the case with true vision and assess its issue with true american feeling the rest can be leave for the present out of the reckoning until this enslave people have have its day of struggle towards the light i have hear no one who be free from such influence propose interference by the united states with the internal affair of mexico certainly no friend of the mexican people have propose it

 the people of the united states be capable of great sympathy and a noble pity in deal with problem of this kind as their spokesman and representative i have try to act in the spirit they would wish i show the people of mexico be strive for the right that be fundamental to life and happiness,?15,000,000 oppress man overburden woman and pitiful child in virtual bondage in their own home of fertile land and inexhaustible treasure some of the leader of the revolution may often have be mistaken and violent and selfish but the revolution itself be inevitable and be right the unspeakable huerta betray the very comrade he serve traitorously overthrow the government of which he be a trusted part impudently speak for the very force that have drive his people to the rebellion with which he have pretend to sympathize the man who overcome he and drive he out represent at least the fierce passion of reconstruction which lie at the very heart of liberty and so long as they represent however imperfectly such a struggle for deliverance i be ready to serve their end when i can so long as the power of recognition rest with i the government of the united states will refuse to extend the hand of welcome to any one who obtain power in a sister republic by treachery and violence no permanency can be give the affair of any republic by a title base upon intrigue and assassination i declare that to be the policy of this administration within three week after i assume the presidency i here again vow it i be more interested in the fortune of oppressed man and pitiful woman and child than in any property right whatever mistake i have no doubt make in this perplexing business but not in purpose or object

 more be involve than the immediate destiny of mexico and the relation of the united states with a distressed and distracted people all america look on test be now be make of we whether we be sincere lover of popular liberty or not and be indeed to be trust to respect national sovereignty among our weak neighbor we have undertake these many year to play big brother to the republic of this hemisphere this be the day of our test whether we mean or have ever mean to play that part for our own benefit wholly or also for theirs upon the outcome of that test its outcome in their mind not in ours depend every relationship of the united states with latin america whether in politic or in commerce and enterprise these be great issue and lie at the heart of the grave task of the future task both economic and political and very intimately inwrought with many of the most vital of the new issue of the politic of the world the republic of america have in the last three year be draw together in a new spirit of accommodation mutual understanding and cordial cooperation much of the politic of the world in the year to come will depend upon their relationship with one another it be a barren and provincial statesmanship that lose sight of such thing

 the future the immediate future will bring we squarely face to face with many great and exact problem which will search we through and through whether we be able and ready to play the part in the world that we mean to play it will not bring we into their presence slowly gently with ceremonious introduction but suddenly and at once the moment the war in europe be over they will be new problem most of they many will be old problem in a new setting and with new element which we have never deal with or reckon the force and meaning of before they will require for their solution new thinking fresh courage and resourcefulness and in some matter radical reconsideration of policy we must be ready to mobilize our resource alike of brain and of material

 it be not a future to be afraid of it be rather a future to stimulate and excite we to the display of the good power that be in we we may enter it with confidence when we be sure that we understand it,?and we have provide ourselves already with the mean of understand it

 look first at what it will be necessary that the nation of the world should do to make the day to come tolerable and fit to live and work in and then look at our part in what be to follow and our own duty of preparation for we must be prepare both in resource and in policy

 there must be a just and settle peace and we here in america must contribute the full force of our enthusiasm and of our authority as a nation to the organization of that peace upon world wide foundation that can not easily be shake no nation should be force to take side in any quarrel in which its own honor and integrity and the fortune of its own people be not involve but no nation can any long remain neutral as against any wilful disturbance of the peace of the world the effect of war can no long be confine to the area of battle no nation stand wholly apart in interest when the life and interest of all nation be throw into confusion and peril if hopeful and generous enterprise be to be renew if the healing and helpful art of life be indeed to be revive when peace come again a new atmosphere of justice and friendship must be generate by mean the world have never try before the nation of the world must unite in joint guarantee that whatever be do to disturb the whole world&#39;s life must first be test in the court of the whole world&#39;s opinion before it be attempt

 these be the new foundation the world must build for itself and we must play our part in the reconstruction generously and without too much thought of our separate interest we must make ourselves ready to play it intelligently vigorously and well

 one of the contribution we must make to the world&#39;s peace be this we must see to it that the people in our insular possession be treat in their own land as we would treat they here and make the rule of the united states mean the same thing everywhere,?the same justice the same consideration for the essential right of man

 besides contribute our ungrudge moral and practical support to the establishment of peace throughout the world we must actively and intelligently prepare ourselves to do our full service in the trade and industry which be to sustain and develop the life of the nation in the day to come

 we have already be provident in this great matter and supply ourselves with the instrumentality of prompt adjustment we have create in the federal trade commission a means of inquiry and of accommodation in the field of commerce which ought both to coordinate the enterprise of our trader and manufacturer and to remove the barrier of misunderstanding and of a too technical interpretation of the law in the new tariff commission we have add another instrumentality of observation and adjustment which promise to be immediately serviceable the trade commission substitute counsel and accommodation for the harsh process of legal restraint and the tariff commission ought to substitute fact for prejudice and theory our exporter have for some time have the advantage of work in the new light throw upon foreign market and opportunity of trade by the intelligent inquiry and activity of the bureau of foreign and domestic commerce which the democratic congress so wisely create in 1912 the tariff commission complete the machinery by which we shall be enable to open up our legislative policy to the fact as they develop

 we can no long indulge our traditional provincialism we be to play a lead part in the world drama whether we wish it or not we shall lend not borrow act for ourselves not imitate or follow organize and initiate not peep about merely to see where we may get in

 we have already formulate and agree upon a policy of law which will explicitly remove the ban now suppose to rest upon cooperation amongst our exporter in seek and secure their proper place in the market of the world the field will be free the instrumentality at hand it will only remain for the master of enterprise amongst we to act in energetic concert and for the government of the united states to insist upon the maintenance throughout the world of those condition of fairness and of even hand justice in the commercial dealing of the nation with one another upon which after all in the last analysis the peace and order life of the world must ultimately depend

 at home also we must see to it that the man who plan and develop and direct our business enterprise shall enjoy definite and settle condition of law a policy accommodate to the free progress we have set the just and necessary limit we have put all kind of unfair competition under the ban and penalty of the law we have bar monopoly these fatal and ugly thing be exclude we must now quicken action and facilitate enterprise by every just mean within our choice there will be peace in the business world and with peace revive confidence and life

 we ought both to husband and to develop our natural resource our mine our forest our water power i wish we could have make more progress than we have make in this vital matter and i call once more with the deep earnestness and solicitude upon the advocate of a careful and provident conservation on the one hand and the advocate of a free and invite field for private capital on the other to get together in a spirit of genuine accommodation and agreement and set this great policy forward at once

 we must hearten and quicken the spirit and efficiency of labor throughout our whole industrial system by everywhere and in all occupation do justice to the laborer not only by pay a living wage but also by make all the condition that surround labor what they ought to be and we must do more than justice we must safeguard life and promote health and safety in every occupation in which they be threaten or imperille that be more than justice and well because it be humanity and economy

 we must coordinate the railway system of the country for national use and must facilitate and promote their development with a view to that coordination and to their well adaptation as a whole to the life and trade and defense of the nation the life and industry of the country can be free and unhampere only if these artery be open efficient and complete

 thus shall we stand ready to meet the future as circumstance and international policy effect their unfolding whether the change come slowly or come fast and without preface

 i have not speak explicitly gentlemen of the platform adopt at st. louis but it have be implicit in all that i have say i have seek to interpret its spirit and meaning the people of the united states do not need to be assure now that that platform be a definite pledge a practical program we have prove to they that our promise be make to be keep

 we hold very definite ideal we believe that the energy and initiative of our people have be too narrowly coach and superintend that they should be set free as we have set they free to disperse themselves throughout the nation that they should not be concentrate in the hand of a few powerful guide and guardian as our opponent have again and again in effect if not in purpose seek to concentrate they we believe moreover,?who that look about he now with comprehending eye can fail to believe??that the day of little americanism with its narrow horizon when method of protection and industrial nursing be the chief study of our provincial statesman be past and go and that a day of enterprise have at last dawn for the united states whose field be the wide world

 we hope to see the stimulus of that new day draw all america the republic of both continent on to a new life and energy and initiative in the great affair of peace we be americans for big america and rejoice to look forward to the day in which america shall strive to stir the world without irritate it or draw it on to new antagonism when the nation with which we deal shall at last come to see upon what deep foundation of humanity and justice our passion for peace rest and when all mankind shall look upon our great people with a new sentiment of admiration friendly rivalry and real affection as upon a people who though keen to succeed seek always to be at once generous and just and to whom humanity be dear than profit or selfish power

 upon this record and in the faith of this purpose we go to the country
senator james gentlemen of the notification committee fellow citizens
 i can not accept the leadership and responsibility which the national democratic convention have again in such generous fashion ask i to accept without first express my profound gratitude to the party for the trust it repose in i after four year of fiery trial in the midst of affair of unprecedented difficulty and the keen sense of add responsibility with which this honor fill i have almost say burden i as i think of the great issue of national life and policy involve in the present and immediate future conduct of our government i shall seek as i have always seek to justify the extraordinary confidence thus repose in i by strive to purge my heart and purpose of every personal and of every misleading party motive and devote every energy i have to the service of the nation as a whole pray that i may continue to have the counsel and support of all forward look man at every turn of the difficult business
 for i do not doubt that the people of the united states will wish the democratic party to continue in control of the government they be not in the habit of reject those who have actually serve they for those who be make doubtful and conjectural promise of service least of all be they likely to substitute those who promise to render they particular service and prove false to that promise for those who have actually render those very service
 boasting be always an empty business which please nobody but the boaster and i have no disposition to boast of what the democratic party have accomplish it have merely do its duty it have merely fulfil its explicit promise but there can be no violation of good taste in call attention to the manner in which those promise have be carry out or in advert to the interesting fact that many of the thing accomplish be what the opposition party have again and again promise to do but have leave undo indeed that be manifestly part of the business of this year of reckoning and assessment there be no mean of judge the future except by assess the past constructive action must be weigh against destructive comment and reaction the democrats either have or have not understand the varied interest of the country the test be contain in the record
 what be that record what be the democrats call into power to do what thing have long wait to be do and how do the democrats do they it be a record of extraordinary length and variety rich in element of many kind but consistent in principle throughout and susceptible of brief recital
 the republican party be put out of power because of failure practical failure and moral failure because it have serve special interest and not the country at large because under the leadership of its preferred and establish guide of those who still make its choice it have lose touch with the thought and the need of the nation and be live in a past age and under a fix illusion the illusion of greatness it have frame tariff law base upon a fear of foreign trade a fundamental doubt as to american skill enterprise and capacity and a very tender regard for the profitable privilege of those who have gain control of domestic market and domestic credit and yet have enact anti trust law which hamper the very thing they mean to foster which be stiff and inelastic and in part unintelligible it have permit the country throughout the long period of its control to stagger from one financial crisis to another under the operation of a national banking law of its own framing which make stringency and panic certain and the control of the large business operation of the country by the banker of a few reserve center inevitable have make as if it mean to reform the law but have faint heartedly fail in the attempt because it could not bring itself to do the one thing necessary to make the reform genuine and effectual namely break up the control of small group of banker it have be oblivious or indifferent to the fact that the farmer upon whom the country depend for its food and in the last analysis for its prosperity be without stand in the matter of commercial credit without the protection of standard in their market transaction and without systematic knowledge of the market themselves that the laborer of the country the great army of man who man the industry it be profess to father and promote carry their labor as a mere commodity to market be subject to restraint by novel and drastic process in the court be without assurance of compensation for industrial accident without federal assistance in accommodate labor dispute and without national aid or advice in find the place and the industry in which their labor be most need the country have no national system of road construction and development little intelligent attention be pay to the army and not enough to the navy the other republic of america distrust we because they find that we think first of the profit of american investor and only as an afterthought of impartial justice and helpful friendship its policy be provincial in all thing its purpose be out of harmony with the temper and purpose of the people and the timely development of the nation&#39;s interest
 so thing stand when the democratic party come into power how do they stand now alike in the domestic field and in the wide field of the commerce of the world american business and life and industry have be set free to move as they never move before
 the tariff have be revise not on the principle of repel foreign trade but upon the principle of encourage it upon something like a footing of equality with our own in respect of the term of competition and a tariff board have be create whose function it will be to keep the relation of american with foreign business and industry under constant observation for the guidance alike of our business man and of our congress american energy be now direct towards the market of the world
 the law against trust have be clarify by definition with a view to make it plain that they be not direct against big business but only against unfair business and the pretense of competition where there be none and a trade commission have be create with power of guidance and accommodation which have relieve business man of unfounded fear and set they upon the road of hopeful and confident enterprise
 by the federal reserve act the supply of currency at the disposal of active business have be render elastic take its volume not from a fix body of investment security but from the liquid asset of daily trade and these asset be assess and accept not by distant group of banker in control of unavailable reserve but by banker at the many center of local exchange who be in touch with local condition everywhere
 effective measure have be take for the re creation of an american merchant marine and the revival of the american carry trade indispensable to our emancipation from the control which foreigner have so long exercise over the opportunity the route and the method of our commerce with other country
 the interstate commerce commission be about to be reorganize to enable it to perform its great and important function more promptly and more efficiently we have create extend and improve the service of the parcel post
 so much we have do for business what other party have understand the task so well or execute it so intelligently and energetically what other party have attempt it at all the republican leader apparently know of no mean of assist business but protection how to stimulate it and put it upon a new footing of energy and enterprise they have not suggest
 for the farmer of the country we have virtually create commercial credit by mean of the federal reserve act and the rural credits act they now have the standing of other business man in the money market we have successfully regulate speculation in future and establish standard in the marketing of grain by an intelligent warehouse act we have assist to make the standard crop available as never before both for systematic marketing and as a security for loan from the bank we have greatly add to the work of neighborhood demonstration on the farm itself of improved method of cultivation and through the intelligent extension of the function of the department of agriculture have make it possible for the farmer to learn systematically where his good market be and how to get at they
 the workingman of america have be give a veritable emancipation by the legal recognition of a man&#39;s labor as part of his life and not a mere marketable commodity by exempt labor organization from process of the court which treat their member like fractional part of mob and not like accessible and responsible individual by release our seaman from involuntary servitude by make adequate provision for compensation for industrial accident by provide suitable machinery for mediation and conciliation in industrial dispute and by put the federal department of labor at the disposal of the workingman when in search of work
 we have effect the emancipation of the child of the country by release they from hurtful labor we have institute a system of national aid in the building of highroad such as the country have be feel after for a century we have seek to equalize taxation by mean of an equitable income tax we have take the step that ought to have be take at the outset to open up the resource of alaska we have provide for national defense upon a scale never before seriously propose upon the responsibility of an entire political party we have drive the tariff lobby from cover and oblige it to substitute solid argument for private influence
 this extraordinary recital must sound like a platform a list of sanguine promise but it be not it be a record of promise make four year ago and now actually redeem in constructive legislation
 these thing must profoundly disturb the thought and confound the plan of those who have make themselves believe that the democratic party neither understand nor be ready to assist the business of the country in the great enterprise which it be its evident and inevitable destiny to undertake and carry through the breaking up of the lobby must especially disconcert they for it be through the lobby that they seek and be sure they have find the heart of thing the game of privilege can be play successfully by no other mean
 this record must equally astonish those who fear that the democratic party have not open its heart to comprehend the demand of social justice we have in four year come very near to carry out the platform of the progressive party as well as our own for we also be progressive
 there be one circumstance connect with this program which ought to be very plainly state it be resist at every step by the interest which the republican party have cater to and foster at the expense of the country and these same interest be now earnestly pray for a reaction which will save their privilege for the restoration of their swear friend to power before it be too late to recover what they have lose they fight with particular desperation and infinite resourcefulness the reform of the banking and currency system know that to be the citadel of their control and most anxiously be they hope and plan for the amendment of the federal reserve act by the concentration of control in a single bank which the old familiar group of banker can keep under their eye and direction but while the big man who use to write the tariff and command the assistance of the treasury have be hostile all but a few with vision the average business man know that he have be deliver and that the fear that be once every day in his heart that the man who control credit and direct enterprise from the committee room of congress would crush he be there no more and will not return unless the party that consult only the big man should return to power the party of masterly inactivity and cunning resourcefulness in stand pat to resist change
 the republican party be just the party that can not meet the new condition of a new age it do not know the way and it do not wish new condition it try to break away from the old leader and could not they still select its candidate and dictate its policy still resist change still hanker after the old condition still know no method of encourage business but the old method when it change its leader and its purpose and bring its idea up to date it will have the right to ask the american people to give it power again but not until then a new age an age of revolutionary change need new purpose and new idea
 in foreign affair we have be guide by principle clearly conceive and consistently live up to perhaps they have not be fully comprehend because they have hitherto govern international affair only in theory not in practice they be simple obvious easily state and fundamental to american ideal
 we have be neutral not only because it be the fixed and traditional policy of the united states to stand aloof from the politic of europe and because we have have no part either of action or of policy in the influence which bring on the present war but also because it be manifestly our duty to prevent if it be possible the indefinite extension of the fire of hate and desolation kindle by that terrible conflict and seek to serve mankind by reserve cur strength and our resource for the anxious and difficult day of restoration and healing which must follow when peace will have to build its house anew
 the right of our own citizen of course become involve that be inevitable where they do this be our guide principle that property right can be vindicate by claim for damage and no modern nation can decline to arbitrate such claim but the fundamental right of humanity can not be the loss of life be irreparable neither can direct violation of a nation&#39;s sovereignty await vindication in suit for damage the nation that violate these essential right must expect to be check and call to account by direct challenge and resistance it at once make the quarrel in part our own these be plain principle and we have never lose sight of they or depart from they whatever the stress or the perplexity of circumstance or the provocation to hasty resentment the record be clear and consistent throughout and stand distinct and definite for anyone to judge who wish to know the truth about it
 the sea be not broad enough to keep the infection of the conflict out of our own politic the passion and intrigue of certain active group and combination of man amongst we who be bear under foreign flag inject the poison of disloyalty into our own most critical affair lay violent hand upon many of our industry and subject we to the shame of division of sentiment and purpose in which america be contemn and forget it be part of the business of this year of reckoning and settlement to speak plainly and act with unmistakable purpose in rebuke of these thing in order that they may be forever hereafter impossible i be the candidate of a party but i be above all thing else an american citizen i neither seek the favor nor fear the displeasure of that small alien element amongst we which put loyalty to any foreign power before loyalty to the united states
 while europe be at war our own continent one of our own neighbor be shake by revolution in that matter too principle be plain and it be imperative that we should live up to it if we be to deserve the trust of any real partisan of the right as free man see it we have profess to believe and we do believe that the people of small and weak state have the right to expect to be deal with exactly as the people of big and powerful state would be we have act upon that principle in deal with the people of mexico
 our recent pursuit of bandit into mexican territory be no violation of that principle we venture to enter mexican territory only because there be no military force in mexico that could protect our border from hostile attack and our own people from violence and we have commit there no single act of hostility or interference even with the sovereign authority of the republic of mexico herself it be a plain case of the violation of our own sovereignty which could not wait to be vindicate by damage and for which there be no other remedy the authority of mexico be powerless to prevent it
 many serious wrong against the property many irreparable wrong against the person of americans have be commit within the territory of mexico herself during this confused revolution wrong which could not be effectually check so long as there be no constituted power in mexico which be in a position to check they we could not act directly in that matter ourselves without deny mexicans the right to any revolution at all which disturb we and make the emancipation of her own people await our own interest and convenience
 for it be their emancipation that they be seek blindly it may be and as yet ineffectually but with profound and passionate purpose and within their unquestionable right apply what true american principle you will any principle that an american would publicly avow the people of mexico have not be suffer to own their own country or direct their own institution outsider man out of other nation and with interest too often alien to their own have dictate what their privilege and opportunity should be and who should control their land their life and their resource some of they americans press for thing they could never have get in their own country the mexican people be entitle to attempt their liberty from such influence and so long as i have anything to do with the action of our great government i shall do everything in my power to prevent anyone stand in their way i know that this be hard for some person to understand but it be not hard for the plain people of the united states to understand it be hard doctrine only for those who wish to get something for themselves out of mexico there be man and noble woman too not a few of our own people thank god whose fortune be invest in great property in mexico who yet see the case with true vision and assess its issue with true american feeling the rest can be leave for the present out of the reckoning until this enslave people have have its day of struggle towards the light i have hear no one who be free from such influence propose interference by the united states with the internal affair of mexico certainly no friend of the mexican people have propose it
 the people of the united states be capable of great sympathy and a noble pity in deal with problem of this kind as their spokesman and representative i have try to act in the spirit they would wish i show the people of mexico be strive for the right that be fundamental to life and happiness 15,000,000 oppress man overburden woman and pitiful child in virtual bondage in their own home of fertile land and inexhaustible treasure some of the leader of the revolution may often have be mistaken and violent and selfish but the revolution itself be inevitable and be right the unspeakable huerta betray the very comrade he serve traitorously overthrow the government of which he be a trusted part impudently speak for the very force that have drive his people to the rebellion with which he have pretend to sympathize the man who overcome he and drive he out represent at least the fierce passion of reconstruction which lie at the very heart of liberty and so long as they represent however imperfectly such a struggle for deliverance i be ready to serve their end when i can so long as the power of recognition rest with i the government of the united states will refuse to extend the hand of welcome to any one who obtain power in a sister republic by treachery and violence no permanency can be give the affair of any republic by a title base upon intrigue and assassination i declare that to be the policy of this administration within three week after i assume the presidency i here again vow it i be more interested in the fortune of oppressed man and pitiful woman and child than in any property right whatever mistake i have no doubt make in this perplexing business but not in purpose or object
 more be involve than the immediate destiny of mexico and the relation of the united states with a distressed and distracted people all america look on test be now be make of we whether we be sincere lover of popular liberty or not and be indeed to be trust to respect national sovereignty among our weak neighbor we have undertake these many year to play big brother to the republic of this hemisphere this be the day of our test whether we mean or have ever mean to play that part for our own benefit wholly or also for theirs upon the outcome of that test its outcome in their mind not in ours depend every relationship of the united states with latin america whether in politic or in commerce and enterprise these be great issue and lie at the heart of the grave task of the future task both economic and political and very intimately inwrought with many of the most vital of the new issue of the politic of the world the republic of america have in the last three year be draw together in a new spirit of accommodation mutual understanding and cordial cooperation much of the politic of the world in the year to come will depend upon their relationship with one another it be a barren and provincial statesmanship that lose sight of such thing
 the future the immediate future will bring we squarely face to face with many great and exact problem which will search we through and through whether we be able and ready to play the part in the world that we mean to play it will not bring we into their presence slowly gently with ceremonious introduction but suddenly and at once the moment the war in europe be over they will be new problem most of they many will be old problem in a new setting and with new element which we have never deal with or reckon the force and meaning of before they will require for their solution new thinking fresh courage and resourcefulness and in some matter radical reconsideration of policy we must be ready to mobilize our resource alike of brain and of material

 thus shall we stand ready to meet the future as circumstance and international policy effect their unfolding whether the change come slowly or come fast and without preface
 i have not speak explicitly gentlemen of the platform adopt at st. louis but it have be implicit in all that i have say i have seek to interpret its spirit and meaning the people of the united states do not need to be assure now that that platform be a definite pledge a practical program we have prove to they that our promise be make to be keep
 we hold very definite ideal we believe that the energy and initiative of our people have be too narrowly coach and superintend that they should be set free as we have set they free to disperse themselves throughout the nation that they should not be concentrate in the hand of a few powerful guide and guardian as our opponent have again and again in effect if not in purpose seek to concentrate they we believe moreover who that look about he now with comprehending eye can fail to believe that the day of little americanism with its narrow horizon when method of protection and industrial nursing be the chief study of our provincial statesman be past and go and that a day of enterprise have at last dawn for the united states whose field be the wide world
 we hope to see the stimulus of that new day draw all america the republic of both continent on to a new life and energy and initiative in the great affair of peace we be americans for big america and rejoice to look forward to the day in which america shall strive to stir the world without irritate it or draw it on to new antagonism when the nation with which we deal shall at last come to see upon what deep foundation of humanity and justice our passion for peace rest and when all mankind shall look upon our great people with a new sentiment of admiration friendly rivalry and real affection as upon a people who though keen to succeed seek always to be at once generous and just and to whom humanity be dear than profit or selfish power
 upon this record and in the faith of this purpose we go to the country

madam president ladies of the association
 i have find it a real privilege to be here to night and to listen to the address which you have hear though you may not all of you believe it i would a great deal rather hear somebody else speak than speak myself but i should feel that i be omit a duty if i do not address you to night and say some of the thing that have be in my thought as i realize the approach of this evening and the duty that would fall upon i
 the astonishing thing about the movement which you represent be not that it have grow so slowly but that it have grow so rapidly no doubt for those who have be a long time in the struggle like your honored president it seem a long and arduous path that have be tread but when you think of the cumulate force of this movement in recent decade you must agree with i that it be one of the most astonishing tide in modern history two generation ago no doubt madam president will agree with i in say it be a handful of woman who be fight this cause now it be a great multitude of woman who be fight it
 and there be some interesting historical connection which i would like to attempt to point out to you one of the most striking fact about the history of the united states be that at the outset it be a lawyers&#39 history almost all of the question to which america address itself say a hundred year ago be legal question be question of method not question of what you be go to do with your government but question of how you be go to constitute your government,&mdash;how you be go to balance the power of the states and the federal government how you be go to balance the claim of property against the process of liberty how you be go to make your government up so as to balance the part against each other so that the legislature would check the executive and the executive the legislature and the court both of they put together the whole conception of government when the united states become a nation be a mechanical conception of government and the mechanical conception of government which underlay it be the newtonian theory of the universe if you pick up the federalist some part of it read like a treatise on astronomy instead of a treatise on government they speak of the centrifugal and the centripetal force and locate the president somewhere in a rotate system the whole thing be a calculation of power and an adjustment of part there be a time when nobody but a lawyer could know enough to run the government of the united states and a distinguished english publicist once remark speak of the complexity of the american government that it be no proof of the excellence of the american constitution that it have be successfully operate because the americans could run any constitution but there have be a great many technical difficulty in run it
 and then something happen a great question arise in this country which though complicated with legal element be at bottom a human question and nothing but a question of humanity that be the slavery question and be it not significant that it be then and then for the first time that woman become prominent in politic in america not many woman those prominent in that day be so few that you can name they over in a brief catalogue but nevertheless they then begin to play a part in writing not only but in public speech which be a very novel part for woman to play in america after the civil war have settle some of what seem to be the most difficult legal question of our system the life of the nation begin not only to unfold but to accumulate life in the united states be a comparatively simple matter at the time of the civil war there be none of that underground struggle which be now so manifest to those who look only a little way beneath the surface story such as dr. davis have tell to night be uncommon in those simple day the pressure of low wage the agony of obscure and unremunerated toil do not exist in america in anything like the same proportion that they exist now and as our life have unfold and accumulate as the contact of it have become hot as the population have assemble in the city and the cool space of the country have be supplant by the feverish urban area the whole nature of our political question have be alter they have cease to be legal question they have more and more become social question question with regard to the relation of human being to one another,&mdash;not merely their legal relation but their moral and spiritual relation to one another this have be most characteristic of american life in the last few decade and as these question have assume great and great prominence the movement which this association represent have gather cumulative force so that if anybody ask himself what do this gathering force mean if he know anything about the history of the country he know that it mean something that have not only come to stay but have come with conquering power
 i get a little impatient sometimes about the discussion of the channel and method by which it be to prevail it be go to prevail and that be a very superficial and ignorant view of it which attribute it to mere social unrest it be not merely because the woman be discontent it be because the woman have see vision of duty and that be something which we not only can not resist but if we be true americans we do not wish to resist america take its origin in vision of the human spirit in aspiration for the deep sort of liberty of the mind and of the heart and as vision of that sort come up to the sight of those who be spiritually minded in america america come more and more into her birthright and into the perfection of her development
 so that what we have to realize in deal with force of this sort be that we be deal with the substance of life itself i have feel as i sit here to night the wholesome contagion of the occasion almost every other time that i ever visit atlantic city i come to fight somebody i hardly know how to conduct myself when i have not come to fight against anybody but with somebody i have come to suggest among other thing that when the force of nature be steadily work and the tide be rise to meet the moon you need not be afraid that it will not come to its flood we feel the tide we rejoice in the strength of it and we shall not quarrel in the long run as to the method of it because when you be work with masse of man and organized body of opinion you have get to carry the organized body along the whole art and practice of government consist not in move individual but in move masse it be all very well to run ahead and beckon but after all you have get to wait for the body to follow i have not come to ask you to be patient because you have be but i have come to congratulate you that there be a force behind you that will beyond any peradventure be triumphant and for which you can afford a little while to wait

gentlemen of the congress in fulfil at this time the duty lay upon i by the constitution of communicate to you from time to time information of the state of the union and recommend to your consideration such legislative measure as may be judge necessary and expedient i shall continue the practice which i hope have be acceptable to you of leave to the report of the several head of the executive department the elaboration of the detailed need of the public service and confine myself to those matter of more general public policy with which it seem necessary and feasible to deal at the present session of the congress i realize the limitation of time under which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my suggestion as few as possible but there be some thing leave undo at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which it seem necessary in the interest of the public to do at once in the first place it seem to i imperatively necessary that the early possible consideration and action should be accord the remain measure of the program of settlement and regulation which i have occasion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in view of the public danger disclose by the unaccommodated difficulty which then exist and which still unhappily continue to exist between the railroad of the country and their locomotive engineer conductor and trainman i then recommend first immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reorganization of the interstate commerce commission along the line embody in the bill recently pass by the house of representatives and now await action by the senate in order that the commission may be enable to deal with the many great and various duty now devolve upon it with a promptness and thoroughness which be with its present constitution and mean of action practically impossible second the establishment of an eight hour day as the legal basis alike of work and wage in the employment of all railway employe who be actually engage in the work of operate train in interstate transportation third the authorization of the appointment by the president of a small body of man to observe actual result in experience of the adoption of the eight hour day in railway transportation alike for the man and for the railroad fourth explicit approval by the congress of the consideration by the interstate commerce commission of an increase of freight rate to meet such additional expenditure by the railroad as may have be render necessary by the adoption of the eight hour day and which have not be offset by administrative readjustment and economy should the fact disclose justify the increase fifth an amendment of the exist federal statute which provide for the mediation conciliation and arbitration of such controversy as the present by add to it a provision that in case the method of accommodation now provide for should fail a full public investigation of the merit of every such dispute shall be institute and complete before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempt and sixth the lodgment in the hand of the executive of the power in case of military necessity to take control of such portion and such rolling stock of the railway of the country as may be require for military use and to operate they for military purpose with authority to draft into the military service of the united states such train crew and administrative official as the circumstance require for their safe and efficient use the second and third of these recommendation the congress immediately act on it establish the eight hour day as the legal basis of work and wage in train service and it authorize the appointment of a commission to observe and report upon the practical result deem these the measure most immediately need but it postpone action upon the other suggestion until an opportunity should be offer for a more deliberate consideration of they the fourth recommendation i do not deem it necessary to renew the power of the interstate commerce commission to grant an increase of rate on the ground refer to be indisputably clear and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of the commission 's authority or its inclination to do justice when there be no reason to doubt either the other suggestion the increase in the interstate commerce commission 's membership and in its facility for perform its manifold duty the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial dispute and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the railway when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity i now very earnestly renew the necessity for such legislation be manifest and pressing those who have entrust we with the responsibility and duty of serve and safeguard they in such matter would find it hard i believe to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matter or any unnecessary postponement of action upon they not only do the interstate commerce commission now find it practically impossible with its present membership and organization to perform its great function promptly and thoroughly but it be not unlikely that it may presently be find advisable to add to its duty still other equally heavy and exact it must first be perfect as an administrative instrument the country can not and should not consent to remain any long expose to profound industrial disturbance for lack of additional mean of arbitration and conciliation which the congress can easily and promptly supply and all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the executive to make immediate and uninterrupted use of the railroad for the concentration of the military force of the nation wherever they be need and whenever they be need this be a program of regulation prevention and administrative efficiency which argue its own case in the mere statement of it with regard to one of its item the increase in the efficiency of the interstate commerce commission the house of representatives have already act its action need only the concurrence of the senate i would hesitate to recommend and i dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should i make it that any man in any i occupation should be oblige by law to continue in an employment which he desire to leave to pass a law which forbid or prevent the individual workman to leave his work before receive the approval of society in do so would be to adopt a new principle into our jurisprudence which i take it for grant we be not prepared to introduce but the proposal that the operation of the railway of the country shall not be stop or interrupt by the concerted action of organize body of man until a public investigation shall have be institute which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation be not to propose any such principle it be base upon the very different principle that the concerted action of powerful body of man shall not be permit to stop the industrial process of the nation at any rate before the nation shall have have an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merit of the case as between employe and employer time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merit and opportunity to consider all practicable mean of conciliation or arbitration i can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by society of the necessary process of its very life there be nothing arbitrary or unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily and unjustly do it can and should be do with a full and scrupulous regard for the interest and liberty of all concerned as well as for the permanent interest of society itself three matter of capital importance await the action of the senate which have already be act upon by the house of representatives the bill which seek to extend great freedom of combination to those engage in promote the foreign commerce of the country than be now think by some to be legal under the term of the law against monopoly the bill amend the present organic law of porto rico and the bill propose a more thorough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in election commonly call the corrupt practices act i need not labor my advice that these measure be enact into law their urgency lie in the manifest circumstance which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but necessary even delay would seriously jeopard the interest of the country and of the government immediate passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in election may seem to be less necessary than the immediate enactment of the other measure to which i refer because at least two year will elapse before another election in which federal office be to be fill but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter be deal with while the circumstance and the danger to the public moral of the present method of obtain and spend campaign fund stand clear under recent observation and the method of expenditure can be frankly study in the light of present experience and a delay would have the further very serious disadvantage of postpone action until another election be at hand and some special object connect with it might be think to be in the mind of those who urge it action can be take now with fact for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose i shall not argue at length the desirability of give a free hand in the matter of combined and concerted effort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of build up our export trade that enterprise will presently will immediately assume have indeed already assume a magnitude unprecedented in our experience we have not the necessary instrumentality for its prosecution it be deem to be doubtful whether they could be create upon an adequate scale under our present law we should clear away all legal obstacle and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permit unregulated license the thing must be do now because the opportunity be here and may escape we if we hesitate or delay the argument for the propose amendment of the organic law of porto rico be brief and conclusive the present law govern the island and regulate the right and privilege of its people be not just we have create expectation of extend privilege which we have not satisfy there be uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intention concern they which the adoption of the pende measure would happily remove we do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular we ought to do it at once at the last session of the congress a bill be pass by the senate which provide for the promotion of vocational and industrial education which be of vital importance to the whole country because it concern a matter too long neglect upon which the thorough industrial preparation of the country for the critical year of economic development immediately ahead of we in very large measure depend may i not urge its early and favorable consideration by the house of representatives and its early enactment into law it contain plan which affect all interest and all part of the country and i be sure that there be no legislation now pende before the congress whose passage the country await with more thoughtful approval or great impatience to see a great and admirable thing set in the way of be do there be other matter already advance to the stage of conference between the two house of which it be not necessary that i should speak some practicable basis of agreement concern they will no doubt be find an action take upon they inasmuch as this be gentleman probably the last occasion i shall have to address the sixty fourth congress i hope that you will permit i to say with what genuine pleasure and satisfaction i have co operate with you in the many measure of constructive policy with which you have enrich the legislative annal of the country it have be a privilege to labor in such company i take the liberty of congratulate you upon the completion of a record of rare serviceableness and distinction
gentleman of the senate

 on the eighteenth of december last i address an identic note to the government of the nation now at war request they to state more definitely than they have yet be state by either group of belligerent the term upon which they would deem it possible to make peace i speak on behalf of humanity and of the right of all neutral nation like our own many of whose most vital interest the war put in constant jeopardy

 the central powers unite in a reply which state merely that they be ready to meet their antagonist in conference to discuss term of peace

 the entente powers have reply much more definitely and have state in general term indeed but with sufficient definiteness to imply detail the arrangement guarantee and act of reparation which they deem to be the indispensable condition of a satisfactory settlement

 we be that much near a definite discussion of the peace which shall end the present war we be that much near the discussion of the international concert which must thereafter hold the world at peace

 in every discussion of the peace that must end this war it be take for grant that that peace must be follow by some definite concert of power which will make it virtually impossible that any such catastrophe should ever overwhelm we again every lover of mankind every sane and thoughtful man must take that for grant

 i have seek this opportunity to address you because i think that i owe it to you as the council associate with i in the final determination of our international obligation to disclose to you without reserve the thought and purpose that have be take form in my mind in regard to the duty of our government in the day to come when it will be necessary to lay afresh and upon a new plan the foundation of peace among the nation

 it be inconceivable that the people of the united states should play no part in that great enterprise to take part in such a service will be the opportunity for which they have seek to prepare themselves by the very principle and purpose of their polity and the approve practice of their government ever since the day when they set up a new nation in the high and honorable hope that it might in all that it be and do show mankind the way to liberty

 they can not in honor withhold the service to which they be now about to be challenge they do not wish to withhold it but they owe it to themselves and to the other nation of the world to state the condition under which they will feel free to render it that service be nothing less than this to add their authority and their power to the authority and force of other nation to guarantee peace and justice throughout the world such a settlement can not now be long postpone it be right that before it come this government should frankly formulate the condition upon which it would feel justified in ask our people to approve its formal and solemn adherence to a league for peace i be here to attempt to state those condition

 the present war must first be end but we owe it to candor and to a just regard for the opinion of mankind to say that so far as our participation in guarantee of future peace be concern it make a great deal of difference in what way and upon what term it be end the treaty and agreement which bring it to an end must embody term which will create a peace that be worth guarantee and preserving a peace that will win the approval of mankind not merely a peace that will serve the several interest and immediate aim of the nation engage

 we shall have no voice in determine what those term shall be but we shall i feel sure have a voice in determine whether they shall be make lasting or not by the guarantee of a universal covenant and our judgment upon what be fundamental and essential as a condition precedent to permanency should be speak now not afterwards when it may be too late

 no covenant of cooperative peace that do not include the people of the new world can suffice to keep the future safe against war and yet there be only one sort of peace that the people of america could join in guarantee

 the element of that peace must be element that engage the confidence and satisfy the principle of the american government element consistent with their political faith and with the practical conviction which the people of america have once for all embrace and undertake to defend

 i do not mean to say that any american government would throw any obstacle in the way of any term of peace the government now at war might agree upon or seek to upset they when make whatever they might be i only take it for grant that mere term of peace between the belligerent will not satisfy even the belligerent themselves

 mere agreement may not make peace secure it will be absolutely necessary that a force be create as a guarantor of the permanency of the settlement so much great than the force of any nation now engage or any alliance hitherto form or project that no nation no probable combination of nation could face or withstand it

 if the peace presently to be make be to endure it must be a peace make secure by the organized major force of mankind

 the term of the immediate peace agree upon will determine whether it be a peace for which such a guarantee can be secure the question upon which the whole future peace and policy of the world depend be this

 be the present war a struggle for a just and secure peace or only for a new balance of power if it be only a struggle for a new balance of power who will guarantee who can guarantee the stable equilibrium of the new arrangement

 only a tranquil europe can be a stable europe there must be not a balance of power but a community of power not organized rivalry but an organized common peace

 fortunately we have receive very explicit assurance on this point the statesman of both of the group of nation now array against one another have say in term that could not be misinterpret that it be no part of the purpose they have in mind to crush their antagonist but the implication of these assurance may not be equally clear to all?may not be the same on both side of the water i think it will be serviceable if i attempt to set forth what we understand they to be

 they imply first of all that it must be a peace without victory it be not pleasant to say this i beg that i may be permit to put my own interpretation upon it and that it may be understand that no other interpretation be in my thought

 i be seek only to face reality and to face they without soft concealment victory would mean peace force upon the loser a victor&#39;s term impose upon the vanquished it would be accept in humiliation under duress at an intolerable sacrifice and would leave a sting a resentment a bitter memory upon which term of peace would rest not permanently but only as upon quicksand

 only a peace between equal can last only a peace the very principle of which be equality and a common participation in a common benefit the right state of mind the right feeling between nation be as necessary for a last peace as be the just settlement of vex question of territory or of racial and national allegiance

 the equality of nation upon which peace must be found if it be to last must be an equality of right the guarantee exchange must neither recognize nor imply a difference between big nation and small between those that be powerful and those that be weak

 right must be base upon the common strength not upon the individual strength of the nation upon whose concert peace will depend

 equality of territory or of resource there of course can not be nor any other sort of equality not gain in the ordinary peaceful and legitimate development of the people themselves but no one ask or expect anything more than an equality of right mankind be look now for freedom of life not for equipoise of power

 and there be a deep thing involve than even equality of right among organize nation no peace can last or ought to last which do not recognize and accept the principle that government derive all their just power from the consent of the govern and that no right anywhere exist to hand people about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they be property

 i take it for grant for instance if i may venture upon a single example that statesman everywhere be agree that there should be a united independent and autonomous poland and that henceforth inviolable security of life of worship and of industrial and social development should be guarantee to all people who have live hitherto under the power of government devote to a faith and purpose hostile to their own

 i speak of this not because of any desire to exalt an abstract political principle which have always be hold very dear by those who have seek to build up liberty in america but for the same reason that i have speak of the other condition of peace which seem to i clearly indispensable,?because i wish frankly to uncover reality

 any peace which do not recognize and accept this principle will inevitably be upset it will not rest upon the affection or the conviction of mankind the ferment of spirit of whole population will fight subtly and constantly against it and all the world will sympathize the world can be at peace only if its life be stable and there can be no stability where the will be in rebellion where there be not tranquillity of spirit and a sense of justice of freedom and of right

 so far as practicable moreover every great people now struggle towards a full development of its resource and of its power should be assure a direct outlet to the great highway of the sea where this can not be do by the cession of territory it can no doubt be do by the neutralization of direct right of way under the general guarantee which will assure the peace itself with a right comity of arrangement no nation need be shut away from free access to the open path of the world&#39;s commerce

 and the path of the sea must alike in law and in fact be free the freedom of the sea be the sine qua non of peace equality and cooperation

 no doubt a somewhat radical reconsideration of many of the rule of international practice hitherto think to be establish may be necessary in order to make the sea indeed free and common in practically all circumstance for the use of mankind but the motive for such change be convincing and compelling there can be no trust or intimacy between the people of the world without they

 the free constant unthreatened intercourse of nation be an essential part of the process of peace and of development it need not be difficult either to define or to secure the freedom of the sea if the government of the world sincerely desire to come to an agreement concern it

 it be a problem closely connect with the limitation of naval armament and the cooperation of the navy of the world in keep the sea at once free and safe and the question of limit naval armament open the wide and perhaps more difficult question of the limitation of army and of all program of military preparation

 difficult and delicate as these question be they must be face with the utmost candor and decide in a spirit of real accommodation if peace be to come with healing in its wing and come to stay peace can not be have without concession and sacrifice there can be no sense of safety and equality among the nation if great preponderate armament be henceforth to continue here and there to be build up and maintain

 the statesman of the world must plan for peace and nation must adjust and accommodate their policy to it as they have plan for war and make ready for pitiless contest and rivalry the question of armament whether on land or sea be the most immediately and intensely practical question connect with the future fortune of nation and of mankind

 i have speak upon these great matter without reserve and with the utmost explicitness because it have seem to i to be necessary if the world&#39;s yearn desire for peace be anywhere to find free voice and utterance perhaps i be the only person in high authority amongst all the people of the world who be at liberty to speak and hold nothing back

 i be speak as an individual and yet i be speak also of course as the responsible head of a great government and i feel confident that i have say what the people of the united states would wish i to say may i not add that i hope and believe that i be in effect speak for liberal and friend of humanity in every nation and of every program of liberty

 i would fain believe that i be speak for the silent mass of mankind everywhere who have as yet have no place or opportunity to speak their real heart out concern the death and ruin they see to have come already upon the person and the home they hold most dear

 and in hold out the expectation that the people and government of the united states will join the other civilized nation of the world in guarantee the permanence of peace upon such term as i have name i speak with the great boldness and confidence because it be clear to every man who can think that there be in this promise no breach in either our tradition or our policy as a nation but a fulfilment rather of all that we have profess or striven for

 i be propose as it be that the nation should with one accord adopt the doctrine of president monroe as the doctrine of the world that no nation should seek to extend its polity over any other nation or people but that every people should be leave free to determine its own polity its own way of development unhindered unthreatened unafraid the little along with the great and powerful

 i be propose that all nation henceforth avoid entangle alliance which would draw they into competition of power catch they in a net of intrigue and selfish rivalry and disturb their own affair with influence intrude from without there be no entangle alliance in a concert of power when all unite to act in the same sense and with the same purpose all act in the common interest and be free to live their own life under a common protection

 i be propose government by the consent of the govern that freedom of the sea which in international conference after conference representative of the united states have urge with the eloquence of those who be the convinced disciple of liberty and that moderation of armament which make of army and navie a power for order merely not an instrument of aggression or of selfish violence

 these be american principle american policy we could stand for no other and they be also the principle and policy of forward look man and woman everywhere of every modern nation of every enlighten community they be the principle of mankind and must prevail
gentleman of the congress
 the imperial german government on the thirty first of january announce to this government and to the government of the other neutral nation that on and after the first day of february the present month it would adopt a policy with regard to the use of submarine against all shipping seek to pass through certain designate area of the high sea to which it be clearly my duty to call your attention
 let i remind the congress that on the eighteenth of april last in view of the sinking on the twenty fourth of march of the cross channel passenger steam sussex by a german submarine without summon or warning and the consequent loss of the life of several citizen of the united states who be passenger aboard she this government address a note to the imperial german government in which it make the follow declaration
 if it be still the purpose of the imperial government to prosecute relentless and indiscriminate warfare against vessel of commerce by the use of submarine without regard to what the government of the united states must consider the sacred and indisputable rule of international law and the universally recognize dictate of humanity the government of the united states be at last force to the conclusion that there be but one course it can pursue unless the imperial government should now immediately declare and effect an abandonment of its present method of submarine warfare against passenger and freight carry vessel the government of the united states can have no choice but to sever diplomatic relation with the german empire altogether
 in reply to this declaration the imperial german government give this government the follow assurance
 the german government be prepared to do its utmost to confine the operation of war for the rest of its duration to the fight force of the belligerent thereby also insure the freedom of the sea a principle upon which the german government believe now as before to be in agreement with the government of the united states
 the german government guide by this idea notify the government of the united states that the german naval force have receive the follow order
 in accordance with the general principle of visit and search and destruction of merchant vessel recognize by international law such vessel both within and without the area declare as naval war zone shall not be sink without warn and without save human life unless these ship attempt to escape or offer resistance
 but it add neutral can not expect that germany force to fight for her existence shall for the sake of neutral interest restrict the use of an effective weapon if her enemy be permit to continue to apply at will method of warfare violate the rule of international law such a demand would be incompatible with the character of neutrality and the german government be convince that the government of the united states do not think of make such a demand know that the government of the united states have repeatedly declare that it be determined to restore the principle of the freedom of the sea from whatever quarter it have be violate
 to this the government of the united states reply on the eighth of may accept of course the assurance give but add
 the government of the united states feel it necessary to state that it take it for grant that the imperial german government do not intend to imply that the maintenance of its newly announce policy be in any way contingent upon the course or result of diplomatic negotiation between the government of the united states and any other belligerent government notwithstanding the fact that certain passage in the imperial government&#39;s note of the fourth instant might appear to be susceptible of that construction in order however to avoid any possible misunderstanding the government of the united states notify the imperial government that it can not for a moment entertain much less discuss a suggestion that respect by german naval authority for the right of citizen of the united states upon the high sea should in any way or in the slight degree be make contingent upon the conduct of any other government affect the right of neutral and non combatant responsibility in such matter be single not joint absolute not relative
 to this note of the eighth of may the imperial german government make no reply
 on the thirty first of january the wednesday of the present week the german ambassador hand to the secretary of state along with a formal note a memorandum which contain the follow statement
 the imperial government therefore do not doubt that the government of the united states will understand the situation thus force upon germany by the entente allies&#39 brutal method of war and by their determination to destroy the central powers and that the government of the united states will far realize that the now openly disclose intention of the entente allies give back to germany the freedom of action which she reserve in her note address to the government of the united states on may 4 1916
 under these circumstance germany will meet the illegal measure of her enemy by forcibly prevent after february 1 1917 in a zone around great britain france italy and in the eastern mediterranean all navigation that of neutral include from and to england and from and to france etc etc all ship meet within the zone will be sink
 i think that you will agree with i that in view of this declaration which suddenly and without prior intimation of any kind deliberately withdraw the solemn assurance give in the imperial government&#39;s note of the fourth of may 1916 this government have no alternative consistent with the dignity and honor of the united states but to take the course which in its note of the eighteenth of april 1916 it announce that it would take in the event that the german government do not declare and effect an abandonment of the method of submarine warfare which it be then employ and to which it now purpose again to resort
 i have therefore direct the secretary of state to announce to his excellency the german ambassador that all diplomatic relation between the united states and the german empire be sever and that the american ambassador at berlin will immediately be withdraw and in accordance with this decision to hand to his excellency his passport
 notwithstanding this unexpected action of the german government this sudden and deeply deplorable renunciation of its assurance give this government at one of the most critical moment of tension in the relation of the two government i refuse to believe that it be the intention of the german authority to do in fact what they have warn we they will feel at liberty to do i can not bring myself to believe that they will indeed pay no regard to the ancient friendship between their people and our own or to the solemn obligation which have be exchange between they and destroy american ship and take the life of american citizen in the willful prosecution of the ruthless naval program they have announce their intention to adopt
 only actual overt act on their part can make i believe it even now
 if this inveterate confidence on my part in the sobriety and prudent foresight of their purpose should unhappily prove unfounded if american ship and american life should in fact be sacrifice by their naval commander in heedless contravention of the just and reasonable understanding of international law and the obvious dictate of humanity i shall take the liberty of come again before the congress to ask that authority be give i to use any mean that may be necessary for the protection of our seaman and our people in the prosecution of their peaceful and legitimate errand on the high sea i can do nothing less i take it for grant that all neutral government will take the same course
 we do not desire any hostile conflict with the imperial german government we be the sincere friend of the german people and earnestly desire to remain at peace with the government which speak for they we shall not believe that they be hostile to we unless and until we be oblige to believe it and we purpose nothing more than the reasonable defense of the undoubted right of our people we wish to serve no selfish end we seek merely to stand true alike in thought and in action to the immemorial principle of our people which i seek to express in my address to the senate only two week ago,&mdash;seek merely to vindicate our right to liberty and justice and an unmolested life these be the basis of peace not war god grant we may not be challenge to defend they by act of wilful injustice on the part of the government of germany

gentleman of the congress
 i have again ask the privilege of address you because we be move through critical time during which it seem to i to be my duty to keep in close touch with the houses of congress so that neither counsel nor action shall run at cross purpose between we
 on the third of february i officially inform you of the sudden and unexpected action of the imperial german government in declare its intention to disregard the promise it have make to this government in april last and undertake immediate submarine operation against all commerce whether of belligerent or of neutral that should seek to approach great britain and ireland the atlantic coast of europe or the harbor of the eastern mediterranean and to conduct those operation without regard to the establish restriction of international practice without regard to any consideration of humanity even which might interfere with their object that policy be forthwith put into practice it have now be in active execution for nearly four week
 its practical result be not yet fully disclose the commerce of other neutral nation be suffer severely but not perhaps very much more severely than it be already suffer before the first of february when the new policy of the imperial government be put into operation we have ask the cooperation of the other neutral government to prevent these depredation but so far none of they have think it wise to join we in any common course of action our own commerce have suffer be suffer rather in apprehension than in fact rather because so many of our ship be timidly keep to their home port than because american ship have be sink
 two american vessel have be sink the housatonic and the lyman m. law the case of the housatonic which be carry food stuff consign to a london firm be essentially like the case of the fry in which it will be recall the german government admit its liability for damage and the life of the crew as in the case of the fry be safeguard with reasonable care the case of the law which be carry lemon box stave to palermo disclose a ruthlessness of method which deserve grave condemnation but be accompany by no circumstance which might not have be expect at any time in connection with the use of the submarine against merchantman as the german government have use it
 in sum therefore the situation we find ourselves in with regard to the actual conduct of the german submarine warfare against commerce and its effect upon our own ship and people be substantially the same that it be when i address you on the third of february except for the tying up of our shipping in our own port because of the unwillingness of our shipowner to risk their vessel at sea without insurance or adequate protection and the very serious congestion of our commerce which have result a congestion which be grow rapidly more and more serious every day this in itself might presently accomplish in effect what the new german submarine order be mean to accomplish so far as we be concern we can only say therefore that the overt act which i have venture to hope the german commander would in fact avoid have not occur
 but while this be happily true it must be admit that there have be certain additional indication and expression of purpose on the part of the german press and the german authority which have increase rather than lessen the impression that if our ship and our people be spare it will be because of fortunate circumstance or because the commander of the german submarine which they may happen to encounter exercise an unexpected discretion and restraint rather than because of the instruction under which those commander be act it would be foolish to deny that the situation be fraught with the grave possibility and danger no thoughtful man can fail to see that the necessity for definite action may come at any time if we be in fact and not in word merely to defend our elementary right as a neutral nation it would be most imprudent to be unprepared
 i can not in such circumstance be unmindful of the fact that the expiration of the term of the present congress be immediately at hand by constitutional limitation and that it would in all likelihood require an unusual length of time to assemble and organize the congress which be to succeed it i feel that i ought in view of that fact to obtain from you full and immediate assurance of the authority which i may need at any moment to exercise no doubt i already possess that authority without special warrant of law by the plain implication of my constitutional duty and power but i prefer in the present circumstance not to act upon general implication i wish to feel that the authority and the power of the congress be behind i in whatever it may become necessary for i to do we be jointly the servant of the people and must act together and in their spirit so far as we can divine and interpret it
 no one doubt what it be our duty to do we must defend our commerce and the life of our people in the midst of the present trying circumstance with discretion but with clear and steadfast purpose only the method and the extent remain to be choose upon the occasion if occasion should indeed arise since it have unhappily prove impossible to safeguard our neutral right by diplomatic mean against the unwarranted infringement they be suffer at the hand of germany there may be no recourse but to armed neutrality which we shall know how to maintain and for which there be abundant american precedent
 it be devoutly to be hope that it will not be necessary to put armed force anywhere into action the american people do not desire it and our desire be not different from theirs i be sure that they will understand the spirit in which i be now act the purpose i hold near my heart and would wish to exhibit in everything i do i be anxious that the people of the nation at war also should understand and not mistrust we i hope that i need give no further proof and assurance than i have already give throughout nearly three year of anxious patience that i be the friend of peace and mean to preserve it for america so long as i be able i be not now propose or contemplate war or any step that need lead to it i merely request that you will accord i by your own vote and definite bestowal the mean and the authority to safeguard in practice the right of a great people who be at peace and who be desirous of exercise none but the right of peace to follow the pursuit of peace in quietness and good will,&mdash;right recognize time out of mind by all the civilized nation of the world no course of my choosing or of theirs will lead to war war can come only by the wilful act and aggression of other
 you will understand why i can make no definite proposal or forecast of action now and must ask for your support authority in the most general term the form in which action may become necessary can not yet be foresee i believe that the people will be willing to trust i to act with restraint with prudence and in the true spirit of amity and good faith that they have themselves display throughout these try month and it be in that belief that i request that you will authorize i to supply our merchant ship with defensive arm should that become necessary and with the mean of use they and to employ any other instrumentality or method that may be necessary and adequate to protect our ship and our people in their legitimate and peaceful pursuit on the sea i request also that you will grant i at the same time along with the power i ask a sufficient credit to enable i to provide adequate mean of protection where they be lack include adequate insurance against the present war risk
 i have speak of our commerce and of the legitimate errand of our people on the sea but you will not be mislead as to my main thought the thought that lie beneath these phrase and give they dignity and weight it be not of material interest merely that we be think it be rather of fundamental human right chief of all the right of life itself i be think not only of the right of americans to go and come about their proper business by way of the sea but also of something much deep much more fundamental than that i be think of those right of humanity without which there be no civilization my theme be of those great principle of compassion and of protection which mankind have seek to throw about human life the life of non combatant the life of man who be peacefully at work keep the industrial process of the world quick and vital the life of woman and child and of those who supply the labor which minister to their sustenance we be speak of no selfish material right but of right which our heart support and whose foundation be that righteous passion for justice upon which all law all structure alike of family of state and of mankind must rest as upon the ultimate base of our existence and our liberty i can not imagine any man with american principle at his heart hesitate to defend these thing

my fellow citizens

 the four year which have elapse since last i stand in this place havebeen crowd with counsel and action of the most vital interest and consequence perhaps no equal period in our history have be so fruitful of importantreform in our economic and industrial life or so full of significant changesin the spirit and purpose of our political action we have seek verythoughtfully to set our house in order correct the gross error andabuse of our industrial life liberate and quicken the process of ournational genius and energy and lift our politic to a broad view ofthe people&#39; essential interest

 it be a record of singular variety and singular distinction but i shallnot attempt to review it it speak for itself and will be of increasinginfluence as the year go by this be not the time for retrospect it istime rather to speak our thought and purpose concern the present andthe immediate future

 although we have center counsel and action with such unusual concentrationand success upon the great problem of domestic legislation to which weaddresse ourselves four year ago other matter have more and more forcedthemselve upon our attention-- matter lie outside our own life as anation and over which we have no control but which despite our wish tokeep free of they have draw we more and more irresistibly into theirown current and influence

 it have be impossible to avoid they they have affect the life ofthe whole world they have shake man everywhere with a passion and anapprehension they never know before it have be hard to preserve calmcounsel while the thought of our own people sway this way and that undertheir influence we be a composite and cosmopolitan people we be ofthe blood of all the nation that be at war the current of our thoughtsas well as the current of our trade run quick at all season back andforth between we and they the war inevitably set its mark from the firstalike upon our mind our industry our commerce our politic and oursocial action to be indifferent to it or independent of it be out ofthe question

 and yet all the while we have be conscious that we be not part ofit in that consciousness despite many division we have draw closertogether we have be deeply wrong upon the sea but we have not wishedto wrong or injure in return have retain throughout the consciousnessof stand in some sort apart intent upon an interest that transcendedthe immediate issue of the war itself

 as some of the injury do we have become intolerable we have stillbeen clear that we wish nothing for ourselves that we be not readyto demand for all mankind fair dealing justice the freedom to live andto be at ease against organize wrong

 it be in this spirit and with this thought that we have grow more andmore aware more and more certain that the part we wish to play be thepart of those who mean to vindicate and fortify peace we have be obligedto arm ourselves to make good our claim to a certain minimum of right andof freedom of action we stand firm in armed neutrality since it seemsthat in no other way we can demonstrate what it be we insist upon and cannotforget we may even be draw on by circumstance not by our own purposeor desire to a more active assertion of our right as we see they anda more immediate association with the great struggle itself but nothingwill alter our thought or our purpose they be too clear to be obscure they be too deeply rooted in the principle of our national life to bealtere we desire neither conquest nor advantage we wish nothing thatcan be have only at the cost of another people we always profess unselfishpurpose and we covet the opportunity to prove our profession be sincere

 there be many thing still to be do at home to clarify our own politicsand add new vitality to the industrial process of our own life and weshall do they as time and opportunity serve but we realize that the greatestthing that remain to be do must be do with the whole world for stageand in cooperation with the wide and universal force of mankind and weare make our spirit ready for those thing

 we be provincial no long the tragic event of the thirty monthsof vital turmoil through which we have just pass have make we citizensof the world there can be no turning back our own fortune as a nationare involve whether we would have it so or not

 and yet we be not the less americans on that account we shall be themore american if we but remain true to the principle in which we havebeen breed they be not the principle of a province or of a single continent we have know and boast all along that they be the principle of aliberated mankind these therefore be the thing we shall stand for whether in war or in peace

 that all nation be equally interested in the peace of the world andin the political stability of free people and equally responsible fortheir maintenance that the essential principle of peace be the actualequality of nation in all matter of right or privilege that peace cannotsecurely or justly rest upon an armed balance of power that governmentsderive all their just power from the consent of the governed and thatno other power should be support by the common thought purpose or powerof the family of nation that the sea should be equally free and safefor the use of all people under rule set up by common agreement andconsent and that so far as practicable they should be accessible toall upon equal term that national armament shall be limit to the necessitiesof national order and domestic safety that the community of interest andof power upon which peace must henceforth depend impose upon each nationthe duty of see to it that all influence proceed from its own citizensmeant to encourage or assist revolution in other state should be sternlyand effectually suppress and prevent

 i need not argue these principle to you my fellow countryman theyare your own part and parcel of your own thinking and your own motivesin affair they spring up native amongst we upon this as a platform ofpurpose and of action we can stand together and it be imperative thatwe should stand together we be be forge into a new unity amidst thefire that now blaze throughout the world in their ardent heat we shall in god&#39;s providence let we hope be purge of faction and division purifiedof the errant humor of party and of private interest and shall standforth in the day to come with a new dignity of national pride and spirit let each man see to it that the dedication be in his own heart the highpurpose of the nation in his own mind ruler of his own will and desire

 i stand here and have take the high and solemn oath to which you havebeen audience because the people of the united states have choose i forthis august delegation of power and have by their gracious judgment namedme their leader in affair

 i know now what the task mean i realize to the full the responsibilitywhich it involve i pray god i may be give the wisdom and the prudenceto do my duty in the true spirit of this great people i be their servantand can succeed only as they sustain and guide i by their confidence andtheir counsel the thing i shall count upon the thing without which neithercounsel nor action will avail be the unity of america an america unitedin feeling in purpose and in its vision of duty of opportunity and ofservice

 we be to beware of all man who would turn the task and the necessitiesof the nation to their own private profit or use they for the buildingup of private power

 united alike in the conception of our duty and in the high resolve toperform it in the face of all man let we dedicate ourselves to the greattask to which we must now set our hand for myself i beg your tolerance your countenance and your united aid

 the shadow that now lie dark upon our path will soon be dispel and we shall walk with the light all about we if we be but true to ourselves toourselve as we have wish to be know in the counsel of the world andin the thought of all those who love liberty and justice and the rightexalted
i have call the congress into extraordinary session because there be serious very serious choice of policy to be make and make immediately which it be neither right nor constitutionally permissible that i should assume the responsibility of make on the 3rd of february last i officially lay before you the extraordinary announcement of the imperial german government that on and after the 1st day of february it be its purpose to put aside all restraint of law or of humanity and use its submarine to sink every vessel that seek to approach either the port of great britain and ireland or the western coast of europe or any of the port control by the enemy of germany within the mediterranean that have seem to be the object of the german submarine warfare early in the war but since april of last year the imperial government have somewhat restrain the commander of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then give to we that passenger boat should not be sink and that due warning would be give to all other vessel which its submarine might seek to destroy when no resistance be offer or escape attempt and care take that their crew be give at least a fair chance to save their life in their open boat the precaution take be meager and haphazard enough as be prove in distress instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business but a certain degree of restraint be observe the new policy have sweep every restriction aside vessel of every kind whatever their flag their character their cargo their destination their errand have be ruthlessly send to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board the vessel of friendly neutral along with those of belligerent even hospital ship and ship carry relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of belgium though the latter be provide with safe conduct through the proscribe area by the german government itself and be distinguish by unmistakable mark of identity have be sink with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle i be for a little while unable to believe that such thing would in fact be do by any government that have hitherto subscribe to the humane practice of civilized nation international law have its origin in the attempt to set up some law which would be respect and observe upon the sea where no nation have right of dominion and where lie the free highway of the world by painful stage after stage have that law be build up with meager enough result indeed after all be accomplish that could be accomplish but always with a clear view at least of what the heart and conscience of mankind demand this minimum of right the german government have sweep aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it have no weapon which it could use at sea except these which it be impossible to employ as it be employ they without throw to the wind all scruple of humanity or of respect for the understanding that be suppose to underlie the intercourse of the world i be not now think of the loss of property involve immense and serious as that be but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the life of noncombatant man woman and child engage in pursuit which have always even in the dark period of modern history be deem innocent and legitimate property can be pay for the life of peaceful and innocent people can not be the present german submarine warfare against commerce be a warfare against mankind it be a war against all nation american ship have be sink american life take in way which it have stir we very deeply to learn of but the ship and people of other neutral and friendly nation have be sink and overwhelm in the water in the same way there have be no discrimination the challenge be to all mankind each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it the choice we make for ourselves must be make with a moderation of counsel and a temperateness of judgment befit our character and our motive as a nation we must put excited feeling away our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation but only the vindication of right of human right of which we be only a single champion when i address the congress on the 26th of february last i think that it would suffice to assert our neutral right with arm our right to use the sea against unlawful interference our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence but armed neutrality it now appear be impracticable because submarine be in effect outlaw when use as the german submarine have be use against merchant shipping it be impossible to defend ship against their attack as the law of nation have assume that merchantman would defend themselves against privateer or cruiser visible craft give chase upon the open sea it be common prudence in such circumstance grim necessity indeed to endeavor to destroy they before they have show their own intention they must be deal with upon sight if deal with at all the german government deny the right of neutral to use arm at all within the area of the sea which it have proscribe even in the defense of right which no modern publicist have ever before question their right to defend the intimation be convey that the armed guard which we have place on our merchant ship will be treat as beyond the pale of law and subject to be deal with as pirate would be armed neutrality be ineffectual enough at well in such circumstance and in the face of such pretension it be bad than ineffectual it be likely only to produce what it be mean to prevent it be practically certain to draw we into the war without either the right or the effectiveness of belligerent there be one choice we can not make we be incapable of make we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred right of our nation and our people to be ignore or violate the wrong against which we now array ourselves be no common wrong they cut to the very root of human life with a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step i be take and of the grave responsibility which it involve but in unhesitate obedience to what i deem my constitutional duty i advise that the congress declare the recent course of the imperial german government to be in fact nothing less than war against the government and people of the united states that it formally accept the status of belligerent which have thus be thrust upon it and that it take immediate step not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resource to bring the government of the german empire to term and end the war what this will involve be clear it will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the government now at war with germany and as incident to that the extension to those government of the most liberal financial credit in order that our resource may so far as possible be add to theirs it will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resource of the country to supply the material of war and serve the incidental need of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible it will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respect but particularly in supply it with the good mean of deal with the enemy 's submarine it will involve the immediate addition to the armed force of the united states already provide for by law in case of war at least 500,000 man who should in my opinion be choose upon the principle of universal liability to service and also the authorization of subsequent additional increment of equal force so soon as they may be need and can be handle in training it will involve also of course the granting of adequate credit to the government sustain i hope so far as they can equitably be sustain by the present generation by well conceive taxation i say sustain so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seem to i that it would be most unwise to base the credit which will now be necessary entirely on money borrow it be our duty i most respectfully urge to protect our people so far as we may against the very serious hardship and evil which would be likely to arise out of the inflation which would be produce by vast loan in carry out the measure by which these thing be to be accomplish we should keep constantly in mind the wisdom of interfere as little as possible in our own preparation and in the equipment of our own military force with the duty for it will be a very practical duty of supply the nation already at war with germany with the material which they can obtain only from we or by our assistance they be in the field and we should help they in every way to be effective there i shall take the liberty of suggest through the several executive department of the government for the consideration of your committee measure for the accomplishment of the several object i have mention i hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with they as having be frame after very careful thought by the branch of the government upon which the responsibility of conduct the war and safeguard the nation will most directly fall while we do these thing these deeply momentous thing let we be very clear and make very clear to all the world what our motive and our object be my own thought have not be drive from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy event of the last two month and i do not believe that the thought of the nation have be alter or cloud by they i have exactly the same thing in mind now that i have in mind when i address the senate on the 22nd of january last the same that i have in mind when i address the congress on the 3rd of february and on the 26th of february our object now as then be to vindicate the principle of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up among the really free and self govern people of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principle neutrality be no long feasible or desirable where the peace of the world be involve and the freedom of its people and the menace to that peace and freedom lie in the existence of autocratic government back by organized force which be control wholly by their will not by the will of their people we have see the last of neutrality in such circumstance we be at the beginning of an age in which it will be insist that the same standard of conduct and of responsibility for wrong do shall be observe among nation and their government that be observe among the individual citizen of civilized state we have no quarrel with the german people we have no feeling toward they but one of sympathy and friendship it be not upon their impulse that their government act in enter this war it be not with their previous knowledge or approval it be a war determine upon as war use to be determine upon in the old unhappy day when people be nowhere consult by their ruler and war be provoke and wage in the interest of dynasty or of little group of ambitious man who be accustomed to use their fellowman as pawn and tool self govern nation do not fill their neighbor state with spy or set the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affair which will give they an opportunity to strike and make conquest such design can be successfully work out only under cover and where no one have the right to ask question cunningly contrive plan of deception or aggression carry it may be from generation to generation can be work out and keep from the light only within the privacy of court or behind the carefully guard confidence of a narrow and privileged class they be happily impossible where public opinion command and insist upon full information concern all the nation 's affair a steadfast concert for peace can never be maintain except by a partnership of democratic nation no autocratic government could be trust to keep faith within it or observe its covenant it must be a league of honor a partnership of opinion intrigue would eat its vital away the plotting of inner circle who could plan what they would and render account to no one would be a corruption seat at its very heart only free people can hold their purpose and their honor steady to a common end and prefer the interest of mankind to any narrow interest of their own do not every american feel that assurance have be add to our hope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and hearten thing that have be happen within the last few week in russia russia be know by those who know it well to have be always in fact democratic at heart in all the vital habit of her thought in all the intimate relationship of her people that speak their natural instinct their habitual attitude toward life the autocracy that crown the summit of her political structure long as it have stand and terrible as be the reality of its power be not in fact russian in origin character or purpose and now it have be shake off and the great generous russian people have be add in all their naive majesty and might to the force that be fight for freedom in the world for justice and for peace here be a fit partner for a league of honor one of the thing that have serve to convince we that the prussian autocracy be not and could never be our friend be that from the very outset of the present war it have fill our unsuspecting community and even our office of government with spy and set criminal intrigue everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel our peace within and without our industry and our commerce indeed it be now evident that its spy be here even before the war begin and it be unhappily not a matter of conjecture but a fact prove in our court of justice that the intrigue which have more than once come perilously near to disturb the peace and dislocate the industry of the country have be carry on at the instigation with the support and even under the personal direction of official agent of the imperial government accredit to the government of the united states even in check these thing and try to extirpate they we have seek to put the most generous interpretation possible upon they because we know that their source lay not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the german people toward we who be no doubt as ignorant of they as we ourselves be but only in the selfish design of a government that do what it please and tell its people nothing but they have play their part in serve to convince we at last that that government entertain no real friendship for we and mean to act against our peace and security at its convenience that it mean to stir up enemy against we at our very door the intercept note to the german minister at mexico city be eloquent evidence we be accept this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a government follow such method we can never have a friend and that in the presence of its organize power always lie in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose there can be no assured security for the democratic government of the world we be now about to accept gauge of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall if necessary spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its pretension and its power we be glad now that we see the fact with no veil of false pretense about they to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its people the german people include for the right of nation great and small and the privilege of man everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience the world must be make safe for democracy its peace must be plant upon the test foundation of political liberty we have no selfish end to serve we desire no conquest no dominion we seek no indemnity for ourselves no material compensation for the sacrifice we shall freely make we be but one of the champion of the right of mankind we shall be satisfied when those right have be make as secure as the faith and the freedom of nation can make they just because we fight without rancor and without selfish object seek nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free people we shall i feel confident conduct our operation as belligerent without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principle of right and of fair play we profess to be fight for i have say nothing of the government ally with the imperial government of germany because they have not make war upon we or challenge we to defend our right and our honor the austro hungarian government have indeed avow its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopt now without disguise by the imperial german government and it have therefore not be possible for this government to receive count tarnowski the ambassador recently accredit to this government by the imperial and royal government of austria hungary but that government have not actually engage in warfare against citizen of the united states on the sea and i take the liberty for the present at least of postpone a discussion of our relation with the authority at vienna we enter this war only where we be clearly force into it because there be no other mean of defend our right it will be all the easy for we to conduct ourselves as belligerent in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon they but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which have throw aside all consideration of humanity and of right and be run amuck we be let i say again the sincere friend of the german people and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relation of mutual advantage between we however hard it may be for they for the time be to believe that this be speak from our heart we have bear with their present government through all these bitter month because of that friendship exercise a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have be impossible we shall happily still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and action toward the million of man and woman of german birth and native sympathy who live among we and share our life and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who be in fact loyal to their neighbor and to the government in the hour of test they be most of they as true and loyal americans as if they have never know any other fealty or allegiance they will be prompt to stand with we in rebuke and restrain the few who may be of a different mind and purpose if there should be disloyalty it will be deal with with a firm hand of stern repression but if it lift its head at all it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few it be a distressing and oppressive duty gentleman of the congress which i have perform in thus address you there be it may be many month of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of we it be a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war into the most terrible and disastrous of all war civilization itself seem to be in the balance but the right be more precious than peace and we shall fight for the thing which we have always carry near our heart for democracy for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government for the right and liberty of small nation for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free people as shall bring peace and safety to all nation and make the world itself at last free to such a task we can dedicate our life and our fortune everything that we be and everything that we have with the pride of those who know that the day have come when america be privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principle that give her birth and happiness and the peace which she have treasure god help she she can do no other
my countryman the surpass war of all time have involve we and find we utterly unprepared in either a mental or military sense the republic must awaken the people must understand our safety lie in full realization the fate of the nation and the safety of the world will be decide on the western battlefront of europe

 do at the city of washington this 6th day of april in the year of our lord one thousand nine hundred and seventeen and of the independence of the united states of america the one hundred and forty first
my fellow countrymen
 the entrance of our own beloved country into the grim and terrible war for democracy and human right which have shake the world create so many problem of national life and action which call for immediate consideration and settlement that i hope you will permit i to address to you a few word of earnest counsel and appeal with regard to they
 we be rapidly put our navy upon an effective war footing and be about to create and equip a great army but these be the simple part of the great task to which we have address ourselves there be not a single selfish element so far as i can see in the cause we be fight for we be fight for what we believe and wish to be the right of mankind and for the future peace and security of the world to do this great thing worthily and successfully we must devote ourselves to the service without regard to profit or material advantage and with an energy and intelligence that will rise to the level of the enterprise itself we must realize to the full how great the task be and how many thing how many kind and element of capacity and service and self sacrifice it involve
 these then be the thing we must do and do well besides fight the thing without which mere fighting would be fruitless
 we must supply abundant food for ourselves and for our army and our seaman not only but also for a large part of the nation with whom we have now make common cause in whose support and by whose side we shall be fight
 we must supply ship by the hundred out of our shipyard to carry to the other side of the sea submarine or no submarine what will every day be need there and abundant material out of our field and our mine and our factory with which not only to clothe and equip our own force on land and sea but also to clothe and support our people for whom the gallant fellow under arm can no long work to help clothe and equip the army with which we be coordinate in europe and to keep the loom and manufactory there in raw material coal to keep the fire go in ship at sea and in the furnace of hundred of factory across the sea steel out of which to make arm and ammunition both here and there rail for wear out railway back of the fighting front locomotive and roll stock to take the place of those every day go to piece mule horse cattle for labor and for military service everything with which the people of england and france and italy and russia have usually supply themselves but can not now afford the man the material or the machinery to make
 it be evident to every thinking man that our industry on the farm in the shipyard in the mine in the factory must be make more prolific and more efficient than ever and that they must be more economically manage and well adapt to the particular requirement of our task than they have be and what i want to say be that the man and the woman who devote their thought and their energy to these thing will be serve the country and conduct the fight for peace and freedom just as truly and just as effectively as the man on the battlefield or in the trench the industrial force of the country man and woman alike will be a great national a great international service army a notable and honored host engage in the service of the nation and the world the efficient friend and savior of free man everywhere thousand nay hundred of thousand of man otherwise liable to military service will of right and of necessity be excuse from that service and assign to the fundamental sustain work of the field and factory and mine and they will be as much part of the great patriotic force of the nation as the man under fire
 i take the liberty therefore of address this word to the farmer of the country and to all who work on the farm the supreme need of our own nation and of the nation with which we be coordinate be an abundance of supply and especially of food stuff the importance of an adequate food supply especially for the present year be superlative without abundant food alike for the army and the people now at war the whole great enterprise upon which we have embark will break down and fail the world&#39;s food reserve be low not only during the present emergency but for some time after peace shall have come both our own people and a large proportion of the people of europe must rely upon the harvest in america upon the farmer of this country therefore in large measure rest the fate of the war and the fate of the nation may the nation not count upon they to omit no step that will increase the production of their land or that will bring about the most effectual coordination in the sale and distribution of their product the time be short it be of the most imperative importance that everything possible be do and do immediately to make sure of large harvest i call upon young man and old alike and upon the able bodied boy of the land to accept and act upon this duty to turn in host to the farm and make certain that no pain and no labor be lack in this great matter
 i particularly appeal to the farmer of the south to plant abundant food stuff as well as cotton they can show their patriotism in no well or more convincing way than by resist the great temptation of the present price of cotton and help help upon a great scale to feed the nation and the people everywhere who be fight for their liberty and for our own the variety of their crop will be the visible measure of their comprehension of their national duty
 the government of the united states and the government of the several states stand ready to coordinate they will do everything possible to assist farmer in secure an adequate supply of seed an adequate force of laborer when they be most need at harvest time and the mean of expedite shipment of fertilizer and farm machinery as well as of the crop themselves when harvest the course of trade shall be as unhampere as it be possible to make it and there shall be no unwarranted manipulation of the nation&#39;s food supply by those who handle it on its way to the consumer this be our opportunity to demonstrate the efficiency of a great democracy and we shall not fall short of it
 this let i say to the middleman of every sort whether they be handle our food stuff or our raw material of manufacture or the product of our mill and factory the eye of the country will be especially upon you this be your opportunity for signal service efficient and disintereste the country expect you as it expect all other to forego unusual profit to organize and expedite shipment of supply of every kind but especially of food with an eye to the service you be render and in the spirit of those who enlist in the rank for their people not for themselves i shall confidently expect you to deserve and win the confidence of people of every sort and station
 to the man who run the railway of the country whether they be manager or operative employee let i say that the railway be the artery of the nation&#39;s life and that upon they rest the immense responsibility of see to it that those artery suffer no obstruction of any kind no inefficiency or slackened power to the merchant let i suggest the motto small profit and quick service and to the shipbuilder the thought that the life of the war depend upon he the food and the war supply must be carry across the sea no matter how many ship be send to the bottom the place of those that go down must be supply and supply at once to the miner let i say that he stand where the farmer do the work of the world wait on he if he slacken or fail army and statesman be helpless he also be enlist in the great service army the manufacturer do not need to be tell i hope that the nation look to he to speed and perfect every process and i want only to remind his employee that their service be absolutely indispensable and be count on by every man who love the country and its liberty
 let i suggest also that everyone who create or cultivate a garden help and help greatly to solve the problem of the feeding of the nation and that every housewife who practice strict economy put herself in the rank of those who serve the nation this be the time for america to correct her unpardonable fault of wastefulness and extravagance let every man and every woman assume the duty of careful provident use and expenditure as a public duty as a dictate of patriotism which no one can now expect ever to be excuse or forgive for ignore
 in the hope that this statement of the need of the nation and of the world in this hour of supreme crisis may stimulate those to whom it come and remind all who need reminder of the solemn duty of a time such as the world have never see before i beg that all editor and publisher everywhere will give as prominent publication and as wide circulation as possible to this appeal i venture to suggest also to all advertising agency that they would perhaps render a very substantial and timely service to the country if they would give it widespread repetition and i hope that clergyman will not think the theme of it an unworthy or inappropriate subject of comment and homily from their pulpit
 the supreme test of the nation have come we must all speak act and serve together

 the whole nation an army
 the power against which we be array have seek to impose its will upon the world by force to this end it have increase armament until it have change the face of war in the sense in which we have be will not to think of army there be no army in this struggle there be entire nation arm
 thus the man who remain to till the soil and man the factory be no less a part of the army that be in france than the man beneath the battle flag
 it must be so with we it be not an army that we must shape and train for war it be a nation to this end our people must draw close in one compact front against a common foe but this can not be if each man pursue a private purpose all must pursue one purpose the nation need all man but it need each man not in the field that will most pleasure he but in the endeavor that will well serve the common good
 thus though a sharpshooter please to operate a trip hammer for the forging of great gun and an expert machinist desire to march with the flag the nation be be serve only when the sharpshooter marche and the machinist remain at his lever the whole nation must be a team in which each man shall play the part for which he be well fit
 not a draft of the unwilling
 to this end congress have provide that the nation shall be organize for war by selection that each man shall be classify for service in the place to which it shall well serve the general good to call he
 the significance of this can not be overstate it be a new thing in our history and a landmark in our progress it be a new manner of accept and vitalize our duty to give ourselves with thoughtful devotion to the common purpose of we all it be in no sense a conscription of the unwilling it be rather selection from a nation which have volunteer in mass
 it be no more a choosing of those who shall march with the color than it be a selection of those who shall serve an equally necessary and devoted purpose in the industry that lie behind the battle line
 the day here name be the time upon which all shall present themselves for assignment to their task it be for that reason destine to be remember as one of the most conspicuous moment in our history it be nothing less than the day upon which the manhood of the country shall step forward in one solid rank in defense of the ideal to which this nation be consecrate it be important to those ideal no less than to the pride of this generation in manifest its devotion to they that there be no gap in the rank
 day of patriotic devotion
 it be essential that the day be approach in thoughtful apprehension of its significance and that we accord to it the honor and the meaning that it deserve our industrial need prescribe that it be not make a technical holiday but the stern sacrifice that be before we urge that it be carry in all our heart as a great day of patriotic devotion and obligation when the duty shall lie upon every man whether he be himself to be register or not to see to it that the name of every male person of the designate age be write on these list of honor
 in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and cause the seal of the united states to be affix
 do at the city of washington this 18th day of may in the year of our lord 1917 and of the independence of the united states of america the one hundred and forty first
gentlemen of the congress eight month have elapse since i last have the honor of address you they have be month crowd with event of immense and grave significance for we i shall not undertake to detail or even to summarize those event the practical particular of the part we have play in they will be lay before you in the report of the executive department i shall discuss only our present outlook upon these vast affair our present duty and the immediate mean of accomplish the object we shall hold always in view i shall not go back to debate the cause of the war the intolerable wrong do and plan against we by the sinister master of germany have long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true american to need to be rehearse but i shall ask you to consider again and with a very grave scrutiny our objective and the measure by which we mean to attain they for the purpose of discussion here in this place be action and our action must move straight toward definite end our object be of course to win the war and we shall not slacken or suffer ourselves to he divert until it be win but it be worth while ask and answer the question when shall we consider the war won?from one point of view it be not necessary to broach this fundamental matter i do not doubt that the american people know what the war be about and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their purpose in it as a nation we be unite in spirit and intention i pay little heed to those who tell i otherwise i hear the voice of dissent who do not i bear the criticism and the clamor of the noisily thoughtless and troublesome i also see man here and there fle themselves in impotent disloyalty against the calm indomitable power of the nation i hear man debate peace who understand neither its nature nor the way in which we may attain it with uplifted eye and unbroken spirit but i know that none of these speak for the nation they do not touch the heart of anything they may safely be leave to strut their uneasy hour and be forget but from another point of view i believe that it be necessary to say plainly what we here at the seat of action consider the war to be for and what part we mean to play in the settlement of its search issue we be the spokesman of the american people and they have a right to know whether their purpose be ours they desire peace by the overcoming of evil by the defeat once for all of the sinister force that interrupt peace and render it impossible and they wish to know how closely our thought run with theirs and what action we propose they be impatient with those who desire peace by any sort of compromisedeeply and indignantly impatient but they will be equally impatient with we if we do not make it plain to they what our objective be and what we be plan for in seek to make conquest of peace by arm i believe that i speak for they when i say two thing first that this intolerable thing of which the master of germany have show we the ugly face this menace of combined intrigue and force which we now see so clearly as the german power a thing without conscience or honor of capacity for covenanted peace must be crush and if it be not utterly bring to an end at least shut out from the friendly intercourse of the nation and second that when this thing and its power be indeed defeat and the time come that we can discuss peace when the german people have spokesman whose word we can believe and when those spokesman be ready in the name of their people to accept the common judgment of the nation as to what shall henceforth be the basis of law and of covenant for the life of the world we shall be willing and glad to pay the full price for peace and pay it ungrudgingly we know what that price will be it will be full impartial justice justice do at every point and to every nation that the final settlement must affect our enemy as well as our friend you catch with i the voice of humanity that be in the air they grow daily more audible more articulate more persuasive and they come from the heart of man everywhere they insist that the war shall not end in vindictive action of any kind that no nation or people shall be rob or punish because the irresponsible ruler of a single country have themselves do deep and abominable wrong it be this thought that have be express in the formula no annexation no contribution no punitive indemnity "just because this crude formula express the instinctive judgment as to right of plain man everywhere it have be make diligent use of by the master of german intrigue to lead the people of russia astrayand the people of every other country their agent could reach in order that a premature peace might be bring about before autocracy have be teach its final and convincing lesson and the people of the world put in control of their own destiny but the fact that a wrong use have be make of a just idea be no reason why a right use should not be make of it it ought to be bring under the patronage of its real friend let it be say again that autocracy must first be show the utter futility of its claim to power or leadership in the modern world it be impossible to apply any standard of justice so long as such force be unchecked and undefeated as the present master of germany command not until that have be do can right be set up as arbiter and peacemaker among the nation but when that have be do as god willing it assuredly will be we shall at last be free to do an unprecedented thing and this be the time to avow our purpose to do it we shall be free to base peace on generosity and justice to the exclusion of all selfish claim to advantage even on the part of the victor let there be no misunderstanding our present and immediate task be to win the war and nothing shall turn we aside from from it until it be accomplish every power and resource we possess whether of man of money or of material be be devote and will continue to be devoted to that purpose until it be achieve those who desire to bring peace about before that purpose be achieve i counsel to carry their advice elsewhere we will not entertain it we shall regard the war as win only when the german people say to we through properly accredit representative that they be ready to agree to a settlement base upon justice and reparation of the wrong their ruler have do they have do a wrong to belgium which must be repair they have establish a power over other land and people than their own over the great empire of austria hungary over hitherto free balkan state over turkey and within asia which must be relinquish germany 's success by skill by industry by knowledge by enterprise we do not grudge or oppose but admire rather she have build up for herself a real empire of trade and influence secure by the peace of the world we be content to abide by the rivalry of manufacture science and commerce that be involve for we in her success and stand or fall as we have or do not have the brain and the initiative to surpass she but at the moment when she have conspicuously win her triumph of peace she throw they away to establish in their stead what the world will no long permit to be establish military and political domination by arm by which to oust where she could not excel the rival she most fear and hate the peace we make must remedy that wrong it must deliver the once fair land and happy people of belgium and northern france from the prussian conquest and the prussian menace but it must deliver also the people of austria hungary the people of the balkans and the people of turkey alike in europe and asia from the impudent and alien dominion of the prussian military and commercial autocracy we owe it however to ourselves to say that we do not wish in any way to impair or to rearrange the austrohungarian empire it be no affair of ours what they do with their own life either industrially or politically we do not purpose or desire to dictate to they in any way we only desire to see that their affair be leave in their own hand in all matter great or small we shall hope to secure for the people of the balkan peninsula and for the people of the turkish empire the right and opportunity to make their own life safe their own fortune secure against oppression or injustice and from the dictation of foreign court or party and our attitude and purpose with regard to germany herself be of a like kind we intend no wrong against the german empire no interference with her internal affair we should deem either the one or the other absolutely unjustifiable absolutely contrary to the principle we have profess to live by and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a nation the people of germany be be tell by the man whom they now permit to deceive they and to act as their master that they be fight for the very life and existence of their empire a war of desperate self defense against deliberate aggression nothing could be more grossly or wantonly false and we must seek by the utmost openness and candor as to our real aim to convince they of its falseness we be in fact fight for their emancipation from the fear along with our own from the fear as well as from the fact of unjust attack by neighbor or rival or schemer after world empire no one be threaten the existence or the independence of the peaceful enterprise of the german empire the bad that can happen to the detriment the german people be this that if they should still after the war be over continue to be oblige to live under ambitious and intriguing master interested to disturb the peace of the world man or class of man whom the other people of the world could not trust it might be impossible to admit they to the partnership of nation which must henceforth guarantee the world 's peace that partnership must be a partnership of people not a mere partnership of government it might be impossible also in such untoward circumstance to admit germany to the free economic intercourse which must inevitably spring out of the other partnership of a real peace but there would be no aggression in that and such a situation inevitable because of distrust would in the very nature of thing soon or later cure itself by process which would assuredly set in the wrong the very deep wrong commit in this war will have to be right that of course but they can not and must not be right by the commission of similar wrong against germany and her ally the world will not permit the commission of similar wrong as a means of reparation and settlement statesman must by this time have learn that the opinion of the world be everywhere wide awake and fully comprehend the issue involve no representative of any self govern nation will dare disregard it by attempt any such covenant of selfishness and compromise as be enter into at the congress of vienna the thought of the plain people here and everywhere throughout the world the people who enjoy no privilege and have very simple and unsophisticated standard of right and wrong be the air all government must henceforth breathe if they would live it be in the full disclosing light of that think that all policy must be receive and execute in this midday hour of the world 's life ger man ruler have be able to upset the peace of the world only because the german people be not suffer under their tutelage to share the comradeship of the other people of the world either in thought or in purpose they be allow to have no opinion of their own which might be set up as a rule of conduct for those who exercise authority over they but the congress that conclude this war will feel the full strength of the tide that run now in the heart and conscience of free man everywhere its conclusion will run with those tide all those thing have be true from the very beginning of this stupendous war and i can not help think that if they have be make plain at the very outset the sympathy and enthusiasm of the russian people might have be once for all enlisted on the side of the allies suspicion and distrust sweep away and a real and lasting union of purpose effect have they believe these thing at the very moment of their revolution and have they be confirm in that belief since the sad reverse which have recently mark the progress of their affair towards an ordered and stable government of free man might have be avoid the russian people have be poison by the very same falsehood that have keep the german people in the dark and the poison have be administer by the very same hand the only possible antidote be the truth it can not be utter too plainly or too often from every point of view therefore it have seem to be my duty to speak these declaration of purpose to add these specific interpretation to what i take the liberty of say to the senate in january our entrance into the war have not alter out attitude towards the settlement that must come when it be over when i say in january that the nation of the world be entitle not only to free pathway upon the sea but also to assure and unmoleste access to those pathway i be think and i be think now not of the small and weak nation alone which need our countenance and support but also of the great and powerful nation and of our present enemy as well as our present associate in the war i be think and be think now of austria herself among the rest as well as of serbia and of poland justice and equality of right can be have only at a great price we be seek permanent not temporary foundation for the peace of the world and must seek they candidly and fearlessly as always the right will prove to be the expedient what shall we do then to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion we must clear away with a thorough hand all impediment to success and we must make every adjustment of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force as a fighting unit one very embarrassing obstacle that stand hi our way be that we be at war with germany but not with her ally i therefore very earnestly recommend that the congress immediately declare the united states in a state of war with austria hungary do it seem strange to you that this should be the conclusion of the argument i have just address to you it be not it be in fact the inevitable logic of what i have say austria hungary be for the time be not her own mistress but simply the vassal of the german government we must face the fact as they be and act upon they without sentiment in this stern business the government of austria and hungary be not act upon its own initiative or in response to the wish and feeling of its own people but as the instrument of another nation we must meet its force with our own and regard the central powers as but one the war can be successfully conduct in no other way the same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against turkey and bulgaria they also be the tool of germany but they be mere tool and do not yet stand in the direct path of our necessary action we shall go wherever the necessity of this war carry we but it seem to i that we should go only where immediate and practical consideration lead we and not heed any other the financial and military measure which must be adopt will suggest themselves as the war and its undertaking develop but i will take the liberty of propose to you certain other act of legislation which seem to i to be need for the support of the war and for the release of our whole force and energy it will be necessary to extend in certain particular the legislation of the last session with regard to alien enemy and also necessary i believe to create a very definite and particular control over the entrance and departure of all person into and from the united states legislation should be enact define as a criminal offense every wilful violation of the presidential proclamation relate to alien enemy promulgate under section 4067 of the revise statute and provide appropriate punishment and woman as well as man should be include under the term of the act place restraint upon alien enemy it be likely that as time go on many alien enemy will be willing to be feed and house at the expense of the government in the detention camp and it would be the purpose of the legislation i have suggest to confine offender among they in the penitentiary and other similar institution where they could be make to work as other criminal do recent experience have convince i that the congress must go far in authorize the government to set limit to price the law of supply and demand i be sorry to say have been- replace by the law of unrestrained selfishness while we have eliminate profiteer in several branch of industry it still run impudently rampant in other the farmer for example complain with a great deal of justice that while the regulation of food price restrict their income no restraint be place upon the price of most of the thing they must themselves purchase and similar inequity obtain on all side it be imperatively necessary that the consideration of the full use of the water power of the country and also of the consideration of the systematic and yet economical development of such of the natural resource of the country as be still under the control of the federal government should be immediately resume and affirmatively and con.structively deal with at the early possible moment the press need of such legislation be daily become more obvious the legislation propose at the last session with regard to regulate combination among our exporter in order to provide for our foreign trade a more effective organization and method of co operation ought by all mean to be complete at this session and i beg that the member of the house of representatives will permit i to express the opinion that it will be impossible to deal in any but a very wasteful and extravagant fashion with the enormous appropriation of the public money which must continue to be make if the war be to be properly sustain unless the house will consent to return to its former practice of initiate and prepare all appropriation bill through a single committee in order that responsibility may be center expenditure standardize and make uniform and waste and duplication as much as possible avoid additional legislation may also become necessary before the present congress again adjourn in order to effect the most efficient co ordination and operation of the railway and other transportation system of the country but to that i shall if circumstance should demand call the attention of congress upon another occasion if i have overlook anything that ought to be do for the more effective conduct of the war your own counsel will supply the omission what i be perfectly clear about be that in the present session of the congress our whole attention and energy should be concentrate on the vigorous rapid and successful prosecution of the great task of win the war we can do this with all the great zeal and enthusiasm because we know that for we this be a war of high principle debase by no selfish ambition of conquest or spoiliation because we know and all the world know that we have be force into it to save the very institution we five under from corruption and destruction the purpose of the central powers strike straight at the very heart of everything we believe in their method of warfare outrage every principle of humanity and of knightly honor their intrigue have corrupt the very thought and spirit of many of our people their sinister and secret diplomacy have seek to take our very territory away from we and disrupt the union of the state our safety would be at an end our honor forever sully and bring into contempt be we to permit their triumph they be strike at the very existence of democracy and liberty it be because it be for we a war of high disinterested purpose in which all the free people of the world be band together for the vindication of right a war for the preservation of our nation of all that it have hold dear of principle and of purpose that we feel ourselves doubly constrain to propose for its outcome only that which be righteous and of irreproachable intention for our foe as well as for our friend the cause be just and holy the settlement must be of like motive and equality for this we can fight but for nothing less noble or less worthy of our tradition for this cause we enter the war and for this cause will we battle until the last gun be fire i have speak plainly because this seem to i the time when it be most necessary to speak plainly in order that all the world may know that even in the heat and ardor of the struggle and when our whole thought be of carry the war through to its end we have not forget any ideal or principle for which the name of america have be hold in honor among the nation and for which it have be our glory to contend in the great generation that go before we a supreme moment of history have come the eye of the people have be open and they see the hand of god be lay upon the nation he will show they favor i devoutly believe only if they rise to the clear height of his own justice and mercy
gentleman of the congress
 once more as repeatedly before the spokesman of the central empires have indicate their desire to discuss the object of the war and the possible basis of a general peace parley have be in progress at brest litovsk between russian representative and representative of the central powers to which the attention of all the belligerent have be invite for the purpose of ascertain whether it may be possible to extend these parley into a general conference with regard to term of peace and settlement the russian representative present not only a perfectly definite statement of the principle upon which they would be willing to conclude peace but also an equally definite program of the concrete application of those principle the representative of the central powers on their part present an outline of settlement which if much less definite seem susceptible of liberal interpretation until their specific program of practical term be add that program propose no concession at all either to the sovereignty of russia or to the preference of the population with whose fortune it deal but mean in a word that the central empires be to keep every foot of territory their armed force have occupied,&mdash;every province every city every point of vantage,&mdash;as a permanent addition to their territory and their power it be a reasonable conjecture that the general principle of settlement which they at first suggest originate with the more liberal statesman of germany and austria the man who have begin to feel the force of their own peoples&#39 thought and purpose while the concrete term of actual settlement come from the military leader who have no thought but to keep what they have get the negotiation have be break off the russian representative be sincere and in earnest they can not entertain such proposal of conquest and domination
 the whole incident be full of significance it be also full of perplexity with whom be the russian representative deal for whom be the representative of the central empires speak be they speak for the majority of their respective parliament or for the minority party that military and imperialistic minority which have so far dominate their whole policy and control the affair of turkey and of the balkan state which have felt oblige to become their associate in this war the russian representative have insist very justly very wisely and in the true spirit of modern democracy that the conference they have be hold with the teutonic and turkish statesman should be hold within open not closed door and all the world have be audience as be desire to whom have we be listen then to those who speak the spirit and intention of the resolutions of the german reichstag of the ninth of july last the spirit and intention of the liberal leader and party of germany or to those who resist and defy that spirit and intention and insist upon conquest and subjugation or be we listen in fact to both unreconciled and in open and hopeless contradiction these be very serious and pregnant question upon the answer to they depend the peace of the world
 but whatever the result of the parley at brest litovsk whatever the confusion of counsel and of purpose in the utterance of the spokesman of the central empires they have again attempt to acquaint the world with their object in the war and have again challenge their adversary to say what their object be and what sort of settlement they would deem just and satisfactory there be no good reason why that challenge should not be respond to and respond to with the utmost candor we do not wait for it not once but again and again we have lay our whole thought and purpose before the world not in general term only but each time with sufficient definition to make it clear what sort of definitive term of settlement must necessarily spring out of they within the last week mr. lloyd george have speak with admirable candor and in admirable spirit for the people and government of great britain there be no confusion of counsel among the adversary of the central powers no uncertainty of principle no vagueness of detail the only secrecy of counsel the only lack of fearless frankness the only failure to make definite statement of the object of the war lie with germany and her allies the issue of life and death hang upon these definition no statesman who have the least conception of his responsibility ought for a moment to permit himself to continue this tragical and appalling outpouring of blood and treasure unless he be sure beyond a peradventure that the object of the vital sacrifice be part and parcel of the very life of society and that the people for whom he speak think they right and imperative as he do
 there be moreover a voice call for these definition of principle and of purpose which be it seem to i more thrilling and more compelling than any of the many move voice with which the troubled air of the world be fill it be the voice of the russian people they be prostrate and all but helpless it would seem before the grim power of germany which have hitherto know no relenting and no pity their power apparently be shatter and yet their soul be not subservient they will not yield either in principle or in action their conception of what be right of what it be humane and honorable for they to accept have be state with a frankness a largeness of view a generosity of spirit and a universal human sympathy which must challenge the admiration of every friend of mankind and they have refuse to compound their ideal or desert other that they themselves may be safe they call to we to say what it be that we desire in what if in anything our purpose and our spirit differ from theirs and i believe that the people of the united states would wish i to respond with utter simplicity and frankness whether their present leader believe it or not it be our heartfelt desire and hope that some way may be open whereby we may be privileged to assist the people of russia to attain their utmost hope of liberty and order peace
 it will be our wish and purpose that the process of peace when they be begin shall be absolutely open and that they shall involve and permit henceforth no secret understanding of any kind the day of conquest and aggrandizement be go by so be also the day of secret covenant enter into in the interest of particular government and likely at some unlooke for moment to upset the peace of the world it be this happy fact now clear to the view of every public man whose thought do not still linger in an age that be dead and go which make it possible for every nation whose purpose be consistent with justice and the peace of the world to avow now or at any other time the object it have in view
 we enter this war because violation of right have occur which touch we to the quick and make the life of our own people impossible unless they be correct and the world secure once for all against their recurrence what we demand in this war therefore be nothing peculiar to ourselves it be that the world be make fit and safe to live in and particularly that it be make safe for every peace love nation which like our own wish to live its own life determine its own institution be assure of justice and fair dealing by the other people of the world as against force and selfish aggression all the people of the world be in effect partner in this interest and for our own part we see very clearly that unless justice be do to other it will not be do to we the program of the world&#39;s peace therefore be our program and that program the only possible program as we see it be this
 i. open covenant of peace openly arrive at after which there shall be no private international understanding of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view
 ii absolute freedom of navigation upon the sea outside territorial water alike in peace and in war except as the sea may be close in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenant
 iii the removal so far as possible of all economic barrier and the establishment of an equality of trade condition among all the nation consent to the peace and associate themselves for its maintenance
 iv adequate guarantee give and take that national armament will be reduce to the low point consistent with domestic safety
 v. a free open minded and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claim base upon a strict observance of the principle that in determine all such question of sovereignty the interest of the population concern must have equal weight with the equitable claim of the government whose title be to be determine
 vi the evacuation of all russian territory and such a settlement of all question affect russia as will secure the good and free cooperation of the other nation of the world in obtain for she an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political development and national policy and assure she of a sincere welcome into the society of free nation under institution of her own choosing and more than a welcome assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire the treatment accord russia by her sister nation in the month to come will be the acid test of their good will of their comprehension of her need as distinguish from their own interest and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy
 vii belgium the whole world will agree must be evacuate and restore without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoy in common with all other free nation no other single act will serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the nation in the law which they have themselves set and determine for the government of their relation with one another without this healing act the whole structure and validity of international law be forever impaired
 viii all french territory should be free and the invade portion restore and the wrong do to france by prussia in 1871 in the matter of alsace lorraine which have unsettle the peace of the world for nearly fifty year should be right in order that peace may once more be make secure in the interest of all
 ix a readjustment of the frontier of italy should be effect along clearly recognizable line of nationality
 x. the people of austria hungary whose place among the nation we wish to see safeguard and assure should be accord the free opportunity of autonomous development
 xi rumania serbia and montenegro should be evacuate occupy territory restore serbia accord free and secure access to the sea and the relation of the several balkan state to one another determine by friendly counsel along historically establish line of allegiance and nationality and international guarantee of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity of the several balkan state should be enter into
 xii the turkish portion of the present ottoman empire should be assure a secure sovereignty but the other nationality which be now under turkish rule should be assure an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development and the dardanelles should be permanently open as a free passage to the ship and commerce of all nation under international guarantee
 xiii an independent polish state should be erect which should include the territory inhabit by indisputably polish population which should be assure a free and secure access to the sea and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guarantee by international covenant
 xiv a general association of nation must be form under specific covenant for the purpose of afford mutual guarantee of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small state alike
 in regard to these essential rectification of wrong and assertion of right we feel ourselves to be intimate partner of all the government and people associate together against the imperialists we can not be separate in interest or divide in purpose we stand together until the end
 for such arrangement and covenant we be willing to fight and to continue to fight until they be achieve but only because we wish the right to prevail and desire a just and stable peace such as can be secure only by remove the chief provocation to war which this program do remove we have no jealousy of german greatness and there be nothing in this program that impair it we grudge she no achievement or distinction of learn or of pacific enterprise such as have make her record very bright and very enviable we do not wish to injure she or to block in any way her legitimate influence or power we do not wish to fight she either with arm or with hostile arrangement of trade if she be willing to associate herself with we and the other peace love nation of the world in covenant of justice and law and fair dealing we wish she only to accept a place of equality among the people of the world,&mdash;the new world in which we now live,&mdash;instead of a place of mastery
 neither do we presume to suggest to she any alteration or modification of her institution but it be necessary we must frankly say and necessary as a preliminary to any intelligent dealing with she on our part that we should know whom her spokesman speak for when they speak to we whether for the reichstag majority or for the military party and the man whose creed be imperial domination
 we have speak now surely in term too concrete to admit of any further doubt or question an evident principle run through the whole program i have outline it be the principle of justice to all people and nationality and their right to live on equal term of liberty and safety with one another whether they be strong or weak unless this principle be make its foundation no part of the structure of international justice can stand the people of the united states could act upon no other principle and to the vindication of this principle they be ready to devote their life their honor and everything that they possess the moral climax of this the culminating and final war for human liberty have come and they be ready to put their own strength their own high purpose their own integrity and devotion to the test

gentlemen of the congress the year that have elapse since i last stand before you to fulfil my constitutional duty to give to the congress from time to time information on the state of the union have be so crowded with great event great process and great result that i can not hope to give you an adequate picture of its transaction or of the far reach change which have be work of our nation and of the world you have yourself witness these thing as i have it be too soon to assess they and we who stand in the midst of they and be part of they be less qualified than man of another generation will be to say what they mean or even what they have be but some great outstanding fact be unmistakable and constitute in a sense part of the public business with which it be our duty to deal to state they be to set the stage for the legislative and executive action which must grow out of they and which we have yet to shape and determine a year ago we have send 145,918 man overseas since then we have send 1,950,513 an average of 162,542 each month the number in fact rise in may last to 245,951 in june to 278,760 in july to 307,182 and continue to reach similar figure in august and september in august 289,570 and in september 257,438 no such movement of troop ever take place before across three thousand mile of sea follow by adequate equipment and supply and carry safely through extraordinary danger of attack,-danger which be alike strange and infinitely difficult to guard against in all this movement only seven hundred and fifty eight man be lose by enemy attack six hundred and thirty of whom be upon a single english transport which be sink near the orkney islands i need not tell you what lie back of this great movement of man and material it be not invidious to say that back of it lie a support organization of the industry of the country and of all its productive activity more complete more thorough in method and effective in result more spirited and unanimous in purpose and effort than any other great belligerent have be able to effect we profit greatly by the experience of the nation which have already be engage for nearly three year in the exigent and exact business their every resource and every executive proficiency tax to the utmost we be their pupil but we learn quickly and act with a promptness and a readiness of cooperation that justify our great pride that we be able to serve the world with unparalleled energy and quick accomplishment but it be not the physical scale and executive efficiency of preparation supply equipment and despatch that i would dwell upon but the mettle and quality of the officer and man we send over and of the sailor who keep the sea and the spirit of the nation that stand behind they no soldier or sailor ever prove themselves more quickly ready for the test of battle or acquit themselves with more splendid courage and achievement when put to the test those of we who play some part in direct the great process by which the war be push irresistibly forward to the final triumph may now forget all that and delight our thought with the story of what our man do their officer understand the grim and exact task they have undertake and perform it with an audacity efficiency and unhesitate courage that touch the story of convoy and battle with imperishable distinction at every turn whether the enterprise be great or small -from their great chief pershing and sims down to the young lieutenant and their man be worthy of them,-such man as hardly need to be command and go to their terrible adventure blithely and with the quick intelligence of those who know just what it be they would accomplish i be proud to be the fellowcountryman of man of such stuff and valor those of we who stay at home do our duty the war could not have be win or the gallant man who fight it give their opportunity to win it otherwise but for many a long day we shall think ourselves accurs'd we be not there and hold our manhood cheap while any speak that fight with these at st. mihiel or thierry the memory of those day of triumphant battle will go with these fortunate man to their grave and each will have his favorite memory old man forget yet all shall be forget but he will remember with advantage what feat he do that day!"what we all thank god for with deep gratitude be that our man go in force into the line of battle just at the critical moment when the whole fate of the world seem to hang in the balance and throw their fresh strength into the rank of freedom in time to turn the whole tide and sweep of the fateful struggle,-turn it once for all so that thenceforth it be back back back for their enemy always back never again forward after that it be only a scant four month before the commander of the central empires know themselves beat and now their very empire be in liquidation!and throughout it all how fine the spirit of the nation be what unity of purpose what untiring zeal what elevation of purpose run through all its splendid display of strength its untiring accomplishment i have say that those of we who stay at home to do the work of organization and supply will always wish that we have be with the man whom we sustain by our labor but we can never be ashamed it have be an inspiring thing to be here in the midst of fine man who have turn aside from every private interest of their own and devote the whole of their train capacity to the task that supply the sinew of the whole great undertaking the patriotism the unselfishness the thoroughgoing devotion and distinguished capacity that mark their toilsome labor day after day month after month have make they fit mate and comrade of the man in the trench and on the sea and not the man here in washington only they have but direct the vast achievement throughout innumerable factory upon innumerable farm in the depth of coal mine and iron mine and copper mine wherever the stuff of industry be to be obtain and prepare in the shipyard on the railway at the dock on the sea in every labor that be need to sustain the battle line man have vie with each other to do their part and do it well they can look any man at arm in the face and say we also strove to win and give the good that be in we to make our fleet and army sure of their triumph!and what shall we say of the women,-of their instant intelligence quicken every task that they touch their capacity for organization and cooperation which give their action discipline and enhance the effectiveness of everything they attempt their aptitude at task to which they have never before set their hand their utter selfsacrifice alike in what they do and in what they give their contribution to the great result be beyond appraisal they have add a new lustre to the annal of american womanhood the least tribute we can pay they be to make they the equal of man in political right as they have prove themselves their equal in every field of practical work they have enter whether for themselves or for their country these great day of complete achievement would be sadly mar be we to omit that act of justice besides the immense practical service they have render the woman of the country have be the move spirit in the systematic economy by which our people have voluntarily assist to supply the suffer people of the world and the army upon every front with food and everything else that we have that might serve the common cause the detail of such a story can never be fully write but we carry they at our heart and thank god that we can say that we be the kinsman of such and now we be sure of the great triumph for which every sacrifice be make it have come come in its completeness and with the pride and inspiration of these day of achievement quick within we we turn to the task of peace again,-a peace secure against the violence of irresponsible monarch and ambitious military coterie and make ready for a new order for new foundation of justice and fair dealing we be about to give order and organization to this peace not only for ourselves but for the other people of the world as well so far as they will suffer we to serve they it be international justice that we seek not domestic safety merely our thought have dwelt of late upon europe upon asia upon the near and the far east very little upon the act of peace and accommodation that wait to be perform at our own door while we be adjust our relation with the rest of the world be it not of capital importance that we should clear away all ground of misunderstand with our immediate neighbor and give proof of the friendship we really feel i hope that the member of the senate will permit i to speak once more of the unratified treaty of friendship and adjustment with the republic of colombia i very earnestly urge upon they an early and favorable action upon that vital matter i believe that they will feel with i that the stage of affair be now set for such action as will be not only just but generous and in the spirit of the new age upon which we have so happily enter so far as our domestic affair be concern the problem of our return to peace be a problem of economic and industrial readjustment that problem be less serious for we than it may turn out too he for the nation which have suffer the disarrangement and the loss of war long than we our people moreover do not wait to be coach and lead they know their own business be quick and resourceful at every readjustment definite in purpose and self reliant in action any lead string we might seek to put they in would speedily become hopelessly tangle because they would pay no attention to they and go their own way all that we can do as their legislative and executive servant be to mediate the process of change here there and elsewhere as we may i have hear much counsel as to the plan that should be form and personally conduct to a happy consummation but from no quarter have i see any general scheme of reconstruction emerge which i think it likely we could force our spirited business man and self reliant laborer to accept with due pliancy and obedience while the war last we set up many agency by which to direct the industry of the country in the service it be necessary for they to render by which to make sure of an abundant supply of the material need by which to check undertaking that could for the time be dispense with and stimulate those that be most serviceable in war by which to gain for the purchase department of the government a certain control over the price of essential article and material by which to restrain trade with alien enemy make the most of the available shipping and systematize financial transaction both public and private so that there would be no unnecessary conflict or confusion,-by which in short to put every material energy of the country in harness to draw -the common load and make of we one team in the accomplishment of a great task but the moment we know the armistice to have be sign we take the harness off raw material upon which the government have keep its hand for fear there should not be enough for the industry that supply the army have be release and put into the general market again great industrial plant whose whole output and machinery have be take over for the use of the government have be set free to return to the use to which they be put before the war it have not be possible to remove so readily or so quickly the control of foodstuff and of shipping because the world have still to be feed from our granary and the ship be still need to send supply to our man overseas and to bring the man back as fast as the disturb condition on the other side of the water permit but even there restraint be be relax as much as possible and more and more as the week go bynever before have there be agency in existence in this country which know so much of the field of supply of labor and of industry as the war industries board the war trade board the labor department the food administration and the fuel administration have know since their labor become thoroughly systematize and they have not be isolate agency they have be direct by man who represent the permanent departments of the government and so have be the centre of unified and cooperative action it have be the policy of the executive therefore since the armistice be assure which be in effect a complete submission of the enemy to put the knowledge of these body at the disposal of the business man of the country and to offer their intelligent mediation at every point and in every matter where it be desire it be surprising how fast the process of return to a peace footing have move in the three week since the fighting stop it promise to outrun any inquiry that may be institute and any aid that may be offer it will not be easy to direct it any well than it will direct itself the american business man be of quick initiative the ordinary and normal process of private initiative will not however provide immediate employment for all of the man of our return army those who be of train capacity those who be skilled workman those who have acquire familiarity with established business those who be ready and willing to go to the farm all those whose aptitude be know or will be seek out by employer will find no difficulty it be safe to say in find place and employment but there will be other who will be at a loss where to gain a livelihood unless pain be take to guide they and put they in the way of work there will be a large float residuum of labor which should not be leave wholly to shift for itself it seem to i important therefore that the development of public work of every sort should be promptly resume in order that opportunity should be create for unskilled labor in particular and that plan should be make for such development of our unused land and our natural resource as we have hitherto lack stirnulation to undertake i particularly direct your attention to the very practical plan which the secretary of the interior have develop in his annual report and before your committees for the reclamation of arid swamp and cutover land which might if the states be willing and able to cooperate redeem some three hundred million acre of land for cultivation there be say to be fifteen or twenty million acre of land in the west at present arid for whose reclamation water be available if properly conserve there be about two hundred and thirty million acre from which the forest have be cut but which have never yet be clear for the plow and which lie waste and desolate these lie scatter all over the union and there be nearly eighty million acre of land that lie under swamp or subject to periodical overflow or too wet for anything but grazing which it be perfectly feasible to drain and protect and redeem the congress can at once direct thousand of the return soldier to the reclamation of the arid land which it have already undertake if it will but enlarge the plan and appropriation which it have entrust to the department of the interior it be possible in deal with our unused land to effect a great rural and agricultural development which will afford the good sort of opportunity to man who want to help themselves and the secretary of the interior have think the possible method out in a way which be worthy of your most friendly attention i have speak of the control which must yet for a while perhaps for a long long while be exercise over shipping because of the priority of service to which our force overseas be entitle and which should also be accord the shipment which be to save recently liberate people from starvation and many devasted region from permanent ruin may i not say a special word about the need of belgium and northern france no sum of money pay by way of indemnity will serve of themselves to save they from hopeless disadvantage for year to come something more must be do than merely find the money if they have money and raw material in abundance to morrow they could not resume their place in the industry of the world to morrow,-the very important place they hold before the flame of war sweep across they many of their factory be raze to the ground much of their machinery be destroy or have be take away their people be scatter and many of their good workman be dead their market will be take by other if they be not in some special way assist to rebuild their factory and replace their lose instrument of manufacture they should not be leave to the vicissitude of the sharp competition for material and for industrial facility which be now to set in i hope therefore that the congress will not be unwilling if it should become necessary to grant to some such agency as the war trade board the right to establish priority of export and supply for the benefit of these people whom we have be so happy to assist in save from the german terror and whom we must not now thoughtlessly leave to shift for themselves in a pitiless competitive market for the steadying and facilitation of our own domestic business readjustment nothing be more important than the immediate determination of the taxis that be to be levy for 1918 1919 and 1920 as much of the burden of taxation must be lift from business as sound method of finance the government will permit and those who conduct the great essential industry of the country must be tell as exactly as possible what obligation to the government they will be expect to meet in the year immediately ahead of they it will be of serious consequence to the country to delay remove all uncertainty in this matter a single day long than the right process of debate justify it be idle to talk of successful and confident business reconstruction before those uncertainty be resolve if the war have continue it would have be necessary to raise at least eight billion dollar by taxation payable in the year 1919 but the war have end and i agree with the secretary of the treasury that it will be safe to reduce the amount to six billion an immediate rapid decline in the expense of the government be not to be look for contract make for war supply will indeed be rapidly cancel and liquidate but their immediate liquidation will make heavy drain on the treasury for the month just ahead of we the maintenance of our force on the other side of the sea be still necessary a considerable proportion of those force must remain in europe during the period of occupation and those which be bring home will be transport and demobilize at heavy expense for month to come the interest on our war debt must of course be pay and provision make for the retirement of the obligation of the government which represent it but these demand will of course fall much below what a continuation of military operation would have entail and six billion should suffice to supply a sound foundation for the financial operation of the year i entirely concur with the secretary of the treasury in recommend that the two billion need in addition to the four billion provide by exist law be obtain from the profit which have accrue and shall accrue from war contract and distinctively war business but that these taxis be confine to the war profit accrue in 1918 or in 1919 from business originating in war contract i urge your acceptance of his recommendation that provision be make now not subsequently that the taxis to be pay in 1920 should be reduce from six to four billion any arrangement less definite than these would add element of doubt and confusion to the critical period of industrial readjustment through which the country must now immediately pass and which no true friend of the nation 's essential business interest can afford to be responsible for create or prolong clearly determined condition clearly and simply chart be indispensable to the economic revival and rapid industrial development which may confidently be expect if we act now andsweep all interrogation point away i take it for grant that the congress will carry out the naval programme which be undertake before we enter the war the secretary of the navy have submit to your committee for authorization that part of the programme which cover the building plan of the next three year these plan have be prepare along the line and in accordance with the policy which the congress establish not under the exceptional condition of the war but with the intention of adhere to a definite method of development for the navy i earnestly recommend the uninterrupted pursuit of that policy it would clearly be unwise for we to attempt to adjust our programme to a future world policy as yet undetermined the question which cause i the great concern be the question of the policy to be adopt towards the railroad i frankly turn to you for counsel upon it i have no confident judgment of my own i do not see how any thoughtful man can have who know anything of the complexity of the problem it be a problem which must be study study immediately and study without bias or prejudice nothing can be gain by become partisan of any particular plan of settlement it be necessary that the administration of the railway should be take over by the government so long as the war last it would have be impossible otherwise to establish and carry through under a single direction the necessary priority of shipment it would have be impossible otherwise to combine maximum production at the factory and mine and farm with the maximum possible car supply to take the product to the port and market impossible to route troop shipment and freight shipment without regard to the advantage or disadvantage of the road employ impossible to subordinate when necessary all question of convenience to the public necessity impossible to give the necessary financial support to the road from the public treasury but all these necessity have now be serve and the question be what be good for the railroad and for the public in the future?exceptional circumstance and exceptional method of administration be not need to convince we that the railroad be not equal to the immense task of transportation impose upon they by the rapid and continuous development of the industry of the country we know that already and we know that they be unequal to it partly because their full cooperation be render impossible by law and their competition make obligatory so that it have be impossible to assign to they severally the traffic which could well be carry by their respective line in the interest of expedition and national economy we may hope i believe for the formal conclusion of the war by treaty by the time spring have come the twentyone month to which the present control of the railway be limited after formal proclamation of peace shall have be make will run at the farth i take it for grant only to the january of 1921 the full equipment of the railway which the federal administration have plan could not be complete within any such period the present law do not permit the use of the revenue of the several road for the execution of such plan except by formal contract with their director some of whom will consent while some will not and therefore do not afford sufficient authority to undertake improvement upon the scale upon which it would be necessary to undertake they every approach to this difficult subject matter of decision bring we face to face therefore with this unanswered question what be it right that we should do with the railroad in the interest of the public and in fairness to their owners?let i say at once that i have no answer ready the only thing that be perfectly clear to i be that it be not fair either to the public or to the owner of the railroad to leave the question unanswered and that it will presently become my duty to relinquish control of the road even before the expiration of the statutory period unless there should appear some clear prospect in the meantime of a legislative solution their release would at least produce one element of a solution namely certainty and a quick stimulation of private initiative i believe that it will be serviceable for i to set forth as explicitly as possible the alternative course that lie open to our choice we can simply release the road and go back to the old condition of private management unrestricted competition and multiform regulation by both state and federal authority or we can go to the opposite extreme and establish complete government control accompany if necessary by actual government ownership or we can adopt an intermediate course of modify private control under a more unified and affirmative public regulation and under such alteration of the law as will permit wasteful competition to be avoid and a considerable degree of unification of administration to be effect as for example by regional corporation under which the railway of definable area would be in effect combine in single system the one conclusion that i be ready to state with confidence be that it would be a disservice alike to the country and to the owner of the railroad to return to the old condition unmodifie those be condition of restraint without development there be nothing affirmative or helpful about they what the country chiefly need be that all its mean of transportation should be develop its railway its waterway its highway and its countryside road some new element of policy therefore be absolutely necessary necessary for the service of the public necessary for the release of credit to those who be administer the railway necessary for the protection of their security holder the old policy may be change much or little but surely it can not wisely be leave as it be i hope that the congress will have a complete and impartial study of the whole problem institute at once and prosecute as rapidly as possible i stand ready and anxious to release the road from the present control and i must do so at a very early date if by wait until the statutory limit of time be reach i shall be merely prolong the period of doubt and uncertainty which be hurtful to every interest concern i welcome this occasion to announce to the congress my purpose to join in paris the representative of the government with which we have be associate in the war against the central empires for the purpose of discuss with they the main feature of the treaty of peace i realize the great inconvenience that will attend my leave the country particularly at this time but the conclusion that it be my paramount duty to go have be force upon i by consideration which i hope will seem as conclusive to you as they have seem to i the allied government have accept the basis of peace which i outline to the congress on the eighth of january last as the central empires also have and very reasonably desire my personal counsel in their interpretation and application and it be highly desirable that i should give it in order that the sincere desire of our government to contribute without selfish purpose of any kind to settlement that will be of common benefit to all the nation concern may be make fully manifest the peace settlement which be now to be agree upon be of transcendent importance both to we and to the rest of the world and i know of no business or interest which should take precedence of they the gallant man of our armed force on land and sea have consciously fight for the ideal which they know to be the ideal of their country i have seek to express those ideal they have accept my statement of they as the substance of their own thought and purpose as the associated government have accept they i owe it to they to see to it so far as in i lie that no false or mistaken interpretation be put upon they and no possible effort omit to realize they it be now my duty to play my full part in make good what they offer their life 's blood to obtain i can think of no call to service which could transcend this i shall be in close touch with you and with affair on this side the water and you will know all that i do at my request the french and english government have absolutely remove the censorship of cable news which until within a fortnight they have maintain and there be now no censorship whatever exercise at this end except upon attempt trade communication with enemy country it have be necessary to keep an open wire constantly available between paris and the department of state and another between france and the department of war in order that this might be do with the least possible interference with the other use of the cable i have temporarily take over the control of both cable in order that they may be use as a single system i do so at the advice of the most experienced cable official and i hope that the result will justify my hope that the news of the next few month may pass with the utmost freedom and with the least possible delay from each side of the sea to the other may i not hope gentlemen of the congress that in the delicate task i shall have to perform on the other side of the sea in my effort truly and faithfully to interpret the principle and purpose of the country we love i may have the encouragement and the add strength of your united support i realize the magnitude and difficulty of the duty i be undertake i be poignantly aware of its grave responsibility i be the servant of the nation i can have no private thought or purpose of my own in perform such an errand i go to give the good that be in i to the common settlement which i must now assist in arrive at in conference with the other work head of the associated government i shall count upon your friendly countenance and encouragement i shall not be inaccessible the cable and the wireless will render i available for any counsel or service you may desire of i and i shall be happy in the thought that i be constantly in touch with the weighty matter of domestic policy with which we shall have to deal i shall make my absence as brief as possible and shall hope to return with the happy assurance that it have be possible to translate into action the great ideal for which america have strive
nationality be the call of the heart of liberated people and the dream of those to whom freedom become an undying cause it be the guide light the psalm the prayer the confirmation for our own people although we be never assure indivisible union until the civil war be fight can any red blooded american consent now when we have come to understand its priceless value to merge our nationality into internationality merely because brotherhood and fraternity and fellowship and peace be soothe and appeal term

 out of the ferment the turmoil the debt and echo sorrow out of the appalling waste and far reach disorder out of the threat against orderly government and the assault on our present day civilization i think sir i can see the opening way for america we must preserve the inheritance and cle to just government we do not need and we do not mean to live within and for ourselves alone but we do mean to hold our ideal safe from foreign incursion we have command respect and confidence command they in the friendship and the association of peace command they in the conflict and comradeship of war it be easily possible to hold the world 's high estimate through righteous relationship if our ideal of civilization be the good in the world and i proudly believe that they be

 then we ought to send the american torch bearer lead on to fulfillment america aid in save civilization americans will not fail civilization in the deliberate advancement of peace we be willing to give but we resent demand i do not believe senators that it be go to break the heart of the world to make this covenant right or at least free it from peril which would endanger our own independence but it be well to witness this rhetorical tragedy than to destroy the soul of this great republic

 it be a very alluring thing senator to do what the world have never do before no republic have ever permanently survive they have flash illumine and advance the world and then fade or crumble i want to be a contributor to the abide republic none of we today can be sure that it shall abide for generation to come but we may hold it unshaken for our day and pass it on to the next generation preserve in its integrity this be the unending call of duty to man of every civilization it be distinctly the american call to duty to every man who believe we have come the near to dependable popular government the world have yet witness

 let we have our america walk erect unafraid concerned about its right and ready to defend they proud of its citizen and commit to defend they and sure of its ideal and strong to support they we be a hundred million or more today and if the miracle of the first century of national life may be repeat in the second the million of today will be the myriad of the future i like to think sir that out of the discover soul of the republic and through our preservative action in this supreme moment of human progress we shall hold the word american the proud boast of citizenship in all the world

to the senate and house of representatives i sincerely regret that i can not be present at the opening of this session of the congress i be thus prevent from present in as direct a way as i could wish the many question that be press for solution at this time happily i have have the advantage of the advice of the head of the several executive department who have keep in close touch with affair in their detail and whose thoughtful recommendation i earnestly second in the matter of the railroad and the readjustment of their affair grow out of federal control i shall take the liberty at a later date of address you i hope that congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legislation look to the establishment of a budget system that there should be one single authority responsible for the making of all appropriation and that appropriation should be make not independently of each other but with reference to one single comprehensive plan of expenditure properly relate to the nation 's income there can be no doubti believe the burden of prepare the budget must in the nature of the case if the work be to be properly do and responsibility concentrate instead of divided rest upon the executive the budget so prepared should be submit to and approve or amend by a single committee of each house of congress and no single appropriation should be make by the congress except such as may have be include in the budget prepare by the executive or add by the particular committee of congress charge with the budget legislation another and not less important aspect of the problem be the ascertainment of the economy and efficiency with which the money appropriate be expend under exist law the only audit be for the purpose of ascertain whether expenditure have be lawfully make within the appropriation no one be authorize or equip to ascertain whether the money have be spend wisely economically and effectively the auditor should be highly train official with permanent tenure in the treasury department free of obligation to or motive of consideration for this or any subsequent administration and authorize and empower to examine into and make report upon the method employ and the result obtain by the executive department of the government their report should be make to the congress and to the secretary of the treasury i trust that the congress will give its immediate consideration to the problem of future taxation simplification of the income and profit taxis have become an immediate necessity these taxis perform indispensable service during the war they must however be simplify not only to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense but in order that his liability may be make certain and definite with reference to the detail of the revenue law the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of internal revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amendment necessary or desirable in connection with the administration of the law recommendation which have my approval and support it be of the utmost importance that in deal with this matter the present law should not be disturb so far as regard taxis for the calendar year 1920 payable in the calendar year 1921 the congress might well consider whether the high rate of income and profit taxis can in peace time be effectively productive of revenue and whether they may not on the contrary be destructive of business activity and productive of waste and inefficiency there be a point at which in peace time high rate of income and profit taxis discourage energy remove the incentive to new enterprise encourage extravagant expenditure and produce industrial stagnation with consequent unemployment and other attendant evil the problem be not an easy one a fundamental change have take place with reference to the position of america in the world 's affair the prejudice and passion engender by decade of controversy between two school of political and economic thought,-the one believer in protection of american industry the other believer in tariff for revenue only,-must be sbordinate to the single consideration of the public interest in the light of utterly change condition before the war america be heavily the debtor of the rest of the world and the interest payment she have to make to foreign country on american security hold abroad the expenditure of american traveler abroad and the ocean freight charge she have to pay to other about balance the value of her pre war favorable balance of trade during the war america 's export nave be greatly stimulate and increase price have increase their value on the other hand she have purchase a large proportion of the american security previously hold abroad have loan some $ 9,000,000,000 to foreign government and have build her own ship our favorable balance of trade have thus be greatly increase and europe have be deprive of the mean of meet it heretofore exist europe can have only three way of meet the favorable balance of trade in peace time by import into this country of gold or of good or by establish new credit europe be in no position at the present time to ship gold to we nor could we contemplate large further import of gold into this country without concern the time have nearly pass for international governmental loan and it will take time to develop in this country a market for foreign security anything therefore which would tend to prevent foreign country from settle for our export by shipment of good into this country could only have the effect of prevent they from pay for our export and therefore of prevent the export from be make the productivity of the country greatly stimulate by the war must find an outlet by export to foreign country and any measure take to prevent import will inevitably curtail export force curtailment of production load the banking machinery of the country with credit to carry unsold product and produce industrial stagnation and unemployment if we want to sell we must be prepare to buy whatever therefore may have be our view during the period of growth of american business concern tariff legislation we must now adjust our own economic life to a change condition grow out of the fact that american business be full grown and that america be the great capitalist in the world no policy of isolation will satisfy the grow need and opportunity of america the provincial standard and policy of the past which have hold american business as if in a strait jacket must yield and give way to the need and exigency of the new day in which we live a day full of hope and promise for american business if we will but take advantage of the opportunity that be ours for the asking the recent war have end our isolation and throw upon we a great duty and responsibility the united states must share the expand world market the united states desire for itself only equal opportunity with the other nation of the world and that through the process of friendly cooperation and fair competition the legitimate interest of the nation concern may be successfully and equitably adjust there be other matter of importance upon which i urge action at the last session of congress which be still press for solution i be sure it be not necessary for i again to remind you -that there be one immediate and very practicable question result from the war which we should meet in the most liberal spirit it be a matter of recognition and relief to our soldier i can do no well than to quote from my last message urge this very action:"we must see to it that our return soldier be assist in every practicable way to find the place for which they be fit in the daily work of the country this can be do by develop and maintain upon an adequate scale the admirable organization create by the department of labor for place man seek work and it can also be do in at least one very great field by create new opportunity for individual enterprise the secretary of the interior have point out the way by which return soldier may be help to find and take up land in the hitherto undeveloped region of the country which the federal government have already prepare or can readily prepare for cultivation and also on many of the cutover or neglect area which lie within the limit of the old state and i once more take the liberty of recommend very urgently that his plan shall receive the immediate and substantial support of the congress "in the matter of tariff legislation i beg to call your attention to the statement contain in my last message urge legislation with reference to the establishment of the chemical and dyestuff industry in america:"among the industry to which special consideration should be give be that of the manufacture of dyestuff and related chemical our complete dependence upon german supply before the war make the interruption of trade a cause of exceptional economic disturbance the close relation between the manufacture of dyestuff on the one hand and of explosive and poisonous gas on the other moreover have give the industry an exceptional significance and value although the united states will gladly and unhesitatingly join in the programme of international disarmament it will nevertheless be a policy of obvious prudence to make certain of the successful maintenance of many strong and well equip chemical plant the german chemical industry with which we will be bring into competition be -and may well be again a thoroughly knit monopoly capable of exercise a competition of a peculiarly insidious and dangerous kind "dure the war the farmer perform a vital and willing service to the nation by materially increase the production of his land he supply america and the allies with the increase amount of food necessary to keep their immense army in the field he indispensably help to win the war but there be now scarcely less need of increase the production in food -and the necessary of life i ask the congress to consider mean of encourage effort along these line the importance of do everything possible to promote production along economical line to improve marketing and to make rural life more attractive and healthful be obvious i would urge approval of the plan already propose to the congress by the secretary of agriculture to secure the essential fact require for the proper study of this question through the propose enlarge programme for farm management study and crop estimate i would urge also the continuance of federal participation in the building of good road under the term of exist law and under the direction of present agency the need of further action on the part of the states and the federal government to preserve and develop our forest resource especially through the practice of well forestry method on private holding and the extension of the publicly own forest well support for country school and the more definite direction of their course of study along line relate to rural problem and full provision for sanitation in rural district and the building up of need hospital and medical facility in these locality perhaps the way might be clear for many of these desirable reform by a fresh comprehensive survey make of rural condition by a conference compose of representative of the farmer and of the agricultural agency responsible for leadership i would call your attention to the widespread condition of political restlessness in our body politic the cause of this unrest while various and complicated be superficial rather than deep seat broadly they arise from or be connect with the failure on the part of our government to arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace permit return to normal condition from the transfusion of radical theory from seethe european center pende such delay from heartless profiteering result in the increase of the cost of living and lastly from the machination of passionate and malevolent agitator with the return to normal condition this unrest will rapidly disappear in the meantime it do much evil it seem to i that in deal with this situation congress should not be impatient or drastic but should seek rather to remove the cause it should endeavor to bring our country back speedily to a peace basis with ameliorate living condition under the minimum of restriction upon personal liberty that be consistent with our reconstruction problem and it should arm the federal government with power to deal in its criminal court with those person who by violent method would abrogate our time test institution with the free expression of opinion and with the advocacy of orderly political change however fundamental there must be no interference but towards passion and malevolence tendine to incite crime and insurrection under guise of political evolution there should be no leniency legislation to this end have be recommend by the attorney general and should be enact in this direct connection i would call your attention to my recommendation on august 8th point out legislative measure which wouldbe effective in control and bring down the present cost of living which contribute so largely to this unrest on only one of these recommendation have the congress act if the government 's campaign be to be effective it be necessary that the other step suggest should be act on at once i renew and strongly urge the necessity of the extension of the present food control act as to the period of time in which it shall remain in operation the attorney general have submit a bill provide for an extension of this act for a period of six month as it now stand it be limit in operation to the period of the war and become inoperative upon the formal proclamation of peace it be imperative that it should be extend at once the department of justice have build up extensive machinery for the purpose of enforce its provision all of which must be abandon upon the conclusion of peace unless the provision of this act be extend during this period the congress will have an opportunity to make similar permanent provision and regulation with regard to all good destine for interstate commerce and to exclude they from interstate shipment if the requirement of the law be not compile with some such regulation be imperatively necessary the abuse that have grow up in the manipulation of price by the withholding of foodstuff and other necessary of life can not otherwise be effectively prevent there can be no doubt of either the necessity of the legitimacy of such measure as i point out in my last message publicity can accomplish a great deal in this campaign the aim of the government must be clearly bring to the attention of the consume public civic organization and state official who be in a position to lend their assistance to our effort you have make available fund with which to carry on this campaign but there be no provision in the law authorize their expenditure for the purpose of make the public fully inform about the effort of the government specific recommendation have be make by the attorney general in this regard i would strongly urge upon you its immediate adoption as it constitute one of the preliminary step to this campaign i also renew my recommendation that the congress pass a law regulate cold storage as it be regulate for example by the law of the state of new jersey which limit the time during which good may be keep in storage prescribe the method of dispose of they if keep beyond the permit period and require that good release from storage shall in all case bear the date of their receipt it would materially add to the serviceability of the law for the purpose we now have in view if it be also prescribe that all good release from storage for interstate shipment should have plainly mark upon each package the selling or market price at which they go into storage by this mean the purchaser would always be able to learn what profit stand between he and the producer or the wholesale dealer i would also renew my recommendation that all good destine for interstate commerce should in every case where their form or package make it possible be plainly mark with the price at which they leave the hand of the producer we should formulate a law require a federal license of all corporation engage in interstate commerce and embody in the license or in the condition under which it be to be issue specific regulation design to secure competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profit in the method of marketing such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much need reform in the business of interstate shipment and in the method of corporation which be engage in it but for the moment i confine my recommendation to the object immediately in hand which be to lower the cost of living no one who have observe the march of event in the last year can fail to note the absolute need of a definite programme to bring about an improvement in the condition of labor there can be no settle condition lead to increase production and a reduction in the cost of live if labor and capital be to be antagonist instead of partner sound think and an honest desire to serve the interest of the whole nation as distinguish from the interest of a class must be apply to the solution of this great and press problem the failure of other nation to consider this matter in a vigorous way have produce bitterness and jealousy and antagonism the food of radicalism the only way to keep man from agitate against grievance be to remove the grievance an unwillingness even to discuss these matter produce only dissatisfaction and give comfort to the extreme element in our country which endeavor to stir up disturbance in order to provoke government to embark upon a course of retaliation and repression the seed of revolution be repression the remedy for these thing must not be negative in character it must be constructive it must comprehend the general interest the real antidote for the unrest which manifest itself be not suppression but a deep consideration of the wrong that beset our national life and the application of a remedy congress have already show its willingness to deal with these industrial wrong by establish the eight hour day as the standard in every field of labor it have seek to find a way to prevent child labor it have serve the whole country by lead the way in develop the mean of preserve and safeguard life and health in dangerous industry it must now help in the difficult task of find a method that will bring about a genuine democratization of industry base upon the full recognition of the right of those who work in whatever rank to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly affect their welfare it be with this purpose in mind that i call a conference to meet in washington on december 1st to consider these problem in all their broad aspect with the idea of bring about a well understanding between these two interest the great unrest throughout the world out of which have emerge a demand for an immediate consideration of the difficulty between capital and labor bid we put our own house in order frankly there can be no permanent and lasting settlement between capital and labor which do not recognize the fundamental concept for which labor have be struggle through the year the whole world give its recognition and endorsement to these fundamental purpose in the league of nations the statesman gather at versailles recognize the fact that world stability could not be have by revert to industrial standard and condition against which the average workman of the world have revolt it be therefore the task of the statesman of this new day of change and readjustment to recognize world condition and to seek to bring about through legislation condition that will mean the ending of age long antagonism between capital and labor and that will hopefully lead to the building up of a comradeship which will result not only in great contentment among the mass of workman but also bring about a great production and a great prosperity to business itself to analyze the particular in the demand of labor be to admit the justice of their complaint in many matter that lie at their basis the workman demand an adequate wage sufficient to permit he to live in comfort unhampere by the fear of poverty and want in his old age he demand the right to live and the right to work amidst sanitary surrounding both in home and in workshop surrounding that develop and do not retard his own health and wellbeing and the right to provide for his child 's want in the matter of health and education in other word it be his desire to make the condition of his life and the life of those dear to he tolerable and easy to bear the establishment of the principle regard labor lay down in the covenant of the league of nations offer we the way to industrial peace and conciliation no other road lie open to we not to pursue this one be long to invite enmity bitterness and antagonism which in the end only lead to industrial and social disaster the unwilling workman be not a profitable servant an employee whose industrial life be hedge about by hard and unjust condition which he do not create and over which he have no control lack that fine spirit of enthusiasm and volunteer effort which be the necessary ingredient of a great produce entity let we be frank about this solemn matter the evidence of world wide unrest which manifest themselves in violence throughout the world bid we pause and consider the mean to be find to stop the spread of this contagious thing before it sap the very vitality of the nation itself do we gain strength by withhold the remedy or be it not the business of statesman to treat these manifestation of unrest which meet we on every hand as evidence of an economic disorder and to apply constructive remedy wherever necessary be sure that in the application of the remedy we touch not the vital tissue of our industrial and economic life there can be no recession of the tide of unrest until constructive instrumentality be set up to stem that tide government must recognize the right of man collectively to bargain for humane object that have at their base the mutual protection and welfare of those engage in all industry labor must not be long treat as a commodity it must be regard as the activity of human being possess of deep yearning and desire the busi ness man give his good thought to the repair and replenishment of his machinery so that its usefulness will not be impair and its power to produce may always be at its height and keep in full vigor and motion no less regard ought to be pay to the human machine which after all propel the machinery of the world and be the great dynamic force that lie back of all industry and progress return to the old standard of wage and industry in employment be unthinkable the terrible tragedy of war which have just end and which have bring the world to the verge of chaos and disaster would be in vain if there should ensue a return to the condition of the past europe itself whence have come the unrest which now hold the world at bay be an example of standpatism in these vital human matter which america might well accept as an example not to be follow but studiously to be avoid europe make labor the differential and the price of it all be enmity and antagonism and prostrate industry the right of labor to live in peace and comfort must be recognize by government and america should be the first to lay the foundation stone upon which industrial peace shall be build labor not only be entitle to an adequate wage but capital should receive a reasonable return upon its investment and be entitle to protection at the hand of the government in every emergency no government worthy of the name can play these element against each other for there be a mutuality of interest between they which the government must seek to express and to safeguard at all cost the right of individual to strike be inviolate and ought not to be interfere with by any process of government but there be a predominant right and that be the right of the government to protect all of its people and to assert its power and majesty against the challenge of any class the government when it assert that right seek not to antagonize a class but simply to defend the right of the whole people as against the irreparable harm and injury that might be do by the attempt by any class to usurp a power that only government itself have a right to exercise as a protection to all in the matter of international dispute which have lead to war statesman have seek to set up as a remedy arbitration for war do this not point the way for the settlement of industrial dispute by the establishment of a tribunal fair and just alike to all which will settle industrial dispute which in the past have lead to war and disaster america witness the evil consequence which have follow out of such dispute between these contending force must not admit itself impotent to deal with these matter by mean of peaceful process surely there must be some method of bring together in a council of peace and amity these two great interest out of which will come a happy day of peace and cooperation a day that will make man more hopeful and enthusiastic in their various task that will make for more comfort and happiness in living and a more tolerable condition among all class of man certainly human intelligence can devise some acceptable tribunal for adjust the difference between capital and labor this be the hour of test and trial for america by her prowess and strength and the indomitable courage of her soldier she demonstrate her power to vindicate on foreign battlefield her conception of liberty and justice let not her influence as a mediator between capital and labor be weaken and her own failure to settle matter of purely domestic concern be proclaim to the world there be those in this country who threaten direct action to force their will upon a majority russia today with its blood and terror be a painful object lesson of the power of minority it make little difference what minority it be whether capital or labor or any other class no sort of privilege will ever be permit to dominate this country we be a partnership or nothing that be worth while we be a democracy where the majority be the master or all the hope and purpose of the man who found this government have be defeat and forget in america there be but one way by which great reform can be accomplish and the relief seek by class obtain and that be through the orderly process of representative government those who would propose any other method of reform be enemy of this country america will not be daunt by threat nor lose her composure or calmness in these distressing time we can afford in the midst of this day of passion and unrest to be self contained and sure the instrument of all reform in america be the ballot the road to economic and social reform in america be the straight road of justice to all class and condition of man man have but to follow this road to realize the full fruition of their object and purpose let those beware who would take the short road of disorder and revolution the right road be the road of justice and orderly process
my countryman the first flame torch of americanism be light in frame the federal constitution in 1787 the pilgrim sign their simple and majestic covenant a full century and a half before and set aflame their beacon of liberty on the coast of massachusetts other pioneer of new world 's freedom be rear their new standard of liberty from jamestown to plymouth for five generation before lexington and concord herald the new era it be all american in the destine result yet all of it lack the soul of nationality

 in simple truth there be no thought of nationality in the revolution for american independence the colonist be resist a wrong and freedom be their solace once it be achieve nationality be the only agency suit to its preservation americanism really begin when robe in nationality the american republic begin the blaze trail of representative popular government representative democracy be proclaim the safe agency of high human freedom america head the forward procession of civil human and religious liberty which ultimately will affect the liberation of all mankind the federal constitution be the very base of all americanism the ark of the covenant of american liberty the very temple of equal right the constitution do abide and ever will so long as the republic survive

 let we hesitate before we surrender the nationality which be the very soul of high americanism this republic have never fail humanity or endangered civilization we have be tardy sometimes like when we be proclaim democracy and neutrality and yet ignore our national right but the ultimate and helpful part we play in the great war will be the pride of americans so long as the world recite the story we do not mean to hold aloof we choose no isolation we shun no duty i like to rejoice in an american conscience and in a big conception of our obligation to liberty justice and civilization aye and more i like to think of columbia 's help hand to new republic which be seek the blessing portray in our example but i have a confidence in our america that require no council of foreign power to point the way of american duty we wish to counsel cooperate and contribute but we arrogate to ourselves the keeping of the american conscience and every concept of our moral obligation

 it be time to idealize but it be very practical to make sure our own house be in perfect order before we attempt the miracle of old world stabilization call it selfishness of nationality if you will i think it an inspiration to patriotic devotion-- to safeguard america first to stabilize america first to prosper america first to think of america first to exalt america first to live for and revere america first

 let the internationalist dream and the bolshevist destroy god pity he for whom no minstrel rapture swell in the spirit of the republic we proclaim americanism and acclaim america

my countryman there be not anything the matter with the world 's civilization except that humanity be view it through a vision impair in a cataclysmal war poise have be disturb and nerve have be wrack and fever have render man irrational sometimes there have be draught upon the dangerous cup of barbarity man have wander far from safe path but the human procession still march in the right direction here in the united states we feel the reflex rather than the hurt wound itself but we still think straight and we mean to act straight we mean to hold firmly to all that be ours when war involve we and seek the high attainment which be the only compensation that so supreme a tragedy may give mankind

 america 's present need be not heroic but healing not nostrum but normalcy not revolution but restoration not agitation but adjustment not surgery but serenity not the dramatic but the dispassionate not experiment but equipoise not submergence in internationality but sustainment in triumphant nationality it be one thing to battle successfully against the world 's domination by a military autocracy because the infinite god never intend such a program but it be quite another thing to revise human nature and suspend the fundamental law of life and all of life 's requirement

 the world call for peace america demand peace formal as well as actual and mean to have it so we may set our own house in order we challenge the proposal that an armed autocrat should dominate the world and we choose for ourselves to cling to the representative democracy which make we what we be

 this republic have its ample task if we put an end to false economic which lure humanity to utter chaos our will be the command example of world leadership today if we can prove a representative popular government under which the citizenship seek what it may do for the government and country rather than what the country may do for individual we shall do more to make democracy safe for the world than all armed conflict ever record

 the world need to be remind that all human ill be not curable by legislation and that quantity of statutory enactment and excess of government offer no substitute for quality of citizenship the problem of maintain civilization be not to be solve by a transfer of responsibility from citizenship to government and no eminent page in history be ever draft to the standard of mediocrity nor no government worthy of the name which be direct by influence on the one hand or move by intimidation on the other my good judgement of america 's need be to steady down to get squarely on our foot to make sure of the right path let us get out of the fevere delirium of war with the hallucination that all the money in the world be to be make in the madness of war and the wildness of its aftermath let we stop to consider that tranquility at home be more precious than peace abroad and that both our good fortune and our eminence be dependent on the normal forward stride of all the american people we want to go on secure and unafraid hold fast to the american inheritance and confident of the supreme american fulfillment

chairman lodge members of the notification committee members of the national committee ladies and gentlemen
 the message which you have formally convey bring to i a realization of responsibility which be not underestimate it be a supreme task to interpret the covenant of a great political party the activity of which be so weave into the history of this republic and a very sacred and solemn undertaking to utter the faith and aspiration of the many million who adhere to that party the party platform have chart the way yet somehow we have come to expect that interpretation which voice the faith of nominee who must assume specific task
 let i be understand clearly from the very beginning i believe in party sponsorship in government i believe in party government as distinguish from personal government individual dictatorial autocratic or what not in a citizenship of more than a hundred million it be impossible to reach agreement upon all question party be form by those who reach a consensus of opinion it be the intent of the found father to give to this republic a dependable and endure popular government representative in form and it be design to make political party not only the preserve sponsor but the effective agency through which hope and aspiration and conviction and conscience may be translate into public performance
 popular government have be an inspiration of liberty since the dawn of civilization republic have rise and fall and a transition from party to personal government have precede every failure since the world begin under the constitution we have the charted way to security and perpetuity we know it give to we the safe path to a develop eminence which no people in the world ever rival it have guarantee the rule of intelligent deliberate public opinion express through party under this plan a masterful leadership becomingly may manifest its influence but a people&#39; will still remain the supreme authority
 the american achievement under the plan of the father be nowhere dispute on the contrary the american example have be the model of every republic which glorify the progress of liberty and be everywhere the leaven of representative democracy which have expand human freedom it have be work through party government
 no man be big enough to run this great republic there never have be one such domination be never intend tranquillity stability dependability&mdash;all be assure in party sponsorship and we mean to renew the assurance which be render in the cataclysmal war
 it be not surprising that we go far afield from safe and prescribed path amid the war anxiety there be the unfortunate tendency before there be the surrender of congress to the grow assumption of the executive before the world war imperille all the practice we have learn to believe in and in the war emergency every safeguard be sweep away in the name of democracy we establish autocracy we be not complain at this extraordinary bestowal or assumption in war it seem temporarily necessary our alarm be over the failure to restore the constitutional method when the war emergency end
 our first committal be the restoration of representative popular government under the constitution through the agency of the republican party our vision include more than a chief executive we believe in a cabinet of high capacity equal to the responsibility which our system contemplate in whose council the vice president second official of the republic shall be ask to participate the same vision include a cordial understanding and coordinated activity with a house of congress fresh from the people voice the conviction which member bring from direct contact with the electorate and cordial co operation along with the restore function of the senate fit to be the great deliberative body of the world its member be the designate sentinel on the tower of constitutional government the resumption of the senate&#39;s authority save to this republic its independent nationality when autocracy misinterpret the dream of a world experiment to be the vision of a world ideal
 it be not difficult chairman lodge to make ourselves clear on the question of international relationship we republicans of the senate conscious of our solemn oath and mindful of our constitutional obligation when we see the structure of a world super government take visionary form join in a becoming warn of our devotion to this republic if the torch of constitutionalism have not be dim the delay peace of the world and the tragedy of disappointment and europe&#39;s misunderstanding of america easily might have be avoid the republicans of the senate halt the barter of independent american eminence and influence which it be propose to exchange for an obscure and unequal place in the merged government of the world our party mean to hold the heritage of american nationality unimpaire and unsurrendered
 the world will not misconstrue we do not mean to hold aloof we do not mean to shun a single responsibility of this republic to world civilization there be no hate in the american heart we have no envy no suspicion no aversion for any people in the world we hold to our right and mean to defend aye we mean to sustain the right of this nation and our citizen alike everywhere under the shine sun yet there be the concord of amity and sympathy and fraternity in every resolution there be a genuine aspiration in every american breast for a tranquil friendship with all the world
 more we believe the unspeakable sorrow the immeasurable sacrifice the awakened conviction and the aspire conscience of human kind must commit the nation of the earth to a new and well relationship it need not be discuss now what motive plunge the world into war it need not be inquire whether we ask the son of this republic to defend our national right as i believe we do or to purge the old world of the accumulate ill of rivalry and greed the sacrifice will be in vain if we can not acclaim a new order with add security to civilization and peace maintain
 one may readily sense the conscience of our america i be sure i understand the purpose of the dominant group of the senate we be not seek to defeat a world aspiration we be resolve to safeguard america we be resolve then even as we be today and will be tomorrow to preserve this free and independent republic let those now responsible or seek responsibility propose the surrender whether with interpretation apology or reluctant reservations&mdash from which our right be to be omitted&mdash;we welcome the referendum to the american people on the preservation of america and the republican party pledge its defense of the preserve inheritance of national freedom
 in the call of the conscience of america be peace peace that close the gape wound of world war and silence the impassioned voice of international envy and distrust heed this call and knowing as i do the disposition of congress i promise you formal and effective peace so quickly as a republican congress can pass its declaration for a republican executive to sign then we may turn to our readjustment at home and proceed deliberately and reflectively to that hope for world relationship which shall satisfy both conscience and aspiration and still hold we free from menacing involvement
 i can hear in the call of conscience an insistent voice for the largely reduce armament throughout the world with attend reduction of burden upon peace love humanity we wish to give of american influence and example we must give of american leadership to that invaluable accomplishment
 i can speak unreservedly of the american aspiration and the republican committal for an association of nation co operate in sublime accord to attain and preserve peace through justice rather than force determine to add to security through international law so clarify that no misconstruction can be possible without affront world honor
 this republic can never be unmindful of its power and must never forget the force of its example possessor of might that admit no fear america must stand foremost for the right if the mistaken voice of america speak in unheede haste lead europe in the hour of deep anxiety into a military alliance which menace peace and threaten all freedom instead of add to their security then we must speak the truth for america and express our hope for the fraternize conscience of nation
 it will avail nothing to discuss in detail the league covenant which be conceive for world super government negotiate in misunderstanding and intolerantly urge and demand by its administration sponsor who resist every effort to safeguard america and who finally reject it when such safeguard be insert if the supreme blunder have leave european relationship inextricably interweave in the league compact our sympathy for europe only magnify our own good fortune in resist involvement it be well to be the free and disinterested agent of international justice and advance civilization with the covenant of conscience than be shackle by a write compact which surrender our freedom of action and give a military alliance the right to proclaim america&#39;s duty to the world
 no surrender of right to a world council or its military alliance no assumed mandatory however appealing ever shall summon the son of this republic to war their supreme sacrifice shall only be ask for america and its call of honor there be a sanctity in that right we will not delegate
 when the compact be be write i do not know whether europe ask or ambition insistently bestow it be so good to rejoice in the world&#39;s confidence in our unselfishness that i can believe our evident disinterestedness inspire europe&#39;s wish for our association quite as much as the selfish thought of enlist american power and resource ours be an outstanding influential example to the world whether we cloak it in speak modesty or magnify it in exaltation we want to help we mean to help but we hold to our own interpretation of the american conscience as the very soul of our nationality
 dispose as we be the way be very simple let the failure attend assumption obstinacy impracticability and delay be recognize and let we find the big practical unselfish way to do our part neither covetous because of ambition nor hesitant through fear but ready to serve ourselves humanity and god with a senate advise as the constitution contemplate i would hopefully approach the nation of europe and of the earth propose that understanding which make we a willing participant in the consecration of nation to a new relationship to commit the moral force of the world america include to peace and international justice still leave america free independent and self reliant but offer friendship to all the world
 if man call for more specific detail i remind they that moral committal be broad and all inclusive and we be contemplate people in the concord of humanity&#39;s advancement from our own viewpoint the program be specifically american and we mean to be american first to all the world
 appraising preserve nationality as the first essential to the continued progress of the republic there be link with it the supreme necessity of the restoration&mdash;let we say the revealment&mdash;of the constitution and our reconstruction as an industrial nation here be the transcending task it concern our common weal at home and will decide our future eminence in the world more than these this republic under constitutional liberty have give to mankind the most fortunate condition for human activity and attainment the world have ever note and we be today the world&#39;s reserve force in the great contest for liberty through security and maintain equality of opportunity and its righteous reward
 it be folly to close our eye to outstanding fact humanity be restive much of the world be in revolution the agent of discord and destruction have work their tragedy in pathetic russia have light their torch among other people and hope to see america as a part of the great red conflagration ours be the temple of liberty under the law and it be ours to call the sons of opportunity to its defense america must not only save herself but ours must be the appeal voice to sober the world
 more than all else the present day world need understanding there can be no peace save through compose difference and the submission of the individual to the will and weal of the many any other plan mean anarchy and its rule of force
 it must be understand that toil alone make for accomplishment and advancement and righteous possession be the reward of toil and its incentive there be no progress except in the stimulus of competition
 when competition&mdash;natural fair impel competition&mdash;is suppress whether by law compact or conspiracy we halt the march of progress silence the voice of inspiration and paralyze the will for achievement these be but common sense truth of human development
 the chief trouble today be that the world war work the destruction of healthful competition leave our storehouse empty and there be a minimum production when our need be maximum maximums not minimum be the call of america it isn&#39;t a new story because war never fail to leave deplete storehouse and always impair the efficiency of production war also establish its high standard for wage and they abide i wish the high wage to abide on one explicit condition&mdash;that the wage earner will give full return for the wage receive it be the good assurance we can have for a reduce cost of living mark you i be ready to acclaim the high standard of pay but i would be blind to the responsibility that mark this fateful hour if i do not caution the wage earner of america that mount wage and decrease production can lead only to industrial and economic ruin
 i want somehow to appeal to the son and daughter of the republic to every producer to join hand and brain in production more production honest production patriotic production because patriotic production be no less a defense of our good civilization than that of armed force profiteer be a crime of commission underproduction be a crime of omission we must work our most and good else the destructive reaction will come we must stabilize and strive for normalcy else the inevitable reaction will bring its train of suffering disappointment and reversal we want to forestall such reaction we want to hold all advanced ground and fortify it with general good fortune
 let we return for a moment to the necessity for understanding particularly that understanding which concern ourselves at home i decline to recognize any conflict of interest among the participant in industry the destruction of one be the ruin of the other the suspicion or rebellion of one unavoidably involve the other in conflict be disaster in understanding there be triumph there be no issue relate to the foundation on which industry be build because industry be big than any element in its modern making but the insistent call be for labor management and capital to reach understanding
 the human element come first and i want the employer in industry to understand the aspiration the conviction the yearning of the million of american wage earner and i want the wage earner to understand the problem the anxiety the obligation of management and capital and all of they must understand their relationship to the people and their obligation to the republic out of this understanding will come the unanimous committal to economic justice and in economic justice lie that social justice which be the high essential to human happiness
 i be speak as one who have count the content of the pay envelope from the viewpoint of the earner as well as the employer no one pretend to deny the inequality which be manifest in modern industrial life they be less in fact than they be before organization and group on either side reveal the inequality and conscience have work more justice than statute have compel but the ferment of the world rivet our thought on the necessity of progressive solution else our generation will suffer the experiment which mean chaos for our day to re establish god&#39;s plan for the great tomorrow
 speak our sympathy utter the conscience of all the people mindful of our right to dwell amid the good fortune of rational conscience impel advancement we hold the majesty of righteous government with liberty under the law to be our avoidance of chaos and we call upon every citizen of the republic to hold fast to that which make we what we be and we will have orderly government safeguard the onward march to all we ought to be
 the menacing tendency of the present day be not chargeable wholly to the unsettled and fevere condition cause by the war the manifest weakness in popular government lie in the temptation to appeal to group citizenship for political advantage there be no great peril the constitution contemplate no class and recognize no group it broadly include all the people with specific recognition for none and the high consecration we can make today be a committal of the republican party to that save constitutionalism which contemplate all america as one people and hold just government free from influence on the one hand and unmove by intimidation on the other
 it would be the blindness of folly to ignore the activity in our own country which be aim to destroy our economic system and to commit we to the colossal tragedy which have both destroy all freedom and make russia impotent this movement be not to be halt in throttle liberty we must not abridge the freedom of speech the freedom of press or the freedom of assembly because there be no promise in repression these liberty be as sacred as the freedom of religious belief as inviolable as the right of life and the pursuit of happiness we do hold to the right to crush sedition to stifle a menacing contempt for law to stamp out a peril to the safety of the republic or its people when emergency call because security and the majesty of the law be the first essential of liberty he who threaten destruction of the government by force or flaunt his contempt for lawful authority cease to be a loyal citizen and forfeit his right to the freedom of the republic
 let it be say to all of america that our plan of popular government contemplate such orderly change as the crystallized intelligence of the majority of our people think well there can be no modification of this underlying rule but no majority shall abridge the right of a minority man have a right to question our system in full freedom but they must always remember that the right of freedom impose the obligation which maintain it our policy be not of repression but we make appeal today to american intelligence and patriotism when the republic be menace from within just as we trust american patriotism when our right be threaten from without
 we call on all america for steadiness so that we may proceed deliberately to the readjustment which concern all the people our party platform fairly express the conscience of republicans on industrial relation no party be indifferent to the welfare of the wage earner to we his good fortune be of deep concern and we seek to make that good fortune permanent we do not oppose but approve collective bargaining because that be an outstanding right but we be unalterably insistent that its exercise must not destroy the equally sacred right of the individual in his necessary pursuit of livelihood any american have the right to quit his employment so have every american the right to seek employment the group must not endanger the individual and we must discourage group prey upon one another and none shall be allow to forget that government&#39;s obligation be alike to all the people
 i hope we may do more than merely discourage the loss and suffering attend industrial conflict the strike against the government be properly deny for government service involve none of the element of profit which relate to competitive enterprise there be progress in the establishment of official revealment of issue and condition which lead to conflict so that unerre public sentiment may speed the adjustment but i hope for that concord of purpose not force but inspire by the common weal which will give a regulated public service the full guaranty of continuity
 i be think of the railroad in modern life they be the very base of all our activity and interchange for public protection we have enact law provide for a regulation of the charge for service a limitation on the capital invest and a limitation on capital&#39; earning there remain only competition of service on which to base our hope for an efficiency and expansion which meet our modern requirement the railway workman ought to be the well pay and know the good working condition in the world theirs be an exceptional responsibility they be not only essential to the life and health and all productive activity of the people but they be directly responsible for the safety of travel million the government which have assume so much authority for the public good might well stamp railway employment with the sanctity of public service and guarantee to the railway employee that justice which voice the american conception of righteousness on the one hand and assure continuity of service on the other
 the importance of the railway rehabilitation be so obvious that reference seem uncalled for we be so confident that much of the present day insufficiency and inefficiency of transportation be due to the wither hand of government operation that we emphasize anew our opposition to government ownership we want to expedite the reparation and make sure the mistake be not repeat
 it be little use to recite the story of development exploitation government experiment and its neglect government operation and its failure the inadequacy of trackage and terminal facility the insufficiency of equipment and the inefficiency of operation&mdash;all bear the blight stamp of governmental incapacity during federal operation the work of rehabilitation under the restoration of private ownership deserve our good encouragement billion be need in new equipment not alone to meet the grow demand for service but to restore the extraordinary depreciation due to the strained service of war with restricted earning and with speculative profit remove railway activity have come to the realm of conservative and constructive service and the government which impair must play its part in restoration manifestly the return must be so gauge that necessary capital may so be enlist and we must foster as well as restrain
 we have no more pressing problem a state of inadequate transportation facility mainly chargeable to the failure of governmental experiment be lose million to agriculture it be hinder industry it be menace the american people with a fuel shortage little less than a peril it emphasize the present day problem and suggest that spirit of encouragement and assistance which commit all america to relieve such an emergency
 the one compensation amid attend anxiety be our new and needed realization of the vital part transportation play in the complexity of modern life we be not to think of rail alone but highway from farm to market from railway to farm artery of life blood to present day life the quicken way to communication and exchange the answer of our people to the motor age we believe in generous federal cooperation in construction link with assurance of maintenance that will put an end to criminal waste of public fund on the one hand and give a guaranty of upkept highway on the other
 water transportation be inseparably link with adequacy of facility and we favor american eminence on the sea the practical development of inland waterway the upbuilding and co ordination of all to make they equal to and ready for every call of develop and widen american commerce i like that recommittal to thought of america first which pledge the panama canal and american creation to the free use of american shipping it will add to the american reawakening
 one can not speak of industry and commerce and the transportation on which they be dependent without an earnest thought of the abnormal cost of living and the problem in its wake it be easy to inveigh but that avail nothing and it be far too serious to dismiss with flame but futile promise
 eight year ago in time of peace the democratic party make it an issue and when clothe with power that party come near to its accomplishment by destroy the people&#39; capacity to buy but that be a cure bad than the ailment it be easy to understand the real cause after which the patient must help to effect his own cure
 gross expansion of currency and credit have depreciate the dollar just as expansion and inflation have discredit the coin of the world we inflate in haste we must deflate in deliberation we debase the dollar in reckless finance we must restore in honesty deflation on the one hand and restoration of the 100 cent dollar on the other ought to have begin on the day after the armistice but plan be lack or courage fail the unpreparedness for peace be little less costly than unpreparedness for war
 we can promise no one remedy which will cure an ill of such wide proportion but we do pledge that earnest and consistent attack which the party platform covenant we will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation and strike at government borrowing which enlarge the evil and we will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility which attend republican capacity we promise that relief which will attend the halting of waste and extravagance and the renewal of the practice of public economy not alone because it will relieve tax burden but because it will be an example to stimulate thrift and economy in private life
 i have already allude to the necessity for the fullness of production and we need the fullness of service which attend the exchange of product let we speak the irrefutable truth&mdash;high wage and reduce cost of living be in utter contradiction unless we have the height of efficiency for wage receive
 in all sincerity we promise the prevention of unreasonable profit we challenge profiteer with all the moral force and the legal power of government and people but it be fair aye it be timely to give reminder that law be not the sole corrective of our economic ill
 let we call to all the people for thrift and economy for denial and sacrifice if need be for a nation wide drive against extravagance and luxury to a recommittal to simplicity of living to that prudent and normal plan of life which be the health of the republic there hasn&#39;t be a recovery from the waste and abnormality of war since the story of mankind be first write except through work and saving through industry and denial while needless spending and heedless extravagance have mark every decay in the history of nation give the assurance of that rugged simplicity of american life which mark the first century of amazing development and this generation may underwrite a second century of surpass accomplishment
 the republican party be found by farmer with the sensitive conscience bear of their freedom and their simple life these founder spring from the farm of the then middle west our party have never fail in its realization that agriculture be essentially the foundation of our very existence and it have ever be our policy purpose and performance to protect and promote that essential industry
 new condition which attend amazing growth and extraordinary industrial development call for a new and forward look program the american farmer have a hundred and twenty million to feed in the home market and hear the cry of the world for food and answer it though he face an appalling task amid handicap never encounter before
 in the rise of price level there have come increase appraisal to his acre without add to their value in fact but which do add to his taxis and expense without enhance his return his helper have yield to the lure of shop and city until almost alone he have meet and borne the burden of the only insistent attempt to force down price it challenge both the wisdom and the justice of artificial drive on price to recall that they be effective almost solely against his product in the hand of the producer and never effective against the same product in pass to the consumer contemplate the defenselessness of the individual farmer to meet the organized buyer of his product and the distributor of the thing the farmer buy i hold that farmer should not only be permit but encourage to join in co operative association to reap the just measure of reward merit by their arduous toil let we facilitate cooperation to insure against the risk attend agriculture which the urban world so little understand and a like co operation to market their product as directly as possible with the consumer in the interest of all upon such association and co operation should be lay only such restriction as will prevent arbitrary control of our food supply and the fixing of extortionate price upon it
 our platform be an earnest pledge of renew concern for this most essential and elemental industry and in both appreciation and interest we pledge effective expression in law and practice we will hail that co operation which again will make profitable and desirable the ownership and operation of comparatively small farm intensively cultivate and which will facilitate the caring for the product of farm and orchard without the lamentable waste under present condition
 america would look with anxiety on the discouragement of farming activity either through the government&#39;s neglect or its paralysis by socialistic practice a republican administration will be commit to renew regard for agriculture and seek the participation of farmer in cure the ill justly complain of and aim to place the american farm where it ought to be&mdash;highly rank in american activity and fully share the high good fortune of american life
 becomingly associate with this subject be the policy of irrigation and reclamation so essential to agricultural expansion and the continued development of the great and wonderful west it be our purpose to continue and enlarge federal aid not in sectional partiality but for the good of all america we hold to that harmony of relationship between conservation and development which fittingly appraise our natural resource and make they available to develop america of today and still hold to the conserve thought for the america of tomorrow
 the federal government&#39;s relation to reclamation and development be too important to admit of ample discussion today alaska alone be rich in resource beyond all imagination and need only close link through the line of transportation and a government policy that both safeguard and encourage development to speed it to a foremost position as a commonwealth rugge in citizenship and rich in materialize resource
 these thing i can only mention within become limit one can not say more indeed for the present many question of vast importance must be hastily pass reserve a full discussion to suitable occasion as the campaign advance
 i believe the budget system will effect a necessary helpful reformation and reveal business method to government business
 i believe federal department should be make more business like and send back to productive effort thousand of federal employee who be either duplicate work or not essential at all
 i believe in the protective tariff policy and know we will be call for its save americanism again
 i believe in a great merchant marine&mdash;i would have this republic the lead maritime nation of the world
 i believe in a navy ample to protect it and able to assure we dependable defense

 i believe the federal government should give its effective aid in solve the problem of ample and become housing of its citizenship
 i believe this government should make its liberty and victory bond worth all that its patriotic citizen pay in purchase they
 i believe the tax burden impose for the war emergency must be revise to the need of peace and in the interest of equity in distribution of the burden
 i believe the negro citizen of america should be guarantee the enjoyment of all their right that they have earn the full measure of citizenship bestow that their sacrifice in blood on the battlefield of the republic have entitle they to all of freedom and opportunity all of sympathy and aid that the american spirit of fairness and justice demand
 i believe there be an easy and open path to righteous relationship with mexico it have seem to i that our undeveloped uncertain and infirm policy have make we a culpable party to the governmental misfortune in that land our relation ought to be both friendly and sympathetic we would like to acclaim a stable government there and offer a neighborly hand in point the way to great progress it will be simple to have a plain and neighborly understanding merely an understanding about respect our border about protect the life and possession of americans citizen lawfully within the mexican dominion there must be that understanding else there can be no recognition and then the understanding must be faithfully keep
 many of these declaration deserve a full expression with some suggestion of plan to emphasize the faith such expression will follow in due time i promise you
 i believe in law enforcement if elect i mean to be a constitutional president and it be impossible to ignore the constitution unthinkable to evade the law when our every committal be to orderly government people ever will differ about the wisdom of the enactment of a law&mdash;there be divided opinion respect the eighteenth amendment and the law enact to make it operative&mdash;but there can be no difference of opinion about honest law enforcement
 neither government nor party can afford to cheat the american people the law of congress must harmonize with the constitution else they soon be adjudge to be void congress enact the law and the executive branch of the government be charge with enforcement we can not nullify because of divided opinion we can not jeopardize orderly government with contempt for law enforcement modification or repeal be the right of a free people whenever the deliberate and intelligent public sentiment command but perversion and evasion mark the path to the failure of government itself
 though not in any partisan sense i must speak of the service of the man and woman who rally to the color of the republic in the world war america realize and appreciate the service render the sacrifice make and the suffering endure there shall be no distinction between those who know the peril and glory of the battle front or the danger of the sea and those who be compel to serve behind the line or those who constitute the great reserve of a grand army which await the call in camp at home
 all be brave all be sacrifice all be sharer of those ideal which send our boy thrice arm to war worthy son and daughter these fit successor to those who christen our banner in the immortal beginning worthy son of those who save the union and nationality when civil war wipe the ambiguity from the constitution ready son of those who draw the sword for humanity&#39;s sake the first time in the world in 1898
 the four million defender on land and sea be worthy of the good tradition of a people never warlike in peace and never pacifist in war they command our pride they have our gratitude which must have genuine expression it be not only a duty it be a privilege to see that the sacrifice make shall be requite and that those still suffer from casualty and disability shall be abundantly aid and restore to the high capability of citizenship and its enjoyment

my countryman we believe the unspeakable sorrow the immeasurable sacrifice the awakened conviction and the aspire conscience of humankind must commit the nation of the earth to a new and well relationship it need not be discuss now what motive plunge the world into war it need not be inquire whether we ask the son of this republic to defend our national right as i believe we do or to purge the old world of the accumulate ill of rivalry and greed the sacrifice will be in vain if we can not acclaim a new order with add security to civilization and peace maintain

 one may readily sense the conscience of our america i be sure i understand the purpose of the dominant group of the senate we be not seek to defeat a world aspiration we be resolve to safeguard america we be resolve then even as we be today and will be tomorrow to preserve this free and independent republic let those now responsible or seek responsibility propose the surrender whether with interpretation apology or reluctant reservation from which our right be to be omit we welcome the referendum to the american people on the preservation of america and the republican party pledge its defense of the preserve inheritance of national freedom

 see covenant of the league of nations article 10

my countryman the chief trouble today be that the world war work the destruction of healthful competition leave our storehouse empty and there be a minimum production when our need be maximal maximum not minimum be the call of america war never fail to leave deplete storehouse and always impair the efficiency of production war also establish its high standard for wage and they abide i wish the high wage to abide on one explicit condition-- that the wage earner will give full return for the wage receive it be the good assurance we can have for a reduce cost of living i be ready to acclaim the high standard of pay but i would be blind to the responsibility that mark this fateful hour if i do not caution the wage earner of america that mount wage and decrease production can lead only to industrial and economic ruin

 i want somehow to appeal to the son and daughter of the republic to every producer to join hand and brain in production honest production patriotic production profiteer be a crime of commission underproduction be a crime of omission we must work our most and good else the inevitable reaction will bring its train of suffering disappointment and reversal we want to forestall such reaction we want to hold all advanced ground and fortify it with general good fortune

 let we return to the necessity for understanding particularly that understanding that concern ourselves at home i decline to recognize any conflict of interest among the participant in industry the destruction of one be the ruin of the other the suspicion or rebellion of one unavoidably involve the other in conflict be disaster in understanding there be triumph there be no issue relate to the foundation on which industry be build because industry be big than any element in its modern making the insistent call be for labor management and capital to reach understanding

 the human element come first i want the employer in industry to understand the aspiration the conviction the yearning of the million of american wage earner i want the wage earner to understand the problem the anxiety the obligation of management and capital and all of they must understand their relationship to the people and their obligation to the republic

 out of this understanding will come the unanimous committal to economic justice and in economic justice lie that social justice which be the high essential to human happiness i be speak as one who have count the content of the pay envelope from the viewpoint of the earner as well as the employer no one pretend to deny the inequality which be manifest in modern industrial life they be less in fact than they be before organization and group on either side reveal the inequality and conscience have bring more justice than statute have compel but the ferment of the world rivet our thought on the necessity of progressive solution else our generation will suffer the experiment which mean chaos for our day to reestablish god ’s plan for the great tomorrow

my countryman though not in any partisan sense i must speak of the service of the man and woman who rally to the color of the republic in the world war america realize and appreciate the service render the sacrifice make and the suffering endure there shall be no distinction between those who know the peril and glory of the battlefront or the danger of the sea and those who be compel to serve behind the line or those who constitute the great reserve of a grand army which await the call in camp at home all be brave all be self sacrifice all be sharer of those ideal which send our boy thrice arm to war

 worthy son and daughter these fit successor to those who christen our banner in the immortal beginning worthy son of those who save the union and nationality when civil war wipe out the ambiguity from the constitution ready son of those who draw the sword for humanity ’s sake the first time in the world in 1898 the four million defender on land and sea be worthy of the good tradition of a people never warlike in peace and never pacifist in war they command our pride they have our gratitude which must have genuine expression it ’ not only a duty it ’ a privilege to see that the sacrifice make shall be requite and that those still suffer from casualty and disability shall be abundantly aid and restore to the high capability of citizenship and its enjoyment

 much have be say of late about world ideal but i prefer to think of the ideal for america i like to think there ’ something more than the patriotism and practical wisdom of the founding fathers it ’ good to believe that maybe destiny hold this new world republic to be the supreme example of representative democracy and order liberty by which humanity be inspire to high achievement it be idle to think we have attain perfection but there be the satisfying knowledge that we hold orderly process for make our government reflect the heart and mind of the republic

 ours be not only a fortunate people but a very commonsensical people with vision high but their foot on the earth with belief in themselves and faith in god whether enemy threaten from without or menace arise from within there be some indefinable voice say have confidence in the republic america will go on here be the temple of liberty no storm may shake here be the altar of freedom no passion shall destroy it be american in conception american in its building it shall be american in the fulfillment sectional once we be all american now and we mean to be all americans to all the world

 i would not be my natural self if i do not utter my consciousness of my limited ability to meet your full expectation or to realize the aspiration within my own breast but i ’ll gladly give all that be in i all of heart soul and mind and the fight love of country to service in our common cause i can only pray to omnipotent god that i may be as worthy in service as i know myself to be faithful in thought and purpose one can not give more

mr. chairman the message which you have formally convey bring i to a realization of responsibility which be not underestimate it be a supreme task to interpret the covenant of a great political party the activity of which be so weave into the history of this republic i believe in party government as distinguish from personal government individual dictatorial autocratic or what not it be the intent of the found father to give this republic a dependable and endure popular government representative in form and it be design to make political party the effective agency through which hope and aspiration and conviction and conscience may be translate into public performance popular government have be an inspiration of liberty since the dawn of civilization republic have rise and fall and a transition from party to personal government have precede every failure since the world begin

 under the constitution we have the chart the way to security in perpetuity we know it give to we the safe path to a develop eminence which no people in the world ever rival it have guarantee the rule of intelligent deliberate public opinion express through party the american achievement under the plan of the father be nowhere dispute the american example have be the model of every republic which glorify the progress of liberty and be everywhere the leaven of representative democracy which have expand human freedom

 no one man be big enough to run this great republic there never have be one such domination be never intend tranquility stability dependability all be assure in party sponsorship and we mean to renew the assurance which be rend in the cataclysmal war our first committal be the restoration of representative popular government under the constitution through the agency of the republican party

 it be not difficult to make ourselves clear on the question of international relationship we republicans of the senate conscious of our solemn oath and mindful of our constitutional obligation when we see the structure of a world supergovernment taking visionary form join in a becoming warn out of our devotion to this republic if the torch of constitutionalism have not be dim the delay peace of the world and the tragedy of disappointment and europe ’s misunderstanding of america easily might have be avoid the republicans of the senate halt the barter of independent american eminence and influence which it be propose to exchange for an obscure and unequal place in the merged government of the world our party mean to hold the heritage of american nationality unimpaire and unsurrendered

 the world will not misconstrue we do not mean to hold aloof we do not mean to shun a single responsibility of this republic to world civilization there be no hate in the american heart we have no envy no suspicion no aversion for any people in the world we hold to our right and mean to defend aye we mean to sustain the right of this nation and our citizen alike everywhere under the shine sun yet there be the concord of amity and sympathy and fraternity in every resolution there be a genuine aspiration in every american breast for a tranquil friendship with all the world

 senator henry cabot lodge republican of massachusetts chairman of the notification committee

my countryman the menacing tendency of the present day be not chargeable wholly to the unsettled and fevere condition cause by the war the manifest weakness in popular government lie in the temptation to appeal to group citizenship for political advantage there be no great peril the constitution contemplate no class and recognize no group it broadly include all the people with specific recognition for none and the high consecration we can make today be a committal of the republican party to that save constitutionalism which contemplate all america as one people and hold just government free from influence on the one hand and unmove by intimidation on the other

 it would be the blindness of folly to ignore the activity in our own country which be aim to destroy our economic system and to commit we to the colossal tragedy which have both destroy all freedom and make russia impotent this movement be not to be halt in throttle liberty we must not abridge the freedom of speech the freedom of press or the freedom of assembly because there be no promise in repression these liberty be as sacred as the freedom of religious belief as inviolable as the right of life and the pursuit of happiness we do hold to the right to crush sedition to stifle a menacing contempt for law to stamp out a peril to the safety of the republic or its people when emergency call because security and the majesty of the law be the first essential of liberty he who threaten destruction of the government by force or flaunt his contempt for lawful authority cease to be a loyal citizen and forfeit his right to the freedom of the republic

 let it be say to all of america that our plan of popular government contemplate such orderly change as the crystallized intelligence of the majority of our people think well there can be no modification of this underlying rule but no majority shall abridge the right of a minority man have a right to question our system in full freedom but they must always remember that the right of freedom impose the obligation which maintain it our policy be not of repression but we make appeal today to american intelligence and patriotism when the republic be menace from within just as we trust american patriotism when our right be threaten from without

 we call on all america for steadiness so that we may proceed deliberately with the readjustment which concern all the people our party platform fairly express the conscience of republicans on industrial relation no party be indifferent to the welfare of the wage earner to we his good fortune be of deep concern and we seek to make that good fortune permanent we do not oppose but approve collective bargaining because that be an outstanding right but we be unalterably insistent that its exercise must not destroy the equally sacred right of the individual in his necessary pursuit of a livelihood any american have the right to quit his employment so have every american the right to seek employment the group must not endanger the individual and we must discourage group prey upon one another and none shall be allow to forget that government 's obligation be alike to all the people

 february and october by the russian calendar 1917

the republican party have justify the confidence the country repose in it when in october 1918 the president make his most partisan appeal for a congress to do his bidding it be the shocking partisanship of a century the patriotic people of the nation remember that the republicans generously support every request of the president for power and authority they remember that it be representative kahn a republican and a minority member who carry through the bill for the enlargement of our army and navy the republican party never have be find requisite in its patriotic duty and no clear or more positive proof of its earnestness its disinterestedness and its patriotic devotion but be give during the day of its minority in the 65th congress as the party keep faith then so will it continue to do in the day to come and restore we to tranquility and security



 and now a word that may be regard as personal to my friend of wyandot county ohio two son of wyandot be here today who have make the great sacrifice for their country which man may offer short of life itself they be blind under the flag our flag in the argonne

 i want publicly to pledge to they and to those of their comrade who suffer such impairment as must deprive they of a full part in life the republic ’s unfailing and grateful consideration i want to pledge they something more i know what inspire their heroism i know what make they proud soldier of the republic they fight for america and for american right they answer the challenge of american right they fight to defend american life american freedom on the sea and american ideal of international relationship

 battle of meuse argonne fight in part in the argonne forest commence september 26 1918 and continue until the armistice of november 11 for the american army in france command by general john j. pershing it be by far its large engagement and in which the american expeditionary force lose twenty six thousand man kill and ten of thousand wound

i greet you in a spirit of rejoice not a rejoicing in the narrow partisan or personal sense not in the gratifying prospect of party triumph but i rejoice that america be still free and independent and in a position of self reliance oppose to the right of self determination let we take stock for a moment of america in the world aye and of america at home the end of the war find our unselfishness emphasize to all mankind the garland of world leadership be bestow from every direction we have only to follow the path of america rejoice in the inheritance which lead to our eminence to rivet the gaze of all people upon our standard of national righteousness and our conception of international justice

 moreover the world be ready to give we its confidence it be the beckon opportunity of the century not for the glorification of this new world republic but for america to hold every outpost of advance civilization and invite all nation to join the further advance to height dream of but never before approach

 but force of example be sling aside for force of armed alliance we neglect our restoration at home and the sacrifice of million of life leave we and the world groping in anxiety instead of reveal we in the sunlight of a new day with line form ready for the onward march of peace and all its triumph mindful of our splendid example and renew every obligation of association in war i want america to be the rock of security at home resolute in righteousness and supremacy of the law our moral leadership in the world be lose when ambition seek to superimpose a reactionary theory of discredit autocracy upon the progressive principle of living glow democracy

 my deep aspiration my countryman if clothe with power will be to regain that lose leadership not for myself not even for my party though honor and trust it as i do but for the country that i love from the bottom of my heart with every fiber of my being above all else in the world

gentlemen of the congress when i address myself to perform the duty lay upon the president by the constitution to present to you an annual report on the state of the union i find my thought dominate by an immortal sentence of abraham lincoln's-"let we have faith that right make might and in that faith let we dare to do our duty as we understand it -a sentence immortal because it embody in a form of utter simplicity and purity the essential faith of the nation the faith in which it be conceive and the faith in which it have grow to glory and power with that faith and the birth of a nation found upon it come the hope into the world that a new order would prevail throughout the affair of mankind an order in which reason and right would take precedence over covetousness and force and i believe that i express the wish and purpose of every thoughtful american when i say that this sentence mark for we in the plainest manner the part we should play alike in the arrangement of our domestic affair and in our exercise of influence upon the affair of the world by this faith and by this faith alone can the world be lift out of its present confusion and despair it be this faith which prevail over the wicked force of germany you will remember that the beginning of the end of the war come when the german people find themselves face to face with the conscience of the world and realize that right be everywhere array against the wrong that their government be attempt to perpetrate i think therefore that it be true to say that this be the faith which win the war certainly this be the faith with which our gallant man go into the field and out upon the sea to make sure of victory this be the mission upon which democracy come into the world democracy be an assertion of the right of the individual to live and to be treat justly as against any attempt on the part of any combination of individual to make law which will overburden he or which will destroy his equality among his fellow in the matter of right or privilege and i think we all realize that the day have come when democracy be be put upon its final test the old world be just now suffer from a wanton rejection of the principle of democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as assert in the name but without the authority and sanction of the multitude this be the time of all other when democracy should prove its purity and its spiritual power to prevail it be surely the manifest destiny of the united states to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail there be two way in which the united states can assist to accomplish this great object first by offer the example within her own border of the will and power of democracy to make and enforce law which be unquestionably just and which be equal in their administration law which secure its full right to labor and yet at the same time safeguard the integrity of property and particularly of that property which be devoted to the development of industry and the increase of the necessary wealth of the world second by stand for right and justice as toward individual nation the law of democracy be for the protection of the weak and the influence of every democracy in the world should be for the protection of the weak nation the nation which be struggle toward its right and toward its proper recognition and privilege in the family of nation the united states can not refuse this role of champion without put the stigma of rejection upon the great and devoted man who bring its government into existence and establish it in the face of almost universal opposition and intrigue even in the face of wanton force as for example against the orders in council of great britain and the arbitrary napoleonic decree which involve we in what we know as the war of 1812.i urge you to consider that the display of an immediate disposition on the part of the congress to remedy any injustice or evil that may have show themselves in our own national life will afford the most effectual offset to the force of chaos and tyranny which be play so disastrous a part in the fortune of the free people of more than one part of the world the united states be of necessity the sample democracy of the world and the triumph of democracy depend upon its success recovery from the disturbing and sometimes disastrous effect of the late war have be exceedingly slow on the other side of the water and have give promise i venture to say of early completion only in our own fortunate country but even with we the recovery halt and be impede at time and there be immediately serviceable act of legislation which it seem to i we ought to attempt to assist that recovery and prove the indestructible recuperative force of a great government of the people one of these be to prove that a great democracy can keep house as successfully and in as business like a fashion as any other government it seem to i that the first step toward provide this be to supply ourselves with a systematic method of handle our estimate and expenditure and bring they to the point where they will not be an unnecessary strain upon our income or necessitate unreasonable taxation in other word a workable budget system and i respectfully suggest that two element be essential to such a system namely not only that the proposal of appropriation should be in the hand of a single body such as a single appropriation committee in each house of the congress but also that this body should be bring into such cooperation with the departments of the government and with the treasury of the united states as would enable it to act upon a complete conspectus of the need of the government and the resource from which it must draw its income i reluctantly veto the budget bill pass by the last session of the congress because of a constitutional objection the house of representatives subsequently modify the bill in order to meet this objection in the revise form i believe that the bill couple with action already take by the congress to revise its rule and procedure furnish the foundation for an effective national budget system i earnestly hope therefore that one of the first step to be take by the present session of the congress will be to pass the budget bill the nation 's finance have show mark improvement during the last year the total ordinary receipt of $ 6,694,000,000 for the fiscal year 1920 exceed those for 1919 by $ 1,542,000,000 while the total net ordinary expenditure decrease from $ 18,514,000,000 to $ 6,403,000,000 the gross public debt which reach its high point on august 31 1919 when it be $ 26,596,000,000 have drop on november 30 1920 to $ 24,175,000,000.there have also be a marked decrease in holding of government war security by the banking institution of the country as well as in the amount of bill hold by the federal reserve banks secure by government war obligation this fortunate result have relieve the bank and leave they free to finance the need of agriculture industry and commerce it have be due in large part to the reduction of the public debt especially of the float debt but more particularly to the improved distribution of government security among permanent investor the cessation of the government 's borrowing except through short term certificate of indebtedness have be a matter of great consequence to the people of the country at large as well as to the holder of liberty bonds and victory notes and have have an important bearing on the matter of effective credit control the year have be characterize by the progressive withdrawal of the treasury from the domestic credit market and from a position of dominant influence in that market the future course will necessarily depend upon the extent to which economy be practice and upon the burden place upon the treasury as well as upon industrial development and the maintenance of tax receipt at a sufficiently high level the fundamental fact which at present dominate the government 's financial situation be that seven and a half billion of its war indebtedness mature within the next two and a half year of this amount two and a half billion be float debt and five billion victory notes and war saving certificates the fiscal program of the government must be determine with reference to these maturity sound policy demand that government expenditure be reduce to the low amount which will permit the various service to operate efficiently and that government receipt from taxis and salvage be maintain sufficiently high to provide for current requirement include interest and sink fund charge on the public debt and at the same time retire the float debt and part of the victory loan before maturity with rigid economy vigorous salvage operation and adequate revenue from taxation a surplus of current receipt over current expenditure can be realize and should be apply to the float debt all branch of the government should cooperate to see that this program be realize i can not overemphasize the necessity of economy in government appropriation and expenditure and the avoidance by the congress of practice which take money from the treasury by indefinite or revolving fund appropriation the estimate for the present year show that over a billion dollar of expenditure be authorize by the last congress in addition to the amount show in the usual compile statement of appropriation this strikingly illustrate the importance of make direct and specific appropriation the relation between the current receipt and current expenditure of the government during the present fiscal year as well as during the last half of the last fiscal year have be disturb by the extraordinary burden throw upon the treasury by the transportation act in connection with the return of the railroad to private control over $ 600,000,000 have already be pay to the railroad under this act-$350,000,000 during the present fiscal year and it be estimate that further payment aggregate possibly $ 650,000,000 must still be make to the railroad during the current year it be obvious that these large payment have already seriously limit the government 's progress in retire the float debt closely connect with this it seem to i be the necessity for an immediate consideration of the revision of our tax law simplification of the income and profit taxis have become an immediate necessity these taxis perform an indispensable service during the war the need for their simplification however be very great in order to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense and in order to make his liability more certain and definite other and more detailed recommendation with regard to taxis will no doubt be lay before you by the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of internal revenue it be my privilege to draw to the attention of congress for very sympathetic consideration the problem of provide adequate facility for the care and treatment of former member of the military and naval force who be sick and disabled as the result of their participation in the war these heroic man can never be pay in money for the service they patriotically render the nation their reward will lie rather in realization of the fact that they vindicate the right of their country and aid in safeguard civilization the nation 's gratitude must be effectively reveal to they by the most ample provision for their medical care and treatment as well as for their vocational training and placement the time have come when a more complete program can be formulate and more satisfactorily administer for their treatment and training and i earnestly urge that the congress give the matter its early consideration the secretary of the treasury and the board for vocational education will outline in their annual report proposal cover medical care and rehabilitation which i be sure will engage your earnest study and commend your most generous support permit i to emphasize once more the need for action upon certain matter upon which i dwelt at some length in my message to the second session of the sixty sixth congress the necessity for example of encourage the manufacture of dyestuff and related chemical the importance of do everything possible to promote agricultural production along economic line to improve agricultural marketing and to make rural life more attractive and healthful the need for a law regulate cold storage in such a way as to limit the time during which good may be keep in storage prescribe the method of dispose of they if keep beyond the permit period and require good release from storage in all case to bear the date of their receipt it would also be most serviceable if it be provide that all good release from cold storage for interstate shipment should have plainly mark upon each package the selling or market price at which they go into storage in order that the purchaser might be able to learn what profit stand between he and the producer or the wholesale dealer indeed it would be very serviceable to the public if all good destine for interstate commerce be make to carry upon every packing case whose form make it possible a plain statement of the price at which they leave the hand of the producer i respectfully call your attention also to the recommendation of the message refer to with regard to a federal license for all corporation engage in interstate commerce in brief the immediate legislative need of the time be the removal of all obstacle to the realization of the good ambition of our people in their several class of employment and the strengthening of all instrumentality by which difficulty be to be meet and remove and justice deal out whether by law or by some form of mediation and conciliation i do not feel it to be my privilege at present to suggest the detailed and particular method by which these object may be attain but i have faith that the inquiry of your several committee will discover the way and the method in response to what i believe to be the impulse of sympathy and opinion throughout the united states i earnestly suggest that the congress authorize the treasury of the united states to make to the struggle government of armenia such a loan as be make to several of the allied government during the war and i would also suggest that it would be desirable to provide in the legislation itself that the expenditure of the money thus loan should be under the supervision of a commission or at least a commissioner from the united states in order that revolutionary tendency within armenia itself might not be afford by the loan a far tempting opportunity allow i to call your attention to the fact that the people of the philippine islands have succeed in maintain a stable government since the last action of the congress in their behalf and have thus fulfil the condition set by the congress as precedent to a consideration of grant independence to the islands i respectfully submit that this condition precedent having be fulfil it be now our liberty and our duty to keep our promise to the people of those island by grant they the independence which they so honorably covet i have not so much lay before you a series of recommendation gentleman as seek to utter a confession of faith of the faith in which i be breed and which it be my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day i believe this to be the faith of america the faith of the future and of all the victory which await national action in the day to come whether in america or elsewhere
my countrymen

 i be sure our own people will not misunderstand nor will the world misconstrue we have no thought to impede the path to close relationship we wish to promote understanding we want to do our part in make offensive warfare so hateful that government and people who resort to it must prove the righteousness of their cause or stand as outlaw before the bar of civilization

 we be ready to associate ourselves with the nation of the world great and small for conference for counsel to seek the express view of world opinion to recommend a way to approximate disarmament and relieve the crush burden of military and naval establishment we elect to participate in suggest plan for mediation conciliation and arbitration and would gladly join in that express conscience of progress which seek to clarify and write the law of international relationship and establish a world court for the disposition of such justiciable question as nation be agree to submit thereto in express aspiration in seek practical plan in translate humanity 's new concept of righteousness and justice and its hatred of war into recommend action we be ready most heartily to unite but every commitment must be make in the exercise of our national sovereignty since freedom impel and independence inspire and nationality exalt a world super government be contrary to everything we cherish and can have no sanction by our republic this be not selfishness it be sanctity it be not aloofness it be security it be not suspicion of other it be patriotic adherence to the thing which make we what we be

 today well than ever before we know the aspiration of humankind and share they we have come to a new realization of our place in the world and a new appraisal of our nation by the world the unselfishness of theseunited states be a thing prove our devotion to peace for ourselves and for the world be well establish our concern for preserve civilization have have its impassioned and heroic expression there be no american failure to resist the attempt reversion of civilization there will be no failure today or tomorrow

 the success of our popular government rest wholly upon the correct interpretation of the deliberate intelligent dependable popular will of america in a deliberate questioning of a suggest change of national policy where internationality be to supersede nationality we turn to a referendum to the american people there be ample discussion and there be a public mandate in manifest understanding

 america be ready to encourage eager to initiate anxious to participate in any seemly program likely to lessen the probability of war and promote that brotherhood of mankind which must be god 's high conception of human relationship because we cherish ideal of justice and peace because we appraise international comity and helpful relationship no less highly than any people of the world we aspire to a high place in the moral leadership of civilization and we hold a maintain america the proven republic the unshaken temple of representative democracy to be not only an inspiration and example but the high agency of strengthen good will and promote accord on both continent

 mankind need a world wide benediction of understanding it be need among individual among people among government and it will inaugurate an era of good feeling to make the birth of a new order in such understanding man will strive confidently for the promotion of their well relationship and nation will promote the comity so essential to peace

 we must understand that tie of trade bind nation in close intimacy and none may receive except as he give we have not strengthen ours in accordance with our resource or our genius notably on our own continent where a galaxy of republic reflect the glory of new world democracy but in the new order of finance and trade we mean to promote enlarged activity and seek expand confidence

 perhaps we can make no more helpful contribution by example than prove a republic 's capacity to emerge from the wreckage of war while the world 's embitter travail do not leave we devastate land nor desolate city leave no gape wound no breast with hate it do involve we in the delirium of expenditure in expand currency and credit in unbalanced industry in unspeakable waste and disturb relationship while it uncover our portion of hateful selfishness at home it also reveal the heart of america as sound and fearless and beat in confidence unfailing

 amid it all we have rivet the gaze of all civilization to the unselfishness and the righteousness of representative democracy where our freedom never have make offensive warfare never have seek territorial aggrandizement through force never have turn to the arbitrament of arm until reason have be exhaust when the government of the earth shall have establish a freedom like our own and shall have sanction the pursuit of peace as we have practice it i believe the last sorrow and the final sacrifice of international warfare will have be write

 let i speak to the maimed and wound soldier who be present today and through they convey to their comrade the gratitude of the republic for their sacrifice in its defense a generous country will never forget the service you render and you may hope for a policy under government that will relieve any maimed successor from take your place on another such occasion as this

 our supreme task be the resumption of our onward normal way reconstruction readjustment restoration all these must follow i would like to hasten they if it will lighten the spirit and add to the resolution with which we take up the task let i repeat for our nation we shall give no people just cause to make war upon we we hold no national prejudice we entertain no spirit of revenge we do not hate we do not covet we dream of no conquest nor boast of armed prowess

 if despite this attitude war be again force upon we i earnestly hope a way may be find which will unify our individual and collective strength and consecrate all america materially and spiritually body and soul to national defense i can vision the ideal republic where everyman and woman be call under the flag for assignment to duty for whatever service military or civic the individual be well fit where we may call to universal service every plant agency or facility all in the sublime sacrifice for country and not one penny of war profit shall inure to the benefit of private individual corporation or combination but all above the normal shall flow into the defense chest of the nation there be something inherently wrong something out of accord with the ideal of representative democracy when one portion of our citizenship turn its activity to private gain amid defensive war while another be fight sacrifice or die for national preservation

 out of such universal service will come a new unity of spirit and purpose a new confidence and consecration which would make our defense impregnable our triumph assure then we should have little or no disorganization of our economic industrial and commercial system at home no staggering war debt no swollen fortune to flout the sacrifice of our soldier no excuse for sedition no pitiable slackerism no outrage of treason envy and jealousy would have no soil for their menacing development and revolution would be without the passion which engender it

 a regret for the mistake of yesterday must not however blind we to the task of today war never leave such an aftermath there have be staggering loss of life and measureless wastage of material nation be still grope for return to stable way discourage indebtedness confront we like all the war tear nation and these obligation must be provide for no civilization can survive repudiation

 we can reduce the abnormal expenditure and we will we can strike at war taxation and we must we must face the grim necessity with full knowledge that the task be to be solve and we must proceed with a full realization that no statute enact by man can repeal the inexorable law of nature our most dangerous tendency be to expect too much of government and at the same time do for it too little we contemplate the immediatet ask of put our public household in order we need a rigid and yet sane economy combine with fiscal justice and it must be attend by individual prudence and thrift which be so essential to this try hour and reassure for the future

 the business world reflect the disturbance of war 's reaction herein flow the lifeblood of material existence the economic mechanism be intricate and its part interdependent and have suffer the shock and jar incident to abnormal demand credit inflation and price upheaval the normal balance have be impair the channel of distribution have be clog the relation of labor and management have be strain we must seek the readjustment with care and courage our people must give and take price must reflect the recede fever of war activity perhaps we never shall know the old level of wage again because war invariably readjust compensation and the necessary of life will show their inseparable relationship but we must strive for normalcy to reach stability all the penalty will not be light nor evenly distribute there be no way of make they so there be no instant step from disorder to order we must face a condition of grim reality charge off our loss and start afresh it be the old lesson of civilization i would like government to do all it can to mitigate then in understanding in mutuality of interest in concern for the common good our task will be solve no altered system will work a miracle any wild experiment will only add to the confusion our good assurance lie in efficient administration of our proven system

 the forward course of the business cycle be unmistakable people be turn from destruction to production industry have sense the change order and our own people be turn to resume their normal onward way the call be for productive america to go on i know that congress and theadministration will favor every wise government policy to aid the resumption and encourage continue progress

 i speak for administrative efficiency for lightened tax burden for sound commercial practice for adequate credit facility for sympathetic concern for all agricultural problem for the omission of unnecessary interference of government with business for an end to government 's experiment in business and for more efficient business in government administration with all of this must attend a mindfulness of the human side of all activity so that social industrial and economic justice will be square with the purpose of a righteous people

 with the nation wide induction of womanhood into our political life we may count upon her intuition her refinement her intelligence and her influence to exalt the social order we count upon her exercise of the full privilege and the performance of the duty of citizenship to speed the attainment of the high state

 i wish for an america no less alert in guard against danger from within than it be watchful against enemy from without our fundamental law recognize no class no group no section there must be none in legislation or administration the supreme inspiration be the common weal humanity hunger for international peace and we crave it with all mankind my most reverent prayer for america be for industrial peace with its reward widely and generally distribute amid the inspiration of equal opportunity no one justly may deny the equality of opportunity which make we what we be we have mistake unpreparedness to embrace it to be a challenge of the reality and due concern for make all citizen fit for participation will give add strength of citizenship and magnify our achievement

 if revolution insist upon overturn establish order let other people make the tragic experiment there be no place for it in america when world war threaten civilization we pledge our resource and our life to its preservation and when revolution threaten we unfurl the flag of law and order and renew our consecration ours be a constitutional freedom where the popular will be the law supreme and minority be sacredly protect our revision reformation and evolution reflect a deliberate judgment and an orderly progress and we mean to cure our ill but never destroy or permit destruction by force

 i have rather submit our industrial controversy to the conference table in advance than to a settlement table after conflict and suffering the earth be thirst for the cup of good will understanding be its fountain source i would like to acclaim an era of good feeling amid dependable prosperity and all the blessing which attend

 it have be prove again and again that we can not while throw our market open to the world maintain american standard of living and opportunity and hold our industrial eminence in such unequal competition there isa lure fallacy in the theory of banish barrier of trade but preservedamerican standard require our high production cost to be reflect in our tariff on import today as never before when people be seek trade restoration and expansion we must adjust our tariff to the new order we seek participation in the world 's exchange because therein lie our way to widen influence and the triumph of peace we know full well we can not sell where we do not buy and we can not sell successfully where we do not carry opportunity be call not alone for the restoration but for a new era in production transportation and trade we shall answer it well by meet the demand of a surpass home market by promote self- reliance in production and by bid enterprise genius and efficiency to carry our cargo in american bottom to the mart of the world

 we would not have an america live within and for herself alone butwe would have her self reliant independent and ever nobler strong and rich believe in our high standard rear through constitutionalliberty and maintain opportunity we invite the world to the same height but pride in thing work be no reflex of a complete task common welfareis the goal of our national endeavor wealth be not inimical to welfare;it ought to be its friendly agency there never can be equality of rewardsor possession so long as the human plan contain varied talent and differingdegree of industry and thrift but ours ought to be a country free fromthe great blotch of distressed poverty we ought to find a way to guardagainst the peril and penalty of unemployment we want an america ofhome illumine with hope and happiness where mother free from thenecessity for long hour of toil beyond their own door may preside asbefit the hearthstone of american citizenship we want the cradle of americanchildhood rock under condition so wholesome and so hopeful that no blightmay touch it in its development and we want to provide that no selfishinterest no material necessity no lack of opportunity shall prevent thegaining of that education so essential to good citizenship

 there be no short cut to the making of these ideal into glad reality the world have witness again and again the futility and the mischief ofill consider remedy for social and economic disorder but we be mindfultoday as never before of the friction of modern industrialism and we mustlearn its cause and reduce its evil consequence by sober and tested method where genius have make for great possibility justice and happiness mustbe reflect in a great common welfare

 service be the supreme commitment of life i would rejoice to acclaimthe era of the golden rule and crown it with the autocracy of service i pledge an administration wherein all the agency of government be calledto serve and ever promote an understanding of government purely as anexpression of the popular will

 one can not stand in this presence and be unmindful of the tremendousresponsibility the world upheaval have add heavily to our task butwith the realization come the surge of high resolve and there be reassurancein belief in the god give destiny of our republic if i feel that thereis to be sole responsibility in the executive for the america of tomorrowi should shrink from the burden but here be a hundred million withcommon concern and shared responsibility answerable to god and country the republic summon they to their duty and i invite co operation

 i accept my part with single mindedness of purpose and humility of spirit and implore the favor and guidance of god in his heaven with these i amunafraid and confidently face the future

 i have take the solemn oath of office on that passage of holy writwherein it be ask what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god this i plight to godand country

my countryman the pioneer to whom i have oftentime allude these stalwart maker of america could have no conception of our present day attainment hamilton who conceive and washington who sponsor little dreamed of either a development or a solution like our of today but they be right in fundamental they know what be safe and preach security one may doubt if either of they if any of the founder would wish america to hold aloof from the world but there have come to we lately a new realization of the menace to our america in european entanglement which emphasize the prudence of washington though he could little have dream the thought which be in my mind

 when i sit on the senate committee on foreign relations and listen to american delegation appeal in behalf of kinsman or old home folk across the sea i catch the aspiration of nationality and the perfectly natural sympathy among kindre in this republic but i little realize then how we might rend the concord of american citizenship in our seek to solve old world problem there have come to i not at all unbecomingly the express anxiety of americans foreign bear who be ask our country 's future attitude on territorial award in the adjustment of peace they be americans all but they have a proper and a natural interest in the fortune of kinsfolk and native land one can not blame they if our land be to settle the envy rivalry jealousy and hatred of all civilization these adopt son of the republic want the settlement favorable to the land from which they come

 the misfortune be not alone that it rend the concord of nation the great pity be that it rend the concord of our citizenship at home it be folly to think of blend greek and bulgar italian and slovak or make any of they rejoicingly american when the land of adoption sit in judgement on the land from which he come we need to be rescue from divisionary and fruitless pursuit of peace through supergovernment i do not want americans of foreign birth make their party alignment on what we mean to do for some nation in the old world we want they to be republican because of what we mean to do for the united states of america our call be for unison not rival sympathy our need be concord not the antipathy of long inheritance

 surely no one stop to think where the great world experiment be lead frankly no one could know we be only learn now it would be a sorry day for this republic if we allow our activity in seek for peace in the old world to blind we to the essential of peace at home we want a free america again we want america free at home and free in the world we want to silence the outcry of nation against nation in the fullness of understanding and we wish to silence the cry of class against class and stifle the party appeal to class so that we may ensure tranquility in our own freedom if i could choose but one i have rather have industrial and social peace at home than command the international peace of all the world

there grow on i the realization of the unusual character of this occasion our republic have be at war before it have ask and receive the supreme sacrifice of its son and daughter and faith in america have be justify many son and daughter make the sublime offering and go to hallowed grave as the nation ’s defender but we never before send so many to battle under the flag in foreign land never before be there the impressive spectacle of thousand of dead return to find eternal resting place in the beloved homeland the incident be without parallel in history that i know

 these dead know nothing of our ceremony today they sense nothing of the sentiment or the tenderness which bring their waste body to the homeland for burial close to kin and friend and cherished association these poor body be but the clay tenement once possess of soul which flame in patriotic devotion light new hope on the battle ground of civilization and in their sacrifice speed on to accuse autocracy before the court of eternal justice

 we be not meet for they though we love and honor and speak a grateful tribute it would be futile to speak to those who do not hear or to sorrow for those who can not sense it or to exalt those who can not know but we can speak for country we can reach those who sorrow and sacrifice through their service who suffer through their going who glory with the republic through their heroic achievement who rejoice in the civilization their heroism preserve every funeral every memorial every tribute be for the living an offering in compensation of sorrow when the light of life go out there be a new radiance in eternity and somehow the glow of it relieve the darkness which be leave behind

 never a death but somewhere a new life never a sacrifice but somewhere an atonement never a service but somewhere and somehow an achievement these have serve which be the supreme inspiration in living they have earn everlasting gratitude which be the supreme solace in die

 no one may measure the vast and varied affection and sorrow center on this priceless cargo of bodies-- once live fight for and finally die for the republic one ’s word fail his understanding be halt his emotion be stir beyond control when contemplate these thousand of beloved dead i find a hundred thousand sorrow touch my heart and there be ring in my ear like an admonition eternal an insistent call it must not be again it must not be again god grant that it will not be and let a practical people join in cooperation with god to the end that it shall not be

 i would not wish a nation for which man be not willing to fight and if need be to die but i do wish for a nation where it be not necessary to ask that sacrifice i do not pretend that millennial day have come but i can believe in the possibility of a nation be so righteous as never to make a war of conquest and a nation so powerful in righteousness that none will dare invoke her wrath i wish for we such an america these hero be sacrifice in the supreme conflict of all human history they see democracy challenge and defend it they see civilization threaten and rescue it they see america affront and resent it they see our nation ’s right imperil and stamp those right with a new sanctity and renew security



 they give all which man and woman can give we shall give our most and well if we make certain that they do not die in vain we shall not forget no matter whether they lie amid the sweetness and the bloom of the homeland or sleep in the soil they crimson our mindfulness our gratitude our reverence shall be in the preserved republic and maintain liberty and the supreme justice for which they die

 not in recording see speaks john c. addresses of president warren g. harding 1921 1923 washington government printing office 1921

gentleman of the conference the united states welcome you with unselfish hand we harbor no fear we have no sordid end to serve we suspect no enemy we contemplate or apprehend no conquest content with what we have we seek nothing which be another ’s we only wish to do with you that fine nobler thing which no nation can do alone

 we wish to sit with you at the table of international understanding and good will in good conscience we be eager to meet you frankly and invite and offer cooperation the world demand a sober contemplation of the exist order and the realization that there can be no cure without sacrifice not by one of we but by all of we

 i do not mean surrendered right or narrow freedom or deny aspiration or ignore national necessity our republic would no more ask for these than it would give no pride need be humble no nationality submerge but i would have a mergence of mind commit all of we to less preparation for war and more enjoyment of fortunate peace

 the high hope come of the spirit of our come together it be but just to recognize varying need and peculiar position nothing can be accomplish in disregard of national apprehension rather we should act together to remove the cause of apprehension this be not to be do in intrigue great assurance be find in the exchange of simple honesty and directness among man resolve to accomplish as become leader among nation when civilization itself have come to its crucial test

 it be not to be challenge that government fail when the excess of its cost rob the people of the way to happiness and the opportunity to achieve if the fine sentiment be not urge the cold hard fact of excessive cost and the eloquence of economic would urge we to reduce our armament if the concept of a well order do not appeal then let we ponder the burden and the blight of continued competition

 it be not to be deny that the world have swing along throughout the age without heed this call from the kindly heart of man but the same world never before be so tragically bring to realization of the utter futility of passion ’s sway when reason and conscience and fellowship point a nobler way

 i can speak officially only for our united states our hundred million frankly want less of armament and none of war wholly free from guile sure in our own mind that we harbor no unworthy design we accredit the world with the same good intent so i welcome you not alone in good will and high purpose but with high faith

 we be meet for a service to mankind in all simplicity in all honesty and all honor there may be write here the avowal of world conscience refine by the consume fire of war and make more sensitive by the anxious aftermath i hope for that understanding which will emphasize the guarantee of peace and for commitment to less burden and a well order which will tranquilize the world in such an accomplishment there will be add glory to your flag and our and the rejoicing of mankind will make the transcend music of all succeed time

it be a very gratifying privilege to come to the congress with the republic at peace with all the nation of the world more it be equally gratifying to report that our country be not only free from every impending menace of war but there be grow assurance of the permanency of the peace which we so deeply cherish   for approximately ten year we have dwell amid menace of war or as participant in war 's actuality and the inevitable aftermath with its disorder condition bit add to the difficulty of government which adequately can not be appraise except by those who be in immediate contact and know the responsibility our task would be less difficult if we have only ourselves to consider but so much of the world be involve the disorder condition be so well nigh universal even among nation not engage in actual warfare that no permanent readjustment can be effect without consideration of our inescapable relationship to world affair in finance and trade indeed we should be unworthy of our good tradition if we be unmindful of social moral and political condition which be not of direct concern to we but which do appeal to the human sympathy and the very become interest of a people blest with our national good fortune   it be not my purpose to bring to you a program of world restoration in the main such a program must be work out by the nation more directly concern they must themselves turn to the heroic remedy for the menacing condition under which they be struggle then we can help and we mean to help we shall do so unselfishly because there be compensation in the consciousness of assist selfishly because the commerce and international exchange in trade which mark our high tide of fortunate advancement be possible only when the nation of all continent be restore to stable order and normal relationship   in the main the contribution of this republic to restore normalcy in the world must come through the initiative of the executive branch of the government but the good of intention and most carefully consider purpose would fail utterly if the sanction and the cooperation of congress be not cheerfully accord   i be very sure we shall have no conflict of opinion about constitutional duty or authority during the anxiety of war when necessity seem compelling there be excessive grant of authority and all extraordinary concentration of power in the chief executive the repeal of war time legislation and the automatic expiration which attend the peace proclamation have put an end to these emergency excess but i have the wish to go far than that i want to join you in restore in the most cordial way the spirit of coordination and cooperation and that mutuality of confidence and respect which be necessary ill representative popular government   encroachment upon the function of congress or attempt dictation of its policy be not to be think of much less attempted but there be all insistent call for harmony of purpose and concord of action to speed the solution of the difficult problem confront both the legislative and executive branch of the government   it be worth while to make allusion here to the character of our government mindful as one must be that an address to you be no less a message to all our people for whom you speak most intimately ours be it popular government through political party we divide along political line and i would ever have it so i do not mean that partisan preference should hinder any public servant in the performance of a conscientious and patriotic official duty we see partisan line utterly obliterate when war imperil and our faith in the republic be rivet anew we ought not to find these partisan line obstruct the expeditious solution of the urgent problem of peace   grant that we be fundamentally a representative popular government with political party the govern agency i believe the political party in power should assume responsibility determine upon policy ill the conference which supplement convention and election campaign and then strive for achievement through adherence to the accept policy   there be vastly great security immensely more of the national viewpoint much large and prompter accomplishment where our division be along party line in the broad and loftier sense than to divide geographically or accord to pursuit or personal following for a century and a third party have be charge with responsibility and hold to strict accounting when they fail they be relieve of authority and the system have bring its to a national eminence no less than a world example   necessarily legislation be a matter of compromise the full ideal be seldom attain in that meeting of mind necessary to insure result there must and will be accommodation and compromise but in the estimate of conviction and sincere purpose the supreme responsibility to national interest must not be ignore the shield to the high minded public servant who adhere to party policy be manif but the high purpose be the good of the republic as a whole   it would be ungracious to withhold acknowledgment of the really large volume and excellent quality of work accomplish by the extraordinary session of congress which so recently adjourn i be not unmindful of the very difficult task with which you be call to deal and no one can ignore the insistent condition which during recent year have call for the continued and almost exclusive attention of your membership to public work it would suggest insincerity if i express complete accord with every expression record in your roll call but we be all agree about the difficulty and the inevitable divergence of opinion in seek the reduction amelioration and readjustment of the burden of taxation later on when other problem be solve i shall make some recommendation about renew consideration of our tax program but for the immediate time before we we must be content with the billion dollar reduction in the tax draft upon the people and diminish irritation banish uncertainty and improved method of collection by your sustainment of the rigid economy already inaugurate with hope for extension of these economy and add efficiency in administration i believe further reduction may be enact and hinder burden abolish   in these urgent economy we shall be immensely assist by the budget system for which you make provision in the extraordinary session the first budget be before you its preparation be a signal achievement and the perfection of the system a thing impossible in the few month available for its initial trial will mark its enactment as the beginning of the great reformation in governmental practice since the beginning of the republic   there be pende a grant of authority to the administrative branch of the government for the funding and settlement of our vast foreign loan grow out of our grant of war credit with the hand of the executive branch hold impotent to deal with these debt we be hinder urgent readjustment among our debtor and accomplish nothing for ourselves i think it be fair for the congress to assume that the executive branch of the government would adopt no major policy in deal with these matter which would conflict with the purpose of congress in authorize the loan certainly not without ask congressional approval but there be minor problem incident to prudent loan transaction and the safeguarding of our interest which can not even be attempt without this authorization it will be helpful to ourselves and it will improve condition among our debtor if funding and the settlement of defaulted interest may be negotiate   the previous congress deeply concerned in behalf of our merchant marine in 1920 enact the exist shipping law design for the upbuilding of the american merchant marine among other thing provide to encourage our shipping on the world 's sea the executive be direct to give notice of the termination of all exist commercial treaty in order to admit of reduce duty on import carry in american bottom during the life of the act no executive have comply with this order of the congress when the present administration come into responsibility it begin an early inquiry into the failure to execute the express purpose of the jones act only one conclusion have be possible frankly member of house and senate eager as i be to join you in the making of an american merchant marine commensurate with our commerce the denouncement of out commercial treaty would involve we in a chaos of trade relationship and add indescribably to the confusion of the already disorder commercial world our power to do so be not dispute but power and ship without comity of relationship will not give we the expand trade which be inseparably link with a great merchant marine moreover the applied reduction of duty for which the treaty denouncement be necessary encourage only the carrying of dutiable import to our shore while the tonnage which unfurl the flag on the sea be both free and dutiable and the cargo which make it nation eminent in trade be outgoing rather than incoming   it be not my thought to lay the problem before you in detail today it be desire only to say to you that the executive branch of the government uninfluence by the protest of any nation for none have be make be well convinced that your proposal highly intended and heartily support here be so fraught with difficulty and so mark by tendency to discourage trade expansion that i invite your tolerance of noncompliance for only a few week until a plan may be present which contemplate no great draft upon the public treasury and which though yet too crude to offer it to day give such promise of expand our merchant marine that it will argue its own approval it be enough to say to day that we be so possessed of ship and the american intention to establish it merchant marine be so unalterable that a plain of reimbursement at no other cost than be contemplate in the exist act will appeal to the pride and encourage the hope of all the american people   there be before you the completion of the enactment of what have be term a permanent tariff law the word permanent be use to distinguish it from the emergency act which the congress expedite early in the extraordinary session and which be the law today i can not too strongly urge in early completion of this necessary legislation it be need to stabilize our industry at home it be essential to make more definite our trade relation abroad more it be vital to the preservation of many of our own industry which contribute so notably to the very lifeblood of our nation   there be now and there always will be a storm of conflicting opinion about any tariff revision we can not go far wrong when we base our tariff on the policy of preserve the productive activity which enhance employment and add to our national prosperity   again come the reminder that we must not be unmindful of world condition that people be struggle for industrial rehabilitation and that we can not dwell in industrial and commercial exclusion and at the same time do the just thing in aid world reconstruction and readjustment we do not seek a selfish aloofness and we could not profit by it be it possible we recognize the necessity of buy wherever we sell and the permanency of trade lie in its acceptable exchange in our pursuit of market we must give as well as receive we can not sell to other who do not produce nor can we buy unless we produce at home sensible of every obligation of humanity commerce and finance link as they be in the present world condition it be not to be argue that we need destroy ourselves to be helpful to other with all my heart i wish restoration to the people blight by the awful world war but the process of restoration do not lie in our acceptance of like condition it be well to remain on firm ground strive for ample employment and high standard of wage at home and point the way to balanced budget rigid economy and resolute efficient work as the necessary remedy to cure disaster   everything relate to trade among ourselves and among nation have be expand excessive inflated abnormal and there be a madness in finance which no american policy alone will cure we be a creditor nation not by normal process but make so by war it be not an unworthy selfishness to seek to save ourselves when the process of that salvation be not only not deny to other but commend to they we seek to undermine for other no industry by which they subsist we be obligate to permit the undermining of none of our own which make for employment and maintain activity   every contemplation it little matter in which direction one turn magnify the difficulty of tariff legislation but the necessity of the revision be magnify with it doubtless we be justify in seek .1 more flexible policy than we have provide heretofore i hope a way will be find to make for flexibility and elasticity so that rate may be adjust to meet unusual and change condition which can not be accurately anticipate there be problem incident to unfair practice and to exchange which madness in money have make almost unsolvable i know of no manner in which to effect this flexibility other than the extension of the power of the tariff commission so that it can adapt itself to it scientific and wholly just administration of the law   i be not unmindful of the constitutional difficulty these can be meet by give authority to the chief executive who could proclaim additional duty to meet condition which the congress may designate   at this point i must disavow any desire to enlarge the executive 's power or add to the responsibility of the office they be already too large if there be any other plan i would prefer it   the grant of authority to proclaim would necessarily bring the tariff commission into new and enlarged activity because no executive could discharge such a duty except upon the information acquire and recommendation make by this commission but the plan be feasible and the proper functioning of the board would give its it well administration of a define policy than ever can be make possible by tariff duty prescribe without flexibility   there be a manifest difference of opinion about the merit of american valuation many nation have adopt delivery valuation as the basis for collect duty that is they take the cost of the import deliver at the port of entry as the basis for levy duty it be no radical departure in view of vary condition and the disorder state of money value to provide for american valuation but there can not be ignore the danger of such a valuation bring to the level of our own production cost make our tariff prohibitive it might do so in many instance where import ought to be encourage i believe congress ought well consider the desirability of the only promising alternative namely a provision authorize proclaim american valuation under prescribed condition on any give list of article import   in this propose flexibility authorize increase to meet condition so likely to change there should also be provision for decrease a rate may be just to day and entirely out of proportion six month from to day if our tariff be to be make equitable and not necessarily burden our import and hinder our trade abroad frequent adjustment will be necessary for year to come know the impossibility of modification by act of congress for any one or a score of line without involve a long array of schedule i think we shall go a long way toward stabilization if there be recognition of the tariff commission 's fitness to recommend urgent change by proclamation   i be sure about public opinion favor the early determination of our tariff policy there have be reassuring sign of a business revival from the deep slump which all the world have be experience our unemployment which give its deep concern only a few week ago have grow encouragingly less and new assurance and renew confidence will attend the congressional declaration that american industry will be hold secure   much have be say about the protective policy for ourselves make it impossible for our debtor to discharge their obligation to we this be a contention not now press for decision if we must choose between a people in idleness press for the payment of indebtedness or a people resume the normal way of employment and carry the credit let we choose the latter sometimes we appraise large the human ill most vivid in our mind we have be give and be give now of our influence and appeal to minimize the likelihood of war and throw off the crush burden of armament it be all very earnest with a national soul impel but a people unemploye and gaunt with hunger face a situation quite as dishearten as war and our great obligation to day be to do the government 's part toward resume productivity and promote fortunate and remunerative employment   something more than tariff protection be require by american agriculture to the farmer have come the early and the heavy burden of readjustment there be actual depression in our agricultural industry while agricultural prosperity be absolutely essential to the general prosperity of the country   congress have seek very earnestly to provide relief it have promptly give such temporary relief as have be possible but the call be insistent for the permanent solution it be inevitable that large crop lower the price and short crop advance they no legislation can cure that fundamental law but there must be some economic solution for the excessive variation in return for agricultural production   it be rather shocking to be tell and to have the statement strongly support that 9,000,000 bale of cotton raise on american plantation in a give year will actually be worth more to the producer than 13,000,000 bale would have be equally shocking be the statement that 700,000,000 bushel of wheat raise by american farmer would bring they more money than a billion bushel yet these be not exaggerated statement in a world where there be ten of million who need food and clothing which they can not get such a condition be sure to indict the social system which make it possible   in the main the remedy lie in distribution and marketing every proper encouragement should be give to the cooperative marketing program these have prove very helpful to the cooperate community in europe in russia the cooperative community have become the recognize bulwark of law and order and save individualism from engulfment in social paralysis ultimately they will be accredit with the salvation of the russian state   there be the appeal for this experiment why not try it no one challenge the right of the farmer to a large share of the consumer 's pay for his product no one dispute that we can not live without the farmer he be justify in rebel against the transportation cost give a fair return for his labor he will have less occasion to appeal for financial aid and give assurance that his labor shall not be in vain we reassure all the people of a production sufficient to meet our national requirement and guard against disaster   the base of the pyramid of civilization which rest upon the soil be shrink through the drift of population from farm to city for a generation we have be express more or less concern about this tendency economist have warn and statesman have deplore we think for at time that modern convenience and the more intimate contact would halt the movement but it have go steadily on perhaps only grim necessity will correct it but we ought to find a less drastic remedy   the exist scheme of adjust freight rate have be favor the basing point until industry be attract to some center and repel from other a great volume of uneconomic and wasteful transportation have attend and the cost increase accordingly the grain mill and meat pack industry afford ample illustration and the attend concentration be readily apparent the menace in concentration be not limit to the retardingly influence on agriculture manifestly the condition and term of railway transportation ought not be permit to increase this undesirable tendency we have a just pride in our great city but we shall find a great pride in the nation which have it large distribution of its population into the country where comparatively self sufficient small community may blend agricultural and manufacturing interest in harmonious helpfulness and enhance good fortune such a movement contemplate no destruction of thing work of investment make or wealth involve it only look to a general policy of transportation of distribute industry and of highway construction to encourage the spread of our population and restore the proper balance between city and country the problem may well have your earnest attention   it have be perhaps the proud claim of our american civilization that in deal with human relationship it have constantly move toward such justice in distribute the product of human energy that it have improve continuously the economic status of the mass of people our have be a highly productive social organization on the way up from the elemental stage of society we have eliminate slavery and serfdom and be now far on the way to the elimination of poverty   through the eradication of illiteracy and the diffussion of education mankind have reach a stage where we may fairly say that in the united states equality of opportunity have be attain though all be not prepared to embrace it there be indeed a too great divergence between the economic condition of the most and the least favor class in the community but even that divergence have now come to the point where we bracket the very poor and the very rich together as the least fortunate class our effort may well be direct to improve the status of both   while this set of problem be commonly comprehend under the general phrase capital and labor it be really vastly broad it be a question of social and economic organization labor have become a large contributor through its saving to the stock of capital while the people who own the large individual aggregate of capital be themselves often hard and earnest laborer very often it be extremely difficult to draw the line of demarcation between the two group to determine whether a particular individual be entitle to be set down as laborer or as capitalist in a very large proportion of case he be both and when he be both he be the most useful citizen   the right of labor to organize be just as fundamental and necessary as be the right of capital to organize the right of labor to negotiate to deal with and solve its particular problem in an organize way through its choose agent be just as essential as be the right of capital to organize to maintain corporation to limit the liability of stockholder indeed we have come to recognize that the limited liability of the citizen as a member of a labor organization closely parallel the limitation of liability of the citizen as a stockholder in a corporation for profit along this line of reasoning we shall make the great progress toward solution of our problem of capital and labor   in the case of the corporation which enjoy the privilege of limited liability of stockholder particularly when engage in in the public service it be recognize that the outside public have a large concern which must be protect and so we provide regulation restriction and in some case detailed supervision likewise in the case of labor organization we might well apply similar and equally well define principle of regulation and supervision in order to conserve the public 's interest as affect by their operation   just as it be not desirable that a corporation shall be allow to impose undue exaction upon the public so it be not desirable that a labor organization shall be permit to exact unfair term of employment or subject the public to actual distress in order to enforce its term finally just as we be earnestly seek for procedure whereby to adjust and settle political difference between nation without resort to war so we may well look about for mean to settle the difference between organized capital and organized labor without resort to those form of warfare which we recognize under the name of strike lockout boycott and the like   as we have great body of law carefully regulate the organization and operation of industrial and financial corporation as we have treaty and compact among nation which look to the settlement of difference without the necessity of conflict in arm so we might well have plan of conference of common counsel of mediation arbitration and judicial determination in controversy between labor and capital to accomplish this would involve the necessity to develop a thoroughgoe code of practice in deal with such affair it might be well to frankly set forth the superior interest of the community as a whole to either the labor group or the capital group with right privilege immunity and mode of organization thus carefully define it should be possible to set up judicial or quasi judicial tribunal for the consideration and determination of all dispute which menace the public welfare   in an industrial society such as ours the strike the lockout and the boycott be as much out of place and as disastrous in their result as be war or armed revolution in the domain of politic the same disposition to reasonableness to conciliation to recognition of the other side 's point of view the same provision of fair and recognize tribunal and process ought to make it possible to solve the one set of question aseasily as the other i believe the solution be possible   the consideration of such a policy would necessitate the exercise of care and deliberation in the construction of a code and a charter of elemental right deal with the relation of employer and employee this foundation in the law deal with the modern condition of social and economic life would hasten the building of the temple of peace in industry which a rejoice nation would acclaim   after each war until the last the government have be enable to give home to its return soldier and a large part of our settlement and development have attend this generous provision of land for the nation 's defender   there be yet unreserve approximately 200,000,000 acre in the public domain 20,000,000 acre of which be know to be susceptible of reclamation and make fit for home by provision for irrigation   the government have be assist in the development of its remain land until the estimate increase in land value in the irrigated section be full $ 500,000,000 and the crop of 1920 alone on these land be estimate to exceed $ 100,000,000 under the law authorization these expenditure for development the advance be to be return and it would be good business for the government to provide lor the reclamation of the remain 20,000,000 acre in addition to expedite the completion of project long under way   under what be know as the coal and gas lease law applicable also to deposit of phosphate and other mineral on the public domain lease be now be make on the royalty basis and be produce large revenue to the government under this legislation 10 per centum of all royalty be to be pay directly to the federal treasury and of the remainder 50 per centum be to be use for reclamation of arid land by irrigation and 40 per centum be to be pay to the states in which the operation be locate to be use by they for school and road purpose   these resource be so vast and the development be afford so reliable a basis of estimate that the interior department express the belief that ultimately the present law will add in royalty and payment to the treasury of the federal government and the states contain these public land a total of $ 12,000,000,000 this mean of course an add wealth of many time that sum these prospect seem to afford every justification of government advance in reclamation and irrigation   contemplate the inevitable and desirable increase of population there be another phase of reclamation full worthy of consideration there be 79,000,000 acre of swamp and cut over land which may be reclaim and make as valuable as any farm land we possess these acre be largely locate in southern states and the great proportion be own by the states or by private citizen congress have a report of the survey of this field for reclamation and the feasibility be establish i gladly commend federal aid by way of advance where state and private participation be assure   home making be one of the great benefit which government can bestow measure be pende embody this sound policy to which we may well adhere it be easily possible to make available permanent home which will provide in turn for prosperous american family without injurious competition with established activity or imposition on wealth already acquire   while we be think of promote the fortune of our own people i be sure there be room in the sympathetic thought of america for fellow human being who be suffer and die of starvation in russia a severe drought in the valley of the volga have plunge 15,000,000 people into grievous famine our voluntary agency be exert themselves to the utmost to save the life of child in this area but it be now evident that unless relief be afford the loss of life will extend into many million america can not be deaf to such a call as that   we do not recognize the government of russia nor tolerate the propaganda which emanate therefrom but we do not forget the tradition of russian friendship we may put aside our consideration of all international politic and fundamental difference in government the big thing be the call of the suffering and the dying unreservedly i recommend the appropriation necessary to supply the american relief administration with 10,000,000 bushel of corn and 1,000,000 bushel of seed grain not alone to halt the wave of death through starvation but to enable spring planting in area where the seed grain have be exhaust temporarily to stem starvation   the american relief administration be direct in russia by former officer of our own army and have fully demonstrate its ability to transport and distribute relief through american hand without hindrance or loss the time have come to add the government 's support to the wonderful relief already work out of the generosity of the american private purse   i be not unaware that we have suffer and privation at home when it exceed the capacity for the relief within the states concern it will have federal consideration it seem to i we should be indifferent to our own heart prompting and out of accord with the spirit which acclaim the christmastide if we do not give out of our national abundance to lighten this burden of woe upon a people blameless and helpless in famine 's peril   there be a full score of topic concern which it would be become to address you and on which i hope to make report at a later time i have allude to the thing require your early attention however i can not end this limited address without a suggest amendment to the organic law   many of we belong to that school of thought which be hesitant about alter the fundamental law i think our tax problem the tendency of wealth to seek nontaxable investment and the menacing increase of public debt federal state and municipal all justify a proposal to change the constitution so as to end the issue of nontaxable bond no action can change the status of the many billion outstanding but we can guard against future encouragement of capital 's paralysis while a halt in the growth of public indebtedness would be beneficial throughout our whole land   such a change in the constitution must be very thoroughly consider before submission there ought to be know what influence it will have on the inevitable refunding of our vast national debt how it will operate on the necessary refunding of state and municipal debt how the advantage of nation over state and municipality or the contrary may be avoid clearly the states would not ratify to their own apparent disadvantage i suggest the consideration because the drift of wealth into nontaxable security be hinder the flow of large capital to our industry manufacturing agricultural and carry until we be discourage the very activity which make our wealth   agreeable to your express desire and in complete accord with the purpose of the executive branch of the government there be in washington as you happily know an international conference now most earnestly at work on plan for the limitation of armament a naval holiday and the just settlement of problem which might develop into cause of international disagreement   it be easy to believe a world hope be center on this capital city a most gratifying world accomplishment be not improbable
member of the congress so many problem be call for solution that a recital of all of they in the face of the known limitation of a short session of congress would seem to lack sincerity of purpose it be four year since the world war end but the inevitable readjustment of the social and economic order be not more than barely begin there be no acceptance of pre war condition anywhere in the world in a very general way humanity harbor individual wish to go on with war time compensation for production with pre war requirement in expenditure in short everyone speak broadly crave readjustment for everybody except himself while there can be no just and permanent readjustment except when all participate the civilization which measure its strength of genius and the power of science and the resource of industry in addition to test the limit of man power and the endurance and heroism of man and woman that same civilization be bring to its severe test in restore a tranquil order and commit humanity to the stable way of peace if the sober and deliberate appraisal of pre war civilization make it seem a worth while inheritance then with patience and good courage it will be preserve there never again will be precisely the old order indeed i know of no one who think it to be desirable for out of the old order come the war itself and the new order establish and make secure never will permit its recurrence it be no figure of speech to say we have come to the test of our civilization the world have be pass be today pass through of a great crisis the conduct of war itself be not more difficult than the solution of the problem which necessarily follow i be not speak at this moment of the problem in its wide aspect of world rehabilitation or of international relationship the reference be to our own social financial and economic problem at home these thing be not to be consider solely as problem apart from all international relationship but every nation must be able to carry on for itself else its international relationship will have scant importance doubtless our own people have emerge from the world war tumult less impaired than most belligerent power probably we have make large progress toward reconstruction surely we have be fortunate in diminish unemployment and our industrial and business activity which be the lifeblood of our material existence have be restore as in no other reconstruction period of like length in the history of the world have we escape the coal and railway strike which have no excuse for their beginning and less justification for their delay settlement we should have do infinitely well but labor be insistent on hold to the war height and heedless force of reaction seek the pre war level and both be wrong in the folly of conflict our progress be hinder and the heavy cost have not yet be fully estimate there can be neither adjustment nor the penalty of the failure to readjust in which all do not somehow participate the railway strike accentuate the difficulty of the american farmer the first distress of readjustment come to the farmer and it will not lie a readjustment fit to abide until he be relieve the distress bring to the farmer do not affect he alone agricultural ill fortune be a national ill fortune that one fourth of our population which produce the food of the republic and add so largely to our export commerce must participate in the good fortune of the nation else there be none worth retain agriculture be a vital activity in our national life in it we have our beginning and its westward march with the star of the empire have reflect the growth of the republic it have its vicissitude which no legislation will prevent its hardship for which no law can provide escape but the congress can make available to the farmer the financial facility which have be build up under government aid and supervision for other commercial and industrial enterprise it may be do on the same solid fundamental and make the vitally important agricultural industry more secure and it must be do this congress already have take cognizance of the misfortune which precipitate deflation bring to american agriculture your measure of relief and the reduction of the federal reserve discount rate undoubtedly save the country from widespread disaster the very proof of helpfulness already give be the strong argument for the permanent establishment of widen credit heretofore temporarily extend through the war finance corporation the farm loan bureau which already have prove its usefulness through the federal land bank may well have its power enlarge to provide ample farm production credit as well as enlarged land credit it be entirely practical to create a division in the federal land bank to deal with production credit with the limitation of time so adjusted to the farm turnover as the federal reserve system provide for the turnover in the manufacturing and mercantile world special provision must be make for live stock production credit and the limit of land loan may be safely enlarge various measure be pende before you and the good judgment of congress ought to be express in a prompt enactment at the present session but american agriculture need more than add credit facility the credit will help to solve the press problem grow out of war inflate land value and the drastic deflation of three year ago but permanent and deserved agricultural good fortune depend on well and cheap transportation here be an outstanding problem demand the most rigorous consideration of the congress and the country it have to do with more than agriculture it provide the channel for the flow of the country 's commerce but the farmer be particularly hard hit his market so affected by the world consumption do not admit of the price adjustment to meet carry charge in the last half of the year now close the railway break in carry capacity because of motive power and roll stock out of order though insistently declare to the contrary embargo his shipment or deny he car when fortunate market be call too frequently transportation fail while perishable product be turn from possible profit to loss count in ten of million i know of no problem exceed in importance this one of transportation in our complex and interdependent modern life transportation be essential to our very existence let we pass for the moment the menace in the possible paralysis of such service as we have and note the failure for whatever reason to expand our transportation to meet the nation 's need the census of 1880 record a population of 50,000,000 in two decade more we may reasonably expect to count thrice that number in the three decade end in 1920 the country 's freight by rail increase from 631,000,000 ton to 2,234,000,000 ton that be to say while our population be increase less than 70 per cent the freight movement increase over 250 per cent we have build 40 per cent of the world 's railroad mileage and yet find it inadequate to our present requirement when we contemplate the inadequacy of to day it be easy to believe that the next few decade will witness the paralysis of our transportation use social scheme or a complete reorganization on some new basis mindful of the tremendous cost of betterment extension and expansion and mindful of the staggering debt of the world to day the difficulty be magnify here be a problem demand wide vision and the avoidance of mere makeshift no matter what the error of the past no matter how we acclaim construction and then condemn operation in the past we have the transportation and the honest investment in the transportation which speed we on to what we be and we face condition which reflect its inadequacy to day its great inadequacy to morrow and we contemplate transportation cost which much of the traffic can not and will not continue to pay manifestly we have nee to begin on plan to coordinate all transportation facility we should more effectively connect up our rail line with our carrier by sea we ought to reap some benefit from the hundred of million expend on inland waterway prove our capacity to utilize as well as expend we ought to turn the motor truck into a railway feeder and distributor instead of a destroy competitor it would be folly to ignore that we live in a motor age the motor car reflect our standard of living and gauge the speed of our present day life it long ago run down simple living and never halt to inquire about the prostrate figure which fall as its victim with full recognition of motor car transportation we must turn it to the most practical use it can not supersede the railway line no matter how generously we afford it highway out of the public treasury if freight traffic by motor be charge with its proper and proportionate share of highway construction we should find much of it wasteful and more costly than like service by rail yet we have parallel the railway a most natural line of construction and thereby take away from the agency of expect service much of its profitable traffic which the taxpayer have be provide the highway whose cost of maintenance be not yet realize the federal government have a right to inquire into the wisdom of this policy because the national treasury be contribute largely to this highway construction costly highway ought to be make to serve as feeder rather than competitor of the railroad and the motor truck should become a coordinate factor in our great distribute system this transportation problem can not be waive aside the demand for lower cost on farm product and basic material can not be ignore rate horizontally increase to meet increase wage outlay during the war inflation be not easily reduce when some very moderate wage reduction be effect last summer there be a 5 per cent horizontal reduction in rate i seek at that time in a very informal way to have the railway manager go before the interstate commerce commission and agree to a heavy reduction on farm product and coal and other basic commodity and leave unchanged the freight tariff which a very large portion of the traffic be able to bear neither the manager nor the commission tile suggestion so we have the horizontal reduction see fit to adopt too slight to be feel by the high class cargoe and too little to benefit the heavy tonnage call most loudly for relief railway be not to be expect to render the most essential service in our social organization without a fair return on capital invest but the government have go so far in the regulation of rate and rule of operation that it have the responsibility of point the way to the reduce freight cost so essential to our national welfare government operation do not afford the cure it be government operation which bring we to the very order of thing against which we now rebel and we be still liquidate the cost of that supreme folly surely the genius of the railway builder have not become extinct among the railway manager new economy new efficiency in cooperation must be find the fact that labor take 50 to 60 per cent of total railway earning make limitation within which to effect economy very difficult but the demand be no less insistent on that account clearly the manager be without that intercarrier cooperative relationship so highly essential to the good and most economical operation they could not function in harmony when the strike threaten the paralysis of all railway transportation the relationship of rail service to public welfare so intimately affect by state and federal regulation demand the effective correlation and a concerted drive to meet an insistent and justified public demand the merger of line into system a facilitated interchange of freight car the economic use of terminal and the consolidation of facility be suggest way of economy and efficiency i remind you that congress provide a joint commission of agricultural inquiry which make an exhaustive investigation of car service and transportation and unanimously recommend in its report of october 15 1921 the pooling of freight car under a central agency this report well deserve your serious consideration i think well of the central agency which shall be a creation of the railway themselves to provide under the jurisdiction of the interstate commerce commission the mean for financing equipment for carrier which be otherwise unable to provide their proportion of car equipment adequate to transportation need this same agency ought to point the way to every possible economy in maintain equipment and the necessary interchange in railway commerce in a previous address to the congress i call to your attention the insufficiency of power to enforce the decision of the railroad labor board carrier have ignore its decision on the one hand railway workman have challenge its decision by a strike on the other hand the intent of congress to establish a tribunal to which railway labor and manager may appeal respect question of wage and working condition can not be too strongly commend it be vitally important that some such agency should be a guaranty against suspend operation the public must be spare even the threat of discontinued service sponsor the railroad as we do it be an obligation that labor shall be assure the high justice and every proper consideration of wage and working condition but it be an equal obligation to see that no concerted action in force demand shall deprive the public of the transportation service essential to its very existence it be now impossible to safeguard public interest because the decree of the board be unenforceable against either employer or employee the labor board itself be not so constituted as good to serve the public interest with six partisan member on a board of nine three partisan nominate by the employee and three by the railway manager it be inevitable that the partisan viewpoint be maintain throughout hearing and in decision hand down indeed the few exception to a strictly partisan expression in decision thus far render have be follow by accusation of betrayal of the partisan interest represent only the public group of three be free to function in unbiased decision therefore the partisan membership may well be abolish and decision should be make by an impartial tribunal i be well convinced that the function of this tribunal could be much well carry on here in washington even be it to be continue as a separate tribunal there ought to be contact with the interstate commerce commission which have supreme authority in the rate making to which wage cost bear an indissoluble relationship theoretically a fair and living wage must be determine quite apart from the employer 's earning capacity but in practice in the railway service they be inseparable the record of advanced rate to meet increase wage both determine by the government be proof enough the substitution of a labor division in the interstate commerce commission make up from its membership to hear and decide dispute relate to wage and working condition which have fail of adjustment by proper committee create by the railway and their employee offer a more effective plan it need not be surprising that there be dissatisfaction over delay hearing and decision by the present board when every trivial dispute be carry to that tribunal the law should require the railroad and their employee to institute mean and method to negotiate between themselves their constantly arise difference limit appeal to the government tribunal to dispute of such character as be likely to affect the public welfare this suggest substitution will involve a necessary increase in the membership of the commission probably four to constitute the labor division if the suggestion appeal to the congress it will be well to specify that the labor division shall be constitute of representative of the four rate make territory thereby assure a tribunal conversant with the condition which obtain in the different ratemaking section of the country i wish i could bring to you the precise recommendation for the prevention of strike which threaten the welfare of the people and menace public safety it be an impotent civilization and an inadequate government which lack the genius and the courage to guard against such a menace to public welfare as we experience last summer you be aware of the government 's great concern and its futile attempt to aid in an adjustment it will reveal the inexcusable obstinacy which be responsible for so much distress to the country to recall now that though all dispute be not yet adjust the many settlement which have be make be on the term which the government propose in mediation public interest demand that ample power shall be confer upon the labor tribunal whether it be the present board or the suggest substitute to require its ruling to be accept by both party to a dispute question let there be no confusion about the purpose of the suggest conferment of power to make decision effective there can be no denial of constitutional right of either railway workman or railway manager no man can be deny his right to labor when and how he choose or cease to labor when he so elect but since the government assume to safeguard his interest while employ in an essential public service the security of society itself demand his retirement from the service shall not be so time and relate as to effect the destruction of that service this vitally essential public transportation service demand so much of brain and brawn so much for efficiency and security ought to offer the most attractive working condition and the high of wage pay to workman in any employment in essentially every branch from track repairer to the man at the locomotive throttle the railroad worker be responsible for the safety of human life and the care of vast property his high responsibility might well rate high his pay within the limit the traffic will bear but the same responsibility plus grovernmental protection may justly deny he and his associate a withdrawal from service without a warning or under circumstance which involve the paralysis of necessary transportation we have assume so great a responsibility in necessary regulation that we unconsciously have assume the responsibility for maintain service therefore the lawful power for the enforcement of decision be necessary to sustain the majesty of government and to administer to the public welfare during its long session the present congress enact a new tariff law the protection of the american standard of living demand the insurance it provide against the distorted condition of world commerce the framer of the law make provision for a certain flexibility of custom duty whereby it be possible to readjust they as develop condition may require the enactment have impose a large responsibility upon the executive but that responsibility will be discharge with a broad mindfulness of the whole business situation the provision itself admit either the possible fallibility of rate or their unsuitableness to change condition i believe the grant of authority may be promptly and discreetly exercise ever mindful of the intent and purpose to safeguard american industrial activity and at the same time prevent the exploitation of the american consumer and keep open the path of such liberal exchange as do not endanger our own productivity no one contemplate commercial aloofness nor any other aloofness contradictory to the good american tradition or lofty human purpose our fortunate capacity for comparative self containment afford the firm foundation on which to build for our own security and a like foundation on which to build for a future of influence and importance in world commerce our trade expansion must come of capacity and of policy of righteousness and reasonableness in till our commercial relation let no one assume that our provision for maintain good fortune at home and our unwillingness to assume the correction of all the ill of the world mean a reluctance to cooperate with other people or to assume every just obligation to promote human advancement anywhere in the world war make we a creditor nation we do not seek an excess possession of the world 's gold and we have neither desire to profit unduly by its possession nor permanently retain it we do not seek to become an international dictator because of its power the voice of the united states have a respectful hearing in international council because we have convince the world that we have no selfish end to serve no old grievance to avenge no territorial or other greed to satisfy but the voice be hear be that of good counsel not of dictation it be the voice of sympathy and fraternity and helpfulness seek to assist but not assume for the united states burden which nation must bear for themselves we would rejoice to help rehabilitate currency system and facilitate all commerce which do not drag we to the very level of those we seek to lift up while i have everlaste faith in our republic it would be folly indeed to blind ourselves to our problem at home abuse the hospitality of our shore be the advocate of revolution find their delude follower among those who take on the habiliment of an american without know an american soul there be the recrudescence of hyphenated americanism which we think to have be stamp out when we commit the nation life and soul to the world war there be a call to make the alien respect our institution while he accept our hospitality there be need to magnify the american viewpoint to the alien who seek a citizenship among we there be need to magnify the national viewpoint to americans throughout the land more there be a demand for every living be in the united states to respect and abide by the law of the republic let man who be rend the moral fiber of the republic through easy contempt for the prohibition law because they think it restrict their personal liberty remember that they set the example and breed a contempt for law which will ultimately destroy the republic constitutional prohibition have be adopt by the nation it be the supreme law of the land in plain speaking there be condition relate to its enforcement which savor of nation wide scandal it be the most demoralizing factor in our public life most of our people assume that the adoption of the eighteenth amendment mean the elimination of the question from our politic on the contrary it have be so intensify as an issue that many voter be disposed to make all political decision with reference to this single question it be distract the public mind and prejudice the judgment of the electorate the day be unlikely to come when the eighteenth amendment will be repeal the fact may as well be recognize and our course adapt accordingly if the statutory provision for its enforcement be contrary to deliberate public opinion which i do not believe the rigorous and literal enforcement will concentrate public attention on any requisite modification such a course conform with the law and save the humiliation of the government and the humiliation of our people before the world and challenge the destructive force engage in widespread violation official corruption and individual demoralization the eighteenth amendment involve the concurrent authority of state and federal governments for the enforcement of the policy it define a certain lack of definiteness through division of responsibility be thus introduce in order to bring about a full understanding of duty and responsibility as thus distribute i purpose to invite the governor of the states and territories at an early opportunity to a conference with the federal executive authority out of the full and free consideration which will thus be possible it be confidently believe will emerge a more adequate comprehension of the whole problem and definite policy of national and state cooperation in administer the law there be pende bill for the registration of the alien who have come to our shore i wish the passage of such an act might be expedite life amid american opportunity be worth the cost of registration if it be worth the seeking and the nation have the right to know who be citizen in the making or who live among we and share our advantage while seek to undermine our cherished institution this provision will enable we to guard against the abuse in immigration check the undesirable whose irregular willing be his first violation of our law more it will facilitate the need americanizing of those who mean to enroll as fellow citizen before enlarge the immigration quota we have well provide registration for alien those now here or continually press for admission and establish our examination board abroad to make sure of desirable only by the examination abroad we could end the pathos at our port when man and woman find our door close after long voyage and waste saving because they be unfit for admission it would be kindly and safe to tell they before they embarkour program of admission and treatment of immigrant be very intimately related to the educational policy of the republic with illiteracy estimate at from two tenth of 1 percent to less than 2 percent in 10 of the foremost nation of europe it rivet our attention to it serious problem when we be remind of a 6 per cent illiteracy in the united states the figure be base on the test which define an illiterate as one have no schoollng whatever remember the wide freedom of our public school with compulsory attendance in many state in the union one be convince that much of our excessive illiteracy come to we from abroad and the education of the immigrant become it requisite to his americanization it must be do if he be fittingly to exercise the duty as well as enjoy the privilege of american citizenship here be reveal the special field for federal cooperation in further educationfrom the very begin public education have be leave mainly in the hand of the states so far as school youth be concern the policy have be justify because no responsibility can be so effective as that of the local community alive to its task i believe in the cooperation of the national authority to stimulate encourage and broaden the work of tile local authority but it be the especial obligation of the federal government to devise mean and effectively assist in the education of the newcomer from foreign land so that the level of american education may be make the high that be humanly possible closely related to this problem of education be the abolition of child labor twice congress have attempt the correction of the evil incident to child employment the decision of the supreme court have put this problem outside the proper domain of federal regulation until the constitution be so amend as to give the congress indubitable authority i recommend the submission of such an amendment we have two school of thought relate to amendment of the constitution one need not be commit to the belief that amendment be weaken the fundamental law or that excessive amendment be essential to meet every ephemeral whim we ought to amend to meet the demand of the people when sanction by deliberate public opinion one year ago i suggest the submission of an amendment so that we may lawfully restrict the issue of tax exempt security and i renew that recommendation now tax exempt security be dry up the source of federal taxation and they be encourage unproductive and extravagant expenditure by state and municipality there be more than the menace in mount public debt there be the dissipation of capital which should be make available to the need of productive industry the propose amendment will place the state and federal governments and all political subdivision on an exact equality and will correct the grow menace of public borrowing which if leave unchecked may soon threaten the stability of our institution we be so vast and so varied in our national interest that score of problem be press for attention i must not risk the wearying of your patience with detailed reference reclamation and irrigation project where waste land may be make available for settlement and productivity be worthy of your favorable consideration when it be realize that we be consume our timber four time as rapidly as we be grow it we must encourage the great possible cooperation between the federal government the various states and the owner of forest land to the end that protection from fire shall be make more effective and replant encourage the fuel problem be under study now by a very capable fact find commission and any attempt to deal with the coal problem of such deep concern to the entire nation must await the report of the commission there be necessary study of great problem which congress might well initiate the wide spread between production cost and price which consumer pay concern every citizen of the republic it contribute very largely to the unrest in agriculture and must stand sponsor for much against which we inveigh in that familiar term the high cost of living no one doubt the excess be traceable to the levy of the middleman but it would be unfair to charge he with all responsibility before we appraise what be exact of he by our modernly complex life we have attack the problem on one side by the promotion of cooperative marketing and we might well inquire into the benefit of cooperative buying admittedly the consumer be much to blame himself because of his prodigal expenditure and his exaction of service but government might well serve to point the way of narrow the spread of price especially between the production of food and its consumption a superpower survey of the eastern industrial region have recently be complete look to unification of steam water and electric power and to a unified scheme of power distribution the survey prove that vast economy in tonnage movement of freight and in the efficiency of the railroad would be effect if the superpower program be adopt i be convinced that constructive measure calculate to promote such an industrial development i be tempt to say such an industrial revolution would be well worthy the careful attention and foster interest of the national government the propose survey of a plan to draft all the resource of the republic human and material for national defense may well have your approval i commend such a program in case of future war in the inaugural address of march 4 1921 and every experience in the adjustment and liquidation of war claim and the settlement of war obligation persuade i we ought to be prepare for such universal call to armed defense i bring you no apprehension of war the world be abhorrent of it and our own relation be not only free from every threatening cloud but we have contribute our large influence toward make armed conflict less likely those who assume that we play our part in the world war and later take ourselves aloof and apart unmindful of world obligation give scant credit to the helpful part we assume in international relationship whether all nation signatory ratify all the treaty grow out of the washington conference on limitation of armament or some withhold approval the underlie policy of limit naval armament have the sanction of the large naval power and naval competition be suspend of course unanimous ratification be much to be desire the four power pact which abolish every probability of war on the pacific have bring new confidence in a maintained peace and i can well believe it might be make a model for like assurance wherever in the world any common interest be concern we have have express the hostility of the american people to a supergovernment or to any commitment where either a council or an assembly of league power may chart our course treaty of armed alliance can have no likelihood of american sanction but we believe in respect the right of nation in the value of conference and consultation in the effectiveness of leader of nation look each other in the face before resort to the arbitrament of arm it have be our fortune both to preach and promote international understanding the influence of the united states in bring near the settlement of an ancient dispute between south american nation be add proof of the glow of peace in ample understanding in washington to day be meet the delegate of the central american nation gather at the table of international understanding to stabilize their republic and remove every vestige of disagreement they be meet here by our invitation not in our aloofness and they accept our hospitality because they have faith in our unselfishness and believe in our helpfulness perhaps we be selfish in crave their confidence and friendship but such a selfishness we proclaim to the world regardless of hemisphere or sea divide i would like the congress and the people of the nation to believe that in a firm and considerate way we be insistent on american right wherever they may be question and deny no right of other in the assertion of our own moreover we be cognizant of the world 's struggle for full readjustment and rehabilitation and we have shirk no duty which come of sympathy or fraternity or high fellowship among nation every obligation consonant with american ideal and sanction under our form of government be willingly meet when we can not support we do not demand our constitutional limitation do not forbid the exercise of a moral influence the measure of which be not less than the high purpose we have seek to serve after all there be less difference about the part this great republic shall play in further peace and advance humanity than in the manner of play it we ask no one to assume responsibility for we we assume no responsibility which other must bear for themselves unless nationality be hopelessly swallow up in internationalism
since the close of the last congress the nation have lose president harding the world know his kindness and his humanity his greatness and his character he have leave his mark upon history he have make justice more certain and peace more secure the surpass tribute pay to his memory as he be bear across the continent to rest at last at home reveal the place lie hold in the heart of the american people but this be not the occasion for extend reference to the man or his work in this presence among these who know and love he that be unnecessary but we who be associate with he could not resume together the function of our office without pause for a moment and in his memory reconsecrate ourselves to the service of our country he be go we remain it be our duty under the inspiration of his example to take up the burden which he be permit to lay down and to develop and support the wise principle of government which he represent

 foreign affairs

 for we peace reign everywhere we desire to perpetuate it always by grant full justice to other and require of other full justice to ourselves

 our country have one cardinal principle to maintain in its foreign policy it be an american principle it must be an american policy we attend to our own affair conserve our own strength and protect the interest of our own citizen but we recognize thoroughly our obligation to help other reserve to the decision of our own judgment the time the place and the method we realize the common bond of humanity we know the inescapable law of service

 our country have definitely refuse to adopt and ratify the covenant of the league of nations we have not felt warrant in assume the responsibility which its member have assume i be not propose any change in this policy neither be the senate the incident so far as we be concern be close the league exist as a foreign agency we hope it will be helpful but the united states see no reason to limit its own freedom and independence of action by join it we shall do well to recognize this basic fact in all national affair and govern ourselves accordingly

 world court

 our foreign policy have always be guide by two principle the one be the avoidance of permanent political alliance which would sacrifice our proper independence the other be the peaceful settlement of controversy between nation by example and by treaty we have advocate arbitration for nearly 25 year we have be a member of the hague tribunal and have long seek the creation of a permanent world court of justice i be in full accord with both of these policy i favor the establishment of such a court intend to include the whole world that is and have long be an american policy

 pende before the senate be a proposal that this government give its support to the permanent court of international justice which be a new and somewhat different plan this be not a partisan question it should not assume an artificial importance the court be merely a convenient instrument of adjustment to which we could go but to which we could not be bring it should be discuss with entire candor not by a political but by a judicial method without pressure and without prejudice partisanship have no place in our foreign relation as i wish to see a court establish and as the proposal present the only practical plan on which many nation have ever agree though it may not meet every desire i therefore commend it to the favorable consideration of the senate with the propose reservation clearly indicate our refusal to adhere to the league of nations

 russia

 our diplomatic relation lately so largely interrupted be now be resume but russia present notable difficulty we have every desire to see that great people who be our traditional friend restore to their position among the nation of the earth we have relieve their pitiable destitution with an enormous charity our government offer no objection to the carrying on of commerce by our citizen with the people of russia our government do not propose however to enter into relation with another regime which refuse to recognize the sanctity of international obligation i do not propose to barter away for the privilege of trade any of the cherish right of humanity i do not propose to make merchandise of any american principle these right and principle must go wherever the sanction of our government go

 but while the favor of america be not for sale i be willing to make very large concession for the purpose of rescue the people of russia already encourage evidence of return to the ancient way of society can be detect but more be need whenever there appear any disposition to compensate our citizen who be despoiled and to recognize that debt contract with our government not by the czar but by the newly form republic of russia whenever the active spirit of enmity to our institution be abate whenever there appear work mete for repentance our country ought to be the first to go to the economic and moral rescue of russia we have every desire to help and no desire to injure we hope the time be near at hand when we can act

 debt

 the current debt and interest due from foreign government exclusive of the british debt of $ 4,600,000,000 be about $ 7,200,000,000 1 do not favor the cancellation of this debt but i see no objection to adjust it in accordance with the principle adopt for the british debt our country would not wish to assume the role of an oppressive creditor but would maintain the principle that financial obligation between nation be likewise moral obligation which international faith and honor require should be discharge

 our government have a liquidate claim against germany for the expense of the army of occupation of over $ 255,000,000 besides this the mixed claims commission have before they about 12,500 claim of american citizen aggregate about $ 1,225,000,000 these claim have already be reduce by a recent decision but there be valid claim reach well toward $ 500,000,000 our thousand of citizen with credit due they of hundred of million of dollar have no redress save in the action of our government these be very substantial interest which it be the duty of our government to protect as good it can that course i propose to pursue

 it be for these reason that we have a direct interest in the economic recovery of europe they be enlarge by our desire for the stability of civilization and the welfare of humanity that we be make sacrifice to that end none can deny our deferred interest alone amount to a million dollar every day but recently we offer to aid with our advice and counsel we have reiterate our desire to see france pay and germany revive we have propose disarmament we have earnestly seek to compose difference and restore peace we shall persevere in well doing not by force but by reason

 foreign paper

 under the law the paper pertain to foreign relation to be print be transmit as a part of this message other volume of these paper will follow

 foreign service

 the foreign service of our government need to be reorganize and improve

 fiscal condition

 our main problem be domestic problem financial stability be the first requisite of sound government we can not escape the effect of world condition we can not avoid the inevitable result of the economic disorder which have reach all nation but we shall diminish their harm to we in proportion as we continue to restore our government finance to a secure and endurable position this we can and must do upon that firm foundation rest the only hope of progress and prosperity from that source must come relief for the people

 this be be accomplish by a drastic but orderly retrenchment which be bring our expense within our mean the origin of this have be the determination of the american people the main support have be the courage of those in authority and the effective method have be the budget system the result have involve real sacrifice by department head but it have be make without flinching this system be a law of the congress it represent your will it must be maintain and ought to be strengthen by the example of your observance without a budget system there can be no fixed responsibility and no constructive scientific economy

 this great concentration of effort by the administration and congress have bring the expenditure exclusive of the self support post office department down to three billion dollar it be possible in consequence to make a large reduction in the taxis of the people which be the sole object of all curtailment this be treat at great length in the budget message and a propose plan have be present in detail in a statement by the secretary of the treasury which have my unqualified approval i especially commend a decrease on earn income and further abolition of admission message and nuisance taxis tile amusement and educational value of move picture ought not to be tax diminish charge against moderate income from investment will afford immense relief while a revision of the surtax will not only provide additional money for capital investment thus stimulate industry and employ more but will not greatly reduce the revenue from that source and may in the future actually increase it

 be oppose to war taxis in time of peace i be not in favor of excess profit taxis a very great service could be render through immediate enactment of legislation relieve the people of some of the burden of taxation to&#39 reduce war taxis be to give every home a well chance

 for seven year the people have bear with uncomplaine courage the tremendous burden of national and local taxation these must both be reduce the taxis of the nation must be reduce now as much as prudence will permit and expenditure must be reduce accordingly high taxis reach everywhere and burden everybody they gear most heavily upon the poor they diminish industry and commerce they make agriculture unprofitable they increase the rate on transportation they be a charge on every necessary of life of all service which the congress can render to the country i have no hesitation in declare to neglect it to postpone it to obstruct it by unsound proposal be to become unworthy of public confidence and untrue to public trust the country want this measure to have the right of way over an other

 another reform which be urgent in our fiscal system be the abolition of the right to issue tax exempt security the exist system not only permit a large amount of the wealth of the notion to escape its just burden but act as a continual stimulant to municipal extravagance this should be prohibit by constitutional amendment all the wealth of the nation ought to contribute its fair share to the expense of the nation

 tariff law

 the present tariff law have accomplish its two main object it have secure an abundant revenue and be productive of an abound prosperity under it the country have have a very large export and import trade a constant revision of the tariff by the congress be disturbing and harmful the present law contain an elastic provision authorize the president to increase or decrease present schedule not in excess of 50 per centum to meet the difference in cost of production at home and abroad this do not to my mind warrant a rewriting of the whole law but do mean and will be so administered that whenever the require investigation show that inequality of sufficient importance exist in any schedule the power to change they should and will be apply

 shipping

 the entire well being of our country be dependent upon transportation by sea and land our government during the war acquire a large merchant fleet which should be transfer as soon as possible to private ownership and operation under condition which would secure two result first and of prime importance adequate mean for national defense second adequate service to american commerce until shipping condition be such that our fleet can be dispose of advantageously under these condition it will be operate as economically as possible under such plan as may be devise from time to time by the shipping board we must have a merchant marine which meet these requirement and we shall have to pay the cost of its service

 public improvement

 the time have come to resume in a moderate way the opening of our intracoastal waterway the control of flood water of the mississippi and of the colorado rivers the improvement of the waterway from the great lakes toward the gulf of mexico and the development of the great power and navigation project of the st. lawrence river for which effort be now be make to secure the necessary treaty with canada these project can not all be undertake at once but all should have the immediate consideration of the congress and be adopt as fast as plan can be mature and the necessary fund become available this be not incompatible with economy for their nature do not require so much a public expenditure as a capital investment which will be reproductive as evidence by the marked increase in revenue from the panama canal upon these project depend much future industrial and agricultural progress they represent the protection of large area from flood and the addition of a great amount of cheap power and cheap freight by use of navigation chief of which be the bringing of ocean go ship to the great lakes

 another problem of allied character be the superpower development of the northeastern states consideration of which be grow under the direction of the department of commerce by joint conference with the local authority

 railroads

 criticism of the railroad law have be direct first to the section lay down the rule by which rate be fix and provide for payment to the government and use of excess earning second to the method for the adjustment of wage scale and third to the authority permit consolidation

 it have be erroneously assume that the act undertake to guarantee railroad earning the law require that rate should be just and reasonable that have always be the rule under which rate have be fix to make a rate that do not yield a fair return result in confiscation and confiscatory rate be of course unconstitutional unless the government adhere to the rule of make a rate that will yield a fair return it must abandon rate make altogether the new and important feature of that part of the law be the recapture and redistribution of excess rate the constitutionality of this method be now before the supreme court for adjudication their decision should be await before attempt further legislation on this subject furthermore the importance of this feature will not be great if consolidation go into effect

 the settlement of railroad labor dispute be a matter of grave public concern the labor board be establish to protect the public in the enjoyment of continuous service by attempt to insure justice between the company and their employee it have be a great help but be not altogether satisfactory to the public the employee or the company if a substantial agreement can be reach among the group interested there should be no hesitation in enact such agreement into law if it be not reach the labor board may very well be leave for the present to protect the public welfare

 the law for consolidation be not sufficiently effective to be expeditious additional legislation be need give authority for voluntary consolidation both regional and route and provide government machinery to aid and stimulate such action always subject to the approval of the interstate commerce commission this should authorize the commission to appoint committee for each propose group represent the public and the component road with power to negotiate with individual security holder for an exchange of their security for those of the consolidation on such term and condition as the commission may prescribe for avoid any confiscation and preserve fair value should this permissive consolidation prove ineffective after a limited period the authority of the government will have to be directly invoke

 consolidation appear to be the only feasible method for the maintenance of an adequate system of transportation with an opportunity so to adjust freight rate as to meet such temporary condition as now prevail in some agricultural section competent authority agree that an entire reorganization of the rate structure for freight be necessary this should be order at once by the congress

 department of justice

 as no revision of the law of the united states have be make since 1878 a commission or committee should be create to undertake this work the judicial council report that two more district judge be need in the southern district of new york one in the northern district of georgia and two more circuit judge in the circuit court of appeals of the eighth circuit legislation should be consider for this purpose

 it be desirable to expedite the hearing and disposal of case a commission of federal judge and lawyer should be create to recommend legislation by which the procedure in the federal trial court may be simplify and regulate by rule of court rather than by statute such rule to be submit to the congress and to be in force until annul or modify by the congress the supreme court need legislation revise and simplify the law govern review by that court and enlarge the class of case of too little public importance to be subject to review such reform would expedite the transaction of the business of the court the administration of justice be likely to fail if it be long delay

 the national government have never give adequate attention to its prison problem it ought to provide employment in such form of production as can be use by the government though not sell to the public in competition with private business for all prisoner who can be place at work and for which they should receive a reasonable compensation available for their dependent

 two independent reformatory be need one for the segregation of woman and another for the segregation of young man serve their first sentence

 the administration of justice would be facilitate greatly by include in the bureau of investigation of the department of justice a division of criminal identification where there would be collect this information which be now indispensable in the suppression of crime

 prohibition

 the prohibition amendment to the constitution require the congress and the president to provide adequate law to prevent its violation it be my duty to enforce such law for that purpose a treaty be be negotiate with great britain with respect to the ri light of search of hover vessel to prevent smuggling the coast card should be greatly strengthen and a supply of swift power boat should be provide the major source of production should be rigidly regulate and every effort should be make to suppress interstate traffic with this action on the part of the national government and the cooperation which be usually render by municipal and state authority prohibition should be make effective free government have no great menace than disrespect for authority and continual violation of law it be the duty of a citizen not only to observe the law but to let it be know that he be oppose to its violation

 the negro

 number among our population be some 12,000,000 colored people under our constitution their right be just as sacred as those of any other citizen it be both a public and a private duty to protect those right the congress ought to exercise all its power of prevention and punishment against the hideous crime of lynching of which the negro be by no mean the sole sufferer but for which they furnish a majority of the victim

 already a considerable sum be appropriate to give the negro vocational training in agriculture about half a million dollar be recommend for medical course at howard university to help contribute to the education of 500 color doctor need each year on account of the integration of large number into industrial center it have be propose that a commission be create compose of member from both race to formulate a well policy for mutual understanding and confidence such an effort be to be commend everyone would rejoice in the accomplishment of the result which it seek but it be well to recognize that these difficulty be to a large extent local problem which must be work out by the mutual forbearance and human kindness of each community such a method give much more promise of a real remedy than outside interference

 civil service

 the maintenance and extension of the classified civil service be exceedingly important there be nearly 550,000 person in the executive civil service draw about $ 700,000,000 of yearly compensation four fifth of these be in the classified service this method of selection of the employee of the united states be especially desirable for the post office department the civil service commission have recommend that postmaster at first second and third class office be classify such action accompany by a repeal of the four year term of office would undoubtedly be an improvement i also recommend that the field force for prohibition enforcement be bring within the classified civil service without cover in the present membership the good method for select public servant be the merit system

 public building

 many of the department in washington need well housing facility some be so crowded that their work be impede other be so scatter that they lose their identity while i do not favor at this time a general public building law i believe it be now necessary in accordance with plan already sanction for a unified and orderly system for the development of this city to begin the carrying out of those plan by authorize the erection of three or four building most urgently need by an annual appropriation of $ 5,000,000

 regulatory legislation

 cooperation with other maritime power be necessary for complete protection of our coast water from pollution plan for this be under way but await certain experiment for refuse disposal meantime law prohibit spread oil and oil refuse from vessel in our own territorial water would be most helpful against this menace and should be speedily enact

 law should be pass regulating aviation

 revision be need of the law regulate radio interference

 legislation and regulation establish load liner to provide safe loading of vessel leave our port be necessary and recodification of our navigation law be vital

 revision of procedure of the federal trade commission will give more constructive purpose to this department

 if our alaskan fishery be to be save from destruction there must be further legislation declare a general policy and delegate the authority to make rule and regulation to an administrative body

 army and navy

 for several year we have be decrease the personnel of the army and navy and reduce their power to the danger point further reduction should not be make the army be a guarantee of the security of our citizen at home the navy be a guarantee of the security of our citizen abroad both of these service should be strengthen rather than weaken additional plane be need for the army and additional submarine for the navy the defense of panama must be perfect we want no more competitive armament we want no more war but we want no weakness that invite imposition a people who neglect their national defense be put in jeopardy their national honor

 insular possession

 conditions in the insular possession on the whole have be good their business have be revive they be be administer accord to law that effort have the full support of the administration such recommendation as may conic from their people or their government should have the most considerate attention

 education and welfare

 our national government be not do as much as it legitimately can do to promote the welfare of the people our enormous material wealth our institution our whole form of society can not be consider fully successful until their benefit reach the merit of every individual this be not a suggestion that the government should or could assume for the people the inevitable burden of existence there be no method by which we can either be relieve of the result of our own folly or be guarantee a successful life there be an inescapable personal responsibility for the development of character of industry of thrift and of self control these do not come from the government but from the people themselves but the government can and should always be expressive of steadfast determination always vigilant to maintain condition under which these virtue be most likely to develop and secure recognition and reward this be the american policy

 it be in accordance with this principle that we have enact law for the protection of the public health and have adopt prohibition in narcotic drug and intoxicate liquor for purpose of national uniformity we ought to provide by constitutional amendment and appropriate legislation for a limitation of child labor and in all case under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government a minimum wage law for woman which would undoubtedly find sufficient power of enforcement in the influence of public opinion

 have in mind that education be peculiarly a local problem and that it should always be pursue with the large freedom of choice by student and parent nevertheless the federal government might well give the benefit of its counsel and encouragement more freely in this direction if anyone doubt the need of concerted action by the states of the nation for this purpose it be only necessary to consider the appalling figure of illiteracy represent a condition which do not vary much in all part of the union i do not favor the making of appropriation from the national treasury to be expend directly on local education but i do consider it a fundamental requirement of national activity which accompany by allied subject of welfare be worthy of a separate department and a place in the cabinet the humanitarian side of government should not be repress but should be cultivate

 mere intelligence however be not enough enlightenment must be accompany by that moral power which be the product of the home and of rebellion real education and true welfare for the people rest inevitably on this foundation which the government can approve and commend but which the people themselves must create

 immigration

 american institution rest solely on good citizenship they be create by people who have a background of self government new arrival should be limit to our capacity to absorb they into the rank of good citizenship america must be keep american for this i purpose it be necessary to continue a policy of restricted immigration it would be well to make such immigration of a selective nature with some inspection at the source and base either on a prior census or upon the record of naturalization either method would insure the admission of those with the large capacity and good intention of become citizen i be convinced that our present economic and social condition warrant a limitation of those to be admit we should find additional safety in a law require the immediate registration of all alien those&#39 who do not want to be partaker of the american spirit ought not to settle in america

 veteran

 no more important duty fall on the government of the united states than the adequate care of its veteran those suffer disability incur in the service must have sufficient hospital relief and compensation their dependent must be support rehabilitation and vocational training must be complete all of this service must be clean must be prompt and effective and it must be administer in a spirit of the broad and deep human sympathy if investigation reveal any present defect of administration or need of legislation order will be give for the immediate correction of administration and recommendation for legislation should be give the high preference

 at present there be 9,500 vacant bed in government hospital i recommend that all hospital be authorize at once to receive and care for without hospital pay the veteran of all war need such care whenever there be vacant bed and that immediate step be take to enlarge and build new hospital to serve all such case

 the american legion will present to the congress a legislative pro 39;gram too extensive for detailed discussion here it be a carefully mature plan while some of it i do not favor with much of it i be in hearty accord and i recommend that a most painstaking effort be make to provide remedy for any defect in the administration of the present law which their experience have reveal the attitude of the government toward these proposal should be one of generosity but i do not favor the granting of a bonus

 coal

 the cost of coal have become unbearably high it place a great burden on our industrial and domestic life the public welfare require a reduction in the price of fuel with the enormous deposit in existence failure of supply ought not to be tolerate those responsible for the condition in this industry should undertake its reform and free it from any charge of profiteer

 the report of the coal commission will be before the congress it comprise all the fact it represent the mature deliberation and conclusion of the good talent and experience that ever make a national survey of the production and distribution of fuel i do not favor government ownership or operation of coal mine the need be for action under private ownership that will secure great continuity of production and great public protection the federal government probably have no peacetime authority to regulate wage price or profit in coal at the mine or among dealer but by ascertain and publishing fact it can exercise great influence

 the source of the difficulty in the bituminous coal field be the intermittence of operation which cause great waste of both capital and labor that part of the report deal with this problem have much significance and be suggestive of necessary remedy by amend the car rule by encourage great unity of ownership and possibly by permit common sell agent for limited district on condition that they accept adequate regulation and guarantee that competition between district be unlimited distribution storage and continuity ought to be improve

 the supply of coal must be constant in case of its prospective interruption the president should have authority to appoint a commission empower to deal with whatever emergency situation might arise to aid conciliation and voluntary arbitration to adjust any exist or threatened controversy between the employer and the employee when collective bargaining fail and by control distribution to prevent profiteer in this vital necessity this legislation be exceedingly urgent and essential to the exercise of national authority for the protection of the people those who undertake the responsibility of management or employment in this industry do so with the full knowledge that the public interest be paramount and that to fail through any motive of selfishness in its service be such a betrayal of duty as warrant uncompromise action by the government

 reorganization

 a special joint committee have be appoint to work out a plan for a reorganization of the different department and bureaus of the government more scientific and economical than the present system with the exception of the consolidation of the war and navy departments and some minor detail the plan have the general sanction of the president and the cabinet it be important that reorganization be enact into law at the present session

 agriculture

 aid by the sound principle adopt by the government the business of the country have have an extraordinary revival look at as a whole the nation be in the enjoyment of remarkable prosperity industry and commerce be thrive for the most tart agriculture be successful eleven staple having rise in value from about $ 5,300,000,000 two year ago to about $ 7,000,000,000 for the current year but range cattle be still low in price and some section of the wheat area notably minnesota north dakota and on west have many case of actual distress with his product not sell on a parity with the product of industry every sound remedy that can be devise should be apply for the relief of the farmer he represent a character a type of citizenship and a public necessity that must be preserve and afford every facility for regain prosperity

 the distress be most acute among those wholly dependent upon one crop wheat acreage be greatly expand and have not yet be sufficiently reduce a large amount be raise for export which have to meet the competition in the world market of large amount raise on land much cheap and much more productive

 no complicated scheme of relief no plan for government fixing of price no resort to the public treasury will be of any permanent value in establish agriculture simple and direct method put into operation by the farmer himself be the only real source for restoration

 indirectly the farmer must be relieve by a reduction of national and local taxation he must be assist by the reorganization of the freight rate structure which could reduce charge on his production to make this fully effective there ought to be railroad consolidation cheap fertilizer must be provide

 he must have organization his customer with whom he exchange product o he farm for those of industry be organize labor be organize business be organize and there be no way for agriculture to meet this unless it too be organize the acreage of wheat be too large unless we can meet the world market at a profit we must stop raise for export organization would help to reduce acreage system of cooperative marketing create by the farmer themselves supervise by competent management without doubt would be of assistance but the can not wholly solve the problem.&#39 our agricultural school ought to have thorough course in the theory of organization and cooperative marketing

 diversification be necessary those farmer who raise their living on their land be not greatly in distress such loan as be wisely need to assist buy stock and other material to start in this direction should be finance through a government agency as a temporary and emergency expedient

 the remain difficulty be the disposition of exportable wheat i do not favor the permanent interference of the government in this problem that probably would increase the trouble by increase production but it seem feasible to provide government assistance to export and authority should be give the war finance corporation to grant in its discretion the most liberal term of payment for fat and grain export for the direct benefit of the farm

 muscle shoal

 the government be undertake to develop a great water power project know as muscle shoals on which it have expend many million dollar the work be still go on subject to the right to retake in time of war i recommend that this property with a location for auxiliary steam plant and right of way be sell this would end the present burden of expense and should return to the treasury the large price possible to secure

 while the price be an important element there be another consideration even more compelling the agriculture of the nation need a great supply and low cost of fertilizer this be now import in large quantity the good information i can secure indicate that present method of power production would not be able profitably to meet the price at which these import can be sell to obtain a supply from this water power would require long and costly experimentation to perfect a process for cheap production otherwise our purpose would fail completely it seem desirable therefore in order to protect and promote the public welfare to have adequate covenant that such experimentation be make and carry on to success the great advantage of low price nitrate must be secure for the direct benefit of the farmer and the indirect benefit of the public in time of peace and of the government in time of war if this main object be accomplish the amount of money receive for the property be not a primary or major consideration

 such a solution will involve complicated negotiation and there be no authority for that purpose therefore recommend that the congress appoint a small joint committee to consider offer conduct negotiation and report definite recommendation

 reclamation

 by reason of many contribute cause occupant of our reclamation project be in financial difficulty which in some case be acute relief should be grant by definite authority of law empower the secretary of the interior in his discretion to suspend readjust and reassess all charge against water user this whole question be be consider by expert you will have the advantage of the fact and conclusion which they may develop this situation involve a government investment of more than $ 135,000,000 and affect more than 30,000 water user be serious while relief which be necessary should be grant yet contract with the government which can be meet should be meet the established general policy of these project should not be abandon for any private control

 highway and forest

 highway and reforestation should continue to have the interest and support of the government everyone be anxious for good highway i have make a liberal proposal in the budget for the continue payment to the states by the federal government of its share for this necessary public improvement no expenditure of public money contribute so much to the national wealth as for build good road

 reforestation have an importance far above the attention it usually secure a special committee of the senate be investigate this need and i shall welcome a constructive policy base on their report

 it be 100 year since our country announce the monroe doctrine this principle have be ever since and be now one of the main foundation of our foreign relation it must be maintain but in maintain it we must not be forgetful that a great change have take place we be no long a weak nation think mainly of defense dread foreign imposition we be great and powerful new power bring new responsibility our ditty then be to protect ourselves add to that our duty now be to help give stability to the world we want idealism we want that vision which lift man and nation above themselves these be virtue by reason of their own merit but they must not be cloister they must not be impractical they must not be ineffective

 the world have have enough of the curse of hatred and selfishness of destruction and war it have have enough of the wrongful use of material power for the healing of the nation there must be good will and charity confidence and peace the time have come for a more practical use of moral power and more reliance upon the principle that right make its own might our authority among the nation must be represent by justice and mercy it be necessary not only to have faith but to make sacrifice for our faith the spiritual force of the world make all its final determination it be with these voice that america should speak whenever they declare a righteous purpose there need be no doubt that they will be hear america have take her place in the world as a republic free independent powerful the good service that can be render to humanity be the assurance that this place will be maintain
to the congress of the united states the present state of the union upon which it be customary for the president to report to the congress under the provision of the constitution be such that it may be regard with encouragement and satisfaction by every american our country be almost unique in its ability to discharge fully and promptly all its obligation at home and abroad and provide for all its inhabitant an increase in material resource in intellectual vigor and in moral power the nation hold a position unsurpasse in all former human experience this do not mean that we do not have any problem it be elementary that the increase breadth of our experience necessarily increase the problem of our national life but it do mean that if all will but apply ourselves industriously and honestly we have ample power with which to meet our problem and provide for i heir speedy solution i do not profess that we can secure an era of perfection in human existence but we can provide an era of peace and prosperity attend with freedom and justice and make more and more satisfying by the ministration of the charity and humanity of life our domestic problem be for the most part economic we have our enormous debt to pay and we be pay it we have the high cost of government to diminish and we be diminish it we have a heavy burden of taxation to reduce and we be reduce it but while remarkable progress have be make in these direction the work be yet far from accomplished we still owe over $ 21,000,000,000 the cost of the national government be still about $ 3,500,000,000 and the national taxis still amount to about $ 27 for each one of our inhabitant there yet exist this enormous field for the application of economy in my opinion the government can do more to remedy the economic ill of the people by a system of rigid economy in public expenditure than can be accomplish through any other action the cost of our national and local government combine now stand at a sum close to $ 100 for each inhabitant of the land a little less than one third of this be represent by national expenditure and a little more than two third by local expenditure it be an ominous fact that only the national government be reduce its debt other be increase theirs at about $ 1,000,000,000 each year the depression that overtake business the disaster experience in agriculture the lack of employment and the terrific shrinkage in all value which our country experience in a most acute form in 1920 result in no small measure from the prohibitive taxis which be then levy on all productive effort the establishment of a system of drastic economy in public expenditure which have enable we to pay off about one fifth of the national debt since 1919 and almost cut in two the national tax burden since 1921 have be one of the main cause in reestablish a prosperity which have come to include within its benefit almost every one of our inhabitant economy reach everywhere it carry a blessing to everybody the fallacy of the claim that the cost of government be bear by the rich and those who make a direct contribution to the national treasury can not be too often expose no system have be devise i do not think any system could be devise under which any person live in this country could escape be affect by the cost of our government it have a direct effect both upon the rate and the purchase power of wage it be feel in the price of those prime necessity of existence food clothing fuel and shelter it would appear to be elementary that the more the government expend the more it must require every producer to contribute out of his production to the public treasury and the less he will have for his own benefit the continue cost of public administration can be meet in only one way by the work of the people the high they become the more the people must work for the government the less they be the more the people can work for themselves the present estimate margin between public receipt and expenditure for this fiscal year be very small perhaps the most important work that this session of the congress can do be to continue a policy of economy and far reduce the cost of government in order that we may have a reduction of taxis for the next fiscal year nothing be more likely to produce that public confidence which be the forerunner and the mainstay of prosperity encourage and enlarge business opportunity with ample opportunity for employment at good wage provide a large market for agricultural product and put our country in a strong position to be able to meet the world competition in trade than a continue policy of economy of course necessary cost must be meet proper function of the government perform and constant investment for capital account and reproductive effort must be carry on by our various department but the people must know that their government be place upon they no unnecessary burden taxes everyone desire a reduction of taxis and there be a great preponderance of sentiment in favor of taxation reform when i approve the present tax law i state publicly that i do so in spite of certain provision which i believe unwise and harmful one of the most glaring of these be the make public of the amount assess against different income tax payer although that damage have now be do i believe its continuation to be detrimental to the public welfare and bind to decrease public revenue so that it ought to be repeal anybody can reduce taxis but it be not so easy to stand in the gap and resist the passage of increase appropriation bill which would make tax reduction impossible it will be very easy to measure the strength of the attachment to reduced taxation by the power with which increase appropriation be resist if at the close of the present session the congress have keep within the budget which i propose to present it will then be possible to have a moderate amount of tax reduction and all the tax reform that the congress may wish for during the next fiscal year the country be now feel the direct stimulus which come from the passage of the last revenue bill and under the assurance of a reasonable system of taxation there be every prospect of an era of prosperity of unprecedented proportion but it would be idle to expect any such result unless business can continue free from excess profit taxation and be accord a system of surtax at rate which have for their object not the punishment of success or the discouragement of business but the production of the great amount of revenue from large income i be convinced that the large income of the country would actually yield more revenue to the government if the basis of taxation be scientifically revise downward moreover the effect of the present method of this taxation be to increase the cost of interest on productive enterprise and to increase the burden of rent it be altogether likely that such reduction would so encourage and stimulate investment that it would firmly establish our country in the economic leadership of the world waterways meantime our internal development should go on provision should be make for flood control of such river as the mississippi and the colorado and for the opening up of our inland waterway to commerce consideration be due to the project of well navigation from the great lakes to the gulf every effort be be make to promote an agreement with canada to build the st. lawrence waterway there be pende before the congress bill for further development of the mississippi basin for the taking over of the cape cod canal in accordance with a moral obligation which seem to have be incur during the war and for the improvement of harbor on both the pacific and the atlantic coast while this last should be divest of some of its project and we must proceed slowly these bill in general have my approval such work be productive of wealth and in the long run tend to a reduction of the tax burden reclamation our country have a well define policy of reclamation establish under statutory authority this policy should be continue and make a self sustain activity administer in a manner that will meet local requirement and bring our and land into a profitable state of cultivation as fast as there be a market for their product legislation be pende base on the report of the fact finding commission for the proper relief of those need extension of time in which to meet their payment on irrigated land and for additional amendment and reform of our reclamation law which be all exceedingly important and should be enact at once no more important development have take place in the last year than the beginning of a restoration of agriculture to a prosperous condition we must permit no division of class in this country with one occupation strive to secure advantage over another each must proceed under open opportunity and with a fair prospect of economic equality the government can not successfully insure prosperity or fix price by legislative fiat every business have its risk and its time of depression it be well know that in the long run there will be a more even prosperity and a more satisfactory range of price under the natural work out of economic law than when the government undertake the artificial support of market and industry still we can so order our affair so protect our own people from foreign competition so arrange our national finance so administer our monetary system so provide for the extension of credit so improve method of distribution as to provide a well work machinery for the transaction of the business of the nation with the least possible friction and loss the government have be constantly increase its effort in these direction for the relief and permanent establishment of agriculture on a sound and equal basis with other business it be estimate that the value of the crop for this harvest year may reach $ 13,000,000,000 which be an increase of over $ 3,000,000,000 in three year it compare with $ 7,100,000,000 in 1913 arid if we make deduction from the figure of 1924 for the comparatively decrease value of the dollar the yield this year still exceed 1913 in purchase power by over $ 1,000,000,000 and in this interval there have be no increase in the number of farmer mostly by his own effort the farmer have decrease the cost of production a marked increase in the price of his product and some decrease in the price of his supply have bring he about to a parity with the rest of the nation the crop area of this season be estimate at 370,000,000 acre which be a decline of 3,000,000 acre from last year and 6,000,000 acre from 1919 this have be a normal and natural application of economic law which have place agriculture on a foundation which be undeniably sound and begin to be satisfactory a decrease in the world supply of wheat have result in a very large increase in the price of that commodity the position of all agricultural product indicate a well balanced supply but we can not yet conclude that agriculture be recover from the effect of the war period or that it be permanently on a prosperous basis the cattle industry have not yet recover and in some section have be suffer from dry weather every effort must be make both by government activity and by private agency to restore and maintain agriculture to a complete normal relationship with other industry it be on account of past depression and in spite of present more encouraging condition that i have assemble an agricultural conference make up of those who be representative of this great industry in both its operating and economic side everyone know that the great need of the farmer be market the country be not suffer on the side of production almost the entire difficulty be on the side of distribution this reach back of course to unit cost and diversification and many allied subject it be exceedingly intricate for our domestic and foreign trade transportation and banking and in fact our entire economic system be closely related to it in time for action at this session i hope to report to the congress such legislative remedy as the conference may recommend an appropriation should be make to defray their necessary expense muscle shoals the production of nitrogen for plant food in peace and explosive in war be more and more important it be one of the chief sustain element of life it be estimate that soil exhaustion each year be represent by about 9,000,000 ton and replenishment by 5,450,000 ton the deficit of 3,550,000 ton be report to represent the impairment of 118,000,000 acre of farm land each year to meet these necessity the government have be develop a water power project at muscle shoals to be equip to produce nitrogen for explosive and fertilizer it be my opinion that the support of agriculture be the chief problem to consider in connection with this property it could by no means supply the present need for nitrogen but it would help and its development would encourage bring other water power into like use several offer have be make for the purchase of this property probably none of they represent final term much costly experimentation be necessary to produce commercial nitrogen for that reason it be a field well suit to private enterprise than to government operation i should favor a sale of this property or long time lease tinder rigid guaranty of commercial nitrogen production at reasonable price for agricultural use there would be a surplus of power for many year over any possibility of its application to a develop manufacture of nitrogen it may be find advantageous to dispose of the right to surplus power separately with such reservation as will allow its gradual withdrawal and application to nitrogen manufacture a subcommittee of the committees on agriculture should investigate this field and negotiate with prospective purchaser if no advantageous offer be make the development should continue and the plant should be dedicate primarily to the production of material for the fertilization of the soil railways the railway during the past year have make still further progress in recuperation from the war with large rain in efficiency and ability expeditiously to handle the traffic of the country we have now pass through several period of peak traffic without the car shortage which so frequently in the past have bring havoc to our agriculture and industry the condition of many of our great freight terminal be still one of difficulty and result in impose large cost on the public for inward bind freight and on the railway for outward bind freight owe to the growth of our large city and the great increase in the volume of traffic particularly in perishable the problem be not only difficult of solution but in some case not wholly solvable by railway action alone in my message last year i emphasize the necessity for further legislation with a view to expedite the consolidation of our rail way into large system the principle of government control of rate and profit now thoroughly imbed in our governmental attitude toward natural monopoly such as the railway at once eliminate the need of competition by small unit as a method of rate adjustment competition must be preserve as a stimulus to service but this will exist and can be increase tinder enlarge system consequently the consolidation of the railway into large unit for the purpose of secure the substantial value to the public which will come from large operation have be the logical conclusion of congress in its previous enactment and be also support by the good opinion in the country such consolidation will assure not only a great element of competition as to service but it will afford economy in operation great stability in railway earning and more economical financing it open large possibility of well equalization of rate between different class of traffic so as to relieve undue burden upon agricultural product and raw material generally which be now not possible without ruin to small unit owe to the lack of diversity of traffic it would also tend to equalize earning in such fashion as to reduce the importance of section 15a at which criticism often misapply have be direct a small number of unit would offer less difficulty in labor adjustment and would contribute much to the solution of terminal difficulty the consolidation need to be carry out with due regard to public interest and to the right and establish life of various community in our country it do not seem to i necessary that we endeavor to anticipate any final plan or adhere to an artificial and unchangeable project which shall stipulate a fix number of system but rather we ought to approach the problem with such a latitude of action that it can be work out step by step in accordance with a comprehensive consideration of public interest whether the number of ultimate system shall be more or less seem to i can only be determine by time and actual experience in the development of such consolidation those portion of the present law contemplate consolidation ore not sufficiently effective in produce expeditious action and need amplification of the authority of the interstate commerce commission particularly in afford a period for voluntary proposal to the commission and in supply government pressure to secure action after the expiration of such a period there be other proposal before congress for amend the transportation act one of these contemplate a revision of the method of valuation for rate make purpose to be follow by a renew valuation of the railway the valuation institute by the interstate commerce commission 10 year ago have not yet be complete they have cost the government an enormous sum and they have impose great expenditure upon the railway most of which have in effect come out of the public in increase rate this work should not be abandon or supplant until its result be know and can be consider another matter before the congress be legislation affect the labor section of the transportation act much criticism have be direct at the working of this section and experience have show that some useful amendment could be make to these provision it would be helpful if a plan could be adopt which while retain the practice of systematic collective bargaining with conciliation voluntary arbitration of labor difference could also provide simplicity in relation and more direct local responsibility of employee and manager but such legislation will not meet the requirement of the situation unless it recognize the principle that t e public have a right to the uninterrupted service of transportation and therefore a right to be hear when there be danger that the nation may suffer great injury through the interruption of operation because of labor dispute if these element be not comprehend in propose legislation it would be well to gain further experience with the present organization for deal with these question before undertake a change shipping board the form of the organization of the shipping board be base originally on its function as a semi judicial body in regulation of rate during the war it be load with enormous administrative duty it have be demonstrate time and again that this form of organization result in indecision division of opinion and administrative function which make a wholly inadequate foundation for the conduct of a great business enterprise the first principle in secure the objective set out by congress in build up the american merchant marine upon the great trade route and subsequently dispose of it into private operation can not proceed with effectiveness until the entire function of the board be reorganize the immediate requirement be to transfer into the emergency fleet corporation the whole responsibility of operation of the fleet and other property leave to the shipping board solely the duty of determine certain major policy which require deliberative action the procedure under section 28 of the merchant marine act have create great difficulty and threaten friction during the past 12 month its attempt application develop not only great opposition from exporter particularly as to burden that may be impose upon agricultural product but also great anxiety in the different seaport as to the effect upon their relative rate structure this trouble will certainly recur if action be attempt under this section it be uncertain in some of its term and of great difficulty in interpretation it be my belief that action under this section should be suspend until the congress can reconsider the entire question in the light of the experience that have be develop since its enactment national elections nothing be so fundamental to the integrity of a republican form of government as honesty in all that relate to the conduct of election i be of the opinion that the national law govern the choice of member of the congress should be extend to include appropriate representation of the respective party at the ballot box ant equality of representation on the various registration board wherever they exist the judiciary the docket of the supreme court be becoming congest at the opening term last year it have 592 case while this year it have 687 case justice long delay be justice refuse unless the court be give power by preliminary and summary consideration to determine the importance of case and by dispose of those which be not of public moment reserve its time for the more extended consideration of the remainder the congestion of the docket be likely to increase it be also desirable that supreme court should have power to improve and reform procedure in suit at law in the federal court through the adoption of appropriate rule the judiciary committee of the senate have report favorably upon two bill provide for these reform which should have the immediate favorable consideration of the congress i far recommend that provision be make for the appointment of a commission to consist of two or three member of the federal judiciary and as many member of the bar to examine the present criminal code of procedure and recommend to the congress measure which may reform and expedite court procedure in the administration and enforcement of our criminal law prison reform pende before the congress be a bill which have already pass one house provide for a reformatory to which could be commit first offender and young man for the purpose of segregate they from contact with ban criminal and provide they with special training in order to reestablish in they the power to pursue a law abide existence in the social and economic life of the nation this be a matter of so much importance as to warrant the early attention of the present session further provision should also be make for a like reason for a separate reformatory for woman national police bureau representatives of the international police conference will bring to the attention of the congress a proposal for the establishment of a national police bureau such action would provide a central point for gathering compile and later distribute to local police authority much information which would be helpful in the prevention and detection of crime i believe this bureau be need and i recommend favorable consideration of this proposal district of columbia welfare the welfare work of the district of columbia be administer by several different board deal with charity and various correctional effort it would be an improvement if this work be consolidate and place under the direction of a single commission french spoliation claim during the last session of the congress legislation be introduce look to the payment of the remain claim generally refer to as the french spoliation claim the congress have provide for the payment of many similar claim those that remain unpaid have be long pending the beneficiary thereunder have every reason to expect payment these claim have be examine by the court of claims and their validity and amount determine the united states ought to pay its debt i recommend action by the congress which will permit of the payment of these remain claim the wage earner two very important policy have be adopt by this country which while extend their benefit also in other direction have be of the utmost importance to the wage earner one of these be the protective tariff which enable our people to live accord to a well standard and receive a well rate of compensation than any people any time anywhere on earth ever enjoy this save the american market for the product of the american workman the other be a policy of more recent origin and seek to shield our wage earner from the disastrous competition of a great influx of foreign people this have be do by the restrictive immigration law this save the american job for the american workman i should like to see the administrative feature of this law render a little more humane for the purpose of permit those already here a great latitude in secure admission of member of their own family but i believe this law in principle be necessary and sound and destine to increase greatly the public welfare we must maintain our own economic position we must defend our own national integrity it be gratify to report that the progress of industry the enormous increase in individual productivity through labor save device and the high rate of wage have all combine to furnish our people in general with such an abundance not only of the necessary but of the convenience of life that we be by a natural evolution solve our problem of economic and social justice the negro these development have bring about a very remarkable improvement in the condition of the negro race gradually but surely with the almost universal sympathy of those among whom they live the colored people be work out their own destiny i firmly believe that it be well for all concerned that they should be cheerfully accord their full constitutional right that they should be protect from all of those imposition to which from their position they naturally fall a prey especially from the crime of lynching and that they should receive every encouragement to become full partaker in all the blessing of our common american citizenship civil service the merit system have long be recognize as the correct basis for employment in our civil service i believe that first second and third class postmaster and without cover in the present membership tile field force of prohibition enforcement should be bring within the classified service by statute law otherwise the executive order of one administration be change by the executive order of another administration and little real progress be make whatever its defect the merit system be certainly to be prefer to the spoils system departmental reorganization one way to save public money would be to pass the pende bill for the reorganization of the various department this project have be pende for some time and have have the most careful consideration of expert and the thorough study of a special congressional committee this legislation be vital as a companion piece to the budget law legal authority for a thorough reorganization of the federal structure with some latitude of action to the executive in the rearrangement of secondary function would make for continue economy in the shift of government activity which must follow every change in a develop country beyond this many of the independent agency of the government must be place under responsible cabinet official if we be to have safeguard of efficiency economy and probity army and navy little have develop in relation to our national defense which need special attention progress be constantly be make in air navigation and require encouragement and development army aviator have make a successful trip around the world for which i recommend suitable recognition through provision for promotion compensation and retirement under the direction of the navy a new zeppelin have be successfully bring from europe across the atlantic to our own country due to the efficient supervision of the secretary of war the army of the united states have be organize with a small body of regulars and a moderate national guard and reserve the defense test of september 12 demonstrate the efficiency of the operating plan these method and operation be well worthy of congressional support under the limitation of armament treaty a large saving in outlay and a considerable decrease in maintenance of the navy have be accomplish we should maintain the policy of constantly work toward the full treaty strength of the navy careful investigation be be make in this department of the relative importance of aircraft surface and submarine vessel in order that we may not fail to take advantage of all modern improvement for our national defense a special commission also be investigate the problem of petroleum oil for the navy consider the good policy to insure the future supply of fuel oil and prevent the threaten drainage of naval oil reserve legislative action be require to carry on experiment in oil shale reduction as large deposit of this type have be set aside for the use of the navy we have be constantly beseech to engage in competitive armament frequent report will reach we of the magnitude of the military equipment of other nation we shall do well to be little impress by such report or such action any nation undertake to maintain a military establishment with aggressive and imperialistic design will find itself severely handicap in the economic development of the world i believe thoroughly in the army and navy in adequate defense and preparation but i be oppose to any policy of competition in build and maintain land or sea armament our country have definitely relinquish the old standard of deal with other country by terror and force and be definitely committed to the new standard of deal with they through friendship and understanding this new policy should be constantly keep in mind by the guide force of the army and navy by the congress and by the country at large i believe it hold a promise of great benefit to humanity i shall resist any attempt to resort to the old method and the old standard i be especially solicitous that foreign nation should comprehend the candor and sincerity with which we have adopt this position while we propose to maintain defensive and supplementary police force by land and sea and to train they through inspection and maneuver upon appropriate occasion in order to maintain their efficiency i wish every other nation to understand that this do not express any unfriendliness or convey any hostile intent i want the armed force of america to be consider by all people not as enemy but as friend as the contribution which be make by this country for the maintenance of the peace and security of the world veteran with the authorization for general hospitalization of the veteran of all war provide during the present year the care and treatment of those who have serve their country in time of peril and the attitude of the government toward they be not now so much one of need legislation as one of careful generous and humane administration it will ever be recognize that their welfare be of the first concern and always entitle to the most solicitous consideration oil the part of their fellow citizen they be organize in various association of which the chief and most representative be the american legion through its officer the legion will present to the congress numerous suggestion for legislation they cover such a wide variety of subject that it be impossible to discuss they within the scope of this message with many of the proposal i join in hearty approval and commend they all to the sympathetic investigation and consideration of the congress foreign relation at no period in the past 12 year have our foreign relation be in such a satisfactory condition as they be at the present time our action in the recent month have greatly strengthen the american policy of permanent peace with independence the attitude which our government take and maintain toward an adjustment of european reparation by point out that it wit not a political but a business problem have demonstrate its wisdom by its actual result we desire to see europe restore that it may resume its productivity in the increase of industry and its support in the advance of civilization we look with great gratification at the hopeful prospect of recuperation in europe through the dawes plan such assistance as can be give through the action of the public authority and of our private citizen through friendly counsel and cooperation and through economic and financial support not for any warlike effort but for reproductive enterprise not to provide mean for unsound government financing but to establish sound business administration should be unhesitatingly provide ultimately nation like individual can not depend upon each other but must depend upon themselves each one must work out its own salvation we have every desire to help but with all our resource we be powerless to save unless our effort meet with a constructive response the situation in our own country and all over the world be one chat can be improve only by bard work and self denial it be necessary to reduce expenditure increase saving and liquidate debt it be in this direction that there lie the great hope of domestic tranquility and international peace our own country ought to finish the lead example in this effort our past adherence to this policy our constant refusal to maintain a military establishment that could be think to menace the security of other our honorable dealing with other nation whether great or small have leave we in the almost constant enjoyment of peace it be not necessary to stress the general desire of all the people of this country for the promotion of peace it be the lead principle of all our foreign relation we have on every occasion try to cooperate to this end in all way that be consistent with our proper independence and our traditional policy it will be my constant effort to maintain these principle and to reinforce they by all appropriate agreement and treaty while we desire always to cooperate and to help we be equally determined to be independent and free right and truth and justice and humanitarian effort will have the moral support of this country all over the world but we do not wish to become involved in the political controversy of other nor be the country dispose to become a member of the league of nations or to assume the obligation impose by its covenant international court america have be one of the foremost nation in advocate tribunal for the settlement of international dispute of a justiciable character our representative take a leading in those conference which result in the establishment of e ague tribunal and later in provide for a permanent court of international justice i believe it would be for the advantage of this country and helpful to the stability of other nation for we to adhere to the protocol establishing that court upon the condition state in the recommendation which be now before the senate and far that our country shall not be bind by advisory opinion which may be render by the court upon question which we have not voluntarily submit for its judgment this court would provide a practical and convenient tribunal before which we could go voluntarily but to which we could not be summon for a determination of justiciable question when they fail to be resolve by diplomatic negotiation disarmament conference many time i have express my desire to see the work of the washington conference on limitation of armaments appropriately supplement by further agreement for a further reduction m for the purpose of diminish the menace and waste of the competition in prepare instrument of international war it have be and be my expectation that we might hopefully approach other great power for further conference on this subject as soon as the carrying out of the present reparation plan as the established and settle policy of europe have create a favorable opportunity but on account of proposal which have already be make by other government for a european conference it will be necessary to wait to see what the outcome of their action may be i should not wish to propose or have representative attend a conference which would contemplate commitment oppose to the freedom of action we desire to maintain unimpaired with respect to our purely domestic policy international law our country should also support effort which be be make toward the codification of international law we can look more hopefully in the first instance for research and study that be likely to be productive of result to a cooperation among representative of the bar and member of international law institute and society than to a conference of those who be technically representative of their respective government although when project have be develop they must go to the government for their approval these expert professional study be go on in certain quarter and should have our constant encouragement and approval outlaw of war much interest have of late be manifest in this country in the discussion of various proposal to outlaw aggressive war i look with great sympathy upon the examination of this subject it be in harmony with the traditional policy of our country which be against aggressive war and for the maintenance of permanent and honorable peace while as i have say we must safeguard our liberty to deal accord to our own judgment with our domestic policy we can not fail to view with sympathetic interest all progress to this desire end or carefully to study the measure that may be propose to attain it latin america while we be desirous of promote peace in every quarter of the globe we have a special interest in the peace of this hemisphere it be our constant desire that all cause of dispute in this area may be tranquilly and satisfactorily adjust along with our desire for peace be the earnest hope for the increase prosperity of our sister republic of latin america and our constant purpose to promote cooperation with they which may be mutually beneficial and always inspire by the most cordial friendship foreign debt about $ 12,000,000,000 be due to our government from abroad mostly from european government great britain finland hungary lithuania and poland have negotiate settlement amount close to $ 5,000,000,000 this represent the funding of over 42 per cent of the debt since the creation of the special foreign debt commission as the life of this commission be about to expire its term should be extend i be oppose to the cancellation of these debt and believe it for the good welfare of the world that they should be liquidate and pay as fast as possible i do not favor oppressive measure but unless money that be borrow be repay credit can not be secure in time of necessity and there exist besides a moral obligation which our country can not ignore and no other country can evade term and condition may have to conform to difference in the financial ability of the country concern but the principle that each country should meet its obligation admit of no difference and be of universal application it be axiomatic that our country can not stand still it would seem to be perfectly plain from recent event that it be determined to go forward but it want no pretense it want no vagary it be determined to advance in an orderly sound and common sense way it do not propose to abandon the theory of the declaration that the people have inalienable right which no majority and no power of government can destroy it do not propose to abandon the practice of the constitution that provide for the
