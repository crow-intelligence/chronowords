  before i begin let i speak to important news from early today after eight month of nonstop negotiation my administration by my administration a ceasefire and a hostage deal have be reach by israel and hamas the element of which i lay out in great detail in may of this year
  this plan be develop and negotiate by my team and will be largely implement by the incoming administration that ’s why i tell my team to keep the incoming administration fully inform because that ’ how it should be work together as americans
  this will be my final address to you the american people from the oval office from this desk as president and i ’ve be think a lot about who we be and maybe more importantly who we should be
  long ago in new york harbor an ironworker instal beam after beam day after day he be join by steelworker stone mason engineer they build not just a single structure but a beacon of freedom
  the very idea of america be so big we feel the entire world need to see the statue of liberty a gift from france after our civil war like the very idea of america it be build not by one person but by many people from every background and from around the world
  like america the statue of liberty be not stand still   her foot literally step forward atop a broken chain of human bondage she ’s on the march and she literally move she be build to sway back and forth to withstand the fury of stormy weather to stand the test of time because storm be always come she sway a few inch but she never fall into the current below an engineering marvel
  the statue of liberty be also an enduring symbol of the soul of our nation a soul shape by force that bring we together and by force that pull we apart and yet through good time and tough time we ’ve withstand it all
  a nation of pioneer and explorer of dreamer and doer of ancestor native to this land of ancestor who come by force a nation of immigrant who come to build a well life   a nation hold the torch of the most powerful idea ever in the history of the world that all of we all of we be create equal that all of we deserve to be treat with dignity justice and fairness that democracy must defend and be define and be impose move in every way possible our right our freedom our dream
  but we know the idea of america our institution our people our value that uphold it be constantly be test ongoing debate about power and the exercise of power about whether we lead by the example of our power or the power of our example whether we show the courage to stand up to the abuse of power or we yield to it
  after 50 year at the center of all of this i know that believe in the idea of america mean respect the institution that govern a free society the presidency the congress the court a free and independent press institution that be root not to reflect the timeless word but they echo the word of the declaration of independence we hold these truth to be self evident root in the timeless word of the constitution we the people
  our system of separation of power check and balance it may not be perfect but it ’s maintain our democracy for nearly 250 year long than any other nation in history that ’s ever try such a bold experiment
  in the past four year our democracy have hold strong and every day i ’ve keep my commitment to be president for all americans through one of the tough period in our nation ’s history
  i ’ve have a great partner in vice president kamala harris
  it ’s be the honor of my life to see the resilience of essential worker get we through a once in a century pandemic the heroism of service member and first responder keep we safe the determination of advocate stand up for our right and our freedom
  instead of lose their job to an economic crisis that we inherit million of americans now have the dignity of work million of entrepreneur and company create new business and industry hire american worker use american product
  and together we ’ve launch a new era of american possibility one of the great modernization of infrastructure in our entire history from new road bridge clean water affordable high speed internet for every american
  we invent the semiconductor small than the tip of my little finger and now it ’ bring those chip factory and those job back to america where they belong create thousand of job
  finally give medicare the power to negotiate low prescription drug price for million of senior
  and finally do something to protect our child and our family by pass the most significant gun safety law in 30 year and bring violent crime to a 50 year low
  meet our sacred obligation to over 1 million veteran so far who be expose to toxic material and to their family provide medical care and education benefit and more for their family
  you know it will take time to feel the full impact of all we ’ve do together but the seed be plant and they ’ll grow and they ’ll bloom for decade to come
  at home we ’ve create nearly 17 million new job more than any other single administration in a single term
  more people have health care than ever before
  and overseas we ’ve strengthen nato ukraine be still free and we ’ve pull ahead of our competition with china and so much more
  i ’m so proud of how much we ’ve accomplish together for the american people and i wish the incoming administration success because i want america to succeed
  that ’ why i ’ve uphold my duty to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition of power to ensure we lead by the power of our example i have no doubt that america be in a position to continue to succeed
  that ’ why in my farewell address tonight i want to warn the country of some thing that give i great concern and this be the dangerous concern and that ’s the dangerous concentration of power in the hand of very few ultra wealthy people and the dangerous consequence if their abuse of power be leave unchecked
  today an oligarchy be take shape in america of extreme wealth power and influence that literally threaten our entire democracy our basic right and freedom and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead
  we see the consequence all across america and we ’ve see it before more than a century ago but the american people stand up to the robber baron back then and bust the trust
  they do not punish the wealthy they just make the wealthy play by the rule everybody else have to worker win right to earn their fair share you know they be deal into the deal and it help put we on the path to build the large middle class and the most prosperous century any nation the world have ever see and we ’ve get to do that again
  in the last four year that be exactly what we ’ve do
  people should be able to make as much as they can but pplay by the same rule pay their fair share in taxis
  so much be at stake right now the existential threat of climate change have never be clear just look across the country from california to north carolina
  that ’ why i sign the most significant climate and clean energy law ever ever in the history of the world and the rest of the world be try to model it now it ’ work create job and industry of the future
  you know we ’ve prove we do not have to choose between protect the environment and grow the economy we ’re do both
  but powerful force want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate the step we ’ve take to tackle the climate crisis to serve their own interest for power and profit
  we must not be bully into sacrifice the future the future of our child and our grandchild we must keep push forward and push fast there be no time to waste
  it ’ also clear that american leadership in technology be unparalleled an unparalleled source of innovation that can transform life we see the same danger of the concentration of technology power and wealth
  you know his farewell address president eisenhower speak of the danger of the military industrial complex he warn we then about and i quote the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power end of quote
  six decade later i ’m equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech industrial complex that could pose real danger for our country as well
  americans be be bury under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enable the abuse of power the free press be crumble editor be disappear social medium be give up on fact checking the truth be smother by lie tell for power and for profit
  we must hold the social platform accountable to protect our child our family and our very democracy from the abuse of power
  meanwhile artificial intelligence be the most consequential technology of our time perhaps of all time nothing offer more profound possibility and risk for our economy and our security our society our very for humanity
  artificial intelligence even have the potential to help we answer my call to end cancer as we know it but unless safeguard be in place ai could spawn new threat to our right our way of life to our privacy how we work and how we protect our nation
  we must make sure ai be safe and trustworthy and good for all humankind
  in the age of ai it ’ more important than ever that the people must govern and as the land of liberty america not china must lead the world on the development of ai
  you know in the year ahead it will help to be it ’s go to be up to the president the presidency the congress the court the free press and the american people to confront these powerful force
  we must reform the tax code not by give the big tax cut to billionaire but by make they begin to pay their fair share
  we need to get dark money that ’s hide funding behind too many campaign contribution we need to get it out of our politic
  we need to enact an 18 year time limit term limit time and term for the strong ethic reform for our supreme court
  we need to ban member of congress from trade stock while they ’re in the congress
  we need to amend the constitution to make clear that no president no president be immune from crime that he or she commit while in office the president ’s power be limit it ’ not absolute and it should not be
  and in a democracy there ’ another danger to the concentration of power and wealth it erode a sense of unity and common purpose it cause distrust and division participate in our democracy become exhausting and even disillusioning and people do not feel like they have a fair shot
  but we have to stay engaged in the process i know it ’ frustrating
  a fair shot be what make america america everyone be entitle to a fair shot not a guarantee but just a fair shot an even play field go as far as your hard work and talent can take you
  we can never lose that essential truth emain who we be
  i ’ve always believe and i ’ve tell other world leader america can be define by one word possibility
  only in america do we believe anything possible like a kid with a stutter from modest beginning in scranton pennsylvania and claymont delaware sit behind this desk in the oval office as president of the united states
  that ’ the magic of america it ’ all around we
  upstairs in the residence of the white house i ’ve walk by a painting of the statue of liberty i do not know how many time in the painting there be several worker climb on the outstretched arm of the statue that hold the torch it remind i every day i pass it of the story and soul of our nation and the power of the american people
  there ’ a story of a veteran a son of an immigrant whose job it be to climb that torch and polish the amber pane so ray of light could reach out as far as possible he be know as the keeper of the flame
  he once say of the statue of liberty quote speak a silent universal language one of hope that anyone who seek and speak freedom can understand
  yes we sway back and forth to withstand the fury of the storm to stand the test of time a constant struggle constant struggle a short distance between peril and possibility
  but what i believe be the america of our dream be always close than we think and it ’ up to we to make our dream come true
  let i close by state my gratitude to so many people to the member of my administration as well as public service and first responder across the country and around the world thank you for step up to serve
  to our service member and your family it ’s be the high honor of my life to lead you as commander in chief
  and of course to kamala and her incredible partner a historic vice president she and doug have become like family and to i family be everything
  my deep appreciation to our amazing first lady who be with i in the oval today for our entire family you be the love of my life and life of my love
  and my eternal thank to you the american people after 50 year of public service i give you my word i still believe in the idea for which this nation stand a nation where the strength of our institution and the character of our people matter and must endure
  now it ’ your turn to stand guard may you all be the keeper of the flame may you keep the faith
  i love america you love it too
  god bless you all and may god protect our troop thank you for this great honor
