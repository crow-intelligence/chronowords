to the senate of the united states
 i have the honor to make the follow answer to a senate resolution of the 8th instant ask for information as to any interference by any military officer or any part of the army of the united states with the organization or proceeding of the general assembly of the state of louisiana or either branch thereof and also inquire in regard to the existence of armed organization in that state hostile to the government thereof and intent on overturn such government by force
 to say that lawlessness turbulence and bloodshed have characterize the political affair of that state since its reorganization under the reconstruction act be only to repeat what have become well know as a part of its unhappy history but it may be proper here to refer to the election of 1868 by which the republican vote of the state through fraud and violence be reduce to a few thousand and the bloody riot of 1866 and 1868 to show that the disorder there be not due to any recent cause or to any late action of the federal authority
 preparatory to the election of 1872 a shameful and undisguised conspiracy be form to carry that election against the republicans without regard to law or right and to that end the most glaring fraud and forgery be commit in the return after many colored citizen have be deny registration and other deter by fear from cast their ballot
 when the time come for a final canvass of the vote in view of the forego fact william p. kellogg the republican candidate for governor bring suit upon the equity side of the united states circuit court for louisiana and against warmoth and other who have obtain possession of the return of the election represent that several thousand voter of the state have be deprive of the elective franchise on account of their color and pray that step might be take to have say vote count and for general relief to enable the court to inquire as to the truth of these allegation a temporary restraining order be issue against the defendant which be at once wholly disregarded and treat with contempt by those to whom it be direct these proceeding have be widely denounce as an unwarrantable interference by the federal judiciary with the election of state officer but it be to be remember that by the fifteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states the political equality of colored citizen be secure and under the second section of that amendment provide that congress shall have power to enforce its provision by appropriate legislation an act be pass on the 31st of may 1870 and amend in 1871 the object of which be to prevent the denial or abridgment of suffrage to citizen on account of race color or previous condition of servitude and it have be hold by all the federal judge before whom the question have arise include justice strong of the supreme court that the protection afford by this amendment and these act extend to state as well as other election that it be the duty of the federal court to enforce the provision of the constitution of the united states and the law pass in pursuance thereof be too clear for controversy
 section 15 of say act after numerous provision therein to prevent an evasion of the fifteenth amendment provide that the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the united states shall extend to all case in law or equity arise under the provision of say act and of the act amendatory thereof congress seem to have contemplate equitable as well as legal proceeding to prevent the denial of suffrage to colored citizen and it may be safely assert that if kellogg&#39;s bill in the above name case do not present a case for the equitable interposition of the court that no such case can arise under the act that the court of the united states have the fight to interfere in various way with state election so as to maintain political equality and right therein irrespective of race or color be comparatively a new and to some seem to be a startling idea but it result as clearly from the fifteenth amendment to the constitution and the act that have be pass to enforce that amendment as the abrogation of state law uphold slavery result from the thirteenth amendment to the constitution while the jurisdiction of the court in the case of kellogg vs. warmoth and other be clear to my mind it seem that some of the order make by the judge in that and the kindre cause of antoine be illegal but while they be so held and consider it be not to be forget that the mandate of his court have be contemptuously defy and they be make while wild scene of anarchy be sweep away all restraint of law and order doubtless the judge of this court make grave mistake but the law allow the chancellor great latitude not only in punish those who contemn his order and injunction but in prevent the consummation of the wrong which he have judicially forbid whatever may be say or think of those matter it be only make known to i that process of the united states court be resist and as say act especially provide for the use of the army and navy when necessary to enforce judicial process arise thereunder i consider it my duty to see that such process be execute accord to the judgment of the court
 result from these proceeding through various controversy and complication a state administration be organize with william p. kellogg as governor which in the discharge of my duty under section 4 article iv of the constitution i have recognize as the government of the state
 it have be bitterly and persistently allege that kellogg be not elect whether he be or not be not altogether certain nor be it any more certain that his competitor mcenery be choose the election be a gigantic fraud and there be no reliable return of its result kellogg obtain possession of the office and in my opinion have more right to it than his competitor
 on the 20th of february 1873 the committee on privileges and elections of the senate make a report in which they say they be satisfied by testimony that the manipulation of the election machinery by warmoth and other be equivalent to 20,000 vote and they add that to recognize the mcenery government would be recognize a government base upon fraud in defiance of the wish and intention of the voter of the state assume the correctness of the statement in this report and they seem to have be generally accept by the country the great crime in louisiana about which so much have be say be that one be hold the office of governor who be cheat out of 20,000 vote against another whose title to the office be undoubtedly base on fraud and in defiance of the wish and intention of the voter of the state
 misinformed and misjudge as to the nature and extent of this report the supporter of mcenery proceed to displace by force in some county of the state the appointee of governor kellogg and on the 13th of april in an effort of that kind a butchery of citizen be commit at colfax which in bloodthirstiness and barbarity be hardly surpass by any act of savage warfare
 to put this matter beyond controversy i quote from the charge of judge woods of the united states circuit court to the jury in the case of the united states vs. cruikshank and other in new orleans in march 1874 he say
 in the case on trial there be many fact not in controversy i proceed to state some of they in the presence and hearing of counsel on both side and if i state as a concede fact any matter that be dispute they can correct i
 after state the origin of the difficulty which grow out of an attempt of white person to drive the parish judge and sheriff appointee of kellogg from office and their attempt protection by colored person which lead to some fighting in which quite a number of negro be kill the judge state
 most of those who be not kill be take prisoner fifteen or sixteen of the black have lift the board and take refuge under the floor of the court house they be all capture about thirty seven man be take prisoner the number be not definitely fix they be keep under guard until dark they be lead out two by two and shoot most of the man be shoot to death a few be wound not mortally and by pretend to be dead be afterwards during the night able to make their escape among they be the levi nelson name in the indictment
 the dead body of the negro kill in this affair be leave unburied until tuesday april 15 when they be bury by a deputy marshal and an officer of the militia from new orleans these person find fifty nine dead body they show pistol shot wound the great majority in the head and most of they in the back of the head in addition to the fifty nine dead body find some charred remain of dead body be discover near the court house six dead body be find under a warehouse all shoot in the head but one or two which be shoot in the breast
 the only white man injure from the beginning of these trouble to their close be hadnot and harris the court house and its content be entirely consume
 there be no evidence that anyone in the crowd of white bear any lawful warrant for the arrest of any of the black there be no evidence that either nash or cazabat after the affair ever demand their office to which they have set up claim but register continue to act as parish judge and shaw as sheriff
 these be fact in this case as i understand they to be admit
 to hold the people of louisiana generally responsible for these atrocity would not be just but it be a lamentable fact that insuperable obstruction be throw in the way of punish these murderer and the so call conservative paper of the state not only justify the massacre but denounce as federal tyranny and despotism the attempt of the united states officer to bring they to justice fierce denunciation ring through the country about office holding and election matter in louisiana while every one of the colfax miscreant go unwhipped of justice and no way can be find in this boasted land of civilization and christianity to punish the perpetrator of this bloody and monstrous crime
 not unlike this be the massacre in august last several northern young man of capital and enterprise have start the little and flourish town of coushatta some of they be republicans and officeholder under kellogg they be therefore doom to death six of they be seize and carry away from their home and murder in cold blood no one have be punish and the conservative press of the state denounce all effort to that end and boldly justify the crime
 many murder of a like character have be commit in individual ease which can not here be detail for example t. s. crawford judge and p. h. harris district attorney of the twelfth judicial district of the state on their way to court be shoot from their horse by man in ambush on the 8th of october 1873 and the widow of the former in a communication to the department of justice tell a piteous tale of the persecution of her husband because he be a union man and of the effort make to screen those who have commit a crime which to use her own language leave two widow and nine orphan desolate
 to say that the murder of a negro or a white republican be not consider a crime in louisiana would probably be unjust to a great part of the people but it be true that a great number of such murder have be commit and no one have be punish therefor and manifestly as to they the spirit of hatred and violence be strong than law
 representation be make to i that the presence of troop in louisiana be unnecessary and irritate to the people and that there be no danger of public disturbance if they be take away consequently early in last summer the troop be all withdraw from the state with the exception of a small garrison at new orleans barracks it be claim that a comparative state of quiet have supervene political excitement as to louisiana affair seem to be die out but the november election be approach and it be necessary for party purpose that the flame should be rekindle
 accordingly on the 14th of september d. p. penn claim that he be elect lieutenant governor in 1872 issue an inflammatory proclamation call upon the militia of the state to arm assemble and drive from power the usurper as he designate the officer of the state the white leagues armed and ready for the conflict promptly respond
 on the same day the governor make a formal requisition upon i pursuant to the act of 1795 and section 4 article iv of the constitution to aid in suppress domestic violence on the next day i issue my proclamation command the insurgent to disperse within five day from the date thereof but before the proclamation be publish in new orleans the organized and armed force recognize a usurping governor have take forcible possession of the statehouse and temporarily subvert the government twenty or more people be kill include a number of the police of the city the street of the city be stain with blood all that be desire in the way of excitement have be accomplish and in view of the step take to repress it the revolution be apparently though it be believe not really abandon and the cry of federal usurpation and tyranny in louisiana be renew with redoubled energy troop have be send to the state under this requisition of the governor and as other disturbance seem imminent they be allow to remain there to render the executive such aid as might become necessary to enforce the law of the state and repress the continue violence which seem inevitable the moment federal support should be withdraw
 prior to and with a view to the late election in louisiana white man associate themselves together in armed body call white leagues and at the same time threat be make in the democratic journal of the state that the election should be carry against the republicans at all hazard which very naturally greatly alarm the colored voter by section 8 of the act of february 28 1871 it be make the duty of united states marshal and their deputy at poll where vote be cast for representatives in congress to keep the peace and prevent any violation of the so call enforcement act and other offense against the law of the united states and upon a requisition of the marshal of louisiana and in view of say armed organization and other portentous circumstance i cause detachment of troop to be station in various locality in the state to aid he in the performance of his official duty that there be intimidation of republican voter at the election notwithstanding these precaution admit of no doubt the follow be specimen of the mean use
 on the 14th of october eighty person sign and publish the following at shreveport
 we the undersigned merchant of the city of shreveport in obedience to a request of the shreveport campaign club agree to use every endeavor to get our employee to vote the people&#39;s ticket at the ensue election and in the event of their refusal so to do or in case they vote the radical ticket to refuse to employ they at the expiration of their present contract
 on the same day another large body of person publish in the same place a paper in which they use the follow language
 we the undersigned merchant of the city of shreveport alive to the great importance of secure good and honest government to the state do agree and pledge ourselves not to advance any supply or money to any planter the come year who will give employment or rent land to laborer who vote the radical ticket in the come election
 i have no information of the proceeding of the return board for say election which may not be find in its report which have be publish but it be a matter of public information that a great part of the time take to canvass the vote be consume by the argument of lawyer several of whom represent each party before the board i have no evidence that the proceeding of this board be not in accordance with the law under which they act whether in exclude from their count certain return they be right or wrong be a question that depend upon the evidence they have before they but it be very clear that the law give they the power if they choose to exercise it of decide that way and prima facie the person whom they return as elect be entitle to the office for which they be candidate
 respect the alleged interference by the military with the organization of the legislature of louisiana on the 4th instant i have no knowledge or information which have not be receive by i since that time and publish my first information be from the paper of the morning of the 5th of january i do not know that any such thing be anticipate and no order nor suggestion be ever give to any military officer in that state upon that subject prior to the occurrence i be well aware that any military interference by the officer or troop of the united states with the organization of the state legislature or any of its proceeding or with any civil department of the government be repugnant to our idea of government i can conceive of no case not involve rebellion or insurrection where such interference by authority of the general government ought to be permit or can be justify but there be circumstance connect with the late legislative imbroglio in louisiana which seem to exempt the military from any intentional wrong in that matter know that they have be place in louisiana to prevent domestic violence and aid in the enforcement of the state law the officer and troop of the united states may well have suppose that it be their duty to act when call upon by the governor for that purpose
 each branch of a legislative assembly be the judge of the election and qualification of its own member but if a mob or a body of unauthorized person seize and hold the legislative hall in a tumultuous and riotous manner and so prevent any organization by those legally return as elect it might become the duty of the state executive to interpose if request by a majority of the member elect to suppress the disturbance and enable the person elect to organize the house
 any exercise of this power would only be justifiable under most extraordinary circumstance and it would then be the duty of the governor to call upon the constabulary or if necessary the military force of the state but with reference to louisiana it be to be bear in mind that any attempt by the governor to use the police force of that state at this time would have undoubtedly precipitate a bloody conflict with the white league as it do on the 14th of september
 there be no doubt but that the presence of the united states troop upon that occasion prevent bloodshed and the loss of life both party appear to have rely upon they as conservator of the public peace
 the first call be make by the democrats to remove person obnoxious to they from the legislative hall and the second be from the republicans to remove person who have usurped seat in the legislature without legal certificate authorize they to seat and in sufficient number to change the majority
 nobody be disturb by the military who have a legal right at that time to occupy a seat in the legislature that the democratic minority of the house undertake to seize its organization by fraud and violence that in this attempt they trample under foot law that they undertake to make person not return as elect member so as to create a majority that they act under a preconcerte plan and under false pretense introduce into the hall a body of man to support their pretension by force if necessary and that conflict disorder and riotous proceeding follow be fact that seem to be well establish and i be credibly inform that these violent proceeding be a part of a premeditate plan to have the house organize in this way recognize what have be call the mcenery senate then to depose governor kellogg and so revolutionize the state government
 whether it be wrong for the governor at the request of the majority of the member return as elect to the house to use such mean as be in his power to defeat these lawless and revolutionary proceeding be perhaps a debatable question but it be quite certain that there would have be no trouble if those who now complain of illegal interference have allow the house to be organize in a lawful and regular manner when those who inaugurate disorder and anarchy disavow such proceeding it will be time enough to condemn those who by such mean as they have prevent the success of their lawless and desperate scheme
 lieutenant general sheridan be request by i to go to louisiana to observe and report the situation there and if in his opinion necessary to assume the command which he do on the 4th instant after the legislative disturbance have occur at 9 o&#39;clock p.m. a number of hour after the disturbance no party motive nor prejudice can reasonably be impute to he but honestly convince by what he have see and hear there he have characterize the leader of the white leagues in severe term and suggest summary mode of procedure against they which though they can not be adopt would if legal soon put an end to the trouble and disorder in that state general sheridan be look at fact and possibly not think of proceeding which would be the only proper one to pursue in time of peace think more of the utterly lawless condition of society surround he at the time of his dispatch and of what would prove a sure remedy he never propose to do an illegal act nor express determination to proceed beyond what the law in the future might authorize for the punishment of the atrocity which have be commit and the commission of which can not be successfully deny it be a deplorable fact that political crime and murder have be commit in louisiana which have go unpunished and which have be justify or apologize for which must rest as a reproach upon the state and country long after the present generation have pass away
 i have no desire to have united states troop interfere in the domestic concern of louisiana or any other state
 on the 9th of december last governor kellogg telegraph to i his apprehension that the white league intend to make another attack upon the statehouse to which on the same day i make the follow answer since which no communication have be send to he
 your dispatch of this date just receive it be exceedingly unpalatable to use troop in anticipation of danger let the state authority be right and then proceed with their duty without apprehension of danger if they be then molest the question will be determine whether the united states be able to maintain law and order within its limit or not
 i have deplore the necessity which seem to make it my duty under the constitution and law to direct such interference i have always refuse except where it seem to be my imperative duty to act in such a manner under the constitution and law of the united states i have repeatedly and earnestly entreat the people of the south to live together in peace and obey the law and nothing would give i great pleasure than to see reconciliation and tranquillity everywhere prevail and thereby remove all necessity for the presence of troop among they i regret however to say that this state of thing do not exist nor do its existence seem to be desire in some locality and as to those it may be proper for i to say that to the extent that congress have confer power upon i to prevent it neither ku klux klans white leagues nor any other association use arm and violence to execute their unlawful purpose can be permit in that way to govern any part of this country nor can i see with indifference union man or republicans ostracize persecute and murder on account of their opinion as they now be in some locality
 i have heretofore urge the case of louisiana upon the attention of congress and i can not but think that its inaction have produce great evil
 to summarize in september last an armed organized body of man in the support of candidate who have be put in nomination for the office of governor and lieutenant governor at the november election in 1872 and who have be declare not elect by the board of canvasser recognize by all the court to which the question have be submit undertake to subvert and overthrow the state government that have be recognize by i in accordance with previous precedent the recognize governor be drive from the statehouse and but for his finding shelter in the united states custom house in the capital of the state of which he be governor it be scarcely to be doubt that he would have be kill
 from the statehouse before he have be drive to the custom house a call be make in accordance with the fourth section fourth article of the constitution of the united states for the aid of the general government to suppress domestic violence under those circumstance and in accordance with my sworn duty my proclamation of the 15th of september 1874 be issue this serve to reinstate governor kellogg to his position nominally but it can not be claim that the insurgent have to this day surrender to the state authority the arm belong to the state or that they have in any sense disarm on the contrary it be know that the same armed organization that exist on the 14th of september 1874 in opposition to the recognize state government still retain their organization equipment and commander and can be call out at any hour to resist the state government under these circumstance the same military force have be continue in louisiana as be send there under the first call and under the same general instruction i repeat that the task assume by the troop be not a pleasant one to they that the army be not compose of lawyer capable of judge at a moment&#39;s notice of just how far they can go in the maintenance of law and order and that it be impossible to give specific instruction provide for all possible contingency that might arise the troop be bind to act upon the judgment of the command officer upon each sudden contingency that arise or wait instruction which could only reach they after the threaten wrong have be commit which they be call on to prevent it should be recollect too that upon my recognition of the kellogg government i report the fact with the ground of recognition to congress and ask that body to take action in the matter otherwise i should regard their silence as an acquiescence in my course no action have be take by that body and i have maintain the position then mark out
 if error have be commit by the army in these matter it have always be on the side of the preservation of good order the maintenance of law and the protection of life their bearing reflect credit upon the soldier and if wrong have result the blame be with the turbulent element surround they
 i now earnestly ask that such action be take by congress as to leave my duty perfectly clear in deal with the affair of louisiana give assurance at the same time that whatever may be do by that body in the premise will be execute accord to the spirit and letter of the law without fear or favor
 i herewith transmit copy of document contain more specific information as to the subject matter of the resolution

to the senate of the united states
 senate bill no 1044 to provide for the resumption of specie payment be before i and this day receive my signature of approval
 i venture upon this unusual method of convey the notice of approval to the house in which the measure originate because of its great importance to the country at large and in order to suggest further legislation which seem to i essential to make this law effective
 it be a subject of congratulation that a measure have become law which fix a date when specie resumption shall commence and imply an obligation on the part of congress if in its power to give such legislation as may prove necessary to redeem this promise
 to this end i respectfully call your attention to a few suggestion
 first the necessity of an increase revenue to carry out the obligation of add to the sink fund annually 1 per cent of the public debt amount now to about $ 34,000,000 per annum and to carry out the promise of this measure to redeem under certain contingency eighty million of the present legal tender and without contingency the fractional currency now in circulation
 how to increase the surplus revenue be for congress to devise but i will venture to suggest that the duty on tea and coffee might be restore without permanently enhance the cost to the consumer and that the 10 per cent horizontal reduction of the tariff on article specify in the law of june 6 1872 be repeal the supply of tea and coffee already on hand in the united states would in all probability be advanced in price by adopt this measure but it be know that the adoption of free entry to those article of necessity do not cheapen they but merely add to the profit of the country produce they or of the middleman in those country who have the exclusive trade in they
 second the first section of the bill now under consideration provide that the fractional currency shall be redeem in silver coin as rapidly as practicable there be no provision prevent the fluctuation in the value of the paper currency with gold at a premium of anything over 10 per cent above the currency in use it be probable almost certain that silver would be buy up for exportation as fast as it be put out or until change would become so scarce as to make the premium on it equal to the premium on gold or sufficiently high to make it no long profitable to buy for export thereby cause a direct loss to the community at large and great embarrassment to trade
 as the present law command final resumption on the 1st day of january 1879 and as the gold receipt by the treasury be large than the gold payment and the currency receipt be small than the currency payment thereby make monthly sale of gold necessary to meet current currency expense it occur to i that these difficulty might be remedie by authorize the secretary of the treasury to redeem legal tender note whenever present in sum of not less than $ 100 and multiple thereof at a premium for gold of 10 per cent less interest at the rate of 2 1/2 per cent per annum from the 1st day of january 1875 to the date of put this law into operation and diminish this premium at the same rate until final resumption change the rate of premium demand from time to time as the interest amount to one quarter of 1 per cent i suggest this rate of interest because it would bring currency at par with gold at the date fix by law for final resumption i suggest 10 per cent as the demand premium at the beginning because i believe this rate would insure the retention of silver in the country for change
 the provision of the third section of the act will prevent combination be make to exhaust the treasury of coin
 with such a law it be presumable that no gold would be call for not require for legitimate business purpose when large amount of coin should be draw from the treasury correspondingly large amount of currency would be withdraw from circulation thus cause a sufficient stringency in currency to stop the outward flow of coin
 the advantage of a currency of a fix know value would also be reach in my opinion by the enactment of such a law business and industry would revive and the beginning of prosperity on a firm basis would be reach
 other mean of increase revenue than those suggest should probably be devise and also other legislation
 in fact to carry out the first section of the act another mint become a necessity with the present facility for coinage it would take a period probably beyond that fix by law for final specie resumption to coin the silver necessary to transact the business of the country
 there be now smelt furnace for extract the silver and gold from the ore bring from the mountain territory in chicago st. louis and omaha three in the former city and as much of the change require will be want in the mississippi valley states and as the metal to be coin come from west of those states and as i understand the charge for transportation of bullion from either of the city name to the mint in philadelphia or to new york city amount to $ 4 for each $ 1,000 worth with an equal expense for transportation back it would seem a fair argument in favor of adopt one or more of those city as the place or place for the establishment of new coining facility
 i have venture upon this subject with great diffidence because it be so unusual to approve a measure as i most heartily do this even if no further legislation be attainable at this time and to announce the fact by message but i do so because i feel that it be a subject of such vital importance to the whole country that it should receive the attention of and be discuss by congress and the people through the press and in every way to the end that the good and most satisfactory course may be reach of execute what i deem most beneficial legislation on a most vital question to the interest and prosperity of the nation

to the senate of the united states
 herewith i return senate bill no 172 entitle an act fix the salary of the president of the united states without my approval
 i be constrain to this course from a sense of duty to my successor in office to myself and to what be due to the dignity of the position of chief magistrate of a nation of more than 40,000,000 people
 when the salary of the president of the united states pursuant to the constitution be fix at $ 25,000 per annum we be a nation of but 3,000,000 people poor from a long and exhaustive war without commerce or manufacture with but few want and those cheaply supply the salary must then have be deem small for the responsibility and dignity of the position but justifiably so from the impoverished condition of the treasury and the simplicity it be desire to cultivate in the republic
 the salary of congressmen under the constitution be first fix at $ 6 per day for the time actually in session an average of about one hundred and twenty day to each session or $ 720 per year or less than one thirtieth of the salary of the president
 congress have legislate upon their own salary from time to time since until finally it reach $ 5,000 per annum or one fifth that of the president before the salary of the latter be increase
 no one have a knowledge of the cost of live at the national capital will contend that the present salary of congressmen be too high unless it be the intention to make the office one entirely of honor when the salary should be abolish a proposition repugnant to our republican idea and institution
 i do not believe the citizen of this republic desire their public servant to serve they without a fair compensation for their service twenty five thousand dollar do not defray the expense of the executive for one year or have not in my experience it be not now one fifth in value of what it be at the time of the adoption of the constitution in supply demand and want
 have no personal interest in this matter i have feel myself free to return this bill to the house in which it originate with my objection believe that in do so i meet the wish and judgment of the great majority of those who indirectly pay all the salary and other expense of government

to the senate and house of representatives in submit my seventh annual message to congress in this centennial year of our national existence as a free and independent people it afford i great pleasure to recur to the advancement that have be make from the time of the colony one hundred year ago we be then a people number only 3,000,000 now we number more than 40,000,000 then industry be confine almost exclusively to the tillage of the soil now manufactory absorb much of the labor of the country our liberty remain unimpaired the bondman have be free from slavery we have become possess of the respect if not the friendship of all civilized nation our progress have be great in all the art in science agriculture commerce navigation mining mechanic law medicine etc and in general education the progress be likewise encouraging our thirteen state have become thirty eight include colorado which have take the initiatory step to become a state and eight territories include the indian territory

hundred year ago the cotton gin the steamship the railroad the telegraph the reaping sewing and modern printing machine and numerous other invention of scarcely less value to our business and happiness be entirely unknown in 1776 manufactory scarcely exist even in name in all this vast territory in 1870 more than 2,000,000 person be employ in manufactory produce more than $ 2,100,000,000 of product in amount annually nearly equal to our national debt from nearly the whole of the population of 1776 be engage in the one occupation of agriculture in 1870 so numerous and diversified have become the occupation of our people that less than 6,000,000 out of more than 40,000,000 be so engaged the extraordinary effect produce in our country by a resort to diversify occupation have build a market for the product of fertile land distant from the seaboard and the market of the world the american system of locate various and extensive manufactory next to the plow and the pasture and add connect railroad and steamboat have produce in our distant interior country a result noticeable by the intelligent portion all all commercial nation the ingenuity and skill of american mechanic have be demonstrate at home and abroad in a manner most flattering to their pride but for the extraordinary genius and ability of our mechanic the achievement of our agriculturist manufacturer and transporter throughout the country would have be impossible of attainment the progress of the miner have also be great of coal our production have small now many million of ton be mine annually so with iron which form scarcely an appreciable part of our product half a century ago we now produce more than the world consume at the beginning of our national existence lead zinc and copper from be article of import we may expect to be large exporter of in the near future the development of gold and silver mine in the united states and territories have not only be remarkable but have have a large influence upon the business of all commercial nation our merchant in the last hundred year have have a success and have establish a reputation for enterprise sagacity progress and integrity unsurpasse by people of old nationality this good name be not confine to their home but go out upon every sea and into every port where commerce enter with equal pride we can point to our progress in all of the learn profession as we be now about to enter upon our second centennial comment our manhood as a nation it be well to look back upon the past and study what will be good to preserve and advance our future greatness from the fall of adam for his transgression to the present day no nation have ever be free from threatened danger to its prosperity and happiness we should look to the danger threaten we and remedy they so far as lie in our power we be a republic whereof one man be as good as another before the law under such a form of government it be of the great importance that all should be possess of education and intelligence enough to cast a vote with a right understanding of its meaning a large association of ignorant man can not for any considerable period oppose a successful resistance to tyranny and oppression from the educate few but will inevitably sink into acquiescence to the will of intelligence whether direct by the demagogue or by priestcraft hence the education of the masse become of the first necessity for the preservation of our institution they be worth preserve because they have secure the great good to the great proportion of the population of any form of government yet devise all other form of government approach it just in proportion to the general diffusion of education and independence of thought and action as the primary step therefore to our advancement in all that have mark our progress in the past century i suggest for your earnest consideration and most earnestly recommend it that a constitutional amendment be submit to the legislature of the several states for ratification make it the duty of each of the several states to establish and forever maintain free public school adequate to the education of all the child in the rudimentary branch within their respective limit irrespective of sex color birthplace or religion forbid the teaching in say school of religious atheistic or pagan tenet and prohibit the granting of any school fund or school taxis or any part thereof either by legislative municipal or other authority for the benefit or in aid directly or indirectly of any religious sect or denomination or in aid or for the benefit of any other object of any nature or kind whatever in connection with this important question i would also call your attention to the importance of correct an evil that if permit to continue will probably lead to great trouble in our land before the close of the nineteenth century it be the accumulation of vast amount of untaxed church property in 1850 i believe the church property of the united states which pay no tax municipal or state amount to about $ 83,000,000 in 1860 the amount have double in 1875 it be about $ 1,000,000,000 by 1900 without check it be safe to say this property will reach a sum exceed $ 3,000,000,000 so vast a sum receive all the protection and benefit of government without bear its proportion of the burden and expense of the same will not be look upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxis in a grow country where real estate enhance so rapidly with time as in the united states there be scarcely a limit to the wealth that may be acquire by corporation religious or otherwise if allow to retain real estate without taxation the contemplation of so vast a property as here allude to without taxation may lead to sequestration without constitutional authority and through blood i would suggest the taxation of all property equally whether church or corporation exempt only the last resting place of the dead and possibly with proper restriction church edifice our relation with most of the foreign power continue on a satisfactory and friendly footing increase intercourse the extension of commerce and the cultivation of mutual interest have steadily improve our relation with the large majority of the power of the world render practicable the peaceful solution of question which from time to time necessarily arise leave few which demand extended or particular notice the correspondence of the department of state with our diplomatic representative abroad be transmit herewith i be happy to announce the passage of an act by the general cortes of portugal proclaim since the adjournment of congress for the abolition of servitude in the portuguese colony it be to be hope that such legislation may be another step toward the great consummation to be reach when no man shall be permit directly or indirectly under any guise excuse or form of law to hold his fellow man in bondage i be of opinion also that it be the duty of the united states as contribute toward that end and require by the spirit of the age in which we live to provide by suitable legislation that no citizen of the united states shall hold slave as property in any other country or be interested therein chile have make reparation in the case of the whale ship good return seize without sufficient cause upward of forty year ago though she have hitherto deny her accountability the denial be never acquiesce in by this government and the justice of the claim have be so earnestly contend for that it have be gratify that she should have at last acknowledge it the arbitrator in the case of the united states steamer montijo for the seizure and detention of which the government of the united states of colombia be hold accountable have decide in favor of the claim this decision have settle a question which have be pende for several year and which while it continue open might more or less disturb the good understanding which it be desirable should be maintain between the two republic a reciprocity treaty with the king of the hawaiian islands be conclude some month since as it contain a stipulation that it shall not take effect until congress shall enact the proper legislation for that purpose copy of the instrument be herewith submit in order that if such should be the pleasure of congress the necessary legislation upon the subject may be adopt in march last an arrangement be make through mr. cushing our minister in madrid with the spanish government for the payment by the latter to the united states of the sum of $ 80,000 in coin for the purpose of the relief of the family or person of the ship 's company and certain passenger of the virginius this sum be to have be pay in three installment at two month each it be due to the spanish government that i should state that the payment be fully and spontaneously anticipate by that government and that the whole amount be pay within but a few day more than two month from the date of the agreement a copy of which be herewith transmit in pursuance of the term of the adjustment i have direct the distribution of the amount among the party entitle thereto include the ship 's company and such of the passenger as be american citizen payment be make accordingly on the application by the party entitle thereto the past year have furnish no evidence of an approach termination of the ruinous conflict which have be rage for seven year in the neighbor island of cuba the same disregard of the law of civilized warfare and of the just demand of humanity which have heretofore call forth expression of condemnation from the nation of christendom have continue to blacken the sad scene desolation ruin and pillage be pervade the rich field of one of the most fertile and productive region of the earth and the incendiary 's torch fire plantation and valuable factory and building be the agent mark the alternate advance or retreat of contend party the protract continuance of this strife seriously affect the interest of all commercial nation but those of the united states more than other by reason of close proximity its large trade and intercourse with cuba and the frequent and intimate personal and social relation which have grow up between its citizen and those of the island moreover the property of our citizen in cuba be large and be render insecure and depreciate in value and in capacity of production by the continuance of the strife and the unnatural mode of its conduct the same be true differ only in degree with respect to the interest and people of other nation and the absence of any reasonable assurance of a near termination of the conflict must of necessity soon compel the states thus suffer to consider what the interest of their own people and their duty toward themselves may demand i have hope that spain would be enable to establish peace in her colony to afford security to the property and the interest of our citizen and allow legitimate scope to trade and commerce and the natural production of the island because of this hope and from an extreme reluctance to interfere in the most remote manner in the affair of another and a friendly nation especially of one whose sympathy and friendship in the struggle infancy of our own existence must ever be remember with gratitude i have patiently and anxiously wait the progress of event our own civil conflict be too recent for we not to consider the difficulty which surround a government distract by a dynastic rebellion at home at the same time that it have to cope with a separate insurrection in a distant colony but whatever cause may have produce the situation which so grievously affect our interest it exist with all its attendant evil operate directly upon this country and its people thus far all the effort of spain have prove abortive and time have mark no improvement in the situation the armed band of either side now occupy nearly the same ground as in the past with the difference from time to time of more life sacrifice more property destroy and wide extent of fertile and productive field and more and more of valuable property constantly wantonly sacrifice to the incendiary 's torch in contest of this nature where a considerable body of people who have attempt to free themselves of the control of the superior government have reach such point in occupation of territory in power and in general organization as to constitute in fact a body politic have a government in substance as well as in name possess of the element of stability and equip with the machinery for the administration of internal policy and the execution of its law prepared and able to administer justice at home as well as in its dealing with other power it be within the province of those other power to recognize its existence as a new and independent nation in such case other nation simply deal with an actually exist condition of thing and recognize as one of the power of the earth that body politic which possess the necessary element have in fact become a new power in a word the creation of a new state be a fact to establish the condition of thing essential to the recognition of this fact there must be a people occupy a know territory unite under some known and define form of government acknowledge by those subject thereto in which the function of government be administer by usual method competent to mete out justice to citizen and stranger to afford remedy for public and for private wrong and able to assume the correlative international obligation and capable of perform the correspond international duty result from its acquisition of the right of sovereignty a power should exist complete in its organization ready to take and able to maintain its place among the nation of the earth while conscious that the insurrection in cuba have show a strength and endurance which make it at least doubtful whether it be in the power of spain to subdue it it seem unquestionable that no such civil organization exist which may be recognize as an independent government capable of perform its international obligation and entitle to be treat as one of the power of the earth a recognition under such circumstance would be inconsistent with the fact and would compel the power grant it soon to support by force the government to which it have really give its only claim of existence in my judgment the united states should adhere to the policy and the principle which have heretofore be its sure and safe guide in like contest between revolted colony and their mother country and act only upon the clear evidence should avoid any possibility of suspicion or of imputation a recognition of the independence of cuba be in my opinion impracticable and indefensible the question which next present itself be that of the recognition of belligerent right in the party to the contest in a former message to congress i have occasion to consider this question and reach the conclusion that the conflict in cuba dreadful and devastating as be its incident do not rise to the fearful dignity of war regard it now after this lapse of time i be unable to see that any notable success or any marked or real advance on the part of the insurgent have essentially change the character of the contest it have acquire great age but not great or more formidable proportion it be possible that the act of foreign power and even act of spain herself of this very nature might be point to in defense of such recognition but now as in its past history the united states should carefully avoid the false light which might lead it into the maze of doubtful law and of questionable propriety and adhere rigidly and sternly to the rule which have be its guide of do only that which be right and honest and of good report the question of accord or of withholding right of belligerency must be judge in every case in view of the particular attend fact unless justify by necessity it be always and justly regard as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration of moral support to the rebellion it be necessary and it be require when the interest and right of another government or of its people be so far affect by a pende civil conflict as to require a definition of its relation to the party thereto but this conflict must be one which will be recognize in the sense of international law as war belligerence too be a fact the mere existence of contend armed body and their occasional conflict do not constitute war in the sense refer to apply to the exist condition of affair in cuba the test recognize by publicist and writer on international law and which have be observe by nation of dignity honesty and power when free from sensitive or selfish and unworthy motive i fail to find in the insurrection the existence of such a substantial political organization real palpable and manifest to the world have the form and capable of the ordinary function of government toward its own people and to other state with court for the administration of justice with a local habitation possess such organization of force such material such occupation of territory as to take the contest out of the category of a mere rebellious insurrection or occasional skirmish and place it on the terrible footing of war to which a recognition of belligerency would aim to elevate it the contest moreover be solely on land the insurrection have not possess itself of a single seaport whence it may send forth its flag nor have it any mean of communication with foreign power except through the military line of its adversary no apprehension of any of those sudden and difficult complication which a war upon the ocean be apt to precipitate upon the vessel both commercial and national and upon the consular officer of other power call for the definition of their relation to the party to the contest consider as a question of expediency i regard the accordance of belligerent right still to be as unwise and premature as i regard it to be at present indefensible as a measure of right such recognition entail upon the country accord the right which flow from it difficult and complicated duty and require the exaction from the contend party of the strict observance of their right and obligation it confer the right of search upon the high sea by vessel of both party it would subject the carrying of arm and munition of war which now may be transport freely and without interruption in the vessel of the united states to detention and to possible seizure it would give rise to countless vexatious question would release the parent government from responsibility for act do by the insurgent and would invest spain with the right to exercise the supervision recognize by our treaty of 1795 over our commerce on the high sea a very large part of which in its traffic between the atlantic and the gulf states and between all of they and the states on the pacific pass through the water which wash the shore of cuba the exercise of this supervision could scarce fail to lead if not to abuse certainly to collision perilous to the peaceful relation of the two states there can be little doubt to what result such supervision would before long draw this nation it would be unworthy of the united states to inaugurate the possibility of such result by measure of questionable right or expediency or by any indirection apart from any question of theoretical right i be satisfied that while the accordance of belligerent right to the insurgent in cuba might give they a hope and an inducement to protract the struggle it would be but a delusive hope and would not remove the evil which this government and its people be experience but would draw the united states into complication which it have wait long and already suffer much to avoid the recognition of independence or of belligerency be thus in my judgment equally inadmissible it remain to consider what course shall be adopt should the conflict not soon be bring to an end by act of the party themselves and should the evil which result therefrom affect all nation and particularly the united states continue in such event i be of opinion that other nation will be compel to assume the responsibility which devolve upon they and to seriously consider the only remain measure possible mediation and intervention owing perhaps to the large expanse of water separate the island from the peninsula the want of harmony and of personal sympathy between the inhabitant of the colony and those send thither to rule they and want of adaptation of the ancient colonial system of europe to the present time and to the idea which the event of the past century have develop the contend party appear to have within themselves no depository of common confidence to suggest wisdom when passion and excitement have their sway and to assume the part of peacemaker in this view in the early day of the contest the good office of the united states as a mediator be tender in good faith without any selfish purpose in the interest of humanity and in sincere friendship for both party but be at the time decline by spain with the declaration nevertheless that at a future time they would be indispensable no intimation have be receive that in the opinion of spain that time have be reach and yet the strife continue with all its dread horror and all its injury to the interest of the united states and of other nation each party seem quite capable of work great injury and damage to the other as well as to all the relation and interest dependent on the existence of peace in the island but they seem incapable of reach any adjustment and both have thus far fail of achieve any success whereby one party shall possess and control the island to the exclusion of the other under these circumstance the agency of other either by mediation or by intervention seem to be the only alternative which must soon or later be invoke for the termination of the strife at the same time while thus impressed i do not at this time recommend the adoption of any measure of intervention i shall be ready at all time and as the equal friend of both party to respond to a suggestion that the good office of the united states will be acceptable to aid in bring about a peace honorable to both it be due to spain so far as this government be concern that the agency of a third power to which i have advert shall be adopt only as a last expedient have it be the desire of the united states to interfere in the affair of cuba repeat opportunity for so do have be present within the last few year but we have remain passive and have perform our whole duty and all international obligation to spain with friendship fairness and fidelity and with a spirit of patience and forbearance which negative every possible suggestion of desire to interfere or to add to the difficulty with which she have be surround the government of spain have recently submit to our minister at madrid certain proposal which it be hope may be find to be the basis if not the actual submission of term to meet the requirement of the particular grief of which this government have feel itself entitle to complain these proposal have not yet reach i in their full text on their arrival they will be take into careful examination and may i hope lead to a satisfactory adjustment of the question to which they refer and remove the possibility of future occurrence such as have give rise to our just complaint it be understand also that renew effort be be make to introduce reform in the internal administration of the island persuade however that a proper regard for the interest of the united states and of its citizen entitle it to relief from the strain to which it have be subject by the difficulty of the question and the wrong and loss which arise from the contest in cuba and that the interest of humanity itself demand the cessation of the strife before the whole island shall be lay waste and large sacrifice of life be make i shall feel it my duty should my hope of a satisfactory adjustment and of the early restoration of peace and the removal of future cause of complaint be unhappily disappointed to make a further communication to congress at some period not far remote and during the present session recommend what may then seem to i to be necessary the free zone so call several year since establish by the mexican government in certain of the states of that republic adjacent to our frontier remain in full operation it have always be materially injurious to honest traffic for it operate as an incentive to trader in mexico to supply without custom charge the want of inhabitant on this side of the line and prevent the same want from be supply by merchant of the united states thereby to a considerable extent defraud our revenue and check honest commercial enterprise depredation by armed band from mexico on the people of texas near the frontier continue though the main object of these incursion be robbery they frequently result in the murder of unarmed and peaceably disposed person and in some instance even the united states post office and mail communication have be attack renew remonstrance upon this subject have be address to the mexican government but without much apparent effect the military force of this government disposable for service in that quarter be quite inadequate to effectually guard the line even at those point where the incursion be usually make an experiment of an armed vessel on the rio grande for that purpose be on trial and it be hope that if not thwart by the shallowness of the river and other natural obstacle it may materially contribute to the protection of the herdsman of texas the proceeding of the joint commission under the convention between the united states and mexico of the 4th of july 1868 on the subject of claim will soon be bring to a close the result of those proceeding will then be communicate to congress i be happy to announce that the government of venezuela have upon further consideration practically abandon its objection to pay to the united states that share of its revenue which some year since it allot toward the extinguishment of the claim of foreigner generally in thus reconsider its determination that government have show a just sense of self respect which can not fail to reflect credit upon it in the eye of all disinterested person elsewhere it be to be regret however that its payment on account of claim of citizen of the united states be still so meager in amount and that the stipulation of the treaty in regard to the sum to be pay and the period when those payment be to take place should have be so signally disregarded since my last annual message the exchange have be make of the ratification of a treaty of commerce and navigation with belgium and of convention with the mexican republic for the further extension of the joint commission respect claim with the hawaiian islands for commercial reciprocity and with the ottoman empire for extradition all of which have be duly proclaim the court of commissioners of alabama claims have prosecute its important duty very assiduously and very satisfactorily it convene and be organize on the 22d day of july 1874 and by the term of the act under which it be create be to exist for one year from that date the act provide however that should it be find impracticable to complete the work of the court before the expiration of the year the president might by proclamation extend the time of its duration to a period not more than six month beyond the expiration of the one year having receive satisfactory evidence that it would be impracticable to complete the work within the time originally fix i issue a proclamation a copy of which be present herewith extend the time of duration of the court for a period of six month from and after the 22d day of july last a report make through the clerk of the court communicate herewith show the condition of the calendar on the 1st of november last and the large amount of work which have be accomplish one thousand three hundred and eighty two claim have be present of which 682 have be dispose of at the date of the report i be inform that 170 case be decide during the month of november argument be be make and decision give in the remain case with all the dispatch consistent with the proper consideration of the question submit many of these claim be in behalf of mariner or depend on the evidence of mariner whose absence have delay the taking or the return of the necessary evidence it be represent to i that it will be impracticable for the court to finally dispose of all the case before it within the present limit of its duration justice to the party claimant who have be at large expense in prepare their claim and obtain the evidence in their support suggest a short extension to enable the court to dispose of all of the claim which have be present i recommend the legislation which may be deem proper to enable the court to complete the work before it i recommend that some suitable provision be make by the creation of a special court or by confer the necessary jurisdiction upon some appropriate tribunal for the consideration and determination of the claim of alien against the government of the united states which have arise within some reasonable limitation of time or which may hereafter arise exclude all claim bar by treaty provision or otherwise it have be find impossible to give proper consideration to these claim by the executive departments of the government such a tribunal would afford an opportunity to alien other than british subject to present their claim on account of act commit against their person or property during the rebellion as also to those subject of great britain whose claim having arise subsequent to the 9th day of april 1865 could not be present to the late commission organize pursuant to the provision of the treaty of washington the electric telegraph have become an essential and indispensable agent in the transmission of business and social message its operation on land and within the limit of particular state be necessarily under the control of the jurisdiction within which it operate the line on the high sea however be not subject to the particular control of any one government in 1869 a concession be grant by the french government to a company which propose to lay a cable from the shore of france to the united states at that time there be a telegraphic connection between the united states and the continent of europe through the possession of great britain at either end of the line under the control of an association which have at large outlay of capital and at great risk demonstrate the practicability of maintain such mean of communication the cost of correspondence by this agency be great possibly not too large at the time for a proper remuneration for so hazardous and so costly an enterprise it be however a heavy charge upon a means of communication which the progress in the social and commercial intercourse of the world find to be a necessity and the obtaining of this french concession show that other capital than that already invest be ready to enter into competition with assurance of adequate return for their outlay impressed with the conviction that the interest not only of the people of the united states but of the world at large demand or would demand the multiplication of such mean of communication between separated continent i be desirous that the propose connection should be make but certain provision of this concession be deem by i to be objectionable particularly one which give for a long term of year the exclusive right of telegraphic communication by submarine cable between the shore of france and the united states i could not concede that any power should claim the right to land a cable on the shore of the united states and at the same time deny to the united states or to its citizen or grantee an equal fight to land a cable on its shore the right to control the condition for the laying of a cable within the jurisdictional water of the united states to connect our shore with those of any foreign state pertain exclusively to the government of the united states under such limitation and condition as congress may impose in the absence of legislation by congress i be unwilling on the one hand to yield to a foreign state the right to say that its grantee might land on our shore while it deny a similar right to our people to land on its shore and on the other hand i be reluctant to deny to the great interest of the world and of civilization the facility of such communication as be propose i therefore withhold any resistance to the landing of the cable on condition that the offensive monopoly feature of the concession be abandon and that the right of any cable which may be establish by authority of this government to land upon french territory and to connect with french land line and enjoy all the necessary facility or privilege incident to the use thereof upon as favorable term as any other company be concede as the result thereof the company in question renounce the exclusive privilege and the representative of france be inform that understand this relinquishment to be construe as grant the entire reciprocity and equal facility which have be demand the opposition to the landing of the cable be withdraw the cable under this french concession be land in the month of july 1869 and have be an efficient and valuable agent of communication between this country and the other continent it soon pass under the control however of those who have the management of the cable connect great britain with this continent and thus whatever benefit to the public might have ensue from competition between the two line be lose leave only the great facility of an additional line and the additional security in case of accident to one of they but these increase facility and this additional security together with the control of the combine capital of the two company give also great power to prevent the future construction of other line and to limit the control of telegraphic communication between the two continent to those possess the line already lay within a few month past a cable have be lay know as the united states direct cable company connect the united states directly with great britain as soon as this cable be report to be lay and in work order the rate of the then exist consolidated company be greatly reduce soon however a break be announce in this new cable and immediately the rate of the other line which have be reduce be again raise this cable be now repair the rate appear not to be reduce by either line from those formerly charge by the consolidated company there be reason to believe that large amount of capital both at home and abroad be ready to seek profitable investment in the advancement of this useful and most civilizing mean of intercourse and correspondence they await however the assurance of the mean and condition on which they may safely be make tributary to the general good as these cable telegraph line connect separate state there be question as to their organization and control which probably can be good if not solely settle by convention between the respective state in the absence however of international convention on the subject municipal legislation may secure many point which appear to i important if not indispensable for the protection of the public against the extortion which may result from a monopoly of the right of operate cable telegram or from a combination between several line i. no line should be allow to land on the shore of the united states under the concession from another power which do not admit the right of any other line or line form in the united states to land and freely connect with and operate through its land line ii no line should be allow to land on the shore of the united states which be not by treaty stipulation with the government from whose shore it proceed or by prohibition in its charter or otherwise to the satisfaction of this government prohibit from consolidate or amalgamate with any other cable telegraph line or combine therewith for the purpose of regulate and maintain the cost of telegraphing iii all line should be bind to give precedence in the transmission of the official message of the government of the two country between which it may be lay iv a power should be reserve to the two government either conjointly or to each as regard the message dispatch from its shore to fix a limit to the charge to be demand for the transmission of message i present this subject to the earnest consideration of congress in the meantime and unless congress otherwise direct i shall not oppose the landing of any telegraphic cable which comply with and assent to the point above enumerate but will feel it my duty to prevent the landing of any which do not conform to the first and second point as state and which will not stipulate to concede to this government the precedence in the transmission of its official message and will not enter into a satisfactory arrangement with regard to its charge among the pressing and important subject to which in my opinion the attention of congress should be direct be those relate to fraudulent naturalization and expatriation the united states with great liberality offer its citizenship to all who in good faith comply with the requirement of law these requirement be as simple and upon as favorable term to the emigrant as the high privilege to which he be admit can or should permit i do not propose any additional requirement to those which the law now demand but the very simplicity and the want of unnecessary formality in our law have make fraudulent naturalization not infrequent to the discredit and injury of all honest citizen whether native or naturalize case of this character be continually be bring to the notice of the government by our representative abroad and also those of person resident in other country most frequently those who if they have remain in this country long enough to entitle they to become naturalize have generally not much overpasse that period and have return to the country of their origin where they reside avoid all duty to the united states by their absence and claim to be exempt from all duty to the country of their nativity and of their residence by reason of their alleged naturalization it be due to this government itself and to the great mass of the naturalized citizen who entirely both in name and in fact become citizen of the united states that the high privilege of citizenship of the united states should not be hold by fraud or in derogation of the law and of the good name of every honest citizen on many occasion it have be bring to the knowledge of the government that certificate of naturalization be hold and protection or interference claim by party who admit that not only they be not within the united states at the time of the pretend naturalization but that they have never reside in the united states in other the certificate and record of the court show on their face that the person claim to be naturalize have not reside the require time in the united states in other it be admit upon examination that the requirement of law have not be comply with in some ease even such certificate have be matter of purchase these be not isolate ease arise at rare interval but of common occurrence and which be report from all quarter of the globe such occurrence can not and do not fail to reflect upon the government and injure all honest citizen such a fraud be discover however there be no practicable mean within the control of the government by which the record of naturalization can be vacate and should the certificate be take up as it usually be by the diplomatic and consular representative of the government to whom it may have be present there be nothing to prevent the person claim to have be naturalize from obtain a new certificate from the court in place of that which have be take from he the evil have become so great and of such frequent occurrence that i can not too earnestly recommend that some effective measure be adopt to provide a proper remedy and mean for the vacating of any record thus fraudulently make and of punish the guilty party to the transaction in this connection i refer also to the question of expatriation and the election of nationality the united states be foremost in uphold the right of expatriation and be principally instrumental in overthrow the doctrine of perpetual allegiance congress have declare the right of expatriation to be a natural and inherent right of all people but while many other nation have enact law provide what formality shall be necessary to work a change of allegiance the united states have enact no provision of law and have in no respect mark out how and when expatriation may be accomplish by its citizen instance be bring to the attention of the government where citizen of the united states either naturalized or native bear have formally become citizen or subject of foreign power but who nevertheless in the absence of any provision of legislation on this question when involve in difficulty or when it seem to be their interest claim to be citizen of the united states and demand the intervention of a government which they have long since abandon and to which for year they have render no service nor hold themselves in any way amenable in other case naturalize citizen immediately after naturalization have return to their native country have become engage in business have accept office or pursuit inconsistent with american citizenship and evidence no intent to return to the united states until call upon to discharge some duty to the country where they be reside when at once they assert their citizenship and call upon the representative of the government to aid they in their unjust pretension it be but justice to all bona fide citizen that no doubt should exist on such question and that congress should determine by enactment of law how expatriation may be accomplish and change of citizenship be establish i also invite your attention to the necessity of regulate by law the status of american woman who may marry foreigner and of define more fully that of child bear in a foreign country of american parent who may reside abroad and also of some further provision regulate or give legal effect to marriage of american citizen contract in foreign country the correspondence submit herewith show a few of the constantly occur question on these point present to the consideration of the government there be few subject to engage the attention of congress on which more delicate relation or more important interest be dependent in the month of july last the building erect for the department of state be take possession of and occupy by that department i be happy to announce that the archive and valuable paper of the government in the custody of that department be now safely deposit and properly care for the report of the secretary of the treasury show the receipt from custom for the fiscal year end june 30 1874 to have be $ 163,103,833.69 and for the fiscal year end june 30 1875 to have be $ 157,267,722.35 a decrease for the last fiscal year of $ 5,936,111.34 receipt from internal revenue for the year end the 30th of june 1874 be $ 102,409,784.90 and for the year end june 30 1875 $ 110,007,493.58 increase $ 7,597,708.68.the report also show a complete history of the working of the department for the last year and contain recommendation for reform and for legislation which i concur in but can not comment on so fully as i should like to do if space would permit but will confine myself to a few suggestion which i look upon as vital to the good interest of the whole people come within the purview of treasury i mean specie resumption too much stress can not be lay upon this question and i hope congress may be induce at the early day practicable to insure the consummation of the act of the last congress at its last session to bring about specie resumption on and after the 1st of january 1879 at furth it would be a great blessing if this could be consummate even at an early day nothing seem to i more certain than that a full healthy and permanent reaction can not take place in favor of the industry and financial welfare of the country until we return to a measure of value recognize throughout the civilized world while we use a currency not equivalent to this standard the world 's recognize standard specie become a commodity like the product of the soil the surplus seek a market wherever there be a demand for it under our present system we should want none nor would we have any be it not that custom due must be pay in coin and because of the pledge to pay interest on the public debt in coin the yield of precious metal would flow out for the purchase of foreign production and the united states hewer of wood and drawer of water because of wise legislation on the subject of finance by the nation with whom we have dealing i be not prepared to say that i can suggest the good legislation to secure the end most heartily recommend it will be a source of great gratification to i to be able to approve any measure of congress look effectively toward securing resumption "unlimited inflation would probably bring about specie payment more speedily than any legislation look to redemption of the legal tender in coin but it would be at the expense of honor the legal tender would have no value beyond settle present liability or properly speak repudiate they they would buy nothing after debt be all settle there be a few measure which seem to i important in this connection and which i commend to your earnest consideration a repeal of so much of the legal tender act as make these note receivable for debt contract after a date to be fix in the act itself say not later than the 1st of january 1877 we should then have quotation at real value not fictitious one gold would no long be at a premium but currency at a discount a healthy reaction would set in at once and with it a desire to make the currency equal to what it purport to be the merchant manufacturer and tradesman of every calling could do business on a fair margin of profit the money to be receive have an unvarying value laborer and all class who work for stipulate pay or salary would receive more for their income because extra profit would no long be charge by the capitalist to compensate for the risk of a downward fluctuation in the value of the currency second that the secretary of the treasury be authorize to redeem say not to exceed $ 2,000,000 monthly of legal tender note by issue in their stead a long bond bear interest at the rate of 3.65 per cent per annum of denomination range from $ 50 up to $ 1,000 each this would in time reduce the legal tender note to a volume that could be keep afloat without demand redemption in large sum suddenly third that additional power be give to the secretary of the treasury to accumulate gold for final redemption either by increase revenue curtail expense or both it be preferable to do both and i recommend that reduction of expenditure be make wherever it can be do without impair government obligation or cripple the due execution thereof one measure for increase the revenue and the only one i think of be the restoration of the duty on tea and coffee these duty would add probably $ 18,000,000 to the present amount receive from import and would in no way increase the price pay for those article by the consumer these article be the product of country collect revenue from export and as we the large consumer reduce the duty they proportionately increase they with this addition to the revenue many duty now collect and which give but an insignificant return for the cost of collection might be remit and to the direct advantage of consumer at home i would mention those article which enter into manufacture of all sort all duty pay upon such article go directly to the cost of the article when manufacture here and must be pay for by the consumer these duty not only come from the consumer at home but act as a protection to foreign manufacturer of the same complete article in our own and distant market i will suggest or mention another subject bearing upon the problem of how to enable the secretary of the treasury to accumulate balance it be to devise some well method of verify claim against the government than at present exist through the court of claims especially those claim grow out of the late war nothing be more certain than that a very large percentage of the amount pass and pay be either wholly fraudulent or be far in excess of the real loss sustain the large amount of loss prove on good testimony accord to exist law by affidavit of fictitious or unscrupulous person to have be sustain on small farm and plantation be not only far beyond the possible yield of those place for any one year but as everyone know who have have experience in till the soil and who have visit the scene of these spoliation be in many instance more than the individual claimant be ever worth include their personal and real estate the report of the attorney general which will be submit to congress at an early day will contain a detailed history of award make and of claim pende of the class here refer to the report of the secretary of war accompany this message give a detailed account of army operation for the year just pass expense for maintenance etc with recommendation for legislation to which i respectfully invite your attention to some of these i invite special attention first the necessity of make $ 300,000 of the appropriation for the subsistence department available before the beginning of the next fiscal year without this provision troop at point distant from supply production must either go without food or exist law must be violate it be not attend with cost to the treasury second his recommendation for the enactment of a system of annuity for the family of deceased officer by voluntary deduction from the monthly pay of officer this again be not attend with burden upon the treasury and would for the future relieve much distress which every old army officer have witness in the past of officer die suddenly or be kill leave family without even the mean of reach their friend if fortunate enough to have friend to aid they third the repeal of the law abolish mileage and a return to the old system fourth the trial with torpedo under the corps of engineers and appropriation for the same should war ever occur between the united states and any maritime power torpedo will be among if not the most effective and cheap auxiliary for the defense of harbor and also in aggressive operation that we can have hence it be advisable to learn by experiment their good construction and application as well as effect fifth a permanent organization for the signal service corps this service have now become a necessity of peace as well as war under the advancement make by the present able management sixth a renewal of the appropriation for compile the official record of the war etc the condition of our navy at this time be a subject of satisfaction it do not contain it be true any of the powerful cruise ironclad which make so much of the maritime strength of some other nation but neither our continental situation nor our foreign policy require that we should have a large number of ship of this character while this situation and the nature of our port combine to make those of other nation little dangerous to we under any circumstance our navy do contain however a considerable number of ironclad of the monitor class which though not properly cruiser be powerful and effective for harbor defense and for operation near our own shore of these all the single turrete one fifteen in number have be substantially rebuild their rotten wooden beam replace with iron their hull strengthen and their engine and machinery thoroughly repair so that they be now in the most efficient condition and ready for sea as soon as they can be man and put in commission the five double turrete ironclad belong to our navy by far the most powerful of our ship for fight purpose be also in hand undergo complete repair and could be ready for sea in period vary from four to six month with these complete accord to the present design and our two iron torpedo boat now ready our ironclad fleet will be for the purpose of defense at home equal to any force that can readily be bring against it of our wooden navy also cruiser of various size to the number of about forty include those now in commission be in the atlantic and could be ready for duty as fast as man could be enlist for those not already in commission of these one third be in effect new ship and though some of the remainder need considerable repair to their boiler and machinery they all be or can readily be make effective this constitute a fleet of more than fifty war ship of which fifteen be ironclad now in hand on the atlantic coast the navy have be bring to this condition by a judicious and practical application of what could be spare from the current appropriation of the last few year and from that make to meet the possible emergency of two year ago it have be do quietly without proclamation or display and though it have necessarily straiten the department in its ordinary expenditure and as far as the ironclad be concern have add nothing to the cruise force of the navy yet the result be not the less satisfactory because it be to be find in a great increase of real rather than apparent force the expense incur in the maintenance of an effective naval force in all its branch be necessarily large but such force be essential to our position relation and character and affect seriously the weight of our principle and policy throughout the whole sphere of national responsibility the estimate for the regular support of this branch of the service for the next year amount to a little less in the aggregate than those make for the current year but some additional appropriation be ask for object not include in the ordinary maintenance of the navy but believe to be of press importance at this time it would in my opinion be wise at once to afford sufficient mean for the immediate completion of the five double turrete monitor now undergo repair which must otherwise advance slowly and only as money can be spare from current expense supplement by these our navy arm with the destructive weapon of modern warfare man by our seaman and in charge of our instruct officer will present a force powerful for the home purpose of a responsible though peaceful nation the report of the postmaster general herewith transmit give a full history of the working of the department for the year just past it will be observe that the deficiency to be supply from the general treasury be increase over the amount require for the precede year in a country so vast in area as the united states with large portion sparsely settle it must be expect that this important service will be more or less a burden upon the treasury for many year to come but there be no branch of the public service which interest the whole people more than that of cheap and rapid transmission of the mail to every inhabited part of our territory next to the free school the post office be the great educator of the people and it may well receive the support of the general government the subsidy of $ 150,000 per annum give to vessel of the united states for carry the mail between new york and rio de janeiro having cease on the 30th day of september last we be without direct mail facility with the south american states this be greatly to be regret and i do not hesitate to recommend the authorization of a renewal of that contract and also that the service may be increase from monthly to semi monthly trip the commercial advantage to be gain by a direct line of american steamer to the south american states will far outweigh the expense of the service by act of congress approve march 3 1875 almost all matter whether properly mail matter or not may be send any distance through the mail in package not exceed 4 pound in weight for the sum of 16 cent per pound so far as the transmission of real mail matter go this would seem entirely proper but i suggest that the law be so amend as to exclude from the mail merchandise of all description and limit this transportation to article enumerate and which may be class as mail matter proper the discovery of gold in the black hills a portion of the sioux reservation have have the effect to induce a large emigration of miner to that point thus far the effort to protect the treaty right of the indians to that section have be successful but the next year will certainly witness a large increase of such emigration the negotiation for the relinquishment of the gold field having fail it will be necessary for congress to adopt some measure to relieve the embarrassment grow out of the cause name the secretary of the interior suggest that the supply now appropriate for the sustenance of that people be no long obligatory under the treaty of 1868 but simply a gratuity may be issue or withhold at his discretion the condition of the indian territory to which i have refer in several of my former annual message remain practically unchanged the secretary of the interior have take measure to obtain a full report of the condition of that territory and will make it the subject of a special report at an early day it may then be necessary to make some further recommendation in regard to legislation for the government of that territory the steady growth and increase of the business of the patent office indicate in some measure the progress of the industrial activity of the country the receipt of the office be in excess of its expenditure and the office generally be in a prosperous and satisfactory condition the report of the general land office show that there be 2,459,601 acre less disposed of during this than during the last year more than one half of this decrease be in land dispose of under the homestead and timber culture law the cause of this decrease be suppose to be find in the grasshopper scourge and the drought which prevail so extensively in some of the frontier states and territories during that time as to discourage and deter entry by actual settler the cash receipt be less by $ 690,322.23 than during the precede year the entire survey area of the public domain be 680,253,094 acre of which 26,077,531 acre be survey during the past year leave 1,154,471,762 acre still unsurveyed the report of the commissioner present many interesting suggestion in regard to the management and disposition of the public domain and the modification of exist law the apparent importance of which should insure for they the careful consideration of congress the number of pensioner still continue to decrease the high number having be reach during the year end june 30 1873 during the last year 11,557 name be add to the roll and 12,977 be drop therefrom show a net decrease of 1,420 but while the number of pensioner have decrease the annual amount due on the pension roll have increase $ 44,733.13 this be cause by the greatly increase average rate of pension which by the liberal legislation of congress have increase from $ 90.26 in 1872 to $ 103.91 in 1875 to each invalid pensioner an increase in the average rate of 15 per cent in the three year during the year end june 30 1875 there be pay on account of pension include the expense of disbursement $ 29,683,116 be $ 910,632 less than be pay the precede year this reduction in amount of expenditure be produce by the decrease in the amount of arrearage due on allow claim and on pension the rate of which be increase by the legislation of the precede session of congress at the close of the last fiscal year there be on the pension roll 234,821 person of whom 210,363 be army pensioner 105,478 being invalid and 104,885 widow and dependent relative 3,420 be navy pensioner of whom 1,636 be invalid and 1,784 widow and dependent relative 21,038 be pensioner of the war of 1812 15,875 of whom be survivor and 5,163 be widow it be estimate that $ 29,535,000 will be require for the payment of pension for the next fiscal year an amount $ 965,000 less than the estimate for the present year the geological exploration have be prosecute with energy during the year cover an area of about 40,000 square mile in the territories of colorado utah and new mexico develop the agricultural and mineral resource and furnish interesting scientific and topographical detail of that region the method for the treatment of the indians adopt at the beginning of my first term have be steadily pursue and with satisfactory and encouraging result it have be productive of evident improvement in the condition of that race and will be continue with only such modification as further experience may indicate to be necessary the board heretofore appoint to take charge of the article and material pertain to the war the navy the treasury the interior and the post office departments and the department of agriculture the smithsonian institution and the commission of food fishes to be contribute under the legislation of last session to the international exhibition to be hold at philadelphia during the centennial year 1876 have be diligent in the discharge of the duty which have devolve upon it and the preparation so far make with the mean at command give assurance that the governmental contribution will be make one of the marked characteristic of the exhibition the board have observe commendable economy in the matter of the erection of a building for the governmental exhibit the expense of which it be estimate will not exceed say $ 80,000 this amount have be withdraw under the law from the appropriation of five of the principal departments which leave some of those departments without sufficient mean to render their respective practical exhibit complete and satisfactory the exhibition be an international one and the government be a voluntary contributor it be my opinion that its contribution should be of a character in quality and extent to sustain the dignity and credit of so distinguish a contributor the advantage to the country of a creditable display be in an international point of view of the first importance while an indifferent or uncreditable participation by the government would be humiliating to the patriotic feeling of our people themselves i commend the estimate of the board for the necessary additional appropriation to the favorable consideration of congress the power of europe almost without exception many of the south american states and even the more distant eastern power have manifest their friendly sentiment toward the united states and the interest of the world in our progress by take step to join with we in celebrate the centennial of the nation and i strongly recommend that a more national importance be give to this exhibition by such legislation and by such appropriation as will insure its success its value in bring to our shore innumerable useful work of art and skill the commingling of the citizen of foreign country and our own and the interchange of idea and manufacture will far exceed any pecuniary outlay we may make i transmit herewith the report of the commissioner of agriculture together with the report of the commissioners the board of audit and the board of health of the district of columbia to all of which i invite your attention the bureau of agriculture have accomplish much in disseminate useful knowledge to the agriculturist and also in introduce new and useful production adapt to our soil and climate and be worthy of the continue encouragement of the government the report of the commissioner of education which accompany the report of the secretary of the interior show a gratifying progress in educational matter in nearly every annual message that i have have the honor of transmit to congress i have call attention to the anomalous not to say scandalous condition of affair exist in the territory of utah and have ask for definite legislation to correct it that polygamy should exist in a free enlighten and christian country without the power to punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality seem preposterous true there be no law to sustain this unnatural vice but what be need be a law to punish it as a crime and at the same time to fix the status of the innocent child the offspring of this system and of the possibly innocent plural wife but as an institution polygamy should be banish from the land while this be be do i invite the attention of congress to another though perhaps no less an evil the importation of chinese woman but few of whom be bring to our shore to pursue honorable or useful occupation observation while visit the territories of wyoming utah and colorado during the past autumn convince i that exist law regulate the disposition of public land timber etc and probably the mining law themselves be very defective and should be carefully amend and at an early day territory where cultivation of the soil can only be follow by irrigation and where irrigation be not practicable the land can only be use as pasturage and this only where stock can reach water to quench its thirst can not be govern by the same law as to entry as land every acre of which be an independent estate by itself land must be hold in large quantity to justify the expense of conduct water upon it to make it fruitful or to justify utilize it as pasturage the timber in most of the territories be principally confine to the mountain region which be hold for entry in small quantity only and as mineral land the timber be the property of the united states for the disposal of which there be now no adequate law the settler must become a consumer of this timber whether he live upon the plain or engage in work the mine hence every man become either a trespasser himself or knowingly a patron of trespasser my opportunity for observation be not sufficient to justify i in recommend specific legislation on these subject but i do recommend that a joint committee of the two houses of congress sufficiently large to be divide into subcommittee be organize to visit all the mining states and territories during the come summer and that the committee shall report to congress at the next session such law or amendment to law as it may deem necessary to secure the good interest of the government and the people of these territories who be do so much for their development i be sure the citizen occupy the territory describe do not wish to be trespasser nor will they be if legal way be provide for they to become owner of these actual necessity of their position as this will be the last annual message which i shall have the honor of transmit to congress before my successor be choose i will repeat or recapitulate the question which i deem of vital importance which may be legislate upon and settle at this session first that the states shall be require to afford the opportunity of a good common school education to every child within their limit second no sectarian tenet shall ever be teach in any school support in whole or in part by the state nation or by the proceed of any tax levy upon any community make education compulsory so far as to deprive all person who can not read and write from become voter after the year 1890 disfranchise none however on ground of illiteracy who may be voter at the time this amendment take effect third declare church and state forever separate and distinct but each free within their proper sphere and that all church property shall bear its own proportion of taxation fourth drive out license immorality such as polygamy and the importation of woman for illegitimate purpose to recur again to the centennial year it would seem as though now as we be about to begin the second century of our national existence would be a most fitting time for these reform fifth enact such law as will insure a speedy return to a sound currency such as will command the respect of the world believe that these view will commend themselves to the great majority of the right thinking and patriotic citizen of the united states i submit the rest to congress
to the house of representatives
 i have give very attentive consideration to a resolution of the house of representatives pass on the 3d of april request the president of the united states to inform the house whether any executive office act or duty and if any what have within a specify period be perform at a distance from the seat of government establish by law etc
 i have never hesitate and shall not hesitate to communicate to congress and to either branch thereof all the information which the constitution make it the duty of the president to give or which my judgment may suggest to i or a request from either house may indicate to i will be useful in the discharge of the appropriate duty confide to they i fail however to find in the constitution of the united states the authority give to the house of representatives one branch of the congress in which be vest the legislative power of the government to require of the executive an independent branch of the government coordinate with the senate and house of representatives an account of his discharge of his appropriate and purely executive office act and duty either as to when where or how perform
 what the house of representatives may require as a right in its demand upon the executive for information be limited to what be necessary for the proper discharge of its power of legislation or of impeachment
 the inquiry in the resolution of the house as to where executive act have within the last seven year be perform and at what distance from any particular spot or for how long a period at any one time etc do not necessarily belong to the province of legislation it do not profess to be ask for that object
 if this information be seek through an inquiry of the president as to his executive act in view or in aid of the power of impeachment vest in the house it be ask in derogation of an inherent natural right recognize in this country by a constitutional guaranty which protect every citizen the president as well as the humblest in the land from be make a witness against himself
 during the time that i have have the honor to occupy the position of president of this government it have be and while i continue to occupy that position it will continue to be my earnest endeavor to recognize and to respect the several trust and duty and power of the coordinate branch of the government not encroach upon they nor allow encroachment upon the proper power of the office which the people of the united states have confide to i but aim to preserve in their proper relation the several power and function of each of the coordinate branch of the government agreeably to the constitution and in accordance with the solemn oath which i have take to preserve protect and defend that instrument
 in maintenance of the right secure by the constitution to the executive branch of the government i be compel to decline any specific or detailed answer to the request of the house for information as to any executive office act or duty and if any what have be perform at a distance from the seat of government establish by law and for how long a period at any one time and in what part of the united states
 if however the house of representatives desire to know whether during the period of upward of seven year during which i have hold the office of president of the united states i have be absent from the seat of government and whether during that period i have perform or have neglect to perform the duty of my office i freely inform the house that from the time of my entrance upon my office i have be in the habit as be all of my predecessor with the exception of one who live only one month after assume the duty of his office and one whose continued presence in washington be necessary from the existence at the time of a powerful rebellion of absent myself at time from the seat of government and that during such absence i do not neglect or forego the obligation or the duty of my office but continue to discharge all of the executive office act and duty which be require of i as the president of the united states i be not aware that a failure occur in any one instance of my exercise the function and power of my office in every case require their discharge or of my exercise all necessary executive act in whatever part of the united states i may at the time have be fortunately the rapidity of travel and of mail communication and the facility of almost instantaneous correspondence with the office at the seat of government which the telegraph afford to the president in whatever section of the union he may be enable he in these day to maintain as constant and almost as quick intercourse with the departments at washington as may be maintain while he remain at the capital
 the necessity of the performance of executive act by the president of the united states exist and be devolve upon he wherever he may be within the united states during his term of office by the constitution of the united states
 his civil power be no more limited or capable of limitation as to the place where they shall be exercise than be those which he might be require to discharge in his capacity of commander in chief of the army and navy which latter power it be evident he might be call upon to exercise possibly even without the limit of the united states have the effort of those recently in rebellion against the government be successful in drive a late president of the united states from washington it be manifest that he must have discharge his function both civil and military elsewhere than in the place name by law as the seat of government
 no act of congress can limit suspend or confine this constitutional duty i be not aware of the existence of any act of congress which assume thus to limit or restrict the exercise of the function of the executive be there such act i should nevertheless recognize the superior authority of the constitution and should exercise the power require thereby of the president
 the act to which reference be make in the resolution of the house relate to the establishing of the seat of government and the providing of suitable building and removal thereto of the office attach to the government etc it be not understand at its date and by general washington to confine the president in the discharge of his duty and power to actual presence at the seat of government on the 30th of march 1791 shortly after the passage of the act refer to general washington issue an executive proclamation have reference to the subject of this very act from georgetown a place remote from philadelphia which then be the seat of government where the act refer to direct that all office attach to the seat of government should for the time remain
 that none of his successor have entertain the idea that their executive office could be perform only at the seat of government be evidence by the hundred upon hundred of such act perform by my predecessor in unbroken line from washington to lincoln a memorandum of the general nature and character of some of which act be submit herewith and no question have ever be raise as to the validity of those act or as to the right and propriety of the executive to exercise the power of his office in any part of the united states

 the centennial anniversary of the day on which the people of the united states declare their right to a separate and equal station among the power of the earth seem to demand an exceptional observance
 the founder of the government at its birth and in its feebleness invoke the blessing and the protection of a divine providence and the thirteen colony and three million of people have expand into a nation of strength and number command the position which then be assert and for which fervent prayer be then offer
 it seem fitting that on the occurrence of the hundredth anniversary of our existence as a nation a grateful acknowledgment should be make to almighty god for the protection and the bounty which he have vouchsafe to our beloved country
 i therefore invite the good people of the united states on the approach 4th day of july in addition to the usual observance with which they be accustom to greet the return of the day far in such manner and at such time as in their respective locality and religious association may be most convenient to mark its recurrence by some public religious and devout thanksgiving to almighty god for the blessing which have be bestow upon we as a nation during the century of our existence and humbly to invoke a continuance of his favor and of his protection
 in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and cause the seal of the united states to be affix

 secretary of state

to the senate and house of representatives in submit my eighth and last annual message to congress it seem proper that i should refer to and in some degree recapitulate the event and official act of the past eight year it be my fortune or misfortune to be call to the office of chief executive without any previous political training from the age of 17 i have never even witness the excitement attend a presidential campaign but twice antecedent to my own candidacy and at but one of they be i eligible as a voter under such circumstance it be but reasonable to suppose that error of judgment must have occur even have they not difference of opinion between the executive bind by an oath to the strict performance of his duty and writer and debater must have arise it be not necessarily evidence of blunder on the part of the executive because there be these difference of view mistake have be make as all can see and i admit but it seem to i oftener in the selection make of the assistant appoint to aid in carry out the various duty of administer the government in nearly every case select without a personal acquaintance with the appointee but upon recommendation of the representative choose directly by the people it be impossible where so many trust be to be allot that the right party should be choose in every instance history show that no administration from the time of washington to the present have be free from these mistake but i leave comparison to history claim only that i have act in every instance from a conscientious desire to do what be right constitutional within the law and for the very good interest of the whole people failure have be error of judgment not of intent my civil career commence too at a most critical and difficult time less than four year before the country have emerge from a conflict such as no other nation have ever survive nearly one half of the states have revolt against the government and of those remain faithful to the union a large percentage of the population sympathize with the rebellion and make an enemy in the rear almost as dangerous as the more honorable enemy in the front the latter committed error of judgment but they maintain they openly and courageously the former receive the protection of the government they would see destroy and reap all the pecuniary advantage to be gain out of the then exist state of affair many of they by obtain contract and by swindle the government in the delivery of their good immediately on the cessation of hostility the then noble president who have carry the country so far through its peril fall a martyr to his patriotism at the hand of an assassin the intervene time to my first inauguration be fill up with wrangling between congress and the new executive as to the good mode of reconstruction or to speak plainly as to whether the control of the government should be throw immediately into the hand of those who have so recently and persistently try to destroy it or whether the victor should continue to have an equal voice with they in this control reconstruction as finally agree upon mean this and only this except that the late slave be enfranchised give an increase as be suppose to the union love and union support vote if free in the full sense of the word they would not disappoint this expectation hence at the beginning of my first administration the work of reconstruction much embarrassed by the long delay virtually commenced it be the work of the legislative branch of the government my province be wholly in approve their act which i do most heartily urge the legislature of states that have not yet do so to ratify the fifteenth amendment to the constitution the country be labor under an enormous debt contract in the suppression of rebellion and taxation be so oppressive as to discourage production another danger also threaten we a foreign war the last difficulty have to be adjust and be adjust without a war and in a manner highly honorable to all party concern taxis have be reduce within the last seven year nearly $ 300,000,000 and the national debt have be reduce in the same time over $ 435,000,000 by refund the 6 per cent bond debt for bond bear 5 and 4 1/2 per cent interest respectively the annual interest have be reduce from over $ 130,000,000 in 1869 to but little over $ 100,000,000 in 1876 the balance of trade have be change from over $ 130,000,000 against the united states in 1869 to more than $ 120,000,000 in our favor in 1876.it be confidently believe that the balance of trade in favor of the united states will increase not diminish and that the pledge of congress to resume specie payment in 1879 will be easily accomplish even in the absence of much desire further legislation on the subject a policy have be adopt toward the indian tribe inhabit a large portion of the territory of the united states which have be humane and have substantially end indian hostility in the whole land except in a portion of nebraska and dakota wyoming and montana territories the black hills region and approach thereto hostility there have grow out of the avarice of the white man who have violate our treaty stipulation in his search for gold the question might be ask why the government have not enforce obedience to the term of the treaty prohibit the occupation of the black hills region by white the answer be simple the first immigrant to the black hills be remove by troop but rumor of rich discovery of gold take into that region increase number gold have actually be find in pay quantity and an effort to remove the miner would only result in the desertion of the bulk of the troop that might be send there to remove they all difficulty in this matter have however be remove subject to the approval of congress by a treaty cede the black hills and approach to settlement by citizen the subject of indian policy and treatment be so fully set forth by the secretary of the interior and the commissioner of indian affairs and my view so fully express therein that i refer to their report and recommendation as my own the relation of the united states with foreign power continue on a friendly footing question have arise from time to time in the foreign relation of the government but the united states have be happily free during the past year from the complication and embarrassment which have surround some of the foreign power the diplomatic correspondence submit herewith contain information as to certain of the matter which have occupy the government the cordiality which attend our relation with the power of the earth have be plainly show by the general participation of foreign nation in the exhibition which have just close and by the exertion make by distant power to show their interest in and friendly feeling toward the united states in the commemoration of the centennial of the nation the government and people of the united states have not only fully appreciate this exhibition of kindly feeling but it may be justly and fairly expect that no small benefit will result both to ourselves and other nation from a well acquaintance and a well appreciation of our mutual advantage and mutual want congress at its last session see fit to reduce the amount usually appropriate for foreign intercourse by withhold appropriation for representative of the united states in certain foreign country and for certain consular officer and by reduce the amount usually appropriate for certain other diplomatic post and thus necessitate a change in the grade of the representative for these reason immediately upon the passage of the bill make appropriation for the diplomatic and consular service for the present fiscal year instruction be issue to the representative of the united states at bolivia ecuador and colombia and to the consular officer for whom no appropriation have be make to close their respective legation and consulate and cease from the performance of their duty and in like manner step be immediately take to substitute charge 's d'affaire for minister resident in portugal denmark greece switzerland and paraguay while thoroughly impressed with the wisdom of sound economy in the foreign service as in other branch of the government i can not escape the conclusion that in some instance the withholding of appropriation will prove an expensive economy and that the small retrenchment secure by a change of grade in certain diplomatic post be not an adequate consideration for the loss of influence and importance which will attend our foreign representative under this reduction i be of the opinion that a reexamination of the subject will cause a change in some instance in the conclusion reach on these subject at the last session of congress the court of commissioners of alabama claims whose function be continue by an act of the last session of congress until the 1st day of january 1877 have carry on its labor with diligence and general satisfaction by a report from the clerk of the court transmit herewith bear date november 14 1876 it appear that within the time now allow by law the court will have dispose of all the claim present for adjudication this report also contain a statement of the general result of the labor of the court to the date thereof it be a cause of satisfaction that the method adopt for the satisfaction of the class of claim submit to the court which be of long standing and justly entitle to early consideration should have prove successful and acceptable it be with satisfaction that i be enable to state that the work of the joint commission for determine the boundary line between the united states and british possession from the northw angle of the lake of the woods to the rocky mountains commence in 1872 have be complete the final agreement of the commissioner with the map have be duly sign and the work of the commission be complete the fixing of the boundary upon the

commission have be deposit in the department of state the official report of the commissioner on the part of the united states with the report of the chief astronomer of the united states will be submit to congress within a short time i reserve for a separate communication to congress a statement of the condition of the question which lately arise with great britain respect the surrender of fugitive criminal under the treaty of 1842.the ottoman government give notice under date of january 15 1874 of its desire to terminate the treaty of 1862 concern commerce and navigation pursuant to the provision of the twenty second article thereof under this notice the treaty terminate upon the 5th day of june 1876 that government have invite negotiation toward the conclusion of a new treaty by the act of congress of march 23 1874 the president be authorize when he should receive satisfactory information that the ottoman government or that of egypt have organize new tribunal likely to secure to citizen of the united states the same impartial justice enjoy under the exercise of judicial function by diplomatic and consular officer of the united states to suspend the operation of the act of

proclamation to be issue upon the 27th of march last suspend the operation of the act of june 22 1860 in egypt accord to the provision of the act a copy of the proclamation accompany this message the united states have unite with the other power in the organization of these court it be hope that the jurisdictional question which have arise may be readily adjust and that this advance in judicial reform may be hinder by no obstacle the necessary legislation to carry into effect the convention respect commercial reciprocity conclude with the hawaiian islands in 1875 having be have the proclamation to carry into effect the convention as provide by the act approve august 15 1876 be duly issue upon the 9th day of september last a copy thereof accompany this message the commotion which have be prevalent in mexico for some time past and which unhappily seem to be not yet wholly quiet have lead to complaint of citizen of the united states of injury by person in authority it be hope however that these will ultimately be adjust to the satisfaction of both government the frontier of the united states in that quarter have not be exempt from act of violence by citizen of one republic on those of the other the frequency of these be suppose to be increase and their adjustment make more difficult by the considerable change in the course of the low part of the rio grande river which river be a part of the boundary between the two country these change have place on either side of that river portion of land which by exist convention belong to the jurisdiction of the government on the opposite side of the river the subject of adjustment of this cause of difficulty be under consideration between the two republic the government of the united states of colombia have pay the award in the case of the steamer montijo seize by authority of that government some year since and the amount have be transfer to the claimant it be with satisfaction that i be able to announce that the joint commission for the adjustment of claim between the united states and mexico under the convention of 1868 the duration of which have be several time extend have bring its labor to a close from the report of the agent of the united states which accompany the paper transmit herewith it will be see that within the time limit by the commission 1,017 claim on the part of citizen of the united states against mexico be refer to the commission of these claim 831 be dismiss or disallow and in 186 case award be make in favor of the claimant against the mexican republic amount in the aggregate to $ 4,125,622.20 within the same period 998 claim on the part of citizen of the mexican republic against the united states be refer to the commission of these claim 831 be dismiss or disallow and in 167 case award be make in favor of the claimant against the united states amount in the aggregate to $ 150,498.41.by the term of the convention the amount of these award be to be deduct from the amount award in favor of our citizen against mexico and the balance only to be pay by mexico to the united states leave the united states to make provision for this proportion of the award in favor of its own citizen i invite your attention to the legislation which will be necessary to provide for the payment in this connection i be pleased to be able to express the acknowledgment due to sir edward thornton the umpire of the commission who have give to the consideration of the large number of claim submit to he much time unwearied patience and that firmness and intelligence which be well known to belong to the accomplished representative of great britain and which be likewise recognize by the representative in this country of the republic of mexico monthly payment of a very small part of the amount due by the government of venezuela to citizen of the united states on account of claim of the latter against that government continue to be make with reasonable punctuality that government have propose to change the system which it have hitherto pursue in this respect by issue bond for part of the amount of the several claim the proposition however could not it be suppose properly be accept at least without the consent of the holder of certificate of the indebtedness of venezuela these be so much disperse that it would be difficult if not impossible to ascertain their disposition on the subject in former message i have call the attention of congress to the necessity of legislation with regard to fraudulent naturalization and to the subject of expatriation and the election of nationality the number of person of foreign birth seek a home in the united states the ease and facility with which the honest emigrant may after the lapse of a reasonable time become possessed of all the privilege of citizenship of the united states and the frequent occasion which induce such adopt citizen to return to the country of their birth render the subject of naturalization and the safeguard which experience have prove necessary for the protection of the honest naturalize citizen of paramount importance the very simplicity in the requirement of law on this question afford opportunity for fraud and the want of uniformity in the proceeding and record of the various court and in the form of the certificate of naturalization issue afford a constant source of difficulty i suggest no additional requirement to the acquisition of citizenship beyond those now exist but i invite the earnest attention of congress to the necessity and wisdom of some provision regard uniformity in the record and certificate and provide against the fraud which frequently take place and for the vacating of a record of naturalization obtain in fraud these provision be need in aid and for the protection of the honest citizen of foreign birth and for the want of which he be make to suffer not infrequently the united states have insist upon the right of expatriation and have obtain after a long struggle an admission of the principle contend for by acquiescence therein on the part of many foreign power and by the conclusion of treaty on that subject it be however but justice to the government to which such naturalized citizen have formerly owe allegiance as well as to the united states that certain fixed and definite rule should be adopt govern such case and provide how expatriation may be accomplish while emigrant in large number become citizen of the united states it be also true that person both native bear and naturalize once citizen of the united states either by formal act or as the effect of a series of fact and circumstance abandon their citizenship and cease to be entitle to the protection of the united states but continue on convenient occasion to assert a claim to protection in the absence of provision on these question and in this connection i again invite your attention to the necessity of legislation concern the marriage of american citizen contract abroad and concern the status of american woman who may marry foreigner and of child bear of american parent in a foreign country the delicate and complicated question continually occur with reference to naturalization expatriation and the status of such person as i have above refer to induce i to earnestly direct your attention again to these subject in like manner i repeat my recommendation that some mean be provide for the hearing and determination of the just and subsist claim of alien upon the government of the united states within a reasonable limitation and of such as may hereafter arise while by exist provision of law the court of claims may in certain case be resort to by an alien claimant the absence of any general provision govern all such case and the want of a tribunal skilled in the disposition of such case upon recognize fix and settle principle either provide no remedy in many deserving case or compel a consideration of such claim by congress or the executive department of the government it be believe that other government be in advance of the united states upon this question and that the practice now adopt be entirely unsatisfactory congress by an act approve the 3d day of march 1875 authorize the inhabitant of the territory of colorado to form a state government with the name of the state of colorado and therein provide for the admission of say state when form into the union upon an equal footing with the original state a constitution having be adopt and ratify by the people of that state and the act governor having certify to i the fact as provide by say act together with a copy of such constitution and ordinance as provide for in the said act and the provision of the say act of congress having be duly comply with i issue a proclamation upon the 1st of august 1876 a copy of which be hereto annexed the report of the secretary of war show that the army have be actively employ during the year in subdue at the request of the indian bureau certain wild band of the sioux indian nation and in preserve the peace at the south during the election the commission constitute under the act of july 24 1876 to consider and report on the whole subject of the reform and reorganization of the army meet in august last and have collect a large mass of statistic and opinion bear on the subject before it these be now under consideration and their report be progress i be advise though by the president of the commission that it will be impracticable to comply with the clause of the act require the report to be present through i to congress on the first day of this session as there have not yet be time for that mature deliberation which the importance of the subject demand therefore i ask that the time of make the report be extend to the 29th day of january 1877.in accordance with the resolution of august 15 1876 the army regulation prepare under the act of march 1 1875 have not be promulgate but be hold until after the report of the above mention commission shall have be receive and act on by the act of august 15 1876 the cavalry force of the army be increase by 2,500 man with the proviso that they should be discharge on the expiration of hostility under this authority the cavalry regiment have be strengthen and a portion of they be now in the field pursue the remnant of the indians with whom they have be engage during the summer the estimate of the war department be make up on the basis of the number of man authorize by law and their requirement as show by year of experience and also with the purpose on the part of the bureau officer to provide for all contingency that may arise during the time for which the estimate be make exclusive of engineer estimate present in accordance with act of congress call for survey and estimate for improvement at various locality the estimate now present be about six million in excess of the appropriation for the year 1874 75 and 1875 76 this increase be ask in order to provide for the increase cavalry force should their service be necessary to prosecute economically work upon important public building to provide for armament of fortification and manufacture of small arm and to replenish the work stock in the supply department the appropriation for these last name have for the past few year be so limited that the accumulation in store will be entirely exhausted during the present year and it will be necessary to at once begin to replenish they i invite your special attention to the follow recommendation of the secretary of war first that the claim under the act of july 4 1864 for supply take by the army during the war be remove from the office of the quartermaster and commissary generals and transfer to the southern claims commission these claim be of precisely similar nature to those now before the southern claims commission and the war department bureaus have not the clerical force for their examination nor proper machinery for investigate the loyalty of the claimant second that congress sanction the scheme of an annuity fund for the benefit of the family of deceased officer and that it also provide for the permanent organization of the signal service both of which be recommend in my last annual message third that the manufacture operation of the ordnance department be concentrate at three arsenal and an armory and that the remain arsenal be sell and the proceed apply to this object by the ordnance department the appropriation for river and harbor improvement for the current year be $ 5,015,000 with my approval the secretary of war direct that of this amount $ 2,000,000 should be expend and no new work should be begin and none prosecute which be not of national importance subsequently this amount be increase to $ 2,237,600 and the work be now progress on this basis the improvement of the south pass of the mississippi river under james b. eads and his associate be progress favorably at the present time there be a channel of 20.3 foot in depth between the jetty at the mouth of the pass and 18.5 foot at the head of the pass neither channel however have the width require before payment can be make by the united states a commission of engineer officer be now examine these work and their report will be present as soon as receive the report of the secretary of the navy show that branch of the service to be in condition as effective as it be possible to keep it with the mean and authority give the department it be of course not possible to rival the costly and progressive establishment of great european power with the old material of our navy to which no increase have be authorize since the war except the eight small cruiser build to supply the place of other which have go to decay yet the most have be do that be possible with the mean at command and by substantially rebuild some of our old ship with durable material and completely repair and refit our monitor fleet the navy have be gradually so bring up that though it do not maintain its relative position among the progressive navy of the world it be now in a condition more powerful and effective than it ever have be in time of peace the complete repair of our five heavy ironclad be only delay on account of the inadequacy of the appropriation make last year for the working bureaus of the department which be actually less in amount than those make before the war notwithstanding the greatly enhance price of labor and material and the increase in the cost of the naval service grow out of the universal use and great expense of steam machinery the money necessary for these repair should be provide at once that they may be complete without further unnecessary delay and expense when this be do all the strength that there be in our navy will be develop and useful to its full capacity and it will be powerful for purpose of defense and also for offensive action should the necessity for that arise within a reasonable distance from our shore the fact that our navy be not more modern and powerful than it be have be make a cause of complaint against the secretary of the navy by person who at the same time criticise and complain of his endeavor to bring the navy that we have to its good and most efficient condition but the good sense of the country will understand that it be really due to his practical action that we have at this time any effective naval force at command the report of the postmaster general show the excess of expenditure exclude expenditure on account of previous year over receipt for the fiscal year end june 30 1876 to be $ 4,151,988.66.estimated expenditure for the fiscal year end june 30 1878 be $ 36,723,432.43.estimated revenue for same period be $ 30,645,165 leave estimate excess of expenditure to be appropriate as a deficiency of $ 6,078,267.43.the postmaster general like his predecessor be convince that a change in the basis of adjust the salary of postmaster of the fourth class be necessary for the good of the service as well as for the interest of the government and urgently recommend that the compensation of the class of postmaster above mention be base upon the business of their respective office as ascertain from the swear return to the auditor of stamp cancel a few postmaster in the southern states have express great apprehension of their personal safety on account of their connection with the postal service and have specially request that their report of apprehend danger should not be make public lest it should result in the loss of their life but no positive testimony of interference have be submit except in the case of a mail messenger at spartanburg in south carolina who report that he have be violently drive away while in charge of the mail on account of his political affiliation an assistant superintendent of the railway mail service investigate this case and report that the messenger have disappear from his post leave his work to be perform by a substitute the postmaster general think this case be sufficiently suggestive to justify he in recommend that a more severe punishment should be provide for the offense of assault any person in charge of the mail or of retard or otherwise obstruct they by threat of personal injury "a very gratifying result be present in the fact that the deficiency of this department during the last fiscal year be reduce to $ 4,081,790.18 as against $ 6,169,938.88 of the precede year the difference can be trace to the large increase in its ordinary receipt which greatly exceed the estimate therefor and a slight decrease in its expenditure "the ordinary receipt of the post office department for the past seven fiscal year have increase at an average of over 8 per cent per annum while the increase of expenditure for the same period have be but about 5.50 per cent per annum and the decrease of deficiency in the revenue have be at the rate of nearly 2 per cent per annum the report of the commissioner of agriculture accompany this message will be find one of great interest mark as it do the great progress of the last century in the variety of product of the soil increase knowledge and skill in the labor of produce saving and manipulate the same to prepare they for the use of man in the improvement in machinery to aid the agriculturist in his labor and in a knowledge of those scientific subject necessary to a thorough system of economy in agricultural production namely chemistry botany entomology etc a study of this report by those interested in agriculture and derive their support from it will find it of value in point out those article which be raise in great quantity than the need of the world require and must sell therefore for less than the cost of production and those which command a profit over cost of production because there be not an overproduction i call special attention to the need of the department for a new gallery for the reception of the exhibit return from the centennial exhibition include the exhibit donate by very many foreign nation and to the recommendation of the commissioner of agriculture generally the report of the district commissioners and the board of health be just receive too late to read they and to make recommendation thereon and be herewith submit the international exhibition hold in philadelphia this year in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of american independence have prove a great success and will no doubt be of endure advantage to the country it have show the great progress in the art science and mechanical skill make in a single century and demonstrate that we be but little behind old nation in any one branch while in some we scarcely have a rival it have serve too not only to bring people and product of skill and labor from all part of the world together but in bring together people from all section of our own country which must prove a great benefit in the information impart and pride of country engender it have be suggest by scientist interested in and connect with the smithsonian institution in a communication herewith that the government exhibit be remove to the capital and a suitable building be erect or purchase for its accommodation as a permanent exhibit i earnestly recommend this and believe that congress would second this view i direct that all government exhibit at the centennial exhibition should remain where they be except such as might be injure by remain in a building not intend as a protection in inclement weather or such as may be want by the department furnish they until the question of permanent exhibition be act on although the money appropriate by congress to enable the participation of the several executive departments in the international exhibition of 1876 be not sufficient to carry out the undertaking to the full extent at first contemplate it give i pleasure to refer to the very efficient and creditable manner in which the board appoint from these several department to provide an exhibition on the part of the government have discharge their duty with the fund place at their command without a precedent to guide they in the preparation of such a display the success of their labor be amply attest by the sustained attention which the content of the government building attract during the period of the exhibition from both foreign and native visitor i be strongly impressed with the value of the collection make by the government for the purpose of the exhibition illustrate as it do the mineral resource of the country the statistical and practical evidence of our growth as a nation and the use of the mechanical art and the application of apply science in the administration of the affair of government many nation have voluntarily contribute their exhibit to the united states to increase the interest in any permanent exhibition congress may provide for for this act of generosity they should receive the thank of the people and i respectfully suggest that a resolution of congress to that effect be adopt the attention of congress can not be too earnestly call to the necessity of throw some great safeguard over the method of choose and declare the election of a president under the present system there seem to be no provide remedy for contest the election in any one state the remedy be partially no doubt in the enlightenment of elector the compulsory support of the free school and the disfranchisement of all who can not read and write the english language after a fixed probation would meet my hearty approval i would not make this apply however to those already voter but i would to all become so after the expiration of the probation fix upon foreigner come to this country to become citizen who be educate in their own language should acquire the requisite knowledge of our during the necessary residence to obtain naturalization if they do not take interest enough in our language to acquire sufficient knowledge of it to enable they to study the institution and law of the country intelligently i would not confer upon they the right to make such law nor to select those who do i append to this message for convenient reference a synopsis of administrative event and of all recommendation to congress make by i during the last seven year time may show some of these recommendation not to have be wisely conceive but i believe the large part will do no discredit to the administration one of these recommendation meet with the united opposition of one political party in the senate and with a strong opposition from the other namely the treaty for the annexation of santo domingo to the united states to which i will specially refer maintain as i do that if my view have be concur in the country would be in a more prosperous condition to day both politically and financially santo domingo be fertile and upon its soil may be grow just those tropical product of which the united states use so much and which be produce or prepare for market now by slave labor almost exclusively namely sugar coffee dyewood mahogany tropical fruit tobacco etc about 75 per cent of the export of cuba be consume in the united states a large percentage of the export of brazil also find the same market these be pay for almost exclusively in coin legislation particularly in cuba be unfavorable to a mutual exchange of the product of each country flour ship from the mississippi river to havana can pass by the very entrance to the city on its way to a port in spain there pay a duty fix upon article to be reexporte transfer to a spanish vessel and bring back almost to the point of start pay a second duty and still leave a profit over what would be receive by direct shipment all that be produce in cuba could be produce in santo domingo be a part of the united states commerce between the island and mainland would be free there would be no export duty on her shipment nor import duty on those come here there would be no import duty upon the supply machinery etc go from the states the effect that would have be produce upon cuban commerce with these advantage to a rival be observable at a glance the cuban question would have be settle long ago in favor of free cuba hundred of american vessel would now be advantageously use in transport the valuable wood and other product of the soil of the island to a market and in carry supply and emigrant to it the island be but sparsely settle while it have an area sufficient for the profitable employment of several million of people the soil would have soon fall into the hand of united states capitalist the product be so valuable in commerce that emigration there would have be encourage the emancipate race of the south would have find there a congenial home where their civil right would not be dispute and where their labor would be so much seek after that the poor among they could have find the mean to go thus in case of great oppression and cruelty such as have be practice upon they in many place within the last eleven year whole community would have seek refuge in santo domingo i do not suppose the whole race would have go nor be it desirable that they should go their labor be desirable indispensable almost where they now be but the possession of this territory would have leave the negro master of the situation by enable he to demand his right at home on pain of find they elsewhere i do not present these view now as a recommendation for a renewal of the subject of annexation but i do refer to it to vindicate my previous action in regard to it with the present term of congress my official life terminate it be not probable that public affair will ever again receive attention from i far than as a citizen of the republic always take a deep interest in the honor integrity and prosperity of the whole land
to the senate of the united states
 i follow the example heretofore occasionally permit of communicate in this mode my approval of the act to provide for and regulate the counting of vote for president and vice president and the decision of question arise thereon for the term commence march 4 a. d. 1877 because of my appreciation of the imminent peril to the institution of the country from which in my judgment the act afford a wise and constitutional mean of escape
 for the first time in the history of our country under the constitution as it now be a dispute exist with regard to the result of the election of the chief magistrate of the nation
 it be understand that upon the disposition of dispute touch the electoral vote cast at the late election by one or more of the states depend the question whether one or the other of the candidate for the presidency be to be the lawful chief magistrate the importance of having clearly ascertain by a procedure regulate by law which of the two citizen have be elect and of have the right to this high office recognize and cheerfully agree in by all the people of the republic can not be overestimate and lead i to express to congress and to the nation my great satisfaction at the adoption of a measure that afford an orderly mean of decision of a gravely exciting question
 while the history of our country in its early period show that the president of the senate have count the vote and declare their standing our whole history show that in no instance of doubt or dispute have he exercise the power of decide and that the two houses of congress have dispose of all such doubt and dispute although in no instance hitherto have they be such that their decision could essentially have affect the result
 for the first time the government of the united states be now bring to meet the question as one vital to the result and this under condition not the well calculate to produce an agreement or to induce calm feeling in the several branch of the government or among the people of the country in a case where as now the result be involve it be the high duty of the lawmaking power to provide in advance a constitutional orderly and just method of execute the constitution in this most interesting and critical of its provision the do so far from be a compromise of right be an enforcement of right and an execution of power confer by the constitution on congress
 i think that this orderly method have be secure by the bill which appeal to the constitution and the law as the guide in ascertain right provide a mean of decide question of single return through the direct action of congress and in respect to double return by a tribunal of inquiry whose decision stand unless both houses of congress shall concur in determine otherwise thus secure a definite disposition of all question of dispute in whatever aspect they may arise with or without this law as all of the states have vote and as a tie vote be impossible it must be that one of the two candidate have be elect and it would be deplorable to witness an irregular controversy as to which of the two should receive or which should continue to hold the office in all period of history controversy have arise as to the succession or choice of the chief of state and no party or citizen love their country and its free institution can sacrifice too much of mere feeling in preserve through the upright course of law their country from the small danger to its peace on such an occasion and it can not be impress too firmly in the heart of all the people that true liberty and real progress can exist only through a cheerful adherence to constitutional law
 the bill purport to provide only for the settlement of question arise from the recent election the fact that such question can arise demonstrate the necessity which i can not doubt will before long be supply of permanent general legislation to meet case which have not be contemplate in the constitution or law of the country
 the bill may not be perfect and its provision may not be such as would be well applicable to all future occasion but it be calculate to meet the present condition of the question and of the country
 the country be agitate it need and it desire peace and quiet and harmony between all party and all section its industry be arrest labor unemployed capital idle and enterprise paralyze by reason of the doubt and anxiety attend the uncertainty of a double claim to the chief magistracy of the nation it want to be assure that the result of the election will be accept without resistance from the supporter of the disappointed candidate and that its high officer shall not hold his place with a question title of right believe that the bill will secure these end i give it my signature

fellow citizens

 we have assemble to repeat the public ceremonial begin by washington observe by all my predecessor and now a time honor custom which mark the commencement of a new term of the presidential office call to the duty of this great trust i proceed in compliance with usage to announce some of the lead principle on the subject that now chiefly engage the public attention by which it be my desire to be guide in the discharge of those duty i shall not undertake to lay down irrevocably principle or measure of administration but rather to speak of the motive which should animate we and to suggest certain important end to be attain in accordance with our institution and essential to the welfare of our country

 at the outset of the discussion which precede the recent presidential election it seem to i fitting that i should fully make known my sentiment in regard to several of the important question which then appear to demand the consideration of the country follow the example and in part adopt the language of one of my predecessor i wish now when every motive for misrepresentation have pass away to repeat what be say before the election trust that my countryman will candidly weigh and understand it and that they will feel assured that the sentiment declare in accept the nomination for the presidency will be the standard of my conduct in the path before i charge as i now be with the grave and difficult task of carry they out in the practical administration of the government so far as depend under the constitution and law on the chief executive of the nation

 the permanent pacification of the country upon such principle and by such measure as will secure the complete protection of all its citizen in the free enjoyment of all their constitutional right be now the one subject in our public affair which all thoughtful and patriotic citizen regard as of supreme importance

 many of the calamitous effort of the tremendous revolution which have pass over the southern states still remain the immeasurable benefit which will surely follow soon or later the hearty and generous acceptance of the legitimate result of that revolution have not yet be realize difficult and embarrassing question meet we at the threshold of this subject the people of those states be still impoverished and the inestimable blessing of wise honest and peaceful local self government be not fully enjoy whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the cause of this condition of thing the fact be clear that in the progress of event the time have come when such government be the imperative necessity require by all the varied interest public and private of those states but it must not be forget that only a local government which recognize and maintain inviolate the right of all be a true self government

 with respect to the two distinct race whose peculiar relation to each other have bring upon we the deplorable complication and perplexity which exist in those states it must be a government which guard the interest of both race carefully and equally it must be a government which submit loyally and heartily to the constitution and the law the law of the nation and the law of the states themselves accept and obey faithfully the whole constitution as it be

 rest upon this sure and substantial foundation the superstructure of beneficent local government can be build up and not otherwise in furtherance of such obedience to the letter and the spirit of the constitution and in behalf of all that its attainment imply all so call party interest lose their apparent importance and party line may well be permit to fade into insignificance the question we have to consider for the immediate welfare of those states of the union be the question of government or no government of social order and all the peaceful industry and the happiness that belong to it or a return to barbarism it be a question in which every citizen of the nation be deeply interested and with respect to which we ought not to be in a partisan sense either republicans or democrats but fellow citizen and fellowman to whom the interest of a common country and a common humanity be dear

 the sweeping revolution of the entire labor system of a large portion of our country and the advance of 4,000,000 people from a condition of servitude to that of citizenship upon an equal footing with their former master could not occur without present problem of the grave moment to be deal with by the emancipate race by their former master and by the general government the author of the act of emancipation that it be a wise just and providential act fraught with good for all concern be not generally concede throughout the country that a moral obligation rest upon the national government to employ its constitutional power and influence to establish the right of the people it have emancipate and to protect they in the enjoyment of those right when they be infringe or assail be also generally admit

 the evil which afflict the southern states can only be remove or remedie by the united and harmonious effort of both race actuate by motive of mutual sympathy and regard and while in duty bind and fully determined to protect the right of all by every constitutional mean at the disposal of my administration i be sincerely anxious to use every legitimate influence in favor of honest and efficient local self government as the true resource of those states for the promotion of the contentment and prosperity of their citizen in the effort i shall make to accomplish this purpose i ask the cordial cooperation of all who cherish an interest in the welfare of the country trust that party tie and the prejudice of race will be freely surrender in behalf of the great purpose to be accomplish in the important work of restore the south it be not the political situation alone that merit attention the material development of that section of the country have be arrest by the social and political revolution through which it have pass and now need and deserve the considerate care of the national government within the just limit prescribe by the constitution and wise public economy

 but at the basis of all prosperity for that as well as for every other part of the country lie the improvement of the intellectual and moral condition of the people universal suffrage should rest upon universal education to this end liberal and permanent provision should be make for the support of free school by the state government and if need be supplement by legitimate aid from national authority

 let i assure my countryman of the southern states that it be my earnest desire to regard and promote their true interest the interest of the white and of the colored people both and equally and to put forth my good effort in behalf of a civil policy which will forever wipe out in our political affair the color line and the distinction between north andsouth to the end that we may have not merely a united north or a unitedsouth but a united country

 i ask the attention of the public to the paramount necessity of reform in our civil service a reform not merely as to certain abuse and practice of so call official patronage which have come to have the sanction of usage in the several departments of our government but a change in the system of appointment itself a reform that shall be thorough radical and complete a return to the principle and practice of the founder of the government they neither expect nor desire from public officer any partisan service they mean that public officer should owe their whole service to the government and to the people they mean that the officer should be secure in his tenure as long as his personal character remain untarnished and the performance of his duty satisfactory they hold that appointment to office be not to be make nor expect merely as reward for partisan service nor merely on the nomination of member of congress as be entitle in any respect to the control of such appointment

 the fact that both the great political party of the country in declare their principle prior to the election give a prominent place to the subject of reform of our civil service recognize and strongly urge its necessity in term almost identical in their specific import with those i have here employ must be accept as a conclusive argument in behalf of these measure it must be regard as the expression of the united voice and will of the whole country upon this subject and both political party be virtually pledge to give it their unreserved support

 the president of the united states of necessity owe his election to office to the suffrage and zealous labor of a political party the member of which cherish with ardor and regard as of essential importance the principle of their party organization but he should strive to be always mindful of the fact that he serve his party well who serve the country well

 in furtherance of the reform we seek and in other important respect a change of great importance i recommend an amendment to the constitution prescribe a term of six year for the presidential office and forbid a reelection

 with respect to the financial condition of the country i shall not attempt an extended history of the embarrassment and prostration which we have suffer during the past three year the depression in all our varied commercial and manufacturing interest throughout the country which begin in september 1873 still continue it be very gratifying however to be able to say that there be indication all around we of a come change to prosperous time

 upon the currency question intimately connect as it be with this topic i may be permit to repeat here the statement make in my letter of acceptance that in my judgment the feeling of uncertainty inseparable from an irredeemable paper currency with its fluctuation of value be one of the great obstacle to a return to prosperous time the only safe paper currency be one which rest upon a coin basis and be at all time and promptly convertible into coin

 i adhere to the view heretofore express by i in favor of congressional legislation in behalf of an early resumption of specie payment and i be satisfied not only that this be wise but that the interest as well as the public sentiment of the country imperatively demand it

 pass from these remark upon the condition of our own country to consider our relation with other land we be remind by the international complication abroad threaten the peace of europe that our traditional rule of noninterference in the affair of foreign nation have prove of great value in past time and ought to be strictly observe

 the policy inaugurate by my honored predecessor president grant of submit to arbitration grave question in dispute between ourselves and foreign power point to a new and incomparably the good instrumentality for the preservation of peace and will as i believe become a beneficent example of the course to be pursue in similar emergency by other nation

 if unhappily question of difference should at any time during the period of my administration arise between the united states and any foreign government it will certainly be my disposition and my hope to aid in their settlement in the same peaceful and honorable way thus secure to our country the great blessing of peace and mutual good office with all the nation of the world

 fellow citizen we have reach the close of a political contest mark by the excitement which usually attend the contest between great political party whose member espouse and advocate with earnest faith their respective creed the circumstance be perhaps in no respect extraordinary save in the closeness and the consequent uncertainty of the result

 for the first time in the history of the country it have be deem well in view of the peculiar circumstance of the case that the objection and question in dispute with reference to the counting of the electoral vote should be refer to the decision of a tribunal appoint for this purpose

 that tribunal establish by law for this sole purpose its member all of they man of long establish reputation for integrity and intelligence and with the exception of those who be also member of the supreme judiciary choose equally from both political party its deliberation enlighten by the research and the argument of able counsel be entitle to the full confidence of the american people its decision have be patiently wait for and accept as legally conclusive by the general judgment of the public for the present opinion will widely vary as to the wisdom of the several conclusion announce by that tribunal this be to be anticipate in every instance where matter of dispute be make the subject of arbitration under the form of law human judgment be never unerre and be rarely regard as otherwise than wrong by the unsuccessful party in the contest

 the fact that two great political party have in this way settle a dispute in regard to which good man differ as to the fact and the law no less than as to the proper course to be pursue in solve the question in controversy be an occasion for general rejoicing

 upon one point there be entire unanimity in public sentiment that conflict claim to the presidency must be amicably and peaceably adjust and that when so adjust the general acquiescence of the nation ought surely to follow

 it have be reserve for a government of the people where the right of suffrage be universal to give to the world the first example in history of a great nation in the midst of the struggle of oppose party fo rpower hush its party tumult to yield the issue of the contest to adjustment accord to the form of law

 look for the guidance of that divine hand by which the destiny of nation and individual be shape i call upon you senators representatives judge fellow citizen here and everywhere to unite with i in an earnest effort to secure to our country the blessing not only of material prosperity but of justice peace and union a union depend not upon the constraint of force but upon the love devotion of a free people and that all thing may be so ordered and settle upon the good and sure foundation that peace and happiness truth and justice religion and piety may be establish among we for all generation

sir i desire to call your attention to the follow paragraph in a letter address by i to the secretary of the treasury on the conduct to be observe by officer of the general government in relation to the election
 no officer should be require or permit to take part in the management of political organization caucus convention or election campaign their right to vote and to express their view on public question either orally or through the press be not deny provide it do not interfere with the discharge of their official duty no assessment for political purpose on officer or subordinate should be allow

 by the president
 f. w. seward acting secretary of state


with devout gratitude to the bountiful giver of all good i congratulate you that at the beginning of your first regular session you find our country bless with health and peace and abundant harvest and with encouraging prospect of an early return of general prosperity

 to complete and make permanent the pacification of the country continue to be and until it be fully accomplished must remain the most important of all our national interest the earnest purpose of good citizen generally to unite their effort in this endeavor be evident it find decide expression in the resolution announce in 1876 by the national convention of the lead political party of the country there be a widespread apprehension that the momentous result in our progress as a nation mark by the recent amendment to the constitution be in imminent jeopardy that the good understanding which prompt their adoption in the interest of a loyal devotion to the general welfare might prove a barren truce and that the two section of the country once engage in civil strife might be again almost as widely sever and disunite as they be when array in arm against each other

 the course to be pursue which in my judgment seem wisest in the presence of this emergency be plainly indicate in my inaugural address it point to the time which all our people desire to see when a genuine love of our whole country and of all that concern its true welfare shall supplant the destructive force of the mutual animosity of race and of sectional hostility opinion have differ widely as to the measure well calculate to secure this great end this be to be expect the measure adopt by the administration have be subject to severe and varied criticism any course whatever which might have be enter upon would certainly have encounter distrust and opposition these measure be in my judgment such as be most in harmony with the constitution and with the genius of our people and well adapt under all the circumstance to attain the end in view beneficent result already apparent prove that these endeavor be not to be regard as a mere experiment and should sustain and encourage we in our effort already in the brief period which have elapse the immediate effectiveness no less than the justice of the course pursue be demonstrate and i have an abide faith that time will furnish its ample vindication in the mind of the great majority of my fellow citizen the discontinuance of the use of the army for the purpose of uphold local government in two states of the union be no less a constitutional duty and requirement under the circumstance exist at the time than it be a much need measure for the restoration of local self government and the promotion of national harmony the withdrawal of the troop from such employment be effect deliberately and with solicitous care for the peace and good order of society and the protection of the property and person and every right of all class of citizen

 the result that have follow be indeed significant and encouraging all apprehension of danger from remit those state to local self government be dispel and a most salutary change in the mind of the people have begin and be in progress in every part of that section of the country once the theater of unhappy civil strife substitute for suspicion distrust and aversion concord friendship and patriotic attachment to the union no unprejudiced mind will deny that the terrible and often fatal collision which for several year have be of frequent occurrence and have agitate and alarm the public mind have almost entirely cease and that a spirit of mutual forbearance and hearty national interest have succeed there have be a general reestablishment of order and of the orderly administration of justice instance of remain lawlessness have become of rare occurrence political turmoil and turbulence have disappear useful industry have be resume public credit in the southern states have be greatly strengthen and the encourage benefit of a revival of commerce between the section of the country lately embroil in civil war be fully enjoy such be some of the result already attain upon which the country be to be congratulate they be of such importance that we may with confidence patiently await the desire consummation that will surely come with the natural progress of event

 it may not be improper here to say that it should be our fixed and unalterable determination to protect by all available and proper mean under the constitution and the law the lately emancipate race in the enjoyment of their right and privilege and i urge upon those to whom heretofore the colored people have sustain the relation of bondman the wisdom and justice of humane and liberal local legislation with respect to their education and general welfare a firm adherence to the law both national and state as to the civil and political right of the colored people now advance to full and equal citizenship the immediate repression and sure punishment by the national and local authority within their respective jurisdiction of every instance of lawlessness and violence toward they be require for the security alike of both race and be justly demand by the public opinion of the country and the age in this way the restoration of harmony and good will and the complete protection of every citizen in the full enjoyment of every constitutional right will surely be attain whatever authority rest with i to this end i shall not hesitate to put forth

 whatever belong to the power of congress and the jurisdiction of the court of the union they may confidently be rely upon to provide and perform and to the legislature the court and the executive authority of the several states i earnestly appeal to secure by adequate appropriate and seasonable mean within their border these common and uniform right of a united people which love liberty abhor oppression and revere justice these object be very dear to my heart i shall continue most earnestly to strive for their attainment the cordial cooperation of all class of all section of the country and of both race be require for this purpose and with these blessing assure and not otherwise we may safely hope to hand down our free institution of government unimpaire to the generation that will succeed we

 among the other subject of great and general importance to the people of this country i can not be mistake i think in regard as preeminent the policy and measure which be design to secure the restoration of the currency to that normal and healthful condition in which by the resumption of specie payment our internal trade and foreign commerce may be bring into harmony with the system of exchange which be base upon the precious metal as the intrinsic money of the world in the public judgment that this end should be seek and compass as speedily and securely as the resource of the people and the wisdom of their government can accomplish there be a much great degree of unanimity than be find to concur in the specific measure which will bring the country to this desire end or the rapidity of the step by which it can be safely reach

 upon a most anxious and deliberate examination which i have feel it my duty to give to the subject i be but the more confirm in the opinion which i express in accept the nomination for the presidency and again upon my inauguration that the policy of resumption should be pursue by every suitable mean and that no legislation would be wise that should disparage the importance or retard the attainment of that result i have no disposition and certainly no right to question the sincerity or the intelligence of oppose opinion and would neither conceal nor undervalue the considerable difficulty and even occasional distress which may attend the progress of the nation toward this primary condition to its general and permanent prosperity i must however adhere to my most earnest conviction that any wavering in purpose or unsteadiness in method so far from avoid or reduce the inconvenience inseparable from the transition from an irredeemable to a redeemable paper currency would only tend to increase and prolong disturbance in value and unless retrieve must end in serious disorder dishonor and disaster in the financial affair of the government and of the people

 the mischief which i apprehend and urgently deprecate be confine to no class of the people indeed but seem to i most certainly to threaten the industrious masse whether their occupation be of skilled or common labor to they it seem to i it be of prime importance that their labor should be compensate in money which be itself fix in exchangeable value by be irrevocably measure by the labor necessary to its production this permanent quality of the money of the people be seek for and can only be gain by the resumption of specie payment the rich the speculative the operating the money deal class may not always feel the mischief of or may find casual profit in a variable currency but the misfortune of such a currency to those who be pay salary or wage be inevitable and remediless

 closely connect with this general subject of the resumption of specie payment be one of subordinate but still of grave importance i mean the readjustment of our coinage system by the renewal of the silver dollar as an element in our specie currency endow by legislation with the quality of legal tender to a great or less extent

 as there be no doubt of the power of congress under the constitution to coin money and regulate the value thereof and as this power cover the whole range of authority applicable to the metal the rate value and the legal tender quality which shall be adopt for the coinage the consideration which should induce or discourage a particular measure connect with the coinage belong clearly to the province of legislative discretion and of public expediency without intrude upon this province of legislation in the least i have yet think the subject of such critical importance in the actual condition of our affair as to present an occasion for the exercise of the duty impose by the constitution on the president of recommend to the consideration of congress such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient

 hold the opinion as i do that neither the interest of the government nor of the people of the united states would be promote by disparage silver as one of the two precious metal which furnish the coinage of the world and that legislation which look to maintain the volume of intrinsic money to as full a measure of both metal as their relative commercial value will permit would be neither unjust nor inexpedient i must ask your indulgence to a brief and definite statement of certain essential feature in any such legislative measure which i feel it my duty to recommend

 i do not propose to enter the debate represent on both side by such able disputant in congress and before the people and in the press as to the extent to which the legislation of any one nation can control this question even within its own border against the unwritten law of trade or the positive law of other government the wisdom of congress in shape any particular law that may be present for my approval may wholly supersede the necessity of my enter into these consideration and i willingly avoid either vague or intricate inquiry it be only certain plain and practical trait of such legislation that i desire to recommend to your attention

 in any legislation provide for a silver coinage regulate its value and impart to it the quality of legal tender it seem to i of great importance that congress should not lose sight of its action as operate in a twofold capacity and in two distinct direction if the united states government be free from a public debt its legislative deal with the question of silver coinage would be purely sovereign and governmental under no restraint but those of constitutional power and the public good as affect by the propose legislation but in the actual circumstance of the nation with a vast public debt distribute very widely among our own citizen and hold in great amount also abroad the nature of the silver coinage measure as affect this relation of the government to the holder of the public debt become an element in any propose legislation of the high concern the obligation of the public faith transcend all question of profit or public advantage otherwise its unquestionable maintenance be the dictate as well of the high expediency as of the most necessary duty and will ever be carefully guard by congress and people alike

 the public debt of the united states to the amount of $ 729,000,000 bear interest at the rate of 6 per cent and $ 708,000,000 at the rate of 5 percent and the only way in which the country can be relieve from the payment of these high rate of interest be by advantageously refund the indebtedness whether the debt be ultimately pay in gold or in silver coin be of but little moment compare with the possible reduction of interest one third by refund it at such reduce rate if the united states have the unquestione right to pay its bond in silver coin the little benefit from that process would be greatly overbalance by the injurious effect of such payment if make or propose against the honest conviction of the public creditor

 all the bond that have be issue since february 12 1873 when gold become the only unlimited legal tender metallic currency of the country be justly payable in gold coin or in coin of equal value during the time of these issue the only dollar that could be or be receive by the government in exchange for bond be the gold dollar to require the public creditor to take in repayment any dollar of less commercial value would be regard by they as a repudiation of the full obligation assume the bond issue prior to 1873 be issue at a time when the gold dollar be the only coin in circulation or contemplate by either the government or the holder of the bond as the coin in which they be to be pay it be far well to pay these bond in that coin than to seem to take advantage of the unforeseen fall in silver bullion to pay in a new issue of silver coin thus make so much less valuable the power of the united states to coin money and to regulate the value thereof ought never to be exercise for the purpose of enable the government to pay its obligation in a coin of less value than that contemplate by the party when the bond be issue any attempt to pay the national indebtedness in a coinage of less commercial value than the money of the world would involve a violation of the public faith and work irreparable injury to the public credit

 it be the great merit of the act of march 1869 in strengthen the public credit that it remove all doubt as to the purpose of the united states to pay their bond debt in coin that act be accept as a pledge of public faith the government have derive great benefit from it in the progress thus far make in refund the public debt at low rate of interest an adherence to the wise and just policy of an exact observance of the public faith will enable the government rapidly to reduce the burden of interest on the national debt to an amount exceed $ 20,000,000 per annum and effect an aggregate saving to the united states of more than $ 300,000,000 before the bond can be fully pay

 in adapt the new silver coinage to the ordinary use of currency in the everyday transaction of life and prescribe the quality of legal tender to be assign to it a consideration of the first importance should be so to adjust the ratio between the silver and the gold coinage which now constitute our specie currency as to accomplish the desire end of maintain the circulation of the two metallic currency and keep up the volume of the two precious metal as our intrinsic money it be a mixed question for scientific reasoning and historical experience to determine how far and by what method a practical equilibrium can be maintain which will keep both metal in circulation in their appropriate sphere of common use

 an absolute equality of commercial value free from disturb fluctuation be hardly attainable and without it an unlimited legal tender for private transaction assign to both metal would irresistibly tend to drive out of circulation the clear coinage and disappoint the principal object propose by the legislation in view i apprehend therefore that the two condition of a near approach to equality of commercial value between the gold and silver coinage of the same denomination and of a limitation of the amount for which the silver coinage be to be a legal tender be essential to maintain both in circulation if these condition can be successfully observe the issue from the mint of silver dollar would afford material assistance to the community in the transition to redeemable paper money and would facilitate the resumption of specie payment and its permanent establishment without these condition i fear that only mischief and misfortune would flow from a coinage of silver dollar with the quality of unlimited legal tender even in private transaction

 any expectation of temporary ease from an issue of silver coinage to pass as a legal tender at a rate materially above its commercial value be i be persuade a delusion nor can i think that there be any substantial distinction between an original issue of silver dollar at a nominal value materially above their commercial value and the restoration of the silver dollar at a rate which once be but have cease to be its commercial value certainly the issue of our gold coinage reduce in weight materially below its legal tender value would not be any the less a present debasement of the coinage by reason of its equaling or even exceed in weight a gold coinage which at some past time have be commercially equal to the legal tender value assign to the new issue

 in recommend that the regulation of any silver coinage which may be authorize by congress should observe these condition of commercial value and limited legal tender i be govern by the feeling that every possible increase should be give to the volume of metallic money which can be keep in circulation and thereby every possible aid afford to the people in the process of resume specie payment it be because of my firm conviction that a disregard of these condition would frustrate the good result which be desire from the propose coinage and embarrass with new element of confusion and uncertainty the business of the country that i urge upon your attention these consideration

 i respectfully recommend to congress that in any legislation provide for a silver coinage and imparting to it the quality of legal tender there be impress upon the measure a firm provision exempt the public debt heretofore issue and now outstanding from payment either of principal or interest in any coinage of less commercial value than the present gold coinage of the country

 the organization of the civil service of the country have for a number of year attract more and more of the public attention so general have become the opinion that the method of admission to it and the condition of remain in it be unsound that both the great political party have agree in the most explicit declaration of the necessity of reform and in the most emphatic demand for it i have fully believe these declaration and demand to be the expression of a sincere conviction of the intelligent masse of the people upon the subject and that they should be recognize and follow by earnest and prompt action on the part of the legislative and executive department of the government in pursuance of the purpose indicate

 before my accession to office i endeavor to have my own view distinctly understand and upon my inauguration my accord with the public opinion be state in term believe to be plain and unambiguous my experience in the executive duty have strongly confirm the belief in the great advantage the country would find in observe strictly the plan of the constitution which impose upon the executive the sole duty and responsibility of the selection of those federal officer who by law be appoint not elect and which in like manner assign to the senate the complete right to advise and consent to or to reject the nomination so make whilst the house of representatives stand as the public censor of the performance of official duty with the prerogative of investigation and prosecution in all case of dereliction the blemish and imperfection in the civil service may as i think be trace in most case to a practical confusion of the duty assign to the several departments of the government my purpose in this respect have be to return to the system establish by the fundamental law and to do this with the heartiest cooperation and most cordial understanding with the senate and house of representatives

 the practical difficulty in the selection of numerous officer for post of widely vary responsibility and duty be acknowledge to be very great no system can be expect to secure absolute freedom from mistake and the beginning of any attempt change of custom be quite likely to be more embarrassed in this respect than any subsequent period it be here that the constitution seem to i to prove its claim to the great wisdom accord to it it give to the executive the assistance of the knowledge and experience of the senate which when act upon nomination as to which they may be disintereste and impartial judge secure as strong a guaranty of freedom from error of importance as be perhaps possible in human affair

 in addition to this i recognize the public advantage of make all nomination as nearly as possible impersonal in the sense of be free from mere caprice or favor in the selection and in those office in which special training be of greatly increase value i believe such a rule as to the tenure of office should obtain as may induce man of proper qualification to apply themselves industriously to the task of become proficient bear these thing in mind i have endeavor to reduce the number of change in subordinate place usually make upon the change of the general administration and shall most heartily cooperate with congress in the well systematizing of such method and rule of admission to the public service and of promotion within it as may promise to be most successful in make thorough competency efficiency and character the decisive test in these matter

 i ask the renew attention of congress to what have already be do by the civil service commission appoint in pursuance of an act of congress by my predecessor to prepare and revise civil service rule in regard to much of the departmental service especially at washington it may be difficult to organize a well system than that which have thus be provide and it be now be use to a considerable extent under my direction the commission have still a legal existence although for several year no appropriation have be make for defray its expense believe that this commission have render valuable service and will be a most useful agency in improve the administration of the civil service i respectfully recommend that a suitable appropriation to be immediately available be make to enable it to continue its labor

 it be my purpose to transmit to congress as early as practicable a report by the chairman of the commission and to ask your attention to such measure on this subject as in my opinion will far promote the improvement of the civil service

 my present official duty as to this bill permit only an attention to the specific objection to its passage which seem to i so important as to justify i in ask from the wisdom and duty of congress that further consideration of the bill for which the constitution have in such case provide
 the bill provide for the coinage of silver dollar of the weight of 412 1/2 grain each of standard silver to be a legal tender at their nominal value for all debt and due public and private except where otherwise expressly stipulate in the contract it be well know that the market value of that number of grain of standard silver during the post year have be from 90 to 92 cent as compare with the standard gold dollar thus the silver dollar authorize by this bill be worth 8 to 10 per cent less than it purport to be worth and be make a legal tender for debt contract when the law do not recognize such coin as lawful money
 the right to pay duty in silver or in certificate for silver deposit will when they be issue in sufficient amount to circulate put an end to the receipt of revenue in gold and thus compel the payment of silver for both the principal and interest of the public debt one billion one hundred and forty three million four hundred and ninety three thousand four hundred dollar of the bond debt now outstanding be issue prior to february 1873 when the silver dollar be unknown in circulation in this country and be only a convenient form of silver bullion for exportation $ 583,440,350 of the funded debt have be issue since february 1873 when gold alone be the coin for which the bond be sell and gold alone be the coin in which both party to the contract understand that the bond would be pay these bond enter into the market of the world they be pay for in gold when silver have greatly depreciate and when no one would have buy they if it have be understand that they would be pay in silver the sum of $ 225,000,000 of these bond have be sell during my administration for gold coin and the united states receive the benefit of these sale by a reduction of the rate of interest to 4 per cent during the progress of these sale a doubt be suggest as to the coin in which payment of these bond would be make the public announcement be thereupon authorize that it be not to be anticipate that any future legislation of congress or any action of any department of the government would sanction or tolerate the redemption of the principal of these bond or the payment of the interest thereon in coin of less value than the coin authorize by law at the time of the issue of the bond be the coin exact by the government in exchange for the same in view of these fact it will be justly regard as a grave breach of the public faith to undertake to pay these bond principal or interest in silver coin worth in the market less than the coin receive for they
 it be say that the silver dollar make a legal tender by this bill will under its operation be equivalent in value to the gold dollar many supporter of the bill believe this and would not justify an attempt to pay debt either public or private in coin of inferior value to the money of the world the capital defect of the bill be that it contain no provision protect from its operation preexist debt in case the coinage which it create shall continue to be of less value than that which be the sole legal tender when they be contract if it be now propose for the purpose of take advantage of the depreciation of silver in the payment of debt to coin and make a legal lender a silver dollar of less commercial value than any dollar whether of gold or paper which be now lawful money in this country such measure it will hardly be question will in the judgment of mankind be an act of bad faith as to all debt heretofore contract the silver dollar should be make a legal tender only at its market value the standard of value should not be change without the consent of both party to the contract national promise should be keep with unflinche fidelity there be no power to compel a nation to pay its just debt its credit depend on its honor the nation owe what it have lead or allow its creditor to expect i can not approve a bill which in my judgment authorize the violation of sacred obligation the obligation of the public faith transcend all question of profit or public advantage its unquestionable maintenance be the dictate as well of the high expediency as of the most necessary duty and should ever be carefully guard by the executive by congress and by the people
 it be my firm conviction that if the country be to be benefit by a silver coinage it can be do only by the issue of silver dollar of full value which will defraud no man a currency worth less than it purport to be worth will in the end defraud not only creditor but all who be engage in legitimate business and none more surely than those who be dependent on their daily labor for their daily bread

states the three constitutional amendment which confer freedom and equality of civil and political right upon the colored people of the south be adopt by the concurrent action of the great body of good citizen who maintain the authority of the national government and the integrity and perpetuity of the union at such a cost of treasure and life as a wise and necessary embodiment in the organic law of the just result of the war the people of the former slaveholding states accept these result and give in every practicable form assurance that the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendment and law pass in pursuance thereof should in good faith be enforce rigidly and impartially in letter and spirit to the end that the humblest citizen without distinction of race or color should under they receive full and equal protection in person and property and in political right and privilege by these constitutional amendment the southern section of the union obtain a large increase of political power in congress and in the electoral college and the country justly expect that election would proceed as to the enfranchised race upon the same circumstance of legal and constitutional freedom and protection which obtain in all the other states of the union the friend of law and order look forward to the conduct of these election as offer to the general judgment of the country an important opportunity to measure the degree in which the right of suffrage could be exercise by the colored people and would be respect by their fellow citizen but a more general enjoyment of freedom of suffrage by the colored people and a more just and generous protection of that freedom by the community of which they form a part be generally anticipate than the record of the election disclose in some of those states in which the colored people have be unable to make their opinion feel in the election the result be mainly due to influence not easily measure or remedie by legal protection but in the states of louisiana and south carolina at large and in some particular congressional district outside of those states the record of the election seem to compel the conclusion that the right of the colored voter have be overridden and their participation in the election not permit to be either general or free it will be for the congress for which these election be hold to make such examination into their conduct as may be appropriate to determine the validity of the claim of member to their seat in the meanwhile it become the duty of the executive and judicial department of the government each in its province to inquire into and punish violation of the law of the united states which have occur i can but repeat what i say in this connection in my last message that whatever

purpose do not relieve the government of responsibility but necessarily increase the deficiency bill which congress will be call upon to pass in provide for the postal service the following question be present should congress annually appropriate a sum for its expense largely in excess of its revenue or should such rate of postage be establish as will make the department self sustaining should the postal service be reduce by exclude from the mail matter which do not pay its way should the number of post route be diminish should other method be adopt which will increase the revenue or

general and the full text in the appendix thereto in its origin the postal union comprise twenty three country have a population of 350,000,000 people on the 1st of april next it will comprise forty three country and colony with a population of more than 650,000,000 people and will soon by the accession of the few remain country and colony which maintain organized postal service constitute in fact as well as in name as its new title indicate a universal union regulate upon a uniform basis of cheap postage rate the postal intercourse between all civilized nation some embarrassment have arise out of the conflict between the custom law of this country and the provision of the postal convention in regard to the transmission of foreign book and newspaper to this country by mail it be hope that congress will be able to devise some mean of reconcile the difficulty which have thus be create so as to do justice to all party involve the business of the supreme court and of the court in many of the circuit have increase to such an extent during the past year that additional legislation be imperative to relieve and prevent the delay of justice and possible oppression to suitor which be thus occasion the encumbered condition of these docket be present anew in the report of the attorney general and the remedy suggest be earnestly urge for congressional action the creation of additional circuit judge as propose would afford a complete remedy and would involve an expense at the present rate of salary of not more than $ 60,000 a year the annual report of the secretary of the interior and of the commissioner of indian affairs present an elaborate account of the present condition of the indian tribe and of that branch of the public service which minister to their interest while the conduct of the indians generally have be orderly and their relation with their neighbor friendly and peaceable two local disturbance have occur which be deplorable in their character but remain happily confine to a comparatively small number of indians the discontent among the bannocks which lead first to some act of violence on the part of some member of the tribe and finally to the outbreak appear to have be cause by an insufficiency of food on the reservation and this insufficiency to have be owe to the inadequacy of the appropriation make by congress to the want of the indians at a time when the indians be prevent from supply the deficiency by hunting after an arduous pursuit by the troop of the united states and several engagement the hostile indians be reduce to subjection and the large part of they surrender themselves as prisoner in this connection i desire to call attention to the recommendation make by the secretary of the interior that a sufficient fund be place at the disposal of the executive to be use with proper accountability at discretion in sudden emergency of the indian service the other case of disturbance be that of a band of northern cheyennes who suddenly leave their reservation in the indian territory and march rapidly through the states of kansas and nebraska in the direction of their old hunting ground commit murder and other crime on their way from document accompany the report of the secretary of the interior it appear that this disorderly band be as fully supply with the necessary of life as the 4,700 other indians who remain quietly on the reservation and that the disturbance be cause by man of a restless and mischievous disposition among the indians themselves almost the whole of this band have surrender to the military authority and it be a gratifying fact that when some of they have take refuge in the camp of the red cloud sioux with whom they have be in friendly relation the sioux hold they as prisoner and readily give they up to the officer of the united states thus give new proof of the loyal spirit which alarm rumor to the contrary notwithstanding they have uniformly show ever since the wish they express at the council of september 1877 have be comply with both the secretary of the interior and the secretary of war unite in the recommendation that provision be make by congress for the organization of a corps of mount indian auxiliary to be under the control of the army and to be use for the purpose of keep the indians on their reservation and prevent or repress disturbance on their part i earnestly concur in this recommendation it be believe that the organization of such a body of indian cavalry receive a moderate pay from the government would considerably weaken the restless element among the indians by withdraw from it a number of young man and give they congenial employment under the government it be a matter of experience that indians in our service almost without exception be faithful in the performance of the duty assign to they such an organization would materially aid the army in the accomplishment of a task for which its numerical strength be sometimes find insufficient but while the employment of force for the prevention or repression of indian trouble be of occasional necessity and wise preparation should be make to that end great reliance must be place on humane and civilize agency for the ultimate solution of what be call the indian problem it may be very difficult and require much patient effort to curb the unruly spirit of the savage indian to the restraint of civilized life but experience show that it be not impossible many of the tribe which be now quiet and orderly and self support be once as savage as any that at present roam over the plain or in the mountain of the far west and be then consider inaccessible to civilize influence it may be impossible to raise they fully up to the level of the white population of the united states but we should not forget that they be the aborigine of the country and call the soil their own on which our people have grow rich powerful and happy we owe it to they as a moral duty to help they in attain at least that degree of civilization which they may be able to reach it be not only our duty it be also our interest to do so indians who have become agriculturist or herdsman and feel an interest in property will thenceforth cease to be a warlike and disturbing element it be also a well authenticate fact that indians be apt to be peaceable and quiet when their child be at school and i be gratified to know from the expression of indians themselves and from many concurring report that there be a steadily increase desire even among indians belong to comparatively wild tribe to have their child educate i invite attention to the report of the secretary of the interior and the commissioner of indian affairs touch the experiment recently inaugurate in take fifty indian child boy and girl from different tribe to the hampton normal agricultural institute in virginia where they be to receive an elementary english education and training in agriculture and other useful work to be return to their tribe after the complete course as interpreter instructor and example it be report that the officer charge with the selection of those child might have have thousand of young indians send with he have it be possible to make provision for they i agree with the secretary of the interior in say that the result of this interesting experiment if favorable may be destine to become an important factor in the advancement of civilization among the indians "the question whether a change in the control of the indian service should be make be at the last session of congress refer to a committee for inquiry and report without desire to anticipate that report i venture to express the hope that in the decision of so important a question the view express above may not be lose sight of and that the decision whatever it may be will arrest further agitation of this subject such agitation be apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as on the indians themselves in the enrollment of the bill make appropriation for sundry civil expense at the last session of congress that portion which provide for the continuation of the hot springs commission be omit as the commission have complete the work of take testimony on the many conflicting claim the suspension of their labor before determine the right of claimant threaten for a time to embarrass the interest not only of the government but also of a large number of the citizen of hot springs who be wait for final action on their claim before begin contemplated improvement in order to prevent

possible and that a fair compensation be allow the late commissioner for the expense incur and the labor perform by they since the 25th of june last i invite the attention of congress to the recommendation make by the secretary of the interior with regard to the preservation of the timber on the public land of the united states the protection of the public property be one of the first duty of the government the department of the interior should therefore be enable by sufficient appropriation to enforce the law in that respect but this matter appear still more important as a question of public economy the rapid destruction of our forest be an evil fraught with the grave consequence especially in the mountainous district where the rocky slope once denude of their tree will remain so forever there the injury once do can not be repair i fully concur with the secretary of the interior in the opinion that for this reason legislation touch the public timber in the mountainous states and territories of the west should be especially well consider and that exist law in which the destruction of the forest be not sufficiently guard against should be speedily modify a general law concern this important subject appear to i to be a matter of urgent public necessity from the organization of the government the importance of encourage by all possible mean the increase of our agricultural production have be acknowledge and urge upon the attention of congress and the people as the sure and readiest mean of increase our substantial and endure prosperity the word of washington be as applicable to day as when in his eighth annual message he say it will not be doubt that with reference either to individual or national welfare agriculture be of primary importance in proportion as nation advance in population and other circumstance of maturity this truth become more apparent and render the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage institution for promote it grow up support by the public purse and to what object can it be dedicate with great propriety among the mean which have be employ to this end none have be attend with great success than the establishment of board compose of proper character charge with collect and diffuse information and enable by premium and small pecuniary aid to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and improvement this specie of establishment contribute doubly to the increase of improvement by stimulate to enterprise and experiment and by draw to a common center the result everywhere of individual skill and observation and spread they thence over the whole nation experience accordingly hath shewn that they be very cheap instrument of immense national benefit the preponderance of the agricultural over any other interest in the united states entitle it to all the consideration claim for it by washington about one half of the population of the united states be engage in agriculture the value of the agricultural product of the united states for the year 1878 be estimate at $ 3,000,000,000 the export of agricultural product for the year 1877 as appear from the report of the bureau of statistics be $ 524,000,000 the great extent of our country with its diversity of soil and climate enable we to produce within our own border and by our own labor not only the necessary but most of the luxury that be consume in civilized country yet notwithstanding our advantage of soil climate and inter communication it appear from the statistical statement in the report of the commissioner of agriculture that we import annually from foreign land many million of dollar worth of agricultural product which could be raise in our own country numerous question arise in the practice of advanced agriculture which can only be answer by experiment often costly and sometimes fruitless which be beyond the mean of private individual and be a just and proper charge on the whole nation for the benefit of the nation it be good policy especially in time of depression and uncertainty in other business pursuit with a vast area of uncultivated and hence unproductive territory wisely open to homestead settlement to encourage by every proper and legitimate mean the occupation and tillage of the soil the effort of the department of agriculture to stimulate old and introduce new agricultural industry to improve the quality and increase the quantity of our product to determine the value of old or establish the importance of new method of culture be worthy of your careful

of this important interest the abuse of animal in transit be widely attract public attention a national convention of society specially interested in the subject have recently meet at baltimore and the fact develop both in regard to cruelty to animal and the effect of such cruelty upon the public health would seem to demand the careful consideration of congress and the enactment of more efficient law for the prevention of these abuse the report of the commissioner of the bureau of education show very gratifying progress throughout the country in all the interest commit to the care of this important office the report be especially encouraging with respect to the extension of the advantage of the common school system in section of the country where the general enjoyment of the privilege of free school be not yet attain to education more than to any other agency we be to look as the resource for the advancement of the people in the requisite knowledge and appreciation of their right and responsibility as citizen and i desire to repeat the suggestion contain in my former message in behalf of the enactment of appropriate measure by congress for the purpose of supplement with national aid the local system of education in the several states adequate accommodation for the great library which be overgrow the capacity of the room now occupy at the capitol should be provide without further delay this invaluable collection of book manuscript and illustrative art have grow to such proportion in connection with the copyright system of the country as to demand the prompt and careful attention of congress to save it from injury in its present crowded and insufficient quarter as this library be national in its character and must from the nature of the case increase even more rapidly in the future than in the past it can not be doubt that the people will sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its usefulness the appeal of the regent of the smithsonian institution for the mean to organize exhibit and make available for the public benefit the article now store away belong to the national museum i heartily recommend to your favorable consideration the attention of congress be again invite to the condition of the river front of the city of washington it be a matter of vital importance to the health of the resident of the national capital both temporary and permanent that the lowland in front of the city now subject to tidal overflow should be reclaim in their present condition these flat obstruct the drainage of the city and be a dangerous source of malarial poison the reclamation will improve the navigation of the river by restrict and consequently deepen its channel and be also of importance when consider in connection with the extension of the public ground and the enlargement of the park west and south of the washington monument the report of the board of survey heretofore order by act of congress on the improvement of the harbor of washington and georgetown be respectfully commend to consideration the report of the commissioners of the district of columbia present a detailed statement of the

connection a plan be present for the permanent funding of the outstanding security of the district the benevolent reformatory and penal institution of the district be all entitle to the favorable attention of congress the reform school need additional building and teacher appropriation which will place all of these institution in a condition to become model of usefulness and beneficence will be regard by the country as liberality wisely bestow the commissioners with evident justice request attention to the discrimination make by congress against the district in the donation of land for the support of the public school and ask that the same liberality that have be show to the inhabitant of the various states and territories of the united states may be extend to the district of columbia the commissioners also invite attention to the damage inflict upon public and private interest by the present location of the depot and switch track of the several railroad enter the city and ask for legislation look to their removal the recommendation and suggestion contain in the report will i trust receive the careful consideration of congress sufficient time have perhaps not elapse since the reorganization of the government of the district under the recent legislation of congress for the expression of a confident opinion as to its successful operation but the practical result already attain be so satisfactory that the friend of the new government may well urge upon congress the wisdom of its continuance without essential modification until by actual experience its advantage and defect may be more fully ascertain
to the house of representatives
 after a very careful consideration of house bill 2423 entitle an act to restrict the immigration of chinese to the united states i herewith return it to the house of representatives in which it originate with my objection to its passage
 the bill as it be send to the senate from the house of representatives be confine in its provision to the object name in its title which be that of an act to restrict the immigration of chinese to the united states the only mean adopt to secure the propose object be the limitation on the number of chinese passenger which might be bring to this country by any one vessel to fifteen and as this number be not fix in any proportion to the size or tonnage of the vessel or by any consideration of the safety or accommodation of these passenger the simple purpose and effect of the enactment be to repress this immigration to an extent fall but little short of its absolute exclusion
 the bill as amend in the senate and now present to i include an independent and additional provision which aim at and in term require the abrogation by this government of articles v and vi of the treaty with china commonly call the burlingame treaty through the action of the executive enjoin by this provision of the act
 the burlingame treaty of which the ratification be exchange at peking november 23 1869 recite as the occasion and motive of its negotiation by the two government that since the conclusion of the treaty between the united states of america and the ta tsing empire china of the 18th of june 1858 circumstance have arise show the necessity of additional article thereto and proceed to an agree merit as to say additional article these negotiation therefore end by the signature of the additional article july 28 1868 have for their object the completion of our treaty right and obligation toward the government of china by the incorporation of these new article as thenceforth part of the principal treaty to which they be make supplemental upon the settle rule of interpretation applicable to such supplemental negotiation the text of the principal treaty and of these additional article thereto constitute one treaty from the conclusion of the new negotiation in all part of equal and concurrent force and obligation between the two government and to all intent and purpose as if embrace in one instrument
 the principal treaty of which the ratification be exchange august 16 1859 recite that the united states of america and the ta tsing empire desire to maintain firm lasting and sincere friendship have resolve to renew in a manner clear and positive by mean of a treaty or general convention of peace amity and commerce the rule which shall in future be mutually observe in the intercourse of their respective country and proceed in its thirty article to lay out a careful and comprehensive system for the commercial relation of our people with china the main substance of all the provision of this treaty be to define and secure the right of our people in respect of access to residence and protection in and trade with china the actual provision in our favor in these respect be frame to be and have be find to be adequate and appropriate to the interest of our commerce and by the conclude article we receive the important guaranty that--
 should at any time the ta tsing empire grant to any nation or the merchant or citizen of any nation any right privilege or favor connect either with navigation commerce political or other intercourse which be not confer by this treaty such right privilege and favor shall at once freely inure to the benefit of the united states its public officer merchant and citizen
 against this body of stipulation in our favor and this permanent engagement of equality in respect of all future concession to foreign nation the general promise of permanent peace and good office on our part seem to be the only equivalent for this the first article undertake as follow
 there shall be as there have always be peace and friendship between the united states of america and the ta tsing empire and between their people respectively they shall not insult or oppress each other for any trifling cause so as to produce an estrangement between they and if any other nation should act unjustly or oppressively the united states will exert their good office on be inform of the case to bring about an amicable arrangement of the question thus show their friendly feeling
 at the date of the negotiation of this treaty our pacific possession have attract a considerable chinese emigration and the advantage and the inconvenience feel or fear therefrom have become more or less manifest but they dictate no stipulation on the subject to be incorporate in the treaty the year 1868 be mark by the striking event of a spontaneous embassy from the chinese empire head by an american citizen anson burlingame who have relinquish his diplomatic representation of his own country in china to assume that of the chinese empire to the united states and the european nation by this time the fact of the chinese immigration and its nature and influence present and prospective have become more noticeable and be more observe by the population immediately affect and by this government the principal feature of the burlingame treaty be its attention to and its treatment of the chinese immigration and the chinese as form or as they should form a part of our population up to this time our uncovenante hospitality to immigration our fearless liberality of citizenship our equal and comprehensive justice to all inhabitant whether they abjure their foreign nationality or not our civil freedom and our religious toleration have make all comer welcome and under these protection the chinese in considerable number have make their lodgment upon our soil
 the burlingame treaty undertake to deal with this situation and its fifth and sixth article embrace its most important provision in this regard and the main stipulation in which the chinese government have secure an obligatory protection of its subject within our territory they read as follow
 art v. the united states of america and the emperor of china cordially recognize the inherent and inalienable right of man to change his home and allegiance and also the mutual advantage of the free migration and emigration of their citizen and subject respectively from the one country to the other for purpose of curiosity of trade or as permanent resident the high contracting party therefore join in reprobate any other than an entirely voluntary emigration for these purpose they consequently agree to pass law make it a penal offense for a citizen of the united states or chinese subject to take chinese subject either to the united states or to any other foreign country or for a chinese subject or citizen of the united states to take citizen of the united states to china or to any other foreign country without their free and voluntary consent respectively
 art vi citizen of the united states visit or reside in china shall enjoy the same privilege immunity or exemption in respect to travel or residence as may there be enjoy by the citizen or subject of the most favored nation and reciprocally chinese subject visit or reside in the united states shall enjoy the same privilege immunity and exemption in respect to travel or residence as may there be enjoy by the citizen or subject of the most favored nation but nothing herein contain shall be hold to confer naturalization upon citizen of the united states in china nor upon the subject of china in the united states
 an examination of these two article in the light of the experience then influential in suggest their necessity will show that the fifth article be frame in hostility to what seem the principal mischief to be guard against to wit the introduction of chinese laborer by method which should have the character of a forced and servile importation and not of a voluntary emigration of freeman seek our shore upon motive and in a manner consonant with the system of our institution and approve by the experience of the nation unquestionably the adhesion of the government of china to these liberal principle of freedom in emigration with which we be so familiar and with which we be so well satisfied be a great advance toward open that empire to our civilization and religion and give promise in the future of great and great practical result in the diffusion throughout that great population of our art and industry our manufacture our material improvement and the sentiment of government and religion which seem to we so important to the welfare of mankind the first clause of this article secure this acceptance by china of the american doctrine of free migration to and fro among the people and race of the earth
 the second clause however in its reprobation of any other than an entirely voluntary emigration by both the high contracting party and in the reciprocal obligation whereby we secure the solemn and unqualified engagement on the part of the government of china to pass law make it a penal offense for a citizen of the united states or chinese subject to take chinese subject either to the united states or to any other foreign country without their free and voluntary consent constitute the great force and value of this article its importance both in principle and in its practical service toward our protection against servile importation in the guise of immigration can not be overestimate it commit the chinese government to active and efficient measure to suppress this iniquitous system where those measure be most necessary and can be most effectual it give to this government the footing of a treaty right to such measure and the mean and opportunity of insist upon their adoption and of complaint and resentment at their neglect the fifth article therefore if it fall short of what the pressure of the later experience of our pacific states may urge upon the attention of this government as essential to the public welfare seem to be in the right direction and to contain important advantage which once relinquish can not be easily recover
 the second topic which interest the two government under the actual condition of thing which prompt the burlingame treaty be adequate protection under the solemn and definite guaranty of a treaty of the chinese already in this country and those who should seek our shore this be the object and form the subject of the sixth article by whose reciprocal engagement the citizen and subject of the two government respectively visit or reside in the country of the other be secure the same privilege immunity or exemption there enjoy by the citizen or subject of the most favor nation the treaty of 1858 to which these article be make supplemental provide for a great amount of privilege and protection both of person and property to american citizen in china but it be upon this sixth article that the main body of the treaty right and security of the chinese already in this country depend its abrogation be the rest of the treaty leave in force would leave they to such treatment as we should voluntarily accord they by our law and custom any treaty obligation would be want to restrain our liberty of action toward they or to measure or sustain the right of the chinese government to complaint or redress in their behalf
 the lapse of ten year since the negotiation of the burlingame treaty have exhibit to the notice of the chinese government as well as to our own people the working of this experiment of immigration in great number of chinese laborer to this country and their maintenance here of all the trait of race religion manner and custom habitation mode of life segregation here and the keeping up of the tie of their original home which stamp they as stranger and sojourner and not as incorporate element of our national life and growth this experience may naturally suggest the reconsideration of the subject as deal with by the burlingame treaty and may properly become the occasion of more direct and circumspect recognition in renew negotiation of the difficulty surround this political and social problem it may well be that to the apprehension of the chinese government no less than our own the simple provision of the burlingame treaty may need to be replace by more careful method secure the chinese and ourselves against a large and more rapid infusion of this foreign race than our system of industry and society can take up and assimilate with ease and safety this ancient government rule a polite and sensitive people distinguish by a high sense of national pride may properly desire an adjustment of their relation with we which would in all thing confirm and in no degree endanger the permanent peace and amity and the grow commerce and prosperity which it have be the object and the effect of our exist treaty to cherish and perpetuate
 i regard the very grave discontent of the people of the pacific states with the present working of the chinese immigration and their still graver apprehension therefrom in the future as deserve the most serious attention of the people of the whole country and a solicitous interest on the part of congress and the executive if this be not my own judgment the passage of this bill by both houses of congress would impress upon i the seriousness of the situation when a majority of the representative of the people of the whole country have think fit to justify so serious a measure of relief
 the authority of congress to terminate a treaty with a foreign power by express the will of the nation no long to adhere to it be as free from controversy under our constitution as be the further proposition that the power of make new treaty or modify exist treaty be not lodge by the constitution in congress but in the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate as show by the concurrence of two third of that body a denunciation of a treaty by any government be confessedly justifiable only upon some reason both of the high justice and of the high necessity the action of congress in the matter of the french treaty in 1798 if it be regard as an abrogation by this nation of a subsist treaty strongly illustrate the character and degree of justification which be then think suitable to such a proceeding the preamble of the act recite that the--
 treaty conclude between the united states and france have be repeatedly violate on the part of the french government and the just claim of the united states for reparation of the injury so committed have be refuse and their attempt to negotiate an amicable adjustment of all complaint between the two nation have be repel with indignity
 and that--
 under authority of the french government there be yet pursue against the united states a system of predatory violence infract the say treaty and hostile to the right of a free and independent nation
 the enactment as a logical consequence of these recited fact declares--
 that the united states be of right freed and exonerate from the stipulation of the treaty and of the consular convention heretofore conclude between the united states and france and that the same shall not henceforth be regard as legally obligatory on the government or citizen of the united states
 the history of the government show no other instance of an abrogation of a treaty by congress
 instance have sometimes occur where the ordinary legislation of congress have by its conflict with some treaty obligation of the government toward a foreign power take effect as an infraction of the treaty and be judicially declare to be operative to that result but neither such legislation nor such judicial sanction of the same have be regard as an abrogation even for the moment of the treaty on the contrary the treaty in such case still subsist between the government and the casual infraction be repair by appropriate satisfaction in maintenance of the treaty
 the bill before i do not enjoin upon the president the abrogation of the entire burlingame treaty much less of the principal treaty of which it be make the supplement as the power of modify an exist treaty whether by add or strike out provision be a part of the treaty make power under the constitution its exercise be not competent for congress nor would the assent of china to this partial abrogation of the treaty make the action of congress in thus procure an amendment of a treaty a competent exercise of authority under the constitution the importance however of this special consideration seems supersede by the principle that a denunciation of a part of a treaty not make by the term of the treaty itself separable from the rest be a denunciation of the whole treaty as the other high contracting party have enter into no treaty obligation except such as include the part denounce the denunciation by one party of the part necessarily liberate the other party from the whole treaty
 i be convinced that whatever urgency might in any quarter or by any interest be suppose to require an instant suppression of further immigration from china no reason can require the immediate withdrawal of our treaty protection of the chinese already in this country and no circumstance can tolerate an exposure of our citizen in china merchant or missionary to the consequence of so sudden an abrogation of their treaty protection fortunately however the actual recession in the flow of the emigration from china to the pacific coast show by trustworthy statistic relieve we from any apprehension that the treatment of the subject in the proper course of diplomatic negotiation will introduce any new feature of discontent or disturbance among the community directly affect be such delay fraught with more inconvenience than have ever be suggest by the interest most earnest in promote this legislation i can not but regard the summary disturbance of our exist treaty with china as greatly more inconvenient to much wide and more permanent interest of the country
 i have no occasion to insist upon the more general consideration of interest and duty which sacredly guard the faith of the nation in whatever form of obligation it may have be give these sentiment animate the deliberation of congress and pervade the mind of our whole people our history give little occasion for any reproach in this regard and in ask the renew attention of congress to this bill i be persuade that their action will maintain the public duty and the public honor

to the house of representatives
 i have maturely consider the important question present by the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the support of the army for the fiscal year end june 30 1880 and for other purpose and i now return it to the house of representatives in which it originate with my objection to its approval
 the bill provide in the usual form for the appropriation require for the support of the army during the next fiscal year if it contain no other provision it would receive my prompt approval it include however further legislation which attach as it be to appropriation which be requisite for the efficient performance of some of the most necessary duty of the government involve question of the grave character the sixth section of the bill be amendatory of the statute now in force in regard to the authority of person in the civil military and naval service of the united states at the place where any general or special election be hold in any state this statute be adopt february 25 1865 after a protract debate in the senate and almost without opposition in the house of representatives by the concurrent vote of both of the lead political party of the country and become a law by the approval of president lincoln it be reenact in 1874 in the revised statutes of the united states section 2002 and 5528 which be as follow
 sec 2002 no military or naval officer or other person engage in the civil military or naval service of the united states shall order bring keep or have under his authority or control any troop or armed man at the place where any general or special election be hold in any state unless it be necessary to repel the armed enemy of the united states or to keep the peace at the poll
 sec 5528 every officer of the army or navy or other person in the civil military or naval service of the united states who order bring keep or have under his authority or control any troop or armed man at any place where a general or special election be hold in any state unless such force be necessary to repel armed enemy of the united states or to keep the peace at the poll shall be fine not more than $ 5,000 and suffer imprisonment at hard labor not less than three month nor more than five year
 the amendment propose to this statute in the bill before i omit from both of the foregoing section the word or to keep the peace at the poll the effect of the adoption of this amendment may be considered--
 first upon the right of the united states government to use military force to keep the peace at the election for member of congress and
 second upon the right of the government by civil authority to protect these election from violence and fraud
 in addition to the section of the statute above quote the follow provision of law relate to the use of the military power at the election be now in force
 sec 2003 no officer of the army or navy of the united states shall prescribe or fix or attempt to prescribe or fix by proclamation order or otherwise the qualification of voter in any state or in any manner interfere with the freedom of any election in any state or with the exercise of the free right of suffrage in any state
 sec 5529 every officer or other person in the military or naval service who by force threat intimidation order advice or otherwise prevent or attempt to prevent any qualified voter of any state from freely exercise the right of suffrage at any general or special election in such state shall be fine not more than $ 5,000 and imprison at hard labor not more than five year
 sec 5530 every officer of the army or navy who prescribe or fix or attempt to prescribe or fix whether by proclamation order or otherwise the qualification of voter at any election in any state shall be punish as provide in the precede section
 sec 5531 every officer or other person in the military or naval service who by force threat intimidation order or otherwise compel or attempt to compel any officer hold an election in any state to receive a vote from a person not legally qualified to vote or who impose or attempt to impose any regulation for conduct any general or special election in a state different from those prescribe by law or who interfere in any manner with any officer of an election in the discharge of his duty shall be punish as provide in section 5529
 sec 5532 every person convict of any of the offense specify in the five precede section shall in addition to the punishment therein severally prescribe be disqualify from hold any office of honor profit or trust under the united states but nothing in those section shall be construe to prevent any officer soldier sailor or marine from exercise the right of suffrage in any election district to which he may belong if otherwise qualified accord to the law of the state in which he offer to vote
 the foregoing enactment would seem to be sufficient to prevent military interference with the election but the last congress to remove all apprehension of such interference add to this body of law section 15 of an act entitle an act make appropriation for the support of the army for the fiscal year end june 30 1879 and for other purpose approve june 18 1878 which be as follow
 sec 15 from and after the passage of this act it shall not be lawful to employ any part of the army of the united states as a posse comitatus or otherwise for the purpose of execute the law except in such case and under such circumstance as such employment of say force may be expressly authorize by the constitution or by act of congress and no money appropriate by this act shall be use to pay any of the expense incur in the employment of any troop in violation of this section and any person willfully violate the provision of this section shall be deem guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall be punish by fine not exceed $ 10,000 or imprisonment not exceed two year or by both such fine and imprisonment
 this act pass the senate after full consideration without a single vote record against it on its final passage and by a majority of more than two third it be concur in by the house of representatives
 the purpose of the section quote be state in the senate by one of its supporter as follow
 therefore i hope without get into any controversy about the past but act wisely for the future that we shall take away the idea that the army can be use by a general or special deputy marshal or any marshal merely for election purpose as a posse order they about the poll or order they anywhere else when there be an election go on to prevent disorder or to suppress disturbance that should be suppress by the peace officer of the state or if they must bring other to their aid they should summon the unorganized citizen and not summon the officer and man of the army as a posse comitatus to quell disorder and thus get up a feeling which will be disastrous to peace among the people of the country
 in the house of representatives the object of the act of 1878 be state by the gentleman who have it in charge in similar term he say
 but these be all minor point and insignificant question compare with the great principle which be incorporate by the house in the bill in reference to the use of the army in time of peace the senate have already concede what they call and what we might accept as the principle but they have stricken out the penalty and have stricken out the word expressly so that the army might be use in all case where imply authority might be infer the house committee plant themselves firmly upon the doctrine that rather than yield this fundamental principle for which for three year this house have struggle they would allow the bill to fail notwithstanding the reform which we have secure regard these reform as of but little consequence alongside the great principle that the army of the united states in time of peace should be under the control of congress and obedient to its law after a long and protracted negotiation the senate committee have concede that principle in all its length and breadth include the penalty which the senate have stricken out we bring you back therefore a report with the alteration of a single word which the lawyer assure i be proper to be make restore to this bill the principle for which we have contend so long and which be so vital to secure the right and liberty of the people
 thus have we this day secure to the people of this country the same great protection against a stand army which cost a struggle of two hundred year for the commons of england to secure for the british people
 from this brief review of the subject it sufficiently appear that under exist law there can be no military interference with the election no case of such interference have in fact occur since the passage of the act last refer to no soldier of the united states have appear under order at any place of election in any state no complaint even of the presence of united states troop have be make in any quarter it may therefore be confidently state that there be no necessity for the enactment of section 6 of the bill before i to prevent military interference with the election the law already in force be all that be require for that end
 but that part of section 6 of this bill which be significant and vitally important be the clause which if adopt will deprive the civil authority of the united states of all power to keep the peace at the congressional election the congressional election in every district in a very important sense be justly a matter of political interest and concern throughout the whole country each state every political party be entitle to the share of power which be confer by the legal and constitutional suffrage it be the right of every citizen possess the qualification prescribe by law to cast one unintimidated ballot and to have his ballot honestly count so long as the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of this right be common and equal practically as well as formally submission to the result of the suffrage will be accord loyally and cheerfully and all the department of government will feel the true vigor of the popular will thus express
 two provision of the constitution authorize legislation by congress for the regulation of the congressional election
 section 4 of article i of the constitution declares--
 the time place and manner of hold election for senator and representatives shall be prescribe in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulation except as to the place of choose senator
 the fifteenth amendment of the constitution be as follow
 sec 1 the right of citizen of the united states to vote shall not be deny or abridge by the united states or by any state on account of race color or previous condition of servitude
 sec 2 the congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation
 the supreme court have hold that this amendment invest the citizen of the united states with a new constitutional right which be within the protect power of congress that right the court declare to be exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of race color or previous condition of servitude the power of congress to protect this right by appropriate legislation be expressly affirm by the court
 national legislation to provide safeguard for free and honest election be necessary as experience have show not only to secure the right to vote to the enfranchised race at the south but also to prevent fraudulent voting in the large city of the north congress have therefore exercise the power confer by the constitution and have enact certain law to prevent discrimination on account of race color or previous condition of servitude and to punish fraud violence and intimidation at federal election attention be call to the follow section of the revised statutes of the united states viz
 section 2004 which guarantee to all citizen the right to vote without distinction on account of race color or previous condition of servitude
 sections 2005 and 2006 which guarantee to all citizen equal opportunity without discrimination to perform all the act require by law as a prerequisite or qualification for voting

 section 5522 which provide for the punishment of the crime of interfere with the supervisor of election and deputy marshal in the discharge of their duty at the election of representatives in congress
 these be some of the law on this subject which it be the duty of the executive department of the government to enforce the intent and effect of the sixth section of this bill be to prohibit all the civil officer of the united states under penalty of fine and imprisonment from employ any adequate civil force for this purpose at the place where their enforcement be most necessary namely at the place where the congressional election be hold among the most valuable enactment to which i have refer be those which protect the supervisor of federal election in the discharge of their duty at the poll if the propose legislation should become the law there will be no power vest in any officer of the government to protect from violence the officer of the united states engage in the discharge of their duty their right and duty under the law will remain but the national government will be powerless to enforce its own statute the states may employ both military and civil power to keep the peace and to enforce the law at state election it be now propose to deny to the united states even the necessary civil authority to protect the national election no sufficient reason have be give for this discrimination in favor of the state and against the national authority if well found objection exist against the present national election law all good citizen should unite in their amendment the law provide the safeguard of the election should be impartial just and efficient they should if possible be so nonpartisan and fair in their operation that the minority the party out of power will have no just ground to complain the present law have in practice unquestionably conduce to the prevention of fraud and violence at the election in several of the states member of different political party have apply for the safeguard which they furnish it be the right and duty of the national government to enact and enforce law which will secure free and fair congressional election the law now in force should not be repeal except in connection with the enactment of measure which will well accomplish that important end believe that section 6 of the bill before i will weaken if it do not altogether take away the power of the national government to protect the federal election by the civil authority i be force to the conclusion that it ought not to receive my approval
 this section be however not present to i as a separate and independent measure but be as have be state attach to the bill make the usual annual appropriation for the support of the army it make a vital change in the election law of the country which be in no way connect with the use of the army it prohibit under heavy penalty any person engage in the civil service of the united states from have any force at the place of any election prepare to preserve order to make arrest to keep the peace or in any manner to enforce the law this be altogether foreign to the purpose of an army appropriation bill the practice of tack to appropriation bill measure not pertinent to such bill do not prevail until more than forty year after the adoption of the constitution it have become a common practice all party when in power have adopt it many abuse and great waste of public money have in this way creep into appropriation bill the public opinion of the country be against it the state which have recently adopt constitution have generally provide a remedy for the evil by enact that no law shall contain more than one subject which shall be plainly express in its title the constitution of more than half of the states contain substantially this provision the public welfare will be promote in many way by a return to the early practice of the government and to the true principle of legislation which require that every measure shall stand or fall accord to its own merit if it be understand that to attach to an appropriation bill a measure irrelevant to the general object of the bill would imperil and probably prevent its final passage and approval a valuable reform in the parliamentary practice of congress would be accomplish the good justification that have be offer for attach irrelevant rider to appropriation bill be that it be do for convenience sake to facilitate the passage of measure which be deem expedient by all the branch of government which participate in legislation it can not be claim that there be any such reason for attach this amendment of the election law to the army appropriation bill the history of the measure contradict this assumption a majority of the house of representatives in the last congress be in favor of section 6 of this bill it be know that a majority of the senate be oppose to it and that as a separate measure it could not be adopt it be attach to the army appropriation bill to compel the senate to assent to it it be plainly announce to the senate that the army appropriation bill would not be allow to pass unless the propose amendment of the election law be adopt with it the senate refuse to assent to the bill on account of this irrelevant section congress thereupon adjourn without pass an appropriation bill for the army and the present extra session of the forty sixth congress become necessary to furnish the mean to carry on the government
 the ground upon which the action of the house of representatives be defend have be distinctly state by many of its advocate a week before the close of the last session of congress the doctrine in question be state by one of its able defender as follow
 it be our duty to repeal these law it be not worth while to attempt the repeal except upon an appropriation bill the republican senate would not agree to nor the republican president sign a bill for such repeal whatever objection to legislation upon appropriation bill may be make in ordinary case do not apply where free election and the liberty of the citizen be concern we have the power to vote money let we annex condition to it and insist upon the redress of grievance
 by another distinguished member of the house it be say
 the right of the representatives of the people to withhold supply be as old as english liberty history record numerous instance where the commons feel that the people be oppress by law that the lords would not consent to repeal by the ordinary method of legislation obtain redress at last by refuse appropriation unless accompany by relief measure
 that a question of the grave magnitude and new in this country be raise by this course of proceeding be fully recognize also by its defender in the senate it be say by a distinguished senator
 perhaps no great question in the form we be bring to consider it be ever consider by the american congress in time of peace for it involve not merely the merit or demerit of the law which the house bill propose to repeal but involve the right the privilege the power the duty of the two branch of congress and of the president of the united states it be a vast question it be a question whose importance can scarcely be estimate it be a question that never yet have be bring so sharply before the american congress and the american people as it may be now it be a question which soon or later must be decide and the decision must determine what be the power of the house of representatives under the constitution and what be the duty of that house in the view of the framer of that constitution accord to its letter and its spirit
 mr. president i should approach this question if i be in the good possible condition to speak and to argue it with very grave diffidence and certainly with the utmost anxiety for no one can think of it as long and as carefully as i have think of it without see that we be at the beginning perhaps of a struggle that may last as long in this country as a similar struggle last in what we be accustomed to call the mother land there the struggle last for two century before it be ultimately decide it be not likely to last so long here but it may last until every man in this chamber be in his grave it be the question whether or not the house of representatives have a right to say we will grant supply only upon condition that grievance be redress we be the representative of the taxpayer of the republic we the house of representatives alone have the right to originate money bill we the house of representatives have alone the right to originate bill which grant the money of the people the senate represent states we represent the taxpayer of the republic we therefore by the very term of the constitution be charge with the duty of originate the bill which grant the money of the people we claim the right which the house of commons in england establish after two century of contest to say that we will not grant the money of the people unless there be a redress of grievance
 upon the assembling of this congress in pursuance of a call for an extra session which be make necessary by the failure of the forty fifth congress to make the needful appropriation for the support of the government the question be present whether the attempt make in the last congress to ingraft by construction a new principle upon the constitution should be persist in or not this congress have ample opportunity and time to pass the appropriation bill and also to enact any political measure which may be determine upon in separate bill by the usual and orderly method of proceeding but the majority of both houses have deem it wise to adhere to the principle assert and maintain in the last congress by the majority of the house of representatives that principle be that the house of representatives have the sole right to originate bill for raise revenue and therefore have the right to withhold appropriation upon which the existence of the government may depend unless the senate and the president shall give their assent to any legislation which the house may see fit to attach to appropriation bill to establish this principle be to make a radical dangerous and unconstitutional change in the character of our institution the various department of the government and the army and the navy be establish by the constitution or by law pass in pursuance thereof their duty be clearly define and their support be carefully provide for by law the money require for this purpose have be collect from the people and be now in the treasury ready to be pay out as soon as the appropriation bill be pass whether appropriation be make or not the collection of the taxis will go on the public money will accumulate in the treasury it be not the intention of the framer of the constitution that any single branch of the government should have the power to dictate condition upon which this treasure should be apply to the purpose for which it be collect any such intention if it have be entertain would have be plainly express in the constitution
 that a majority of the senate now concur in the claim of the house add to the gravity of the situation but do not alter the question at issue the new doctrine if maintain will result in a consolidation of unchecked and despotic power in the house of representatives a bare majority of the house will become the government the executive will no long be what the framer of the constitution intend an equal and independent branch of the government it be clearly the constitutional duty of the president to exercise his discretion and judgment upon all bill present to he without constraint or duress from any other branch of the government to say that a majority of either or both of the houses of congress may insist upon the approval of a bill under the penalty of stop all of the operation of the government for want of the necessary supply be to deny to the executive that share of the legislative power which be plainly confer by the second section of the seventh article of the constitution it strike from the constitution the qualified negative of the president it be say that this should be do because it be the peculiar function of the house of representatives to represent the will of the people but no single branch or department of the government have exclusive authority to speak for the american people the most authentic and solemn expression of their will be contain in the constitution of the united states by that constitution they have ordain and establish a government whose power be distribute among coordinate branch which as far as possible consistently with a harmonious cooperation be absolutely independent of each other the people of this country be unwilling to see the supremacy of the constitution replace by the omnipotence of any one department of the government
 the enactment of this bill into a law will establish a precedent which will tend to destroy the equal independence of the several branch of the government its principle place not merely the senate and the executive but the judiciary also under the coercive dictation of the house the house alone will be the judge of what constitute a grievance and also of the mean and measure of redress an act of congress to protect election be now the grievance complain of but the house may on the same principle determine that any other act of congress a treaty make by the president with the advice and consent of the senate a nomination or appointment to office or that a decision or opinion of the supreme court be a grievance and that the measure of redress be to withhold the appropriation require for the support of the offend branch of the government
 believe that this bill be a dangerous violation of the spirit and meaning of the constitution i be compel to return it to the house in which it originate without my approval the qualified negative with which the constitution invest the president be a trust that involve a duty which he can not decline to perform with a firm and conscientious purpose to do what i can to preserve unimpaire the constitutional power and equal independence not merely of the executive but of every branch of the government which will be imperil by the adoption of the principle of this bill i desire earnestly to urge upon the house of representatives a return to the wise and wholesome usage of the early day of the republic which exclude from appropriation bill all irrelevant legislation by this course you will inaugurate an important reform in the method of congressional legislation your action will be in harmony with the fundamental principle of the constitution and the patriotic sentiment of nationality which be their firm support and you will restore to the country that feeling of confidence and security and the repose which be so essential to the prosperity of all of our fellow citizen

to the house of representatives
 after a careful consideration of the bill entitle an act to prohibit military interference at election i return it to the house of representatives in which it originate with the follow objection to its approval
 in the communication send to the house of representatives on the 29th of last month return to the house without my approval the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the support of the army for the fiscal year end june 30 1880 and for other purpose i endeavor to show by quotation from the statute of the united states now in force and by a brief statement of fact in regard to recent election in the several states that no additional legislation be necessary to prevent interference with the election by the military or naval force of the united states the fact be present in that communication that at the time of the passage of the act of june 18 1878 in relation to the employment of the army as a posse comitatus or otherwise it be maintain by its friend that it would establish a vital and fundamental principle which would secure to the people protection against a stand army the fact be also refer to that since the passage of this act congressional state and municipal election have be hold throughout the union and that in no instance have complaint be make of the presence of united states soldier at the poll
 holding as i do the opinion that any military interference whatever at the poll be contrary to the spirit of our institution and would tend to destroy the freedom of election and sincerely desire to concur with congress in all of its measure it be with very great regret that i be force to the conclusion that the bill before i be not only unnecessary to prevent such interference but be a dangerous departure from long settle and important constitutional principle
 the true rule as to the employment of military force at the election be not doubtful no intimidation or coercion should be allow to control or influence citizen in the exercise of their right to vote whether it appear in the shape of combination of evil dispose person or of armed body of the militia of a state or of the military force of the united states
 the election should be free from all forcible interference and as far as practicable from all apprehension of such interference no soldier either of the union or of the state militia should be present at the poll to take the place or to perform the duty of the ordinary civil police force there have be and will be no violation of this rule under order from i during this administration but there should be no denial of the right of the national government to employ its military force on any day and at any place in case such employment be necessary to enforce the constitution and law of the united states the bill before i be as follow
 be it enact etc that it shall not be lawful to bring to or employ at any place where a general or special election be be hold in a state any part of the army or navy of the united states unless such force be necessary to repel the armed enemy of the united states or to enforce section 4 article iv of the constitution of the united states and the law make in pursuance thereof on application of the legislature or executive of the state where such force be to be use and so much of all law as be inconsistent herewith be hereby repeal
 it will be observe that the bill exempt from the general prohibition against the employment of military force at the poll two specify case these exception recognize and concede the soundness of the principle that military force may properly and constitutionally be use at the place of election when such use be necessary to enforce the constitution and the law but the excepted case leave the prohibition so extensive and far reach that its adoption will seriously impair the efficiency of the executive department of the government
 the first act expressly authorize the use of military power to execute the law be pass almost as early as the organization of the government under the constitution and be approve by president washington may 2 1792 it be as follow
 sec 2 and be it far enact that whenever the law of the united states shall be oppose or the execution thereof obstruct in any state by combination too powerful to be suppress by the ordinary course of judicial proceeding or by the power vest in the marshal by this act the same be notify to the president of the united states by an associate justice or the district judge it shall be lawful for the president of the united states to call forth the militia of such state to suppress such combination and to cause the law to be duly execute and if the militia of a state where such combination may happen shall refuse or be insufficient to suppress the same it shall be lawful for the president if the legislature of the united states be not in session to call forth and employ such number of the militia of any other state or states most convenient thereto as may be necessary and the use of militia so to be call forth may be continue if necessary until the expiration of thirty day after the commencement of the ensue session
 in 1795 this provision be substantially reenact in a law which repeal the act of 1792 in 1807 the following act become the law by the approval of president jefferson
 that in all case of insurrection or obstruction to the law either of the united states or of any individual state or territory where it be lawful for the president of the united states to call forth the militia for the purpose of suppress such insurrection or of cause the law to be duly execute it shall be lawful for he to employ for the same purpose such part of the land or naval force of the united states as shall be judge necessary having first observe all the prerequisite of the law in that respect
 by this act it will be see that the scope of the law of 1795 be extend so as to authorize the national government to use not only the militia but the army and navy of the united states in cause the law to be duly execute
 the important provision of the act of 1792 1795 and 1807 modify in its term from time to time to adapt it to the exist emergency remain in force until by an act approve by president lincoln july 29 1861 it be reenact substantially in the same language in which it be now find in the revised statutes viz
 sec 5298 whenever by reason of unlawful obstruction combination or assemblage of person or rebellion against the authority of the government of the united states it shall become impracticable in the judgment of the president to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceeding the law of the united states within any state or territory it shall be lawful for the president to call forth the militia of any or all the states and to employ such part of the land and naval force of the united states as he may deem necessary to enforce the faithful execution of the law of the united states or to suppress such rebellion in whatever state or territory thereof the law of the united states may be forcibly oppose or the execution thereof forcibly obstruct
 this ancient and fundamental law have be in force from the foundation of the government it be now propose to abrogate it on certain day and at certain place in my judgment no fact have be produce which tend to show that it ought to be repeal or suspend for a single hour at any place in any of the states or territories of the union all the teaching of experience in the course of our history be in favor of sustain its efficiency unimpaired on every occasion when the supremacy of the constitution have be resist and the perpetuity of our institution imperil the principle of this statute enact by the father have enable the government of the union to maintain its authority and to preserve the integrity of the nation at the most critical period of our history my predecessor in the executive office have rely on this great principle it be on this principle that president washington suppress the whisky rebellion in pennsylvania in 1794
 in 1806 on the same principle president jefferson break up the burr conspiracy by issue order for the employment of such force either of the regular or of the militia and by such proceeding of the civil authority as might enable they to suppress effectually the further progress of the enterprise and it be under the same authority that president jackson crush nullification in south carolina and that president lincoln issue his call for troop to save the union in 1861 on numerous other occasion of less significance under probably every administration and certainly under the present this power have be usefully exert to enforce the law without objection by any party in the country and almost without attract public attention
 the great elementary constitutional principle which be the foundation of the original statute of 1792 and which have be its essence in the various form it have assume since its first adoption be that the government of the united states possess under the constitution in full measure the power of self protection by its own agency altogether independent of state authority and if need be against the hostility of state government it should remain embody in our statute unimpaire as it have be from the very origin of the government it should be regard as hardly less valuable or less sacred than a provision of the constitution itself
 there be many other important statute contain provision that be liable to be suspend or annul at the time and place of hold election if the bill before i should become a law i do not undertake to furnish a list of they many of they perhaps the most of they have be set forth in the debate on this measure they relate to extradition to crime against the election law to quarantine regulation to neutrality to indian reservation to the civil right of citizen and to other subject in regard to they all it may be safely say that the meaning and effect of this bill be to take from the general government an important part of its power to enforce the law
 another grave objection to the bill be its discrimination in favor of the state and against the national authority the presence or employment of the army or navy of the united states be lawful under the term of this bill at the place where an election be be hold in a state to uphold the authority of a state government then and there in need of such military intervention but unlawful to uphold the authority of the government of the united states then and there in need of such military intervention under this bill the presence or employment of the army or navy of the united states would be lawful and might be necessary to maintain the conduct of a state election against the domestic violence that would overthrow it but would be unlawful to maintain the conduct of a national election against the same local violence that would overthrow it this discrimination have never be attempt in any previous legislation by congress and be no more compatible with sound principle of the constitution or the necessary maxim and method of our system of government on occasion of election than at other time in the early legislation of 1792 and of 1795 by which the militia of the states be the only military power resort to for the execution of the constitutional power in support of state or national authority both function of the government be put upon the same footing by the act of 1807 the employment of the army and navy be authorize for the performance of both constitutional duty in the same term
 in all later statute on the same subject matter the same measure of authority to the government have be accord for the performance of both these duty no precedent have be find in any previous legislation and no sufficient reason have be give for the discrimination in favor of the state and against the national authority which this bill contain
 under the sweeping term of the bill the national government be effectually shut out from the exercise of the right and from the discharge of the imperative duty to use its whole executive power whenever and wherever require for the enforcement of its law at the place and time when and where its election be hold the employment of its organized armed force for any such purpose would be an offense against the law unless call for by and therefore upon permission of the authority of the state in which the occasion arise what be this but the substitution of the discretion of the state government for the discretion of the government of the united states as to the performance of its own duty in my judgment this be an abandonment of its obligation by the national government a subordination of national authority and an intrusion of state supervision over national duty which amount in spirit and tendency to state supremacy
 though i believe that the exist statute be abundantly adequate to completely prevent military interference with the election in the sense in which the phrase be use in the title of this bill and be employ by the people of this country i shall find no difficulty in concur in any additional legislation limit to that object which do not interfere with the indispensable exercise of the power of the government under the constitution and law

to the house of representatives
 after mature consideration of the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the legislative executive and judicial expense of the government for the fiscal year end june 30 1880 and for other purpose i herewith return it to the house of representatives in which it originate with the follow objection to its approval
 the main purpose of the bill be to appropriate the money require to support during the next fiscal year the several civil department of the government the amount appropriate exceed in the aggregate $ 18,000,000
 this money be need to keep in operation the essential function of all the great department of the government legislative executive and judicial if the bill contain no other provision no objection to its approval would be make it embrace however a number of clause relate to subject of great general interest which be wholly unconnected with the appropriation which it provide for the objection to the practice of tack general legislation to appropriation bill especially when the object be to deprive a coordinate branch of the government of its right to the free exercise of its own discretion and judgment touch such general legislation be set forth in the special message in relation to house bill no 1 which be return to the house of representatives on the 29th of last month i regret that the objection which be then express to this method of legislation have not seem to congress of sufficient weight to dissuade from this renew incorporation of general enactment in an appropriation bill and that my constitutional duty in respect of the general legislation thus place before i can not be discharge without seem to delay however briefly the necessary appropriation by congress for the support of the government without repeat these objection i respectfully refer to that message for a statement of my view on the principle maintain in debate by the advocate of this bill viz that to withhold appropriation be a constitutional mean for the redress of what the majority of the house of representatives may regard as a grievance
 the bill contain the follow clause viz
 and provide far that the follow section of the revised statutes of the united states namely section 2016 2018 and 2020 and all of the succeed section of say statute down to and include section 2027 and also section 5522 be and the same be hereby repeal and that all the other section of the revised statutes and all law and part of law authorize the appointment of chief supervisor of election special deputy marshal of election or general deputy marshal have any duty to perform in respect to any election and prescribe their duty and power and allow they compensation be and the same be hereby repeal
 it also contain clause amend section 2017 2019 2028 and 2031 of the revised statutes
 the section of the revised statutes which the bill if approve would repeal or amend be part of an act approve may 30 1870 and amend february 28 1871 entitle an act to enforce the right of citizen of the united states to vote in the several states of this union and for other purpose all of the provision of the above name act which it be propose in this bill to repeal or modify relate to the congressional election the remain portion of the law which will continue in force after the enactment of this measure be that which provide for the appointment by a judge of the circuit court of the united states of two supervisor of election in each election district at any congressional election on due application of citizen who desire in the language of the law to have such election guard and scrutinize the duty of the supervisor will be to attend at the poll at all congressional election and to remain after the poll be open until every vote cast have be count but they will have no authority to make arrest or to perform other duty than to be in the immediate presence of the officer hold the election and to witness all their proceeding include the counting of the vote and the making of a return thereof the part of the election law which will be repeal by the approval of this bill include those section which give authority to the supervisor of election to personally scrutinize count and canvass each ballot and all the section which confer authority upon the united states marshal and deputy marshal in connection with the congressional election the enactment of this bill will also repeal section 5522 of the criminal statute of the united states which be enact for the protection of united states officer engage in the discharge of their duty at the congressional election this section protect supervisor and marshal in the performance of their duty by make the obstruction or the assaulting of these officer or any interference with they by bribery or solicitation or otherwise crime against the united states
 the true meaning and effect of the propose legislation be plain the supervisor with the authority to observe and witness the proceeding at the congressional election will be leave but there will be no power to protect they or to prevent interference with their duty or to punish any violation of the law from which their power be derive if this bill be approve only the shadow of the authority of the united states at the national election will remain the substance will be go the supervision of the election will be reduce to a mere inspection without authority on the part of the supervisor to do any act whatever to make the election a fair one all that will be leave to the supervisor be the permission to have such oversight of the election as political party be in the habit of exercise without any authority of law in order to prevent their opponent from obtain unfair advantage the object of the bill be to destroy any control whatever by the united states over the congressional election
 the passage of this bill have be urge upon the ground that the election of member of congress be a matter which concern the states alone that these election should be control exclusively by the states that there be and can be no such election as national election and that the exist law of the united states regulate the congressional election be without warrant in the constitution
 it be evident however that the framer of the constitution regard the election of member of congress in every state and in every district as in a very important sense justly a matter of political interest and concern to the whole country the original provision of the constitution on this subject be as follow sec 4 art i
 the time place and manner of hold election for senator and representatives shall be prescribe in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulation except as to the place of choose senator
 a further provision have be since add which be embrace in the fifteenth amendment it be as follow
 sec 1 the right of citizen of the united states to vote shall not be deny or abridge by the united states or by any state on account of race color or previous condition of servitude
 sec 2 the congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation
 under the general provision of the constitution sec 4 art 1 congress in 1866 pass a comprehensive law which prescribe full and detailed regulation for the election of senators by the legislature of the several states this law have be in force almost thirteen year in pursuance of it all the member of the present senate of the united states hold their seat its constitutionality be not call in question it be confidently believe that no sound argument can be make in support of the constitutionality of national regulation of senatorial election which will not show that the election of member of the house of representatives may also be constitutionally regulate by the national authority
 the bill before i itself recognize the principle that the congressional election be not state election but national election it leave in full force the exist statute under which supervisor be still to be appoint by national authority to observe and witness the congressional election whenever due application be make by citizen who desire say election to be guard and scrutinize if the power to supervise in any respect whatever the congressional election exist under section 4 article 1 of the constitution it be a power which like every other power belong to the government of the united states be paramount and supreme and include the right to employ the necessary mean to carry it into effect
 the statute of the united states which regulate the election of member of the house of representatives an essential part of which it be propose to repeal by this bill have be in force about eight year four congressional election have be hold under they two of which be at the presidential election of 1872 and 1876 numerous prosecution trial and conviction have be have in the court of the united states in all part of the union for violation of these law in no reported case have their constitutionality be call in question by any judge of the court of the united states the validity of these law be sustain by the uniform course of judicial action and opinion
 if it be urge that the united states election law be not necessary an ample reply be furnish by the history of their origin and of their result they be especially prompt by the investigation and exposure of the fraud commit in the city and state of new york at the election of 1868 committee represent both of the lead political party of the country have submit report to the house of representatives on the extent of those fraud a committee of the fortieth congress after a full investigation reach the conclusion that the number of fraudulent vote cast in the city of new york alone in 1868 be not less than 25,000 a committee of the forty fourth congress in their report submit in 1877 adopt the opinion that for every 100 actual voter of the city of new york in 1868 108 vote be cast when in fact the number of lawful vote cast could not have exceed 88 per cent of the actual voter of the city by this statement the number of fraudulent vote at that election in the city of new york alone be between thirty and forty thousand these fraud completely reverse the result of the election in the state of new york both as to the choice of governor and state officer and as to the choice of elector of president and vice president of the united states they attract the attention of the whole country it be plain that if they could be continue and repeat with impunity free government be impossible a distinguished senator in oppose the passage of the election law declare that he have for a long time believe that our form of government be a comparative failure in the large city to meet these evil and to prevent these crime the united states law regulate congressional election be enact
 the framer of these law have not be disappoint in their result in the large city under their provision the election have be comparatively peaceable orderly and honest even the opponent of these law have bear testimony to their value and efficiency and to the necessity for their enactment the committee of the forty fourth congress compose of member a majority of whom be oppose to these law in their report on the new york election of 1876 say
 the committee would commend to other portion of the country and to other city this remarkable system develop through the agency of both local and federal authority act in harmony for an honest purpose in no portion of the world and in no era of time where there have be an expression of the popular will through the form of law have there be a more complete and thorough illustration of republican institution whatever may have be the previous habit or conduct of election in those city or howsoever they may conduct themselves in the future this election of 1876 will stand as a monument of what good faith honest endeavor legal form and just authority may do for the protection of the electoral franchise
 this bill recognize the authority and duty of the united states to appoint supervisor to guard and scrutinize the congressional election but it deny to the government of the united states all power to make its supervision effectual the great body of the people of all party want free and fair election they do not think that a free election mean freedom from the wholesome restraint of law or that the place of election should be a sanctuary for lawlessness and crime on the day of an election peace and good order be more necessary than on any other day of the year on that day the humblest and feeble citizen the aged and the infirm should be and should have reason to feel that they be safe in the exercise of their most responsible duty and their most sacred right as member of society their duty and their right to vote the constitutional authority to regulate the congressional election which belong to the government of the united states and which it be necessary to exert to secure the right to vote to every citizen possess the requisite qualification ought to be enforce by appropriate legislation so far from public opinion in any part of the country favor any relaxation of the authority of the government in the protection of election from violence and corruption i believe it demand great vigor both in the enactment and in the execution of the law frame for that purpose any oppression any partisan partiality which experience may have show in the working of exist law may well engage the careful attention both of congress and of the executive in their respective sphere of duty for the correction of these mischief as no congressional election occur until after the regular session of congress will have be hold there seem to be no public exigency that would preclude a seasonable consideration at that session of any administrative detail that might improve the present method design for the protection of all citizen in the complete and equal exercise of the right and power of the suffrage at such election but with my view both of the constitutionality and of the value of the exist law i can not approve any measure for their repeal except in connection with the enactment of other legislation which may reasonably be expect to afford wise and more efficient safeguard for free and honest congressional election


 june 23 1879
 hayes veto this appropriation bill designate by democrats which exclude implementation of election law fund



 to the house of representatives
 after careful examination of the bill entitle an act make appropriation for certain judicial expense i return it herewith to the house of representatives in which it originate with the follow objection to its approval
 the general purpose of the bill be to provide for certain judicial expense of the government for the fiscal year end june 30 1880 for which the sum of $ 2,690,000 be appropriate these appropriation be require to keep in operation the general function of the judicial department of the government and if this part of the bill stand alone there would be no objection to its approval it contain however other provision to which i desire respectfully to ask your attention
 at the present session of congress a majority of both house favor a repeal of the congressional election law embrace in title 26 of the revised statutes pass a measure for that purpose as part of a bill entitle an act make appropriation for the legislative executive and judicial expense of the government for the fiscal year end june 30 1880 and for other purpose unable to concur with congress in that measure on the 29th of may last i return the bill to the house of representatives in which it originate without my approval for that further consideration for which the constitution provide on reconsideration the bill be approve by less than two third of the house and fail to become a law the election law therefore remain valid enactment and the supreme law of the land bind not only upon all private citizen but also alike and equally binding upon all who be charge with the duty and responsibility of the legislative the executive and the judicial department of the government
 it be not seek by the bill before i to repeal the election law its object be to defeat their enforcement the last clause of the first section be as follow
 and no part of the money hereby appropriate be appropriate to pay any salary compensation fee or expense under or in virtue of title 26 of the revised statutes or of any provision of say title
 title 26 of the revised statutes refer to in the forego clause relate to the elective franchise and contain the law now in force regulate the congressional election
 the second section of the bill reach much far it be as follow
 sec 2 that the sum appropriate in this act for the person and public service embrace in its provision be in full for such person and public service for the fiscal year end june 30 1880 and no department or officer of the government shall during say fiscal year make any contract or incur any liability for the future payment of money under any of the provision of title 26 of the revised statutes of the united states authorize the appointment or payment of general or special deputy marshal for service in connection with election or on election day until an appropriation sufficient to meet such contract or pay such liability shall have first be make by law
 this section of the bill be intend to make an extensive and essential change in the exist law the follow be the provision of the statute on the same subject which be now in force
 sec 3679 no department of the government shall expend in any one fiscal year any sum in excess of appropriation make by congress for that fiscal year or involve the government in any contract for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriation
 sec 3732 no contract or purchase on behalf of the united states shall be make unless the same be authorize by law or be under an appropriation adequate to its fulfillment except in the war and navy departments for clothing subsistence forage fuel quarter or transportation which however shall not exceed the necessity of the current year
 the object of these section of the revised statutes be plain it be first to prevent any money from be expend unless appropriation have be make therefor and second to prevent the government from be bind by any contract not previously authorize by law except for certain necessary purpose in the war and navy departments
 under the exist law the failure of congress to make the appropriation require for the execution of the provision of the election law would not prevent their enforcement the right and duty to appoint the general and special deputy marshal which they provide for would still remain and the executive department of the government would also be empower to incur the requisite liability for their compensation but the second section of this bill contain a prohibition not find in any previous legislation its design be to render the election law inoperative and a dead letter during the next fiscal year it be seek to accomplish this by omit to appropriate money for their enforcement and by expressly prohibit any department or officer of the government from incur any liability under any of the provision of title 26 of the revised statutes authorize the appointment or payment of general or special deputy marshal for service on election day until an appropriation sufficient to pay such liability shall have first be make
 the president be call upon to give his affirmative approval to positive enactment which in effect deprive he of the ordinary and necessary mean of execute law still leave in the statute book and embrace within his constitutional duty to see that the law be execute if he approve the bill and thus give to such positive enactment the authority of law he participate in the curtailment of his mean of see that the law be faithfully execute while the obligation of the law and of his constitutional duty remain unimpaired
 the appointment of special deputy marshal be not make by the statute a spontaneous act of authority on the part of any executive or judicial officer of the government but be accord as a popular right of the citizen to call into operation this agency for secure the purity and freedom of election in any city or town have 20,000 inhabitant or upward section 2021 of the revised statutes put it in the power of any two citizen of such city or town to require of the marshal of the district the appointment of these special deputy marshal thereupon the duty of the marshal become imperative and its nonperformance would expose he to judicial mandate or punishment or to removal from office by the president as the circumstance of his conduct might require the bill now before i neither revoke this popular right of the citizen nor relieve the marshal of the duty impose by law nor the president of his duty to see that this law be faithfully execute
 i forbear to enter again upon any general discussion of the wisdom and necessity of the election law or of the dangerous and unconstitutional principle of this bill that the power vest in congress to originate appropriation involve the right to compel the executive to approve any legislation which congress may see fit to attach to such bill under the penalty of refuse the mean need to carry on essential function of the government my view on these subject have be sufficiently present in the special message send by i to the house of representatives during their present session what be say in those message i regard as conclusive as to my duty in respect to the bill before i the argument urge in those communication against the repeal of the election law and against the right of congress to deprive the executive of that separate and independent discretion and judgment which the constitution confer and require be equally cogent in opposition to this bill this measure leave the power and duty of the supervisor of election untouched the compensation of those officer be provide for under permanent law and no liability for which an appropriation be now require would therefore be incur by their appointment but the power of the national government to protect they in the discharge of their duty at the poll would be take away the states may employ both civil and military power at the election but by this bill even the civil authority to protect congressional election be deny to the united states the object be to prevent any adequate control by the united states over the national election by forbid the payment of deputy marshal the officer who be clothe with authority to enforce the election law
 the fact that these law be deem objectionable by a majority of both houses of congress be urge as a sufficient warrant for this legislation
 there be two lawful way to overturn legislative enactment one be their repeal the other be the decision of a competent tribunal against their validity the effect of this bill be to deprive the executive department of the government of the mean to execute law which be not repeal which have not be declare invalid and which it be therefore the duty of the executive and of every other department of government to obey and to enforce
 i have in my former message on this subject express a willingness to concur in suitable amendment for the improvement of the election law but i can not consent to their absolute and entire repeal and i can not approve legislation which seek to prevent their enforcement

fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives the member of the forty sixth congress have assemble in their first regular session under circumstance call for mutual congratulation and grateful acknowledgment to the giver of all good for the large and unusual measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy the most interesting event which have occur in our public affair since my last annual message to congress be connect with the financial operation of the government directly affect the business interest of the country i congratulate congress on the successful execution of the resumption act at the time fix and in the manner contemplate by law united states note begin to be redeem in coin since the 1st of january last they have be promptly redeem on presentation and in all business transaction public and private in all part of the country they be receive and pay out as the equivalent of coin the demand upon the treasury for gold and silver in exchange for united states note have be comparatively small and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion in exchange for note have be very large the excess of the precious metal deposit or exchange for united states note over the amount of united states note redeem be about $ 40,000,000.the resumption of specie payment have be follow by a very great revival of business with a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world we be enable to enter upon an equal competition with other nation in trade and production the increase foreign demand for our manufacture and agricultural product have cause a large balance of trade in our favor which have be pay in gold from the 1st of july last to november 15 to the amount of about $ 59,000,000 since the resumption of specie payment there have also be a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit the bond of the government bear only 4 per cent interest have be sell at or above par sufficient in amount to pay off all of the national debt which be redeemable under present law the amount of interest save annually by the process of refund the debt since march 1 1877 be $ 14,297,177 the bond sell be largely in small sum and the number of our citizen now hold the public security be much great than ever before the amount of the national debt which mature within less than two year be $ 792,121,700 of which $ 500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent and the balance be in bond bear 6 per cent interest it be believe that this part of the public debt can be refund by the issue of 4 per cent bond and by the reduction of interest which will thus be effect about $ 11,000,000 can be annually save to the treasury to secure this important reduction of interest to be pay by the united states further legislation be require which it be hope will be provide by congress during its present session the coinage of gold by the mint of the united states during the last fiscal year be $ 40,986,912 the coinage of silver dollar since the passage of the act for that purpose up to november 1 1879 be $ 45,000,850 of which $ 12,700,344 have be issue from the treasury and be now in circulation and $ 32,300,506 be still in the possession of the government the pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the united states and the principal commercial nation of europe to effect a permanent system for the equality of gold and silver in the recognize money of the world lead i to recommend that congress refrain from new legislation on the general subject the great revival of trade internal and foreign will supply during the come year its own instruction which may well be await before attempt further experimental measure with the coinage i would however strongly urge upon congress the importance of authorize the secretary of the treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollar upon the present legal ratio the market value of the silver dollar be uniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar it be obviously impracticable to maintain they at par with each other if both be coin without limit if the cheap coin be force into circulation it will if coin without limit soon become the sole standard of value and thus defeat the desire object which be a currency of both gold and silver which shall be of equivalent value dollar for dollar with the universally recognize money of the world the retirement from circulation of united states note with the capacity of legal tender in private contract be a step to be take in our progress toward a safe and stable currency which should be accept as the policy and duty of the government and the interest and security of the people it be my firm conviction that the issue of legal tender paper money base wholly upon the authority and credit of the government except in extreme emergency be without warrant in the constitution and a violation of sound financial principle the issue of united states note during the late civil war with the capacity of legal tender between private individual be not authorize except as a means of rescue the country from imminent peril the circulation of these note as paper money for any protract period of time after the accomplishment of this purpose be not contemplate by the framer of the law under which they be issue they anticipate the redemption and withdrawal of these note at the early practicable period consistent with the attainment of the object for which they be provide the policy of the united states steadily adhere to from the adoption of the constitution have be to avoid the creation of a national debt and when from necessity in time of war debt have be create they have be pay off on the return of peace as rapidly as possible with this view and for this purpose it be recommend that the exist law for the accumulation of a sink fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period be maintain if any change of the object or rate of taxation be deem necessary by congress it be suggest that experience have show that a duty can be place on tea and coffee which will not enhance the price of those article to the consumer and which will add several million of dollar annually to the treasury the continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and influential citizen of the territory of utah of the law of the united states for the prosecution and punishment of polygamy demand the attention of every department of the government this territory have a population sufficient to entitle it to admission as a state and the general interest of the nation as well as the welfare of the citizen of the territory require its advance from the territorial form of government to the responsibility and privilege of a state this important change will not however be approve by the country while the citizen of utah in very considerable number uphold a practice which be condemn as a crime by the law of all civilized community throughout the world the law for the suppression of this offense be enact with great unanimity by congress more than seventeen year ago but have remain until recently a dead letter in the territory of utah because of the peculiar difficulty attend its enforcement the opinion widely prevail among the citizen of utah that the law be in contravention of the constitutional guaranty of religious freedom this objection be now remove the supreme court of the united states have decide the law to be within the legislative power of congress and bind as a rule of action for all who reside within the territories there be no long any reason for delay or hesitation in its enforcement it should be firmly and effectively execute if not sufficiently stringent in its provision it should be amend and in aid of the purpose in view i recommend that more comprehensive and more searching method for prevent as well as punish this crime be provide if necessary to secure obedience to the law the enjoyment and exercise of the right and privilege of citizenship in the territories of the united states may be withhold or withdraw from those who violate or oppose the enforcement of the law on this subject the election of the past year though occupy only with state officer have not fail to elicit in the political discussion which attend they all over the country new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citizen take in the progress of the country toward a more general and complete establishment at whatever cost of universal security and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise while many topic of political concern demand great attention from our people both in the sphere of national and state authority i find no reason to qualify the opinion i express in my last annual message that no temporary or administrative interest of government however urgent or weighty will ever displace the zeal of our people in defense of the primary right of citizenship and that the power of public opinion will override all political prejudice and all sectional and state attachment in demand that all over our wide territory the name and character of citizen of the united states shall mean one and the same thing and carry with they unchallenged security and respect i earnestly appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of all good citizen of every part of the country however much they maybe divide in opinion on other political subject to unite in compelling obedience to exist law aim at the protection of the right of suffrage i respectfully urge upon congress to supply any defect in these law which experience have show and which it be within its power to remedy i again invoke the cooperation of the executive and legislative authority of the states in this great purpose i be fully convinced that if the public mind can be set at rest on this paramount question of popular right no serious obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacification of the country or retard the general diffusion of prosperity in a former message i invite the attention of congress to the subject of the reformation of the civil service of the government and express the intention of transmit to congress as early as practicable a report upon this subject by the chairman of the civil service commission in view of the fact that during a considerable period the government of great britain have be deal with administrative problem and abuse in various particular analogous to those present in this country and that in recent year the measure adopt be understand to have be effective and in every respect highly satisfactory i think it desirable to have full information upon the subject and accordingly request the chairman of the civil service commission to make a thorough investigation for this purpose the result have be an elaborate and comprehensive report the report set forth the history of the partisan spoil system in great britain and of the rise and fall of the parliamentary patronage and of official interference with the freedom of election it show that after long trial of various kind of examination those which be competitive and open on equal term to all and which be carry on under the superintendence of a single commission have with great advantage be establish as condition of admission to almost every official place in the subordinate administration of that country and of british india the completion of the report owe to the extent of the labor involve in its preparation and the omission of congress to make any provision either for the compensation or the expense of the commission have be postpone until the present time it be herewith transmit to congress while the reform measure of another government be of no authority for we they be entitle to influence to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to our institution and social life may commend they to our consideration the view i have heretofore express concern the defect and abuse in our civil administration remain unchanged except in so far as an enlarged experience have deepen my sense of the duty both of officer and of the people themselves to cooperate for their removal the grave evil and peril of a partisan spoil system of appointment to office and of office tenure be now generally recognize in the resolution of the great party in the report of departments in the debate and proceeding of congress in the message of executive the gravity of these evil have be point out and the need of their reform have be admit to command the necessary support every measure of reform must be base on common right and justice and must be compatible with the healthy existence of great party which be inevitable and essential in a free state when the people have approve a policy at a national election confidence on the part of the officer they have select and of the adviser who in accordance with our political institution should be consult in the policy which it be their duty to carry into effect be indispensable it be eminently proper that they should explain it before the people as well as illustrate its spirit in the performance of their official duty very different consideration apply to the great number of those who fill the subordinate place in the civil service their responsibility be to their superior in official position it be their duty to obey the legal instruction of those upon whom that authority be devolve and their good public service consist in the discharge of their function irrespective of partisan politic their duty be the same whatever party be in power and whatever policy prevail as a consequence it follow that their tenure of office should not depend on the prevalence of any policy or the supremacy of any party but should be determine by their capacity to serve the people most usefully quite irrespective of partisan interest the same consideration that should govern the tenure should also prevail in the appointment discipline and removal of these subordinate the authority of appointment and removal be not a perquisite which may be use to aid a friend or reward a partisan but be a trust to be exercise in the public interest under all the sanction which attend the obligation to apply the public fund only for public purpose every citizen have an equal right to the honor and profit of enter the public service of his country the only just ground of discrimination be the measure of character and capacity he have to make that service most useful to the people except in case where upon just and recognize principle as upon the theory of pension office and promotion be bestow as reward for past service their bestowal upon any theory which disregard personal merit be an act of injustice to the citizen as well as a breach of that trust subject to which the appointing power be hold in the light of these principle it become of great importance to provide just and adequate mean especially for every department and large administrative office where personal discrimination on the part of its head be not practicable for ascertain those qualification to which appointment and removal should have reference to fail to provide such mean be not only to deny the opportunity of ascertain the fact upon which the most righteous claim to office depend but of necessity to discourage all worthy aspirant by hand over appointment and removal to mere influence and favoritism if it be the right of the worthy claimant to gain the appointment and the interest of the people to bestow it upon he it would seem clear that a wise and just method of ascertain personal fitness for office must be an important and permanent function of every just and wise government it have long since become impossible in the great office for those have the duty of nomination and appointment to personally examine into the individual qualification of more than a small proportion of those seek office and with the enlargement of the civil service that proportion must continue to become less in the early year of the government the subordinate office be so few in number that it be quite easy for those make appointment and promotion to personally ascertain the merit of candidate party manager and method have not then become powerful agency of coercion hostile to the free and just exercise of the appoint power a large and responsible part of the duty of restore the civil service to the desire purity and efficiency rest upon the president and it be my purpose to do what be within my power to advance such prudent and gradual measure of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical change of system essential to make our administrative method satisfactory to a free and intelligent people by a proper exercise of authority it be in the power of the executive to do much to promote such a reform but it can not be too clearly understand that nothing adequate can be accomplish without cooperation on the part of congress and considerate and intelligent support among the people reform which challenge the generally accept theory of party and demand change in the method of departments be not the work of a day their permanent foundation must be lay in sound principle and in an experience which demonstrate their wisdom and expose the error of their adversary every worthy officer desire to make his official action a gain and an honor to his country but the people themselves far more than their officer in public station be interested in a pure economical and vigorous administration by law enact in 1853 and 1855 and now in substance incorporate in the revised statutes the practice of arbitrary appointment to the several subordinate grade in the great departments be condemn and examination as to capacity to be conduct by departmental board of examiner be provide for and make condition of admission to the public service these statute be a decision by congress that examination of some sort as to attainment and capacity be essential to the well being of the public service the important question since the enactment of these law have be as to the character of these examination and whether official favor and partisan influence or common right and merit be to control the access to the examination in practice these examination have not always be open to worthy person generally who might wish to be examine official favoritism and partisan influence as a rule appear to have designate those who alone be permit to go before the examine board subject even the examiner to a pressure from the friend of the candidate very difficult to resist as a consequence the standard of admission fall below that which the public interest demand it be also almost inevitable that a system which provide for various separate board of examiner with no common supervision or uniform method of procedure should result in confusion inconsistency and inadequate test of capacity highly detrimental to the public interest a further and more radical change be obviously require in the annual message of december 1870 my predecessor declare that there be no duty which so much embarrass the executive and head of departments as that of appointment nor be there any such arduous and thankless labor impose on senators and representatives as that of find place for constituent the present system do not secure the good man and often not even fit man for public place the elevation and purification of the civil service of the government will be hail with approval by the whole people of the united states congress accordingly pass the act approve march 3 1871 to regulate the civil service of the united states and promote the efficiency thereof give the necessary authority to the executive to inaugurate a civil service reform act under this statute which be interpret as intend to secure a system of just and effectual examination under uniform supervision a number of eminently competent person be select for the purpose who enter with zeal upon the discharge of their duty prepare with an intelligent appreciation of the requirement of the service the regulation contemplate and take charge of the examination and who in their capacity as a board have be know as the civil service commission congress for two year appropriate the money need for the compensation and for the expense of carry on the work of the commission it appear from the report of the commission submit to the president in april 1874 that examination have be hold in various section of the country and that an appropriation of about $ 25,000 would be require to meet the annual expense include salary involve in discharge the duty of the commission the report be transmit to congress by special message of april 18 1874 with the follow favorable comment upon the labor of the commission if sustain by congress i have no doubt the rule can after the experience gain be so improved and enforce as to still more materially benefit the public service and relieve the executive member of congress and the head of departments from influence prejudicial to good administration the rule as they have hitherto be enforce have result beneficially as be show by the opinion of the member of the cabinet and their subordinate in the departments and in that opinion i concur and in the annual message of december of the same year similar view be express and an appropriation for continue the work of the commission again advise the appropriation be not make and as a consequence the active work of the commission be suspend leave the commission itself still in existence without the mean therefore of cause qualification to be test in any systematic manner or of securing for the public service the advantage of competition upon any extensive plan i recommend in my annual message of december 1877 the making of an appropriation for the resumption of the work of the commission in the meantime however competitive examination under many embarrassment have be conduct within limited sphere in the executive departments in washington and in a number of the custom house and post office of the principal city of the country with a view to far test their effect and in every instance they have be find to be as salutary as they be state to have be under the administration of my predecessor i think the economy purity and efficiency of the public service would be greatly promote by their systematic introduction wherever practicable throughout the entire civil service of the government together with ample provision for their general supervision in order to secure consistency and uniform justice report from the secretary of the interior from the postmaster general from the postmaster in the city of new york where such examination have be some time on trial and also from the collector of the port the naval officer and the surveyor in that city and from the postmaster and collector in several of the other large city show that the competitive system where apply have in various way contribute to improve the public service the report show that the result have be salutary in a marked degree and that the general application of similar rule can not fail to be of decide benefit to the service the report of the government officer in the city of new york especially bear decide testimony to the utility of open competitive examination in their respective office show that these examination and the excellent qualification of those admit to the service through they have have a marked incidental effect upon the person previously in the service and particularly upon those aspire to promotion there have be on the part of these latter an increase interest in the work and a desire to extend acquaintance with it beyond the particular desk occupy and thus the morale of the entire force have be raise the examination have be attend by many citizen who have have an opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope and character of the test and the method of determine the result and those visitor have without exception approve the method employ and several of they have publicly attest their favorable opinion upon such consideration i deem it my duty to renew the recommendation contain in my annual message of december 1877 request congress to make the necessary appropriation for the resumption of the work of the civil service commission economy will be promote by authorize a moderate compensation to person in the public service who may perform extra labor upon or under the commission as the executive may direct i be convinced that if a just and adequate test of merit be enforce for admission to the public service and in make promotion such abuse as removal without good cause and partisan and official interference with the proper exercise of the appoint power will in large measure disappear there be other administrative abuse to which the attention of congress should be ask in this connection mere partisan appointment and the constant peril of removal without cause very naturally lead to an absorbing and mischievous political activity on the part of those thus appoint which not only interfere with the due discharge of official duty but be incompatible with the freedom of election not without warrant in the view of several of my predecessor in the presidential office and directly within the law of 1871 already cite i endeavor by regulation make on the 22d day of june 1877 to put some reasonable limit to such abuse it may not be easy and it may never perhaps be necessary to define with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of federal officer but while their right to hold and freely express their opinion can not be question it be very plain that they should neither be allow to devote to other subject the time need for the proper discharge of their official duty nor to use the authority of their office to enforce their own opinion or to coerce the political action of those who hold different opinion reason of justice and public policy quite analogous to those which forbid the use of official power for the oppression of the private citizen impose upon the government the duty of protect its officer and agent from arbitrary exaction in whatever aspect consider the practice of make levy for party purpose upon the salary of officer be highly demoralize to the public service and discreditable to the country though an officer should be as free as any other citizen to give his own money in aid of his opinion or his party he should also be as free as any other citizen to refuse to make such gift if salary be but a fair compensation for the time and labor of the officer it be gross injustice to levy a tax upon they if they be make excessive in order that they may bear the tax the excess be an indirect robbery of the public fund i recommend therefore such a revision and extension of present statute as shall secure to those in every grade of official life or public employment the protection with which a great and enlightened nation should guard those who be faithful in its service our relation with foreign country have continue peaceful with great britain there be still unsettled question grow out of the local law of the maritime province and the action of provincial authority deem to be in derogation of right secure by treaty to american fisherman the united states minister in london have be instruct to present a demand for $ 105,305.02 in view of the damage receive by american citizen at fortune bay on the 6th day of january 1878 the subject have be take into consideration by the british government and an early reply be anticipate upon the completion of the necessary preliminary examination the subject of our participation in the provincial fishery as regulate by treaty will at once be bring to the attention of the british government with a view to an early and permanent settlement of the whole question which be only temporarily adjust by the treaty of washington effort have be make to obtain the removal of restriction find injurious to the exportation of cattle to the united kingdom some correspondence have also occur with regard to the rescue and saving of life and property upon the lakes which have result in important modification of the previous regulation of the dominion government on the subject in the interest of humanity and commerce in accordance with the joint resolution of the last session of congress commissioner be appoint to represent the united states at the two international exhibition in australia one of which be now in progress at sydney and the other to be hold next year at melbourne a desire have be express by our merchant and manufacturer interested in the important and grow trade with australia that an increase provision should be make by congress for the representation of our industry at the melbourne exhibition of next year and the subject be respectfully submit to your favorable consideration the assent of the government have be give to the landing on the coast of massachusetts of a new and independent transatlantic cable between france by way of the french island of st. pierre and this country subject to any future legislation of congress on the subject the condition impose before allow this connection with our shore to be establish be such as to secure its competition with any exist or future line of marine cable and preclude amalgamation therewith to provide for entire equality of right to our government and people with those of france in the use of the cable and prevent any exclusive possession of the privilege as accord by france to the disadvantage of any future cable communication between france and the united states which may be project and accomplish by our citizen an important reduction of the present rate of cable communication with europe feel to be too burdensome to the interest of our commerce must necessarily flow from the establishment of this compete line the attention of congress be draw to the propriety of some general regulation by congress of the whole subject of transmarine cable by my predecessor in his message of december 7 1875 and i respectfully submit to your consideration the importance of congressional action in the matter the question of grave importance with spain grow out of the incident of the cuban insurrection have be for the most part happily and honorably settle it may reasonably be anticipate that the commission now sit in washington for the decision of private case in this connection will soon be able to bring its labor to a conclusion the long stand question of east florida claim have lately be renew as a subject of correspondence and may possibly require congressional action for its final disposition a treaty with the netherlands with respect to consular right and privilege similar to those with other power have be sign and ratify and the ratification be exchange on the 31st of july last negotiation for extradition treaty with the netherlands and with denmark be now in progress some question with switzerland in regard to pauper and convict emigrant have arise but it be not doubted that they will be arrange upon a just and satisfactory basis a question have also occur with respect to an asserted claim by swiss municipal authority to exercise tutelage over person and property of swiss citizen naturalize in this country it be possible this may require adjustment by treaty with the german empire frequent question arise in connection with the subject of naturalization and expatriation but the imperial government have constantly manifest a desire to strictly maintain and comply with all treaty stipulation in regard to they in consequence of the omission of congress to provide for a diplomatic representative at athens the legation to greece have be withdraw there be now no channel of diplomatic communication between the two country and the expediency of provide for one in some form be submit to congress relation with austria russia italy portugal turkey and belgium continue amicable and mark by no incident of especial importance a change of the personal head of the government of egypt have take place no change however have occur in the relation between egypt and the united states the action of the egyptian government in present to the city of new york one of the ancient obelisk which possess such historic interest be highly appreciated as a generous mark of international regard if prosperity should attend the enterprise of its transportation across the atlantic its erection in a conspicuous position in the chief commercial city of the nation will soon be accomplish the treaty recently make between japan and the united states in regard to the revision of former commercial treaty it be now believe will be follow by similar action on the part of other treaty power the attention of congress be again invite to the subject of the indemnity fund receive some year since from japan and china which with their accumulate interest now amount to considerable sum if any part of these fund be justly due to american citizen they should receive it promptly and whatever may have be receive by this government in excess of strictly just demand should in some form be return to the nation to whom it equitably belong the government of china have signify its willingness to consider the question of the emigration of its subject to the united states with a dispassionate fairness and to cooperate in such measure as may tend to prevent injurious consequence to the united states the negotiation be still proceed and will be press with diligence a question having arise between china and japan about the lew chew islands the united states government have take measure to inform those power of its readiness to extend its good office for the maintenance of peace if they shall mutually deem it desirable and find it practicable to avail themselves of the proffer it be a gratification to be able to announce that through the judicious and energetic action of the military commander of the two nation on each side of the rio grande under the instruction of their respective government raid and depredation have greatly decrease and in the locality where formerly most destructive have now almost wholly cease in view of this result i entertain a confident expectation that the prevalence of quiet on the border will soon become so assured as to justify a modification of the present order to our military commander as to cross the border without encourage such disturbance as would endanger the peace of the two country the third installment of the award against mexico under the claim commission of july 4 1868 be duly pay and have be put in course of distribution in pursuance of the act of congress provide for the same this satisfactory situation between the two country lead i to anticipate an expansion of our trade with mexico and an increase contribution of capital and industry by our people to the development of the great resource of that country i earnestly commend to the wisdom of congress the provision of suitable legislation look to this result diplomatic intercourse with colombia be again fully restore by the arrival of a minister from that country to the united states this be especially fortunate in view of the fact that the question of an inter oceanic canal have recently assume a new and important aspect and be now under discussion with the central american country through whose territory the canal by the nicaragua route would have to pass it be trust that enlighten statesmanship on their part will see that the early prosecution of such a work will largely inure to the benefit not only of their own citizen and those of the united states but of the commerce of the civilized world it be not doubted that should the work be undertake under the protective auspex of the united states and upon satisfactory concession for the right of way and its security by the central american governments the capital for its completion would be readily furnish from this country and europe which might fail such guaranty prove inaccessible diplomatic relation with chile have also be strengthen by the reception of a minister from that country the war between peru bolivia and chile still continue the united states have not deem it proper to interpose in the matter far than to convey to all the government concern the assurance that the friendly office of the government of the united states for the restoration of peace upon an honorable basis will be extend in case the belligerent shall exhibit a readiness to accept they cordial relation continue with brazil and the argentine republic and trade with those country be improve a provision for regular and more frequent mail communication in our own ship between the port of this country and the nation of south america seem to i to deserve the attention of congress as an essential precursor of an enlargement of our commerce with they and an extension of our carry trade a recent revolution in venezuela have be follow by the establishment of a provisional government this government have not yet be formally recognize and it be deem desirable to await the propose action of the people which be expect to give it the sanction of constitutional form a naval vessel have be send to the samoan islands to make survey and take possession of the privilege cede to the united states by samoa in the harbor of pago pago a coaling station be to be establish there which will be convenient and useful to united states vessel the subject of open diplomatic relation with roumania and servia now become independent sovereignty be at present under consideration and be the subject of diplomatic correspondence there be a gratifying increase of trade with nearly all european and american country and it be believe that with judicious action in regard to its development it can and will be still more enhanced and that american product and manufacture will find new and expand market the report of diplomatic and consular officer upon this subject under the system now adopt have result in obtain much valuable information which have be and will continue to be lay before congress and the public

the uncivilized tribe be subject to such law and regulation as the united states may from time to time adopt in regard to the aboriginal tribe of that country both the obligation of this treaty and the necessity of the people require that some organized form of government over the territory of alaska be adopt there appear to be no law for the arrest of person charge with common law offense such as assault robbery and murder and no magistrate authorize to issue or execute process in such case serious difficulty have already arise from offense of this character not only among the original

suppression of hostility among the indians of the ute and apache tribe and praise be justly award to the officer and troop engage for promptness skill and courage display the past year have be one of almost unbroken peace and quiet on the mexican frontier and there be reason to believe that the effort of this government and of mexico to maintain order in that region will prove permanently successful this department be enable during the past year to find temporary though crowd accommodation and a safe depository for a portion of its record in the complete east wing of the building design for the state war and navy departments the construction of the north wing of the building a part of the structure intend for the use of the war department be be carry forward with all possible dispatch and the work should receive from congress such liberal appropriation as will secure its speedy completion the report of the secretary of the navy show continued improvement in that branch of the service during the last fiscal year extensive repair have be make upon vessel and two new ship have be complete and make ready for sea the total expenditure of the year end june 30 1879 include specific appropriation not estimate for by the department be $ 13,555,710.09 the expense chargeable to the year after deduct the amount of these specific appropriation be $ 13,343,317.79 but this be subject to a reduction of $ 283,725.99 that amount having be draw upon warrant but not pay out during the year the amount of appropriation applicable to the last fiscal year be $ 14,538,646.17 there be therefore a balance of $ 1,479,054.37 remain unexpended and to the credit of the department on june 30 1879 the estimate for the fiscal year end june 30 1881 be $ 14,864,147.95 which exceed the appropriation for the present fiscal year $ 361,897.28 the reason for this increase be explain in the secretary 's report the appropriation available for the present fiscal year be $ 14,502,250.67 which will in the opinion of the secretary answer all the ordinary demand of the service the amount draw from the treasury from july 1 to november 1 1879 be $ 5,770,404.12 of which $ 1,095,440.33 have be refund leave as the expenditure for that period $ 4,674,963.79 if the expenditure of the remain two third of the year do not exceed the proportion for these four month there will remain unexpended at the end of the year $ 477,359.30 of the current appropriation the report of the secretary show the gratifying fact that among all the disburse officer of the pay corps of the navy there be not one who be a defaulter to the extent of a single dollar i unite with he in recommend the removal of the observatory to a more healthful location that institution reflect credit upon the nation and have obtain the approbation of scientific man in all part of the world its removal from its present location would not only be conducive to the health of its officer and professor but would greatly increase its usefulness the appropriation for judicial expense which have heretofore be make for the department of justice in gross be subdivide at the last session of congress and no appropriation whatever be make for the payment of the fee of marshal and their deputy either in the service of process or for the discharge of other duty and since june 30 these officer have continue the performance of their duty without compensation from the government take upon themselves the necessary incidental outlay as well as render their own service in only a few unavoidable instance have the proper execution of the process of the united states fail by reason of the absence of the requisite appropriation this course of official conduct on the part of these officer highly creditable to their fidelity be advise by the attorney general who inform they however that they would necessarily have to rely for their compensation upon the prospect of future legislation by congress i therefore especially recommend that immediate appropriation be make by congress for this purpose the act make the principal appropriation for the department of justice at previous session have uniformly contain the follow clause and for defray the expense which my be incur in the enforcement of the act approve february 28 1871 entitle an act to amend an act approve may 31 1870 entitle an act to enforce the right of citizen of the united states to vote in the several states of this union and for other purpose or any act amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto no appropriation be make for this purpose for the current year as no general election for member of congress occur the omission be a matter of little practical importance such election will however take place during the ensue year and the appropriation make for the pay of marshal and deputy should be sufficient to embrace compensation for the service they may be require to perform at such election the business of the supreme court be at present largely in arrear it can not be expect that more cause can be decide than be now disposed of in its annual session or that by any assiduity the distinguished magistrate who compose the court can accomplish more than be now do in the court of many of the circuit also the business have increase to such an extent that the delay of justice will call the attention of congress to an appropriate remedy it be believe that all be do in each circuit which can fairly be expect from its judicial force the evil arise from delay be less heavily feel by the united states than by private suitor as its cause be advance by the court when it be see that they involve the discussion of question of a public character the remedy suggest by the attorney general be the appointment of additional circuit judge and the creation of an intermediate court of error and appeal which shall relieve the supreme court of a part of its jurisdiction while a large force be also obtain for the performance of circuit duty i commend this suggestion to the consideration of congress it would seem to afford a complete remedy and would involve if ten additional circuit judge be appoint an expenditure at the present rate of salary of not more than $ 60,000 a year which would certainly be small in comparison with the object to be attain the report of the postmaster general bear testimony to the general revival of business throughout the country the receipt of the post office department for the fiscal year end june 30 1879 be $ 30,041,982.86 be $ 764,465.91 more than the revenue of the precede year the amount realize from the sale of postage stamp stamp envelope and postal card be $ 764,465.91 more than in the precede year and $ 2,387,559.23 more than in 1877 the expenditure of the department be $ 33,449,899.45 of which the sum of $ 376,461.63 be pay on liability incur in precede year the expenditure during the year be $ 801,209.77 less than in the precede year this reduction be to be attribute mainly to the operation of the law pass june 17 1878 change the compensation of postmaster from a commission on the value of stamp sell to a commission on stamp cancel the amount draw from the treasury on appropriation in addition to the revenue of the department be $ 3,031,454.96 be $ 2,276,197.86 less than in the precede year the expenditure for the fiscal year end june 30 1881 be estimate at $ 39,920,900 and the receipt from all source at $ 32,210,000 leave a deficiency to be appropriate for out of the treasury of $ 7,710,900.the relation of the department with railroad company have be harmonize notwithstanding the general reduction by congress of their compensation by the appropriation for special facility and the railway post office line have be greatly extend especially in the southern states the interest of the railway mail service and of the public would be greatly promote and the expenditure could be more readily control by the classification of the employee of the railway mail service as recommend by the postmaster general the appropriation for salary with respect to which the maximum limit be already fix by law to be make in gross the postmaster general recommend an amendment of the law regulate the increase of compensation for increase service and increase speed on star route so as to enable he to advertise for proposal for such increase service and speed he also suggest the advantage to accrue to the commerce of the country from the enactment of a general law authorize contract with american build steamer carry the american flag for transport the mail between port of the united states and port of the west indies and south america at a fix maximum price per mile the amount to be expend be regulate by annual appropriation in like manner with the amount pay for the domestic star service the arrangement make by the postmaster general and the secretary of the treasury for the collection of duty upon book receive in the mail from foreign country have prove so satisfactory in its practical operation that the recommendation be now make that congress shall extend the provision of the act of march 3 1879 under which this arrangement be make so as to apply to all other dutiable article receive in the mail from foreign country the report of the secretary of the interior and of the commissioner of indian affairs set forth the present state of our relation with the indian tribe on our territory the measure take to advance their civilization and prosperity and the progress already achieve by they will be find of more than ordinary interest the general conduct of our indian population have be so satisfactory that the occurrence of two disturbance which result in bloodshed and destruction of property be all the more to be lament the history of the outbreak on the white river ute reservation in western colorado have become so familiar by elaborate report in the public press that its remarkable incident need not be state here in detail it be expect that the settlement of this difficulty will lead to such arrangement as will prevent further hostile contact between the indians and the border settlement in western colorado the other disturbance occur at the mescalero agency in new mexico where victoria at the head of a small band of marauder after commit many atrocity be vigorously chase by a military force make his way across the mexican border and be now on foreign soil while these occurrence in which a comparatively small number of indians be engage be most deplorable a vast majority of our indian population have fully justify the expectation of those who believe that by humane and peaceful influence the indian can be lead to abandon the habit of savage life and to develop a capacity for useful and civilized occupation what they have already accomplish in the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work the remarkable success which have attend the experiment of employing as freighter a class of indians hitherto count among the wild and most intractable and the general and urgent desire express by they for the education of their child may be take as sufficient proof that they will be find capable of accomplish much more if they continue to be wisely and fairly guide the indian policy sketch in the report of the secretary of the interior the object of which be to make liberal provision for the education of indian youth to settle the indians upon farm lot in severalty to give they title in fee to their farm inalienable for a certain number of year and when their want be thus provide for to dispose by sale of the land on their reservation not occupy and use by they a fund to be form out of the proceed for the benefit of the indians which will gradually relieve the government of the expense now provide for by annual appropriation must commend itself as just and beneficial to the indians and as also calculate to remove those obstruction which the existence of large reservation present to the settlement and development of the country i therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law enable the government to give indians a title in fee inalienable for twenty five year to the farm land assign to they by allotment i also repeat the recommendation make in my first annual message that a law be pass admit indians who can give satisfactory proof of have by their own labor support their family for a number of year and who be willing to detach themselves from their tribal relation to the benefit of the homestead act and to grant they patent contain the same provision of inalienability for a certain period the experiment of send a number of indian child of both sex to the hampton normal and agricultural institute in virginia to receive an elementary english education and practical instruction in farming and other useful industry have lead to result so promise that it be think expedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at carlisle in pennsylvania to the interior department for the establishment of an indian school on a large scale this school have now 158 pupil select from various tribe and be in full operation arrangement be also make for the education of a number of indian boy and girl belong to tribe on the pacific slope in a similar manner at forest grove in oregon these institution will commend themselves to the liberality of congress and to the philanthropic munificence of the american people last spring information be receive of the organization of an extensive movement in the western states the object of which be the occupation by unauthorized person of certain land in the indian territory cede by the cherokees to the government for the purpose of settlement by other indian tribe on the 26th of april i issue a proclamation warn all person against participation in such an attempt and by the cooperation of a military force the invasion be promptly check it be my purpose to protect the right of the indian inhabitant of that territory to the full extent of the executive power but it would be unwise to ignore the fact that a territory so large and so fertile with a population so sparse and with so great a wealth of unused resource will be find more expose to the repetition of such attempt as happen this year when the surround state be more densely settle and the westward movement of our population look still more eagerly for fresh land to occupy under such circumstance the difficulty of maintain the indian territory in its present state will greatly increase and the indian tribe inhabit it would do well to prepare for such a contingency i therefore fully approve of the advice give to they by the secretary of the interior on a recent occasion to divide among themselves in severalty as large a quantity of their land as they can cultivate to acquire individual title in fee instead of their present tribal ownership in common and to consider in what manner the balance of their land may be dispose of by the government for their benefit by adopt such a policy they would more certainly secure for themselves the value of their possession and at the same time promote their progress in civilization and prosperity than by endeavor to perpetuate the present state of thing in the territory the question whether a change in the control of the indian service should be make be in the forty fifth congress refer to a joint committee of both houses for inquiry and report in my last annual message i express the hope that the decision of that question then in prospect would arrest further agitation of this subject such agitation be apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as on the indians themselves since then the committee having report the question have be decide in the negative by a vote in the house of representatives for the reason here state and in view of the fact that further uncertainty on this point will be calculate to obstruct other much need legislation to weaken the discipline of the service and to unsettle salutary measure now in progress for the government and improvement of the indians i respectfully recommend that the decision arrive at by congress at its last session be permit to stand the effort make by the department of the interior to arrest the depredation on the timber land of the united states have be continue and have meet with considerable success a large number of case of trespass have be prosecute in the court of the united states other have be settle the trespasser offer to make payment to the government for the value of the timber take by they the proceed of these prosecution and settlement turn into the treasury far exceed in amount the sum appropriate by congress for this purpose a more important result however consist in the fact that the destruction of our public forest by depredation although such case still occur have be greatly reduce in extent and it be probable that if the present policy be vigorously pursue and sufficient provision to that end be make by congress such trespass at least those on a large scale can be entirely suppress except in the territories where timber for the daily requirement of the population can not under the present state of the law be otherwise obtain i therefore earnestly invite the attention of congress to the recommendation make by the secretary of the interior that a law be enact enable the government to sell timber from the public land without convey the fee where such land be principally valuable for the timber thereon such sale to be so regulated as to conform to domestic want and business requirement while at the same time guard against a sweeping destruction of the forest the enactment of such a law appear to become a more pressing necessity every day my recommendation in former message be renew in favor of enlarge the facility of the department of agriculture agriculture be the lead interest and the permanent industry of our people it be to the abundance of agricultural production as compare with our home consumption and the largely increased and highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoy in recent year that we be mainly indebted for our present prosperity as a people we must look for its continue maintenance to the same substantial resource there be no branch of industry in which labor direct by scientific knowledge yield such increase production in comparison with unskilled labor and no branch of the public service to which the encouragement of liberal appropriation can be more appropriately extended the omission to render such aid be not a wise economy but on the contrary undoubtedly result in loss of immense sum annually that might be save through well direct effort by the government to promote this vital interest the result already accomplish with the very limited means heretofore place at the command of the department of agriculture be an earnest of what may be expect with increase appropriation for the several purpose indicate in the report of the commissioner with a view to place the department upon a footing which will enable it to prosecute more effectively the object for which it be establish appropriation be need for a more complete laboratory for the establishment of a veterinary division and a division of forestry and for an increase of force the requirement for these and other purpose indicate in the report of the commissioner under the head of the immediate necessity of the department will not involve any expenditure of money that the country can not with propriety now undertake in the interest of agriculture it be gratify to learn from the bureau of education the extent to which educational privilege throughout the united states have be advance during the year no more fundamental responsibility rest upon congress than that of devise appropriate measure of financial aid to education supplemental to local action in the states and territories and in the district of columbia the wise forethought of the founder of our government have not only furnish the basis for the support of the common school system of the new state but lay the foundation for the maintenance of their university and college of agriculture and the mechanic art measure in accordance with this traditional policy for the further benefit of all these interest and the extension of the same advantage to every portion of the country it be hope will receive your favorable consideration to preserve and perpetuate the national literature should be among the foremost care of the national legislature the library gather at the capitol still remain unprovided with any suitable accommodation for its rapidly increase store the magnitude and importance of the collection increase as it be by the deposit make under the law of copyright by domestic and foreign exchange and by the scientific library of the smithsonian institution call for building accommodation which shall be at once adequate and fireproof the location of such a public building which should provide for the press necessity of the present and for the vast increase of the nation 's book in the future be a matter which address itself to the discretion of congress it be earnestly recommend as a measure which should unite all suffrage and which should no long be delay the joint commission create by the act of congress of august 2 1876 for the purpose of supervise and direct the completion of the washington national monument of which commission the president be a member have give careful attention to this subject and already the strengthening of the foundation have so far progress as to insure the entire success of this part of the work a massive layer of masonry have be introduce below the original foundation widen the base increase the stability of the structure and render it possible to carry the shaft to completion it be earnestly recommend that such further appropriation be make for the continue prosecution of the work as may be necessary for the completion of this national monument at an early day in former message impress with the importance of the subject i have take occasion to commend to congress the adoption of a generous policy toward the district of columbia the report of the commissioners of the district herewith transmit contain suggestion and recommendation to all of which i earnestly invite your careful attention i ask your early and favorable consideration of the view which they express as to the urgent need of legislation for the reclamation of the marsh of the potomac and its eastern branch within the limit of the city and for the repair of the street of the capital heretofore lay with wooden block and now by decay render almost impassable and a source of imminent danger to the health of its citizen the mean at the disposal of the commissioners be wholly inadequate for the accomplishment of these important work and should be supplement by timely appropriation from the federal treasury the filling of the flat in front of the city will add to the adjacent land and park now own by the united states a large and valuable domain sufficient it be think to reimburse its entire cost and will also as an incidental result secure the permanent improvement of the river for the purpose of navigation the constitution having invest congress with supreme and exclusive jurisdiction over the district of columbia its citizen must of necessity look to congress alone for all needful legislation affect their interest and as the territory of this district be the common property of the people of the united states who equally with its resident citizen be interested in the prosperity of their capital i can not doubt that you will be amply sustain by the general voice of the country in any measure you may adopt for this purpose i also invite the favorable consideration of congress to the want of the public school of this district as exhibit in the report of the commissioners while the number of pupil be rapidly increase no adequate provision exist for a corresponding increase of school accommodation and the commissioners be without the mean to meet this urgent need a number of the building now use for school purpose be rent and be in important particular unsuited for the purpose the cause of popular education in the district of columbia be surely entitle to the same consideration at the hand of the national government as in the several states and territories to which munificent grant of the public land have be make for the endowment of school and university
to the senate
 i transmit herewith the report of the secretary of state and the accompany paper in response to the resolution adopt by the senate on the 11th day of february last request copy of all correspondence between this government and any foreign government since february 1869 respect a ship canal across the isthmus between north america and south america together with copy of any projet of treaty respect the same which the department of state may have propose or submit since that date to any foreign power or its diplomatic representative
 in further compliance with the resolution of the senate i deem it proper to state briefly my opinion as to the policy of the united states with respect to the construction of an interoceanic canal by any route across the american isthmus
 the policy of this country be a canal under american control the united states can not consent to the surrender of this control to any european power or to any combination of european power if exist treaty between the united states and other nation or if the right of sovereignty or property of other nation stand in the way of this policy a contingency which be not apprehend suitable step should be take by just and liberal negotiation to promote and establish the american policy on this subject consistently with the right of the nation to be affect by it
 the capital invest by corporation or citizen of other country in such an enterprise must in a great degree look for protection to one or more of the great power of the world no european power can intervene for such protection without adopt measure on this continent which the united states would deem wholly inadmissible if the protection of the united states be rely upon the united states must exercise such control as will enable this country to protect its national interest and maintain the right of those whose private capital be embark in the work
 an interoceanic canal across the american isthmus will essentially change the geographical relation between the atlantic and pacific coast of the united states and between the united states and the rest of the world it would be the great ocean thoroughfare between our atlantic and our pacific shore and virtually a part of the coast line of the united states our merely commercial interest in it be great than that of all other country while its relation to our power and prosperity as a nation to our mean of defense our unity peace and safety be matter of paramount concern to the people of the united states no other great power would under similar circumstance fail to assert a rightful control over a work so closely and vitally affect its interest and welfare
 without urge far the ground of my opinion i repeat in conclusion that it be the right and the duty of the united states to assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connect north and south america as will protect our national interest this i be quite sure will be find not only compatible with but promotive of the wide and most permanent advantage to commerce and civilization

 the supreme court of the united states in the recent case of ex parte siebold and other decide at the october term 1879 on the question raise in the case as to the constitutionality of the section of the revised statutes above quote use the follow language
 these portion of the revised statutes be take from the act commonly know as the enforcement act approve may 31 1870 and entitle an act to enforce the right of citizen of the united states to vote in the several states of this union and for other purpose and from the supplement to that act approve february 28 1871 they relate to election of member of the house of representatives and be an assertion on the part of congress of a power to pass law for regulate and superintending say election and for secure the purity thereof and the right of citizen to vote thereat peaceably and without molestation
 it must be concede to be a most important power and of a fundamental character in the light of recent history and of the violence fraud corruption and irregularity which have frequently prevail at such election it may easily be conceive that the exertion of the power if it exist may be necessary to the stability of our form of government
 the great difficulty in come to a just conclusion arise from mistaken notion with regard to the relation which subsist between the state and national governments
 it seem to be often overlook that a national constitution have be adopt in this country establish a real government therein operate upon person and territory and thing and which moreover be or should be as dear to every american citizen as his state government be whenever the true conception of the nature of this government be once concede no real difficulty will arise in the just interpretation of its power but if we allow ourselves to regard it as a hostile organization oppose to the proper sovereignty and dignity of the state government we shall continue to be vex with difficulty as to its jurisdiction and authority no great jealousy be require to be exercise toward this government in reference to the preservation of our liberty than be proper to be exercise toward the state government its power be limit in number and clearly define and its action within the scope of those power be restrain by a sufficiently rigid bill of right for the protection of its citizen from oppression the true interest of the people of this country require that both the national and state government should be allow without jealous interference on either side to exercise all the power which respectively belong to they accord to a fair and practical construction of the constitution state right and the right of the united states should be equally respect both be essential to the preservation of our liberty and the perpetuity of our institution but in endeavor to vindicate the one we should not allow our zeal to nullify or impair the other
 the true doctrine as we conceive be this that while the states be really sovereign as to all matter which have not be grant to the jurisdiction and control of the united states the constitution and constitutional law of the latter be as we have already say the supreme law of the land and when they conflict with the law of the states they be of paramount authority and obligation this be the fundamental principle on which the authority of the constitution be base and unless it be concede in practice as well as theory the fabric of our institution as it be contemplate by its founder can not stand the question involve have respect not more to the autonomy and existence of the states than to the continued existence of the united states as a government to which every american citizen may look for security and protection in every part of the land
 why do we have marshal at all if they can not physically lay their hand on person and thing in the performance of their proper duty what function can they perform if they can not use force in execute the process of the court must they call on the near constable for protection must they rely on he to use the requisite compulsion and to keep the peace while they be solicit and entreat the party and bystander to allow the law to take its course this be the necessary consequence of the position that be assume if we indulge in such impracticable view as these and keep on refining and re refining we shall drive the national government out of the united states and relegate it to the district of columbia or perhaps to some foreign soil we shall bring it back to a condition of great helplessness than that of the old confederation
 the argument be base on a strained and impracticable view of the nature and power of the national government it must execute its power or it be no government it must execute they on the land as well as on the sea on thing as well as on person and to do this it must necessarily have power to command obedience preserve order and keep the peace and no person or power in this land have the right to resist or question its authority so long as it keep within the bound of its jurisdiction
 i have deem it fitting and proper to quote thus largely from an important and elaborate opinion of the supreme court because the bill before i proceed upon a construction of the constitution as to the power of the national government which be in direct conflict with the judgment of the high judicial tribunal of our country
 under the section of the present law above quote officer of the united states be authorize and it be their duty in the case of congressional election to keep the peace at the poll and at the place of registration to arrest immediately any person who be guilty of crime against the united states election law to protect all officer of election in the performance of their duty and whenever an arrest be make to bring the person so arrest before a commissioner judge or court of the united states for examination of the offense allege against he such special deputy marshal as be specially empower thereto by the marshal in writing if forcibly resist may call to their aid the bystander or posse comitatus it be make a crime punishable with fine or imprisonment to hinder assault or otherwise interfere with the marshal or his special deputy or to threaten or to attempt so to do if any person appoint such special deputy marshal have take the oath of office and thereafter neglect or refuse to fully discharge the duty of such office he be punishable not only by removal from office but by fine and imprisonment the function of the special deputy marshal now provide for by law be executive they be place under the authority of the well know chief executive officer of the court of the united states they be in fact and not merely in name the deputy of the marshal and he and his bondsman be responsible for they a civil force for the execution of the law be thus institute in accordance with long establish and familiar usage which be simple effective and under a responsible head the necessity for the possession of these power by appropriate officer will not be call in question by intelligent citizen who appreciate the importance of peaceable orderly and lawful election similar power be confer and exercise under state law with respect to state election the executive officer of the united states under the exist law have no other or great power to supervise and control the conduct of the congressional election than the state executive officer exercise in regard to state election
 the bill before i change completely the present law by substitute for the special deputy marshal of the exist statute new officer hitherto unknown to the law and who lack the power responsibility and protection which be essential to enable they to act efficiently as executive officer
 the bill under consideration be as follow
 be it enact by the senate and house of representatives of the united states america in congress assemble that from and after the passage of this act the pay of all deputy marshal for service in reference to any election shall be $ 5 for each day of actual service and no more
 sec 2 that all deputy marshal to serve in reference to any election shall be appoint by the circuit court of the united states for the district in which such marshal be to perform their duty in each year and the judge of the several circuit court of the united states be hereby authorize to open their respective court at any time for that purpose and in case the circuit court shall not be open for that purpose at least ten day prior to a registration if there be one or if no registration be require then at east ten day before such election the judge of the district court of the united states be hereby respectively authorize to cause their court to be open for the purpose of appoint such deputy marshal who shall be appoint by the say district court and the officer so appoint shall be in equal number from the different political party and shall be well know citizen of good moral character and actual resident of the voting precinct in which their duty be to be perform and shall not be candidate for any office at such election and all law and part of law inconsistent with this act be hereby repeal provide that the marshal of the united states for whom deputy shall be appoint by the court under this act shall not be liable for any of the act of such deputy
 it will be observe that the deputy marshal propose by the bill before i be distinctly different officer from the special deputy of the marshal as such officer be now provide for in the statute this bill do not connect the new officer with the exist law relate to special deputy marshal so as to invest the propose deputy marshal with the same power to impose upon they the same duty and to give they the same protection by mean of the criminal law when new officer be create distinct in character and appoint by different authority although similar in name to officer already provide for such officer be not hold by similar responsibility to the criminal law do not possess the same power and be not similarly protect unless it be expressly so provide by legislation
 the so call deputy marshal provide for in this bill will have no executive head the marshal can neither appoint nor remove they he can not control they and he be not responsible for they they will have no authority to call to their aid if resist the posse comitatus they be protect by no criminal statute in the performance of their duty an assault upon one of these deputy with the intent to prevent a lawful election will be no more than an ordinary assault upon any other citizen they can not keep the peace they can not make arrest when crime be commit in their presence whatever power they have be confine to the precinct in which they reside outside of the precinct for which they be appoint the deputy marshal of this bill can not keep the peace make arrest hold prisoner take prisoner before a proper tribunal for hearing nor perform any other duty no oath of office be require of they and they give no bond they have no superior who be responsible for they and they be not punishable for neglect of duty or misconduct in office in all these respect this bill make a radical change between the power of the united states officer at national election and the power uniformly possess and exercise by state officer at state election this discrimination against the authority of the united states be a departure from the usage of the government establish by precedent begin with the early statute on the subject and violate the true principle of the constitution the supreme court in the decision already refer to say
 it be argue that the preservation of peace and good order in society be not within the power confide to the government of the united states but belong exclusively to the states here again we be meet with the theory that the government of the united states do not rest upon the soil and territory of the country we think that this theory be found on an entire misconception of the nature and power of that government we hold it to be an incontrovertible principle that the government of the united states may by mean of physical force exercise through its official agent execute on every foot of american soil the power and function that belong to it this necessarily involve the power to command obedience to its law and hence the power to keep the peace to that extent
 this power to enforce its law and to execute its function in all place do not derogate from the power of the state to execute its law at the same time and in the same place the one do not exclude the other except where both can not be execute at the same time in that case the word of the constitution itself show which be to yield this constitution and all law which shall be make in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land
 in conclusion it be proper to say that no objection would be make to the appointment of officer to act with reference to the election by the court of the united states and that i be in favor of appoint officer to supervise and protect the election without regard to party but the bill before i while it recognize the power and duty of the united states to provide officer to guard and scrutinize the congressional election fail to adapt its provision to the exist law so as to secure efficient supervision and protection it be therefore return to the senate in which it originate for that further consideration which be contemplate by the constitution

i congratulate you on the continued and increase prosperity of our country by the favor of divine providence we have be bless during the past year with health with abundant harvest with profitable employment for all our people and with contentment at home and with peace and friendship with other nation the occurrence of the twenty fourth election of chief magistrate have afford another opportunity to the people of the united states to exhibit to the world a significant example of the peaceful and safe transmission of the power and authority of government from the public servant whose term of office be about to expire to their newly choose successor this example can not fail to impress profoundly thoughtful people of other country with the advantage which republican institution afford the immediate general and cheerful acquiescence of all good citizen in the result of the election give gratify assurance to our country and to its friend throughout the world that a government base on the free consent of an intelligent and patriotic people possess element of strength stability and permanency not find in any other form of government

 continue opposition to the full and free enjoyment of the right of citizenship confer upon the colored people by the recent amendment to the constitution still prevail in several of the late slaveholding state it have perhaps not be manifest in the recent election to any large extent in act of violence or intimidation it have however by fraudulent practice in connection with the ballot with the regulation as to the place and manner of voting and with counting return and canvass the vote cast be successful in defeat the exercise of the right preservative of all rights&mdash;the right of suffrage&mdash;which the constitution expressly confer upon our enfranchised citizen

 it be the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor in our politic should disappear they prefer that no section of the country should be unite in solid opposition to any other section the disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to the equal right amendment to the constitution be all that now stand in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional line in our political contest as long as either of these amendment be flagrantly violate or disregard it be safe to assume that the people who place they in the constitution as embody the legitimate result of the war for the union and who believe they to be wise and necessary will continue to act together and to insist that they shall be obey the paramount question still be as to the enjoyment of the fight by every american citizen who have the requisite qualification to freely cast his vote and to have it honestly count with this question rightly settle the country will be relieve of the contention of the past bygone will indeed be bygone and political and party issue with respect to economy and efficiency of administration internal improvement the tariff domestic taxation education finance and other important subject will then receive their full share of attention but resistance to and nullification of the result of the war will unite together in resolute purpose for their support all who maintain the authority of the government and the perpetuity of the union and who adequately appreciate the value of the victory achieve this determination proceed from no hostile sentiment or feel to any part of the people of our country or to any of their interest the inviolability of the amendment rest upon the fundamental principle of our government they be the solemn expression of the will of the people of the united states

 the sentiment that the constitutional right of all our citizen must be maintain do not grow weak it will continue to control the government of the country happily the history of the late election show that in many part of the country where opposition to the fifteenth amendment have heretofore prevail it be diminish and be likely to cease altogether if firm and well consider action be take by congress i trust the house of representatives and the senate which have the right to judge of the election return and qualification of their own member will see to it that every case of violation of the letter or spirit of the fifteenth amendment be thoroughly investigate and that no benefit from such violation shall accrue to any person or party it will be the duty of the executive with sufficient appropriation for the purpose to prosecute unsparingly all who have be engage in deprive citizen of the right guarantee to they by the constitution

 it be not however to be forget that the good and sure guaranty of the primary right of citizenship be to be find in that capacity for self protection which can belong only to a people whose right to universal suffrage be support by universal education the mean at the command of the local and state authority be in many case wholly inadequate to furnish free instruction to all who need it this be especially true where before emancipation the education of the people be neglect or prevent in the interest of slavery firmly convinced that the subject of popular education deserve the earnest attention of the people of the whole country with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the government of the united states i respectfully recommend that congress by suitable legislation and with proper safeguard supplement the local educational fund in the several states where the grave duty and responsibility of citizenship have be devolve on uneducated people by devote to the purpose grant of the public land and if necessary by appropriation from the treasury of the united states whatever government can fairly do to promote free popular education ought to be do wherever general education be find peace virtue and social order prevail and civil and religious liberty be secure

 in my former annual message i have ask the attention of congress to the urgent necessity of a reformation of the civil service system of the government my view concern the danger of patronage or appointment for personal or partisan consideration have be strengthen by my observation and experience in the executive office and i believe these danger threaten the stability of the government abuse so serious in their nature can not be permanently tolerate they tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of administrative service as the growth of the country in population increase the number of officer and placeman employ

 the reason be imperative for the adoption of fix rule for the regulation of appointment promotion and removal establish a uniform method have exclusively in view in every instance the attainment of the good qualification for the position in question such a method alone be consistent with the equal right of all citizen and the most economical and efficient administration of the public business

 competitive examination in aid of impartial appointment and promotion have be conduct for some year past in several of the executive departments and by my direction this system have be adopt in the custom house and post office of the large city of the country in the city of new york over 2,000 position in the civil service have be subject in their appointment and tenure of place to the operation of publish rule for this purpose during the past two year the result of these practical trial have be very satisfactory and have confirm my opinion in favor of this system of selection all be subject to the same test and the result be free from prejudice by personal favor or partisan influence it secure for the position apply for the good qualification attainable among the compete applicant it be an effectual protection from the pressure of importunity which under any other course pursue largely exact the time and attention of appoint officer to their great detriment in the discharge of other official duty prevent the abuse of the service for the mere furtherance of private or party purpose and leave the employee of the government free from the obligation impose by patronage to depend solely upon merit for retention and advancement and with this constant incentive to exertion and improvement

 these invaluable result have be attain in a high degree in the office where the rule for appointment by competitive examination have be apply

 a method which have so approve itself by experimental test at point where such test may be fairly consider conclusive should be extend to all subordinate position under the government i believe that a strong and grow public sentiment demand immediate measure for securing and enforce the high possible efficiency in the civil service and its protection from recognize abuse and that the experience refer to have demonstrate the feasibility of such measure

 the examination in the custom house and post office have be hold under many embarrassment and without provision for compensation for the extra labor perform by the officer who have conduct they and whose commendable interest in the improvement of the public service have induce this devotion of time and labor without pecuniary reward a continuance of these labor gratuitously ought not to be expect and without an appropriation by congress for compensation it be not practicable to extend the system of examination generally throughout the civil service it be also highly important that all such examination should be conduct upon a uniform system and under general supervision section 1753 of the revised statutes authorize the president to prescribe the regulation for admission to the civil service of the united states and for this purpose to employ suitable person to conduct the requisite inquiry with reference to the fitness of each candidate in respect to age health character knowledge and ability for the branch of service into which he seek to enter but the law be practically inoperative for want of the requisite appropriation

 i therefore recommend an appropriation of $ 25,000 per annum to meet the expense of a commission to be appoint by the president in accordance with the term of this section whose duty it shall be to devise a just uniform and efficient system of competitive examination and to supervise the application of the same throughout the entire civil service of the government i be persuade that the facility which such a commission will afford for test the fitness of those who apply for office will not only be as welcome a relief to member of congress as it will be to the president and head of departments but that it will also greatly tend to remove the cause of embarrassment which now inevitably and constantly attend the conflict claim of patronage between the legislative and executive department the most effectual check upon the pernicious competition of influence and official favoritism in the bestowal of office will be the substitution of an open competition of merit between the applicant in which everyone can make his own record with the assurance that his success will depend upon this alone

 i also recommend such legislation as while leave every officer as free as any other citizen to express his political opinion and to use his mean for their advancement shall also enable he to feel as safe as any private citizen in refuse all demand upon his salary for political purpose a law which should thus guarantee true liberty and justice to all who be engage in the public service and likewise contain stringent provision against the use of official authority to coerce the political action of private citizen or of official subordinate be greatly to be desire

 the most serious obstacle however to an improvement of the civil service and especially to a reform in the method of appointment and removal have be find to be the practice under what be know as the spoil system by which the appointing power have be so largely encroach upon by member of congress the first step in the reform of the civil service must be a complete divorce between congress and the executive in the matter of appointment the corrupting doctrine that to the victor belong the spoil be inseparable from congressional patronage as the establish rule and practice of party in power it come to be understand by applicant for office and by the people generally that representatives and senators be entitle to disburse the patronage of their respective district and state it be not necessary to recite at length the evil result from this invasion of the executive function the true principle of government on the subject of appointment to office as state in the national convention of the lead party of the country have again and again be approve by the american people and have not be call in question in any quarter these authentic expression of public opinion upon this all important subject be the statement of principle that belong to the constitutional structure of the government

 under the constitution the president and head of departments be to make nomination for office the senate be to advise and consent to appointment and the house of representatives be to accuse and prosecute faithless officer the good interest of the public service demand that these distinction be respect that senators and representatives who may be judge and accuser should not dictate appointment to office
 to this end the cooperation of the legislative department of the government be require alike by the necessity of the case and by public opinion member of congress will not be relieve from the demand make upon they with reference to appointment to office until by legislative enactment the pernicious practice be condemn and forbid

 it be therefore recommend that an act be pass define the relation of member of congress with respect to appointment to office by the president and i also recommend that the provision of section 1767 and of the section follow of the revised statutes comprise the tenure of office act of march 2 1867 be repeal

 believe that to reform the system and method of the civil service in our country be one of the high and most imperative duty of statesmanship and that it can be permanently do only by the cooperation of the legislative and executive department of the government i again commend the whole subject to your considerate attention

 it be the recognize duty and purpose of the people of the united states to suppress polygamy where it now exist in our territories and to prevent its extension faithful and zealous effort have be make by the united states authority in utah to enforce the law against it experience have show that the legislation upon this subject to be effective require extensive modification and amendment the long action be delay the more difficult it will be to accomplish what be desire prompt and decide measure be necessary the mormon sectarian organization which uphold polygamy have the whole power of make and execute the local legislation of the territory by its control of the grand and petit jury it possess large influence over the administration of justice exercise as the head of this sect do the local political power of the territory they be able to make effective their hostility to the law of congress on the subject of polygamy and in fact do prevent its enforcement polygamy will not be abolish if the enforcement of the law depend on those who practice and uphold the crime it can only be suppress by take away the political power of the sect which encourage and sustain it

 the power of congress to enact suitable law to protect the territories be ample it be not a case for halfway measure the political power of the mormon sect be increase it control now one of our wealthy and most populous territories it be extend steadily into other territories wherever it go it establish polygamy and sectarian political power the sanctity of marriage and the family relation be the corner stone of our american society and civilization religious liberty and the separation of church and state be among the elementary idea of free institution to reestablish the interest and principle which polygamy and mormonism have imperil and to fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous immigrant of all creed that part of our domain which have be in a great degree close to general immigration by intolerant and immoral institution it be recommend that the government of the territory of utah be reorganize

 i recommend that congress provide for the government of utah by a governor and judge or commissioner appoint by the president and confirm by the senate&mdash;a government analogous to the provisional government establish for the territory northwest of the ohio by the ordinance of 1787 if however it be deem good to continue the exist form of local government i recommend that the right to vote hold office and sit on jury in the territory of utah be confine to those who neither practice nor uphold polygamy if thorough measure be adopt it be believe that within a few year the evil which now afflict utah will be eradicate and that this territory will in good time become one of the most prosperous and attractive of the new states of the union

 our relation with all foreign country have be those of undisturbed peace and have present no occasion for concern as to their continued maintenance

 my anticipation of an early reply from the british government to the demand of indemnity to our fisherman for the injury suffer by that industry at fortune bay in january 1878 which i express in my last annual message be disappoint this answer be receive only in the latter part of april in the present year and when received exhibit a failure of accord between the two government as to the measure of the inshore fishing privilege secure to our fisherman by the treaty of washington of so serious a character that i make it the subject of a communication to congress in which i recommend the adoption of the measure which seem to i proper to be take by this government in maintenance of the right accord to our fisherman under the treaty and toward secure an indemnity for the injury these interest have suffer a bill to carry out these recommendation be under consideration by the house of representatives at the time of the adjournment of congress in june last

 i sincerely hope that the basis may be find for a speedy adjustment of the very serious divergence of view in the interpretation of the fishery clause of the treaty of washington which as the correspondence between the two government stand at the close of the last session of congress seem to be irreconcilable

 it be fortunate that this large surplus revenue occur at a period when it may be directly apply to the payment of the public debt soon to be redeemable no public duty have be more constantly cherish in the united states than the policy of pay the nation&#39;s debt as rapidly as possible

 the debt of the united states less cash in the treasury and exclusive of accruing interest attain its maximum of $ 2,756,431,571.43 in august 1865 and have since that time be reduce to $ 1,886,019,504.65 of the principal of the debt $ 108,758,100 have be pay since march 1 1877 effect an annual saving of interest of $ 6,107,593 the burden of interest have also be diminish by the sale of bond bear a low rate of interest and the application of the proceed to the redemption of bond bear a high rate the annual saving thus secure since march 1 1877 be $ 14,290,453.50 within a short period over six hundred million of 5 and 6 per cent bond will become redeemable this present a very favorable opportunity not only to far reduce the principal of the debt but also to reduce the rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid i call the attention of congress to the view express on this subject by the secretary of the treasury in his annual report and recommend prompt legislation to enable the treasury department to complete the refunding of the debt which be about to mature

 the continuance of specie payment have not be interrupt or endanger since the date of resumption it have contribute greatly to the revival of business and to our remarkable prosperity the fear that precede and accompanied resumption have prove groundless no considerable amount of united states note have be present for redemption while very large sum of gold bullion both domestic and import be take to the mint and exchange for coin or note the increase of coin and bullion in the united states since january 1 1879 be estimate at $ 227,399,428

 there be still in existence uncanceled $ 346,681,016 of united states legal tender note these note be authorize as a war measure make necessary by the exigency of the conflict in which the united states be then engage the preservation of the nation&#39;s existence require in the judgment of congress an issue of legal tender paper money that it serve well the purpose for which it be create be not question but the employment of the note as paper money indefinitely after the accomplishment of the object for which they be provide be not contemplate by the framer of the law under which they be issue these note long since became like any other pecuniary obligation of the government a debt to be pay and when pay to be cancel as mere evidence of an indebtedness no long exist i therefore repeat what be say in the annual message of last year that the retirement from circulation of united states note with the capacity of legal tender in private contract be a step to be take in our progress toward a safe and stable currency which should be accept as the policy and duty of the government and the interest and security of the people

 at the time of the passage of the act now in force require the coin age of silver dollar fix their value and give they legal tender character it be believe by many of the supporter of the measure that the silver dollar which it authorize would speedily become under the operation of the law of equivalent value to the gold dollar there be other supporter of the bill who while they doubt as to the probability of this result nevertheless be willing to give the propose experiment a fair trial with a view to stop the coinage if experience should prove that the silver dollar authorize by the bill continue to be of less commercial value than the standard gold dollar

 the coinage of silver dollar under the act refer to begin in march 1878 and have be continue as require by the act the average rate per month to the present time have be $ 2,276,492 the total amount coin prior to the 1st of november last be $ 72,847,750 of this amount $ 47,084,450 remain in the treasury and only $ 25,763,291 be in the hand of the people a constant effort have be make to keep this currency in circulation and considerable expense have be necessarily incur for this purpose but its return to the treasury be prompt and sure contrary to the confident anticipation of the friend of the measure at the time of its adoption the value of the silver dollar contain 412 1/2 grain of silver have not increase during the year prior to the passage of the bill authorize its coinage the market value of the silver which it contain be from 90 to 92 cent as compare with the standard gold dollar during the last year the average market value of the silver dollar have be 88 1/2 cent

 it be obvious that the legislation of the last congress in regard to silver so far as it be base on an anticipated rise in the value of silver as a result of that legislation have fail to produce the effect then predict the long the law remain in force require as it do the coinage of a nominal dollar which in reality be not a dollar the great become the danger that this country will be force to accept a single metal as the sole legal standard of value in circulation and this a standard of less value than it purport to be worth in the recognize money of the world

 the constitution of the united states sound financial principle and our good interest all require that the country should have as its legal tender money both gold and silver coin of an intrinsic value as bullion equivalent to that which upon its face it purport to possess the constitution in express term recognize both gold and silver as the only true legal tender money to banish either of these metal from our currency be to narrow and limit the circulate medium of exchange to the disparagement of important interest the united states produce more silver than any other country and be directly interested in maintain it as one of the two precious metal which furnish the coinage of the world it will in my judgment contribute to this result if congress will repeal so much of exist legislation as require the coinage of silver dollar contain only 412 1/2 grain of silver and in its stead will authorize the secretary of the treasury to coin silver dollar of equivalent value as bullion with gold dollar this will defraud no man and will be in accordance with familiar precedent congress on several occasion have alter the ratio of value between gold and silver in order to establish it more nearly in accordance with the actual ratio of value between the two metal

 in financial legislation every measure in the direction of great fidelity in the discharge of pecuniary obligation have be find by experience to diminish the rate of interest which debtor be require to pay and to increase the facility with which money can be obtain for every legitimate purpose our own recent financial history show how surely money become abundant whenever confidence in the exact performance of moneyed obligation be establish

 the rapid extension of the railroad system west of the mississippi river and the great tide of settler which have flow in upon new territory impose on the military an entire change of policy the maintenance of small post along wagon and stage route of travel be no long necessary permanent quarter at point select of a more substantial character than those heretofore construct will be require under exist law permanent building can not be erect without the sanction of congress and when sale of military site and building have be authorize the money receive have revert to the treasury and could only become available through a new appropriation it be recommend that provision be make by a general statute for the sale of such abandon military post and building as be find to be unnecessary and for the application of the proceed to the construction of other post while many of the present post be of but slight value for military purpose owe to the change condition of the country their occupation be continue at great expense and inconvenience because they afford the only available shelter for troop

 the absence of a large number of officer of the line in active duty from their regiment be a serious detriment to the maintenance of the service the constant demand for small detachment each of which should be command by a commission officer and the various detail of officer for necessary service away from their command occasion a scarcity in the number require for company duty with a view to lessen this drain to some extent it be recommend that the law authorize the detail of officer from the active list as professor of tactic and military science at certain college and university be so amend as to provide that all such detail be make from the retired list of the army

 the suggestion of the postmaster general that it would be wise to encourage by appropriate legislation the establishment of american line of steamer by our own citizen to carry the mail between our own port and those of mexico central america south america and of transpacific country be commend to the serious consideration of congress

 the attention of congress be also invite to the suggestion of the postmaster general in regard to postal saving

 the necessity for additional provision to aid in the transaction of the business of the federal court become each year more apparent the docket of the supreme court and of the circuit court in the great number of the circuit be encumber with the constant accession of case in the former court and in many instance in the circuit court year intervene before it be practicable to bring case to hear

 the attorney general recommend the establishment of an intermediate court of error and appeal it be recommend that the number of judge of the circuit court in each circuit with the exception of the second circuit should be increase by the addition of another judge in the second circuit that two should be add and that an intermediate appellate court should be form in each circuit to consist of the circuit judge and the circuit justice and that in the event of the absence of either of these judge the place of the absent judge should be supply by the judge of one of the district court in the circuit such an appellate court could be safely invest with large jurisdiction and its decision would satisfy suitor in many case where appeal would still be allow to the supreme court the expense incur for this intermediate court will require a very moderate increase of the appropriation for the expense of the department of justice this recommendation be commend to the careful consideration of congress

 it be evident that a delay of justice in many instance oppressive and disastrous to suitor now necessarily occur in the federal court which will in this way be remedie

 the report of the secretary of the interior present an elaborate account of the operation of that department during the past year it give i great pleasure to say that our indian affair appear to be in a more hopeful condition now than ever before the indians have make gratifying progress in agriculture herding and mechanical pursuit many who be a few year ago in hostile conflict with the government be quietly settle down on farm where they hope to make their permanent home build house and engage in the occupation of civilized life the introduction of the freight business among they have be remarkably fruitful of good result in give many of they congenial and remunerative employment and in stimulate their ambition to earn their own support their honesty fidelity and efficiency as carrier be highly praised the organization of a police force of indians have be equally successful in maintain law and order upon the reservation and in exercise a wholesome moral influence among the indians themselves i concur with the secretary of the interior in the recommendation that the pay of this force be increase as an inducement to the good class of young man to enter it

 much care and attention have be devote to the enlargement of educational facility for the indians the mean available for this important object have be very inadequate a few additional boarding school at indian agency have be establish and the erection of building have be begin for several more but an increase of the appropriation for this interesting undertaking be greatly need to accommodate the large number of indian child of school age the number offer by their parent from all part of the country for education in the government school be much large than can be accommodate with the mean at present available for that purpose the number of indian pupil at the normal school at hampton va. under the direction of general armstrong have be considerably increase and their progress be highly encouraging the indian school establish by the interior department in 1879 at carlisle pa. under the direction of captain pratt have be equally successful it have now nearly 200 pupil of both sex represent a great variety of the tribe east of the rocky mountains the pupil in both these institution receive not only an elementary english education but be also instruct in housework agriculture and useful mechanical pursuit a similar school be establish this year at forest grove oreg for the education of indian youth on the pacific coast in addition to this thirty six indian boy and girl be select from the eastern cherokees and place in boarding school in north carolina where they be to receive an elementary english education and training in industrial pursuit the interest show by indian parent even among the so call wild tribe in the education of their child be very gratifying and give promise that the result accomplish by the effort now make will be of lasting benefit

 the expense of indian education have so far be draw from the permanent civilization fund at the disposal of the department of the interior but the fund be now so much reduce that the continuance of this beneficial work will in the future depend on specific appropriation by congress for the purpose and i venture to express the hope that congress will not permit institution so fruitful of good result to perish for want of mean for their support on the contrary an increase of the number of such school appear to i highly advisable

 the past year have be unusually free from disturbance among the indian tribe an agreement have be make with the utes by which they surrender their large reservation in colorado in consideration of an annuity to be pay to they and agree to settle in severally on certain land designate for that purpose as farmer hold individual title to their land in fee simple inalienable for a certain period in this way a costly indian war have be avoid which at one time seem imminent and for the first time in the history of the country an indian nation have give up its tribal existence to be settle in severally and to live as individual under the common protection of the law of the country

 a large increase be report in the disposal of public land for settlement during the past year which mark the prosperous growth of our agricultural industry and a vigorous movement of population toward our unoccupied land as this movement proceed the codification of our land law as well as proper legislation to regulate the disposition of public land become of more pressing necessity and i therefore invite the consideration of congress to the report and the accompany draft of a bill make by the public lands commission which be communicate by i to congress at the last session early action upon this important subject be highly desirable

 the attention of congress be again ask to the wasteful depredation commit on our public timber land and the rapid and indiscriminate destruction of our forest the urgent necessity for legislation to this end be now generally recognize in view of the lawless character of the depredation commit and the disastrous consequence which will inevitably follow their continuance legislation have again and again be recommend to arrest the evil and to preserve for the people of our western states and territories the timber need for domestic and other essential use

 the report of the commissioner ask attention particularly to the continued prevalence of an infectious and contagious cattle disease know and dread in europe and asia as cattle plague or pleuro pneumonia a mild type of this disease in certain section of our country be the occasion of great loss to our farmer and of serious disturbance to our trade with great britain which furnish a market for most of our live stock and dressed meat the value of neat cattle export from the united states for the eight month end august 31 1880 be more than $ 12,000,000 and nearly double the value for the same period in 1879&mdash;an unexampled increase of export trade your early attention be solicit to this important matter

 the success of the public school of the district of columbia and the progress make under the intelligent direction of the board of education and the superintendent in supply the educational requirement of the district with thoroughly train and efficient teacher be very gratifying the act of congress from time to time donate public land to the several states and territories in aid of educational interest have prove to be wise measure of public policy result in great and lasting benefit it would seem to be a matter of simple justice to extend the benefit of this legislation the wisdom of which have be so fully vindicate by experience to the district of columbia

 i again commend the general interest of the district of columbia to the favorable consideration of congress the affair of the district as show by the report of the commissioners be in a very satisfactory condition

 in my annual message heretofore and in my special message of december 19 1879 i have urge upon the attention of congress the necessity of reclaim the marsh of the potomac adjacent to the capital and i be constrain by its importance to advert again to the subject these flat embrace an area of several hundred acre they be an impediment to the drainage of the city and seriously impair its health it be believe that with this substantial improvement of its river front the capital would be in all respect one of the most attractive city in the world aside from its permanent population this city be necessarily the place of residence of person from every section of the country engage in the public service many other reside here temporarily for the transaction of business with the government

 it should not be forget that the land acquire will probably be worth the cost of reclaim it and that the navigation of the river will be greatly improve i therefore again invite the attention of congress to the importance of prompt provision for this much need and too long delay improvement

 the water supply of the city be inadequate in addition to the ordinary use throughout the city the consumption by government be necessarily very great in the navy yard arsenal and the various departments and a large quantity be require for the proper preservation of the numerous park and the cleansing of sewer i recommend that this subject receive the early attention of congress and that in make provision for an increase supply such mean be adopt as will have in view the future growth of the city temporary expedient for such a purpose can not but be wasteful of money and therefore unwise a more ample reservoir with corresponding facility for keep it fill should in my judgment be construct i commend again to the attention of congress the subject of the removal from their present location of the depot of the several railroad enter the city and i renew the recommendation of my former message in behalf of the erection of a building for the congressional library the completion of the washington monument and of liberal appropriation in support of the benevolent reformatory and penal institution of the district
to the house of representatives
 having consider the bill entitle an act to facilitate the refunding of the national debt i be constrain to return it to the house of representatives in which it originate with the follow statement of my objection to its passage
 the imperative necessity for prompt action and the pressure of public duty in this closing week of my term of office compel i to refrain from any attempt to make a full and satisfactory presentation of the objection to the bill
 the importance of the passage at the present session of congress of a suitable measure for the refunding of the national debt which be about to mature be generally recognize it have be urge upon the attention of congress by the secretary of the treasury and in my last annual message if successfully accomplish it will secure a large decrease in the annual interest payment of the nation and i earnestly recommend if the bill before i shall fail that another measure for this purpose be adopt before the present congress adjourn
 while in my opinion it would be unwise to authorize the secretary of the treasury in his discretion to offer to the public bond bear 3 1/2 per cent interest in aid of refunding i should not deem it my duty to interpose my constitutional objection to the passage of the present bill if it do not contain in its fifth section provision which in my judgment seriously impair the value and tend to the destruction of the present national banking system of the country this system have now be in operation almost twenty year no safe or more beneficial banking system be ever establish its advantage as a business be free to all who have the necessary capital it furnish a currency to the public which for convenience and security of the bill holder have probably never be equal by that of any other banking system its note be secure by the deposit with the government of the interest bear bond of the united states
 the section of the bill before i which relate to the national banking system and to which objection be make be not an essential part of a refunding measure it be as follow
 sec 5 from and after the 1st day of july 1881 the 3 per cent bond authorize by the first section of this act shall be the only bond receivable as security for national bank circulation or as security for the safe keeping and prompt payment of the public money deposit with such bank but when any such bond deposit for the purpose aforesaid shall be designate for purchase or redemption by the secretary of the treasury the banking association deposit the same shall have the right to substitute other issue of the bond of the united states in lieu thereof provide that no bond upon which interest have cease shall be accept or shall be continue on deposit as security for circulation or for the safe keeping of the public money and in case bond so deposited shall not be withdraw as provide by law within thirty day after the interest have cease thereon the banking association deposit the same shall be subject to the liability and proceeding on the part of the comptroller provide for in section 5234 of the revised statutes of the united states and provide far that section 4 of the act of june 20 1874 entitle an act fix the amount of united states note provide for a redistribution of the national bank currency and for other purpose be and the same be hereby repeal and section 5159 and 5160 of the revised statutes of the united states be and the same be hereby reenacted
 under this section it be obvious that no additional bank will hereafter be organize except possibly in a few city or locality where the prevail rate of interest in ordinary business be extremely low no new bank can be organize and no increase of the capital of exist bank can be obtain except by the purchase and deposit of 3 per cent bond no other bond of the united states can be use for the purpose the one thousand million of other bond recently issue by the united states and bear a high rate of interest than 3 per cent and therefore a well security for the bill holder can not after the 1st of july next be receive as security for bank circulation this be a radical change in the banking law it take from the bank the right they have heretofore have under the law to purchase and deposit as security for their circulation any of the bond issue by the united states and deprive the bill holder of the good security which the bank be able to give by require they to deposit bond have the least value of any bond issue by the government
 the average rate of taxation of capital employ in banking be more than double the rate of taxation upon capital employ in other legitimate business under these circumstance to amend the banking law so as to deprive the bank of the privilege of secure their note by the most valuable bond issue by the government will it be believe in a large part of the country be a practical prohibition of the organization of new bank and prevent the exist bank from enlarge their capital the national banking system if continue at all will be a monopoly in the hand of those already engage in it who may purchase the government bond bear a more favorable rate of interest than the 3 per cent bond prior to next july
 to prevent the further organization of bank be to put in jeopardy the whole system by take from it that feature which make it as it now be a banking system free upon the same term to all who wish to engage in it even the exist bank will be in danger of be drive from business by the additional disadvantage to which they will be subject by this bill in short i can not but regard the fifth section of the bill as a step in the direction of the destruction of the national banking system
 our country after a long period of business depression have just enter upon a career of unexampled prosperity
 the withdrawal of the currency from circulation of the national bank and the enforce winding up of the bank in consequence would inevitably bring serious embarrassment and disaster to the business of the country bank of issue be essential instrument of modern commerce if the present efficient and admirable system of banking be break down it will inevitably be follow by a recurrence to other and inferior method of banking any measure look to such a result will be a disturbing element in our financial system it will destroy confidence and surely check the grow prosperity of the country
 believe that a measure for refund the national debt be not necessarily connect with the national banking law and that any refunding act would defeat its own object if it imperil the national banking system or seriously impair its usefulness and convince that section 5 of the bill before i would if it should become a law work great harm i herewith return the bill to the house of representatives for that further consideration which be provide for in the constitution

fellow citizens

 we stand to day upon an eminence which overlook a hundred year of national life a century crowd with peril but crown with the triumph of liberty and law before continue the onward march let we pause on this height for a moment to strengthen our faith and renew our hope bya glance at the pathway along which our people have travel

 it be now three day more than a hundred year since the adoption of the first write constitution of the united states the articles of confederation and perpetual union the new republic be then beset with danger on every hand it have not conquer a place in the family of nation the decisive battle of the war for independence whose centennial anniversary will soon be gratefully celebrate at yorktown have not yet be fight the colonist be struggle not only against the army of a great nation but against the settle opinion of mankind for the world do not then believe that the supreme authority of government could be safely intrust to the guardianship of the people themselves

 we can not overestimate the fervent love of liberty the intelligent courage and the sum of common sense with which our father make the great experiment of self government when they find after a short trial that the confederacy of states be too weak to meet the necessity of a vigorous and expand republic they boldly set it aside and in its stead establish a national union found directly upon the will of the people endow with full power of self preservation and ample authority for the accomplishment of its great object

 under this constitution the boundary of freedom have be enlarge the foundation of order and peace have be strengthen and the growth of our people in all the well element of national life have indicate the wisdom of the founder and give new hope to their descendant under this constitution our people long ago make themselves safe against danger from without and secure for their mariner and flag equality of right on all the sea under this constitution twenty five states have be add to the union with constitution and law frame and enforce by their own citizen to secure the manifold blessing of local self government

 the jurisdiction of this constitution now cover an area fifty time great than that of the original thirteen states and a population twenty time great than that of 1780

 the supreme trial of the constitution come at last under the tremendous pressure of civil war we ourselves be witness that the union emerge from the blood and fire of that conflict purify and make strong for all the beneficent purpose of good government

 and now at the close of this first century of growth with the inspiration of its history in their heart our people have lately review the condition of the nation pass judgment upon the conduct and opinion of political party and have register their will concern the future administration of the government to interpret and to execute that will in accordance with the constitution be the paramount duty of the executive

 even from this brief review it be manifest that the nation be resolutely face to the front resolve to employ its good energy in develop the great possibility of the future sacredly preserve whatever have be gain to liberty and good government during the century our people be determined to leave behind they all those bitter controversy concern thing which have be irrevocably settle and the further discussion of which can only stir up strife and delay the onward march

 the supremacy of the nation and its law should be no long a subject of debate that discussion which for half a century threaten the existence of the union be close at last in the high court of war by a decree from which there be no appeal that the constitution and the law make in pursuance there of be and shall continue to be the supreme law of the land bind alike upon the states and the people this decree do not disturb the autonomy of the states nor interfere with any of their necessary right of local self government but it do fix and establish the permanent supremacy of the union

 the will of the nation speak with the voice of battle and through the amend constitution have fulfil the great promise of 1776 by proclaiming"liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitant thereof

 the elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full right of citizenship be the most important political change we have know since the adoption of the constitution of 1787 no thoughtful man can fail to appreciate its beneficent effect upon our institution and people it have free we from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution it have add immensely to the moral and industrial force of our people it have liberate the master as well as the slave from a relation which wrong and enfeeble both it have surrender to their own guardianship the manhood of more than 5,000,000people and have open to each one of they a career of freedom and usefulness it have give new inspiration to the power of self help in both race by make labor more honorable to the one and more necessary to the other the influence of this force will grow great and bear rich fruit with the come year

 no doubt this great change have cause serious disturbance to our southern community this be to be deplore though it be perhaps unavoidable but those who resist the change should remember that under our institution there be no middle ground for the negro race between slavery and equal citizenship there can be no permanent disfranchise peasantry in the unitedstates freedom can never yield its fullness of blessing so long as the law or its administration place the small obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen

 the emancipate race have already make remarkable progress with unquestione devotion to the union with a patience and gentleness not bear of fear they have follow the light as god give they to see the light they be rapidly lay the material foundation of self support widen their circle of intelligence and begin to enjoy the blessing that gather around the home of the industrious poor they deserve the generous encouragement of all good man so far as my authority can lawfully extend they shall enjoy the full and equal protection of the constitution and the law

 the free enjoyment of equal suffrage be still in question and a frank statement of the issue may aid its solution it be allege that in many community negro citizen be practically deny the freedom of the ballot in so far as the truth of this allegation be admit it be answer that in many place honest local government be impossible if the mass of uneducated negro be allow to vote these be grave allegation so far as the latter be true it be the only palliation that can be offer for oppose the freedom of the ballot bad local government be certainly a great evil which ought to be prevent but to violate the freedom and sanctity of the suffrage be more than an evil it be a crime which if persist in will destroy the government itself suicide be not a remedy if in other land it be high treason to compass the death of the king it shall be count no less a crime here to strangle our sovereign power and stifle its voice

 it have be say that unsettled question have no pity for the repose of nation it should be say with the utmost emphasis that this question of the suffrage will never give repose or safety to the states or to the nation until each within its own jurisdiction make and keep the ballot free and pure by the strong sanction of the law

 but the danger which arise from ignorance in the voter can not be deny it cover a field far wider than that of negro suffrage and the present condition of the race it be a danger that lurk and hide in the source and fountain of power in every state we have no standard by which to measure the disaster that may be bring upon we by ignorance and vice in the citizen when join to corruption and fraud in the suffrage

 the voter of the union who make and unmake constitution and upon whose will hang the destiny of our government can transmit their supreme authority to no successor save the come generation of voter who be the sole heir of sovereign power if that generation come to its inheritance blind by ignorance and corrupt by vice the fall of the republic will be certain and remediless

 the census have already sound the alarm in the appalling figure which mark how dangerously high the tide of illiteracy have rise among our voter and their child

 to the south this question be of supreme importance but the responsibility for the existence of slavery do not rest upon the south alone the nation itself be responsible for the extension of the suffrage and be under special obligation to aid in remove the illiteracy which it have add to the vote population for the north and south alike there be but one remedy all the constitutional power of the nation and of the states and all the volunteer force of the people should be surrender to meet this danger by the savory influence of universal education

 it be the high privilege and sacred duty of those now live to educate their successor and fit they by intelligence and virtue for the inheritance which await they

 in this beneficent work section and race should be forget and partisanship should be unknown let our people find a new meaning in the divine oracle which declare that a little child shall lead they for our own little child will soon control the destiny of the republic

 my countryman we do not now differ in our judgment concern the controversy of past generation and fifty year hence our child will not be divide in their opinion concern our controversy they will surely bless their father and their fathers&#39 god that the union be preserve that slavery be overthrow and that both race be make equal before the law we may hasten or we may retard but we can not prevent the final reconciliation be it not possible for we now to make a truce with time by anticipate and accept its inevitable verdict

 enterprise of the high importance to our moral and material well be unite we and offer ample employment of our good power let all our people leave behind they the battlefield of dead issue move forward and in their strength of liberty and the restore union win the grander victory of peace

 the prosperity which now prevail be without parallel in our history fruitful season have do much to secure it but they have not do all the preservation of the public credit and the resumption of specie payment so successfully attain by the administration of my predecessor have enable our people to secure the blessing which the season bring

 by the experience of commercial nation in all age it have be find that gold and silver afford the only safe foundation for a monetary system confusion have recently be create by variation in the relative value of the two metal but i confidently believe that arrangement can be make between the lead commercial nation which will secure the general use of both metal congress should provide that the compulsory coinage of silver now require by law may not disturb our monetary system by drive either metal out of circulation if possible such an adjustment should be make that the purchase power of every coin dollar will be exactly equal to its debt pay power in all the market of the world

 the chief duty of the national government in connection with the currency of the country be to coin money and declare its value grave doubt have be entertain whether congress be authorize by the constitution to make any form of paper money legal tender the present issue of unitedstates note have be sustain by the necessity of war but such paper should depend for its value and currency upon its convenience in use and its prompt redemption in coin at the will of the holder and not upon its compulsory circulation these note be not money but promise to pay money if the holder demand it the promise should be keep

 the refunding of the national debt at a low rate of interest should be accomplish without compel the withdrawal of the national banknote and thus disturb the business of the country

 i venture to refer to the position i have occupy on financial question during a long service in congress and to say that time and experience have strengthen the opinion i have so often express on these subject

 the finance of the government shall suffer no detriment which it maybe possible for my administration to prevent

 the interest of agriculture deserve more attention from the government than they have yet receive the farm of the united states afford home and employment for more than one half our people and furnish much the large part of all our export as the government light our coast for the protection of mariner and the benefit of commerce so it should give to the tiller of the soil the good light of practical science and experience

 our manufacturer be rapidly make we industrially independent and be open to capital and labor new and profitable field of employment their steady and healthy growth should still be mature our facility for transportation should be promote by the continue improvement of our harbor and great interior waterway and by the increase of our tonnage on the ocean

 the development of the world&#39;s commerce have lead to an urgent demand for shorten the great sea voyage around cape horn by construct ship canal or railway across the isthmus which unite the continent various plan to this end have be suggest and will need consideration but none of they have be sufficiently mature to warrant the united states in extend pecuniary aid the subject however be one which will immediately engage the attention of the government with a view to a thorough protection to american interest we will urge no narrow policy nor seek peculiar or exclusive privilege in any commercial route but in the language of my predecessor i believe it to be the right and duty of the united states to assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connect north and south america as will protect our national interest

 the constitution guarantee absolute religious freedom congress be prohibit from make any law respect an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof the territories of the unitedstates be subject to the direct legislative authority of congress and hence the general government be responsible for any violation of the constitution in any of they it be therefore a reproach to the government that in the most populous of the territories the constitutional guaranty be not enjoy by the people and the authority of congress be set at naught the mormonchurch not only offend the moral sense of manhood by sanction polygamy but prevent the administration of justice through ordinary instrumentality of law

 in my judgment it be the duty of congress while respect to the uttermost the conscientious conviction and religious scruple of every citizen to prohibit within its jurisdiction all criminal practice especially of that class which destroy the family relation and endanger social order nor can any ecclesiastical organization be safely permit to usurp in the small degree the function and power of the national government

 the civil service can never be place on a satisfactory basis until it be regulate by law for the good of the service itself for the protection of those who be intrust with the appoint power against the waste of time and obstruction to the public business cause by the inordinate pressure for place and for the protection of incumbent against intrigue and wrong i shall at the proper time ask congress to fix the tenure of the minor office of the several executive departments and prescribe the ground upon which removal shall be make during the term for which incumbent have be appoint

 finally act always within the authority and limitation of the constitution invade neither the right of the states nor the reserved right of the people it will be the purpose of my administration to maintain the authority of the nation in all place within its jurisdiction to enforce obedience to all the law of the union in the interest of the people to demand rigid economy in all the expenditure of the government and to require the honest and faithful service of all executive officer remember that the office be create not for the benefit of incumbent or their supporter but for the service of the government

 and now fellow citizen i be about to assume the great trust which you have commit to my hand i appeal to you for that earnest and thoughtful support which make this government in fact as it be in law a government of the people

 i shall greatly rely upon the wisdom and patriotism of congress and of those who may share with i the responsibility and duty of administration and above all upon our effort to promote the welfare of this great people and their government i reverently invoke the support and blessing of almightygod
for the fourth time in the history of the republic its chief magistrate have be remove by death all heart be fill with grief and horror at the hideous crime which have darken our land and the memory of the murder president his protract suffering his unyielding fortitude the example and achievement of his life and the pathos of his death will forever illumine the page of our history
 for the fourth time the officer elect by the people and ordain by the constitution to fill a vacancy so create be call to assume the executive chair the wisdom of our father foresee even the most dire possibility make sure that the government should never be imperil because of the uncertainty of human life man may die but the fabric of our free institution remain unshaken no higher or more assuring proof could exist of the strength and permanence of popular government than the fact that though the choose of the people be strike down his constitutional successor be peacefully instal without shock or strain except the sorrow which mourn the bereavement all the noble aspiration of my lamented predecessor which find expression in his life the measure devise and suggest during his brief administration to correct abuse to enforce economy to advance prosperity and to promote the general welfare to insure domestic security and maintain friendly and honorable relation with the nation of the earth will be garner in the heart of the people and it will be my earnest endeavor to profit and to see that the nation shall profit by his example and experience

 in accordance with the act of february 28 1878 the treasury department have monthly cause at least two million in value of silver bullion to be coin into standard silver dollar one hundred and two million of these dollar have be already coin while only about thirty four million be in circulation

 for the reason which he specify i concur in the secretary 's recommendation that the provision for coinage of a fix amount each month be repeal and that hereafter only so much be coin as shall be necessary to supply the demand

 the secretary advise that the issue of gold certificate should not for the present be resume and suggest that the national bank may properly be forbid by law to retire their currency except upon reasonable notice of their intention so to do such legislation would seem to be justify by the recent action of certain bank on the occasion refer to in thesecretary 's report

 of the fifteen million of fractional currency still outstanding only about eighty thousand have be redeem the past year the suggestion that this amount may properly be drop from future statement of the public debt seem worthy of approval

 in the last annual report of the secretary of the treasury the attention of congress be call to the fact that $ 469,651,050 in 5 per cent bond and $ 203,573,750 in 6 per cent bond would become redeemable during the year and congress be ask to authorize the refunding of these bond at a low rate of interest the bill for such refunding having fail to become a law the secretary of the treasury in april last notify the holder of the $ 195,690,400 6 per cent bond then outstanding that the bond would be pay at par on the 1st day of july following or that they might be continue at the pleasure of the government to bear interest at the rate of 3 1/2 per cent per annum

 under this notice $ 178,055,150 of the 6 per cent bond be continue at the low rate and $ 17,635,250 be redeem

 in the month of may a like notice be give respect the redemption or continuance of the $ 439,841,350 of 5 per cent bond then outstanding and of these $ 401,504,900 be continue at 3 1/2 per cent per annum and$38,336,450 redeem

 the 6 per cent bond of the loan of february 8 1861 and of the oregon war debt amount together to $ 14,125,800 having mature during the year the secretary of the treasury give notice of his intention to redeem the same and such as have be present have be pay from the surplus revenue there have also be redeem at par $ 16,179,100 of the 3 1/2per cent continue bond make a total of bond redeem or which have cease to bear interest during the year of $ 123,969,650

 the reduction of the annual interest on the public debt through thesetransaction be as follow


 by reduction of interest to 3 1/2 per cent   $ 10,473,952.25
 by redemption of bond   6,352,340.00



 total   16,826,292.25


 the 3 1/2 per cent bond be payable at the pleasure of the government be available for the investment of surplus revenue without the payment of premium

 unless these bond can be fund at a much low rate of interest than they now bear i agree with the secretary of the treasury that no legislation respect they be desirable

 it be a matter for congratulation that the business of the country have be so prosperous during the past year as to yield by taxation a large surplus of income to the government if the revenue law remain unchanged this surplus must year by year increase on account of the reduction of the public debt and its burden of interest and because of the rapid increase of our population in 1860 just prior to the institution of our internal revenue system our population but slightly exceed 30,000,000 by the census of 1880 it be now find to exceed 50,000,000 it be estimate that even if the annual receipt and expenditure should continue as at present the entire debt could be pay in ten year

 in view however of the heavy load of taxation which our people have already bear we may well consider whether it be not the part of wisdom to reduce the revenue even if we delay a little the payment of the debt

 it seem to i that the time have arrive when the people may justly demand some relief from their present onerous burden and that by due economy in the various branch of the public service this may readily be afford

 i therefore concur with the secretary in recommend the abolitionof all internal revenue taxis except those upon tobacco in its variousform and upon distilled spirit and ferment liquor and except alsothe special tax upon the manufacturer of and dealer in such article the retention of the latter tax be desirable as afford the officersof the government a proper supervision of these article for the preventionof fraud i agree with the secretary of the treasury that the law imposinga stamp tax upon match proprietary article play card cheek and draft may with propriety be repeal and the law also by which banksand banker be assess upon their capital and deposit there seem tobe a general sentiment in favor of this course

 in the present condition of our revenue the tax upon deposit be especially unjust it be never impose in this country until it be demand by the necessity of war and be never exact i believe in any other country even in its great exigency bank be require to secure their circulation by pledge with the treasurer of the united states bond of the generalgovernment the interest upon these bond which at the time when the tax be impose be 6 per cent be now in most instance 3 1/2 per cent besides the entire circulation be originally limit by law and no increase be allowable when the exist bank have practically a monopoly of the business there be force in the suggestion that for the franchise to the favor grantee the government might very properly exact a tax on circulation;but for year the system have be free and the amount of circulation regulate by the public demand

 the retention of this tax have be suggest as a means of reimburse the government for the expense of printing and furnish the circulate note if the tax should be repeal it would certainly seem proper to require the national bank to pay the amount of such expense to the comptroller of the currency

 it be perhaps doubtful whether the immediate reduction of the rate of taxation upon liquor and tobacco be advisable especially in view of the drain upon the treasury which must attend the payment of arrear of pension a comparison however of the amount of taxis collect under the vary rate of taxation which have at different time prevail suggest the intimation that some reduction may soon be make without material diminution of the revenue

 the tariff law also need revision but that a due regard may be pay to the conflict interest of our citizen important change should be make with caution if a careful revision can not be make at this session a commission such as be lately approve by the senate and be now recommend by the secretary of the treasury would doubtless lighten the labor ofcongress whenever this subject shall be bring to its consideration

 the accompanying report of the secretary of war will make known to you the operation of that department for the past year

 he suggest measure for promote the efficiency of the army without add to the number of its officer and recommend the legislation necessary to increase the number of enlisted man to 30,000 the maximum allow bylaw

 this he deem necessary to maintain quietude on our ever shift frontier;to preserve peace and suppress disorder and maraud in new settlements;to protect settler and their property against indians and indians against the encroachment of intruder and to enable peaceable immigrant to establish home in the most remote part of our country

 the army be now necessarily scatter over such a vast extent of territory that whenever an outbreak occur reenforcement must be hurry from many quarter over great distance and always at heavy cost for transportation of man horse wagon and supply

 i concur in the recommendation of the secretary for increase thearmy to the strength of 30,000 enlist man

 it appear by the secretary 's report that in the absence of disturbance on the frontier the troop have be actively employ in collect theindians hitherto hostile and locate they on their proper reservations;that sit bull and his adherent be now prisoner at fort randall;that the utes have be move to their new reservation in utah that during the recent outbreak of the apaches it be necessary to reenforce the garrison in arizona by troop withdraw from new mexico and that some of the apaches be now hold prisoner for trial while some have escape and the majority of the tribe be now on their reservation

 there be need of legislation to prevent intrusion upon the land set apart for the indians a large military force at great expense be now require to patrol the boundary line between kansas and the indian territory the only punishment that can at present be inflict be the forcible removal of the intruder and the imposition of a pecuniary fine which in most case it be impossible to collect there should be a penalty by imprisonment in such case

 the separate organization of the signal service be urge by the secretary of war and a full statement of the advantage of such permanent organization be present in the report of the chief signal officer a detailed account of the useful work perform by the signal corps and the weather bureau be also give in that report

 i ask attention to the statement of the secretary of war regard the requisition frequently make by the indian bureau upon the subsistencedepartment of the army for the casual support of band and tribe of indians whose appropriation be exhaust the war department should not be leave by reason of inadequate provision for the indian bureau to contribute for the maintenance of indians

 the actual expenditure of that department for the fiscal year endingjune 30 1881 be $ 42,122,201.39 the appropriation for the year 1882were $ 44,889,725.42 the estimate for 1883 be $ 44,541,276.91

 the report of the secretary of the navy exhibit the condition of that branch of the service and present valuable suggestion for its improvement i call your especial attention also to the appended report of the advisoryboard which he convene to devise suitable measure for increase the efficiency of the navy and particularly to report as to the character and number of vessel necessary to place it upon a footing commensurate with the necessity of the government

 i can not too strongly urge upon you my conviction that every consideration of national safety economy and honor imperatively demand a thorough rehabilitation of our navy

 with a full appreciation of the fact that compliance with the suggestion of the head of that department and of the advisory board must involve a large expenditure of the public money i earnestly recommend such appropriation as will accomplish an end which seem to i so desirable

 nothing can be more inconsistent with true public economy than withhold the mean necessary to accomplish the object intrust by the constitution to the national legislature one of those object and one which be of paramount importance be declare by our fundamental law to be the provision for the common defense surely nothing be more essential to the defense of the united states and of all our people than the efficiency of our navy

 we have for many year maintain with foreign government the relation of honorable peace and that such relation may be permanent be desire by every patriotic citizen of the republic but if we heed the teaching of history we shall not forget that in the life of every nation emergency may arise when a resort to arm can alone save it from dishonor

 no danger from abroad now threaten this people nor have we any cause to distrust the friendly profession of other government but for avoid as well as for repel danger that may threaten we in the future we must be prepare to enforce any policy which we think wise to adopt

 we must be ready to defend our harbor against aggression to protect by the distribution of our ship of war over the highway of commerce the varied interest of our foreign trade and the person and property of our citizen abroad to maintain everywhere the honor of our flag and the distinguished position which we may rightfully claim among the nation of the world

 the report of the postmaster general be a gratifying exhibit of the growth and efficiency of the postal service

 the receipt from postage and other ordinary source during the past fiscal year be $ 36,489,816.58 the receipt from the money order business be $ 295,581.39 make a total of $ 36,785,397.97 the expenditure for the fiscal year be $ 39,251,736.46 the deficit supply out of the generaltreasury be $ 2,481,129.35 or 6.3 per cent of the amount expend the receipt be $ 3,469,918.63 in excess of those of the previous year and$4,575,397.97 in excess of the estimate make two year ago before the present period of business prosperity have fairly begin

 the whole number of letter mail in this country in the last fiscal year exceed 1,000,000,000

 the registry system be report to be in excellent condition having be remodel during the past four year with good result the amount of registration fee collect during the last fiscal year be $ 712,882.20,an increase over the fiscal year end june 30 1877 of $ 345,443.40

 the entire number of letter and package register during the year be 8,338,919 of which only 2,061 be lose or destroy in transit

 the operation of the money order system be multiply yearly under the impulse of immigration of the rapid development of the new states and territories and the consequent demand for additional mean of intercommunication and exchange

 during the past year 338 additional money order office have be establish make a total of 5,499 in operation at the date of this report

 during the year the domestic money order aggregate in value 105,075,769.35

 a modification of the system be suggest reduce the fee for money order not exceed $ 5 from 10 cent to 5 cent and make the maximum limit 100 in place of $ 50

 legislation for the disposition of unclaimed money order in the possession of the post office department be recommend in view of the fact that their total value now exceed $ 1,000,000

 the attention of congress be again invite to the subject of establish a system of saving depository in connection with the post office department

 the statistic of mail transportation show that during the past year railroad route have be increase in length 6,249 mile and in cost $ 1,114,382,while steamboat route have be decrease in length 2,182 mile and in cost $ 134,054 the so call star route have be decrease in length3,949 mile and in cost $ 364,144

 nearly all of the more expensive route have be supersede by railroad service the cost of the star service must therefore rapidly decrease in the western states and territories

 the postmaster general however call attention to the constantly increase cost of the railway mail service as a serious difficulty in the way of make the department self sustaining

 our postal intercourse with foreign country have keep pace with the growth of the domestic service within the past year several country and colony have declare their adhesion to the postal union it now include all those which have an organized postal service except bolivia costarica new zealand and the british colony in australia

 as have be already state great reduction have recently be make in the expense of the star route service the investigation of the department of justice and the post office department have result in the presentation of indictment against person formerly connect with that service accuse they of offense against the united states i have enjoin upon the official who be charge with the conduct of the case on the part of the government and upon the eminent counsel who before my accession to the presidency be call to their assistance the duty of prosecute with the utmost vigor of the law all person who may be find chargeable with fraud upon the postal service

 the acting attorney general call attention to the necessity of modify the present system of the court of the united states a necessity dueto the large increase of business especially in the supreme court litigation in our federal tribunal became greatly expand after the close of the late war so long as that expansion might be attributable to the abnormal condition in which the community find itself immediately after the return of peace prudence require that no change be make in the constitution of our judicial tribunal but it have now become apparent that an immense increase of litigation have directly result from the wonderful growth and development of the country there be no ground for belief that the business of the united states court will ever be less in volume than at present indeed that it be likely to be much great be generally recognize by the bench and bar

 in view of the fact that congress have already give much consideration to this subject i make no suggestion as to detail but express the hope that your deliberation may result in such legislation as will give early relief to our overburden court

 the acting attorney general also call attention to the disturbance of the public tranquillity during the past year in the territory of arizona a band of armed desperado know as cowboys probably number from fifty to one hundred man have be engage for month in commit act of lawlessness and brutality which the local authority have be unable to repress the depredation of these cowboys have also extend intomexico which the marauder reach from the arizona frontier with every disposition to meet the exigency of the case i be embarrass by lack of authority to deal with they effectually the punishment of crime commit within arizona should ordinarily of course be leave to the territorial authority but it be worthy consideration whether act which necessarily tend to embroil the united states with neighboring government should not be declare crime against the united states some of the incursion allude to may perhaps be within the scope of the law u. s. revised statutes sec 5286 forbid military expedition or enterprise against friendly state but in view of the speedy assembling of your body i have prefer to await such legislation as in your wisdom the occasion may seem to demand

 it may perhaps be think proper to provide that the setting on foot within our own territory of brigandage and armed marauding expedition against friendly nation and their citizen shall be punishable as an offense against the united states

 i will add that in the event of a request from the territorial government for protection by the united states against domestic violence this government would be powerless to render assistance

 the act of 1795 chapter 36 pass at a time when territorial government receive little attention from congress enforce this duty of the unitedstates only as to the state government but the act of 1807 chapter 39,applied also to territories this law seem to have remain in force until the revision of the statute when the provision for the territories be drop i be not advise whether this alteration be intentional or accidental but as it seem to i that the territories should be offer the protection which be accord to the staten by the constitution i suggest legislation to that end

 it seem to i too that whatever view may prevail as to the policy of recent legislation by which the army have cease to be a part of the posse comitatus an exception might well be make for permit the military to assist the civil territorial authority in enforce the law of the united states this use of the army would not seem to be within the allege evil against which that legislation be aim from sparseness of population and other circumstance it be often quite impracticable to summon a civil posse in place where officer of justice require assistance and where a military force be within easy reach

 the report of the secretary of the interior with accompany document present an elaborate account of the business of that department a summary of it would be too extended for this place i ask your careful attention to the report itself

 prominent among the matter which challenge the attention of congress at its present session be the management of our indian affair while this question have be a cause of trouble and embarrassment from the infancy of the government it be but recently that any effort have be make for its solution at once serious determined consistent and promise success

 it have be easy to resort to convenient makeshift for tide over temporary difficulty than to grapple with the great permanent problem and accordingly the easy course have almost invariably be pursue

 it be natural at a time when the national territory seem almost illimitable and contain many million of acre far outside the bound of civilized settlement that a policy should have be initiate which more than aught else have be the fruitful source of our indian complication

 i refer of course to the policy of deal with the various indian tribe as separate nationality of relegate they by treaty stipulation to the occupancy of immense reservation in the west and of encourage they to live a savage life undisturbe by any earnest and well direct effort to bring they under the influence of civilization

 the unsatisfactory result which have spring from this policy be become apparent to all

 as the white settlement have crowd the border of the reservation the indians sometimes contentedly and sometimes against their will have be transfer to other hunting ground from which they have again be dislodge whenever their new find home have be desire by the adventurous settler

 these removal and the frontier collision by which they have often be precede have lead to frequent and disastrous conflict between the race

 it be profitless to discuss here which of they have be chiefly responsible for the disturbance whose recital occupy so large a space upon the page of our history

 we have to deal with the appalling fact that though thousand of life have be sacrifice and hundred of million of dollar expend in the attempt to solve the indian problem it have until within the past few year seem scarcely near a solution than it be half a century ago but thegovernment have of late be cautiously but steadily feel its way to the adoption of a policy which have already produce gratifying result and which in my judgment be likely if congress and the executive accord in its support to relieve we ere long from the difficulty which have hitherto beset we

 for the success of the effort now make to introduce among the indians the custom and pursuit of civilized life and gradually to absorb they into the mass of our citizen share their right and holden to their responsibility there be imperative need for legislative action

 my suggestion in that regard will be chiefly such as have be already call to the attention of congress and have receive to some extent its consideration

 first i recommend the passage of an act make the law of the variousstate and territories applicable to the indian reservation within their border and extend the law of the state of arkansas to the portion of the indian territory not occupy by the five civilized tribes

 the indian should receive the protection of the law he should be allow to maintain in court his right of person and property he have repeatedly beg for this privilege its exercise would be very valuable to he in his progress toward civilization

 second of even great importance be a measure which have be frequently recommend by my predecessor in office and in furtherance of which several bill have be from time to time introduce in both houses of congress the enactment of a general law permit the allotment in severalty to such indians at least as desire it of a reasonable quantity of land secure to they by patent and for their own protection make inalienable for twenty or twenty five year be demand for their present welfare and their permanent advancement

 in return for such considerate action on the part of the government there be reason to believe that the indians in large number would be persuade to sever their tribal relation and to engage at once in agricultural pursuit many of they realize the fact that their hunting day be over and that it be now for their good interest to conform their manner of life to the new order of thing by no great inducement than the assurance of permanent title to the soil can they be lead to engage in the occupation of till it

 the well attest report of their increase interest in husbandry justify the hope and belief that the enactment of such a statute as i recommend would be at once attend with gratifying result a resort to the allotment system would have a direct and powerful influence in dissolve the tribal bond which be so prominent a feature of savage life and which tend so strongly to perpetuate it

 third i advise a liberal appropriation for the support of indian school because of my confident belief that such a course be consistent with the wise economy

 even among the most uncultivated indian tribe there be report to be a general and urgent desire on the part of the chief and old member for the education of their child it be unfortunate in view of this fact that during the past year the mean which have be at the command of the interior department for the purpose of indian instruction have prove to be utterly inadequate

 the success of the school which be in operation at hampton carlisle and forest grove should not only encourage a more generous provision for the support of those institution but should prompt the establishment of other of a similar character

 they be doubtless much more potent for good than the day school upon the reservation as the pupil be altogether separate from the surrounding of savage life and bring into constant contact with civilization

 there be many other phase of this subject which be of great interest but which can not be include within the become limit of this communication they be discuss ably in the report of the secretary of the interior and the commissioner of indian affairs

 for many year the executive in his annual message to congress have urge the necessity of stringent legislation for the suppression of polygamy in the territories and especially in the territory of utah the exist statute for the punishment of this odious crime so revolt to the moral and religious sense of christendom have be persistently and contemptuously violate ever since its enactment indeed in spite of commendable effort on the part of the authority who represent the united states in thatterritory the law have in very rare instance be enforce and for a cause to which reference will presently be make be practically a dead letter

 the fact that adherent of the mormon church which rest upon polygamy as its corner stone have recently be people in large number idaho arizona and other of our western territories be well calculate to excite the lively interest and apprehension it impose upon congress and theexecutive the duty of array against this barbarous system all the power which under the constitution and the law they can wield for its destruction

 reference have be already make to the obstacle which the united states officer have encounter in their effort to punish violation of law prominent among these obstacle be the difficulty of procure legal evidence sufficient to warrant a conviction even in the case of the most notorious offender

 your attention be call to a recent opinion of the supreme court of the united states explain its judgment of reversal in the case of miles who have be convict of bigamy in utah the court refer to the fact that the secrecy attend the celebration of marriage in that territory make the proof of polygamy very difficult and the propriety be suggest of modify the law of evidence which now make a wife incompetent to testify against her husband

 this suggestion be approve i recommend also the passage of an act provide that in the territories of the united states the fact that a woman have be marry to a person charge with bigamy shall not disqualify she as a witness upon his trial for that offense i far recommend legislation by which any person solemnize a marriage in any of the territories shall be require under stringent penalty for neglect or refusal to file a certificate of such marriage in the supreme court of the territory

 doubtless congress may devise other practicable measure for obviate the difficulty which have hitherto attend the effort to suppress this iniquity i assure you of my determined purpose to cooperate with you in any lawful and discreet measure which may be propose to that end

 although our system of government do not contemplate that the nation should provide or support a system for the education of our people no measure calculate to promote that general intelligence and virtue upon which the perpetuity of our institution so greatly depend have ever be regard with indifference by congress or the executive

 a large portion of the public domain have be from time to time devote to the promotion of education

 there be now a special reason why by set apart the proceed of its sale of public land or by some other course the government should aid the work of education many who now exercise the right of suffrage be unable to read the ballot which they cast upon many who have just emerge from a condition of slavery be suddenly devolve the responsibility of citizenship in that portion of the country most impoverish by war i have be pleased to learn from the report of the commissioner of education that there have lately be a commendable increase of interest and effort for their instruction but all that can be do by local legislation and private generosity should be supplement by such aid as can be constitutionally afford by the national government

 i would suggest that if any fund be dedicate to this purpose it maybe wisely distribute in the different states accord to the ratio of illiteracy as by this mean those locality which be most in need of such assistance will reap its special benefit

 the report of the commissioner of agriculture exhibit the result of the experiment in which that department have be engage during the past year and make important suggestion in reference to the agricultural development of the country

 the steady increase of our population and the consequent addition to the number of those engage in the pursuit of husbandry be give to this department a grow dignity and importance the commissioner 's suggestion touch its capacity for great usefulness deserve attention as it more and more commend itself to the interest which it be create to promote

 it appear from the report of the commissioner of pensions that since1860 789,063 original pension claim have be file 450,949 of these have be allow and inscribe on the pension roll 72,539 have be reject and abandon be 13 + per cent of the whole number of claim settle

 there be now pende for settlement 265,575 original pension claims,227,040 of which be file prior to july 1 1880 these when allow will involve the payment of arrear from the date of discharge in case of an invalid and from date of death or termination of a prior right in all other case

 from all the datum obtainable it be estimate that 15 per cent of the number of claim now pende will be reject or abandon this would show the probable rejection of 34,040 case and the probable admission of about 193,000 claim all of which involve the payment of arrear of pension

 with the present force employ the number of adjudication remain the same and no new business intervene this number of claim 193,000)could be act upon in a period of six year and take january 1 1884,as a near period from which to estimate in each case an average amount of arrear it be find that every case allow would require for the first payment upon it the sum of $ 1,350 multiply this amount by the whole number of probable admission give $ 250,000,000 as the sum require for first payment this represent the sum which must be pay upon claim which be file before july 1 1880 and be now pende and entitle to the benefit of the arrear act from this amount $ 250,000,000 may be deduct from ten to fifteen million for case where the claimant dying there be no person who under the law would be entitle to succeed to the pension leave $ 235,000,000 as the probable amount to be pay

 in these estimate no account have be take of the 38,500 case file since june 30 1880 and now pende which must receive attention as current business but which do not involve the payment of any arrear beyond the date of file the claim of this number it be estimate that 86 per cent will be allow

 as have be state with the present force of the pension bureau 675clerks it be estimate that it will take six year to dispose of the claim now pende

 it be state by the commissioner of pensions that by an addition of250 clerk increase the adjudicate force rather than the mechanical)double the amount of work could be accomplish so that these case could be act upon within three year

 aside from the consideration of justice which may be urge for a speedy settlement of the claim now on the file of the pension office it be no less important on the score of economy inasmuch as fully one third of the clerical force of the office be now wholly occupy in give attention to correspondence with the thousand of claimant whose case have be on the file for the past eighteen year the fact that a sum so enormous must be expend by the government to meet demand for arrear of pension be an admonition to congress and the executive to give cautious consideration to any similar project in the future the great temptation to the presentation of fictitious claim afford by the fact that the average sum obtain upon each application be $ 1,300 lead i to suggest the propriety of make some special appropriation for the prevention of fraud

 i advise appropriation for such internal improvement as the wisdom of congress may deem to be of public importance the necessity of improve the navigation of the mississippi river justify a special allusion to that subject i suggest the adoption of some measure for the removal of obstruction which now impede the navigation of that great channel of commerce

 in my letter accept the nomination for the vice presidency i state that in my judgment--

 no man should be the incumbent of an office the duty of which he be for any cause unfit to perform who be lack in the ability fidelity or integrity which a proper administration of such office demand this sentiment would doubtless meet with general acquiescence but opinion have be widely divide upon the wisdom and practicability of the various reformatory scheme which have be suggest and of certain propose regulation govern appointment to public office
 the efficiency of such regulation have be distrust mainly because they have seem to exalt mere educational and abstract test above general business capacity and even special fitness for the particular work in hand it seem to i that the rule which should be apply to the management of the public service may properly conform in the main to such as regulate the conduct of successful private business
 original appointment should be base upon ascertain fitness
 the tenure of office should be stable
 position of responsibility should so far as practicable be fill by the promotion of worthy and efficient officer
 the investigation of all complaint and the punishment of all official misconduct should be prompt and thorough
 the view express in the forego letter be those which will govern my administration of the executive office they be doubtless share by all intelligent and patriotic citizen however divergent in their opinion as to the good method of put they into practical operation
 for example the assertion that original appointment should be base upon ascertain fitness be not open to dispute

 but the question how in practice such fitness can be most effectually ascertained be one which have for year excited interest and discussion the measure which with slight variation in its detail have lately be urge upon the attention of congress and the executive have as its principal feature the scheme of competitive examination save for certain exception which need not here be specify this plan would allow admission to the service only in its low grade and would accordingly demand that all vacancy in high position should be fill by promotion alone in these particular it be in conformity with the exist civil service system of great britain and indeed the success which have attend that system in the country of its birth be the strong argument which have be urge for its adoption here

 the fact should not however be overlook that there be certain feature of the english system which have not generally be receive with favor in this country even among the foremost advocate of civil service reform

 among they be
 1 a tenure of office winch be substantially a life tenure
 2 a limitation of the maximum age at which an applicant can enter the service whereby all man in middle life or old be with some exception rigidly exclude
 3 a retire allowance upon go out of office

 these three element be as important factor of the problem as any of the other to eliminate they from the english system would effect a most radical change in its theory and practice

 the avow purpose of that system be to induce the educate young man of the country to devote their life to public employment by an assurance that having once enter upon it they need never leave it and that after voluntary retirement they shall be the recipient of an annual pension that this system as an entirety have prove very successful in great britain seem to be generally concede even by those who once oppose its adoption

 to a statute which should incorporate all its essential feature i should feel bound to give my approval but whether it would be for the good interest of the public to fix upon an expedient for immediate and extensive application which embrace certain feature of the english system but exclude or ignore other of equal importance may be seriously doubt even by those who be impressed as i be myself with the grave importance of correct the evil which inhere in the present method of appointment

 if for example the english rule which shut out person above the age of 25 year from a large number of public employment be not to be make an essential part of our own system it be questionable whether the attainment of the high number of mark at a competitive examination should be the criterion by which all application for appointment should be put to test and under similar condition it may also be question whether admission to the service should be strictly limit to its low rank

 there be very many characteristic which go to make a model civil servant prominent among they be probity industry good sense good habit good temper patience order courtesy tact self reliance manly deference to superior officer and manly consideration for inferior the absence of these trait be not supply by wide knowledge of book or by promptitude in answer question or by any other quality likely to be bring to light by competitive examination

 to make success in such a contest therefore an indispensable condition of public employment would very likely result in the practical exclusion of the old applicant even though they might possess qualification far superior to their young and more brilliant competitor

 these suggestion must not be regard as evince any spirit of opposition to the competitive plan which have be to some extent successfully employ already and which may hereafter vindicate the claim of its most earnest supporter but it ought to be seriously consider whether the application of the same educational standard to person of mature year and to young man fresh from school and college would not be likely to exalt mere intellectual proficiency above other quality of equal or great importance

 another feature of the propose system be the selection by promotion of all officer of the government above the low grade except such as would fairly be regard as exponent of the policy of the executive and the principle of the dominant party

 to afford encouragement to faithful public servant by exciting in their mind the hope of promotion if they be find to merit it be much to be desire

 but would it be wise to adopt a rule so rigid as to permit no other mode of supply the intermediate walk of the service

 there be many person who fill subordinate position with great credit but lack those quality which be requisite for high post of duty;and besides the mode of thought and action of one whose service in a governmental bureau have be long continue be often so cramp by routine procedure as almost to disqualify he from institute change require by the public interest an infusion of new blood from time to time into the middle rank of the service might be very beneficial in its result

 the subject under discussion be one of grave importance the evil which be complain of can not be eradicate at once the work must be gradual

 the present english system be a growth of year and be not create by a single stroke of executive or legislative action

 its beginning be find in an order in council promulgate in 1855,and it be after patient and cautious scrutiny of its working that fifteen year later it take its present shape

 five year after the issuance of the order in council and at a time when resort have be have to competitive examination as an experiment much more extensively than have yet be the case in this country a select committee of the house of commons make a report to that house which declare its approval of the competitive plan deprecate nevertheless any precipitancy in its general adoption as likely to endanger its ultimate success

 during this tentative period the result of the two method of pass examination and competitive examination be closely watch and compare it may be that before we confine ourselves upon this important question within the stringent bound of statutory enactment we may profitably await the result of further inquiry and experiment

 the submission of a portion of the nomination to a central board of examiner select solely for test the qualification of applicant may perhaps without resort to the competitive test put an end to the mischief which attend the present system of appointment and it may be feasible to vest in such a board a wide discretion to ascertain the characteristic and attainment of candidate in those particular which i have already refer to as be no less important than mere intellectual attainment

 if congress should deem it advisable at the present session to establish competitive test for admission to the service no doubt such as have be suggest shall deter i from give the measure my earnest support

 and i urgently recommend should there be a failure to pass any other act upon this subject that an appropriation of $ 25,000 per year may be make for the enforcement of section 1753 of the revised statutes

 with the aid thus afford i i shall strive to execute the provision of that law accord to its letter and spirit

 i be unwilling in justice to the present civil servant of the government to dismiss this subject without declare my dissent from the severe and almost indiscriminate censure with which they have be recently assail that they be as a class indolent inefficient and corrupt be a statement which have be often make and widely credit but when the extent variety delicacy and importance of their duty be consider the great majority of the employee of the government be in my judgment deserve of high commendation

 the continue decline of the merchant marine of the united states be greatly to be deplore in view of the fact that we furnish so large a proportion of the freight of the commercial world and that our shipment be steadily and rapidly increase it be cause of surprise that not only be our navigation interest diminishing but it be less than when our export and import be not half so large as now either in bulk or value there must be some peculiar hindrance to the development of this interest or the enterprise and energy of american mechanic and capitalist would have keep this country at least abreast of our rival in the friendly contest for ocean supremacy

 the substitution of iron for wood and of steam for sail have work great revolution in the carry trade of the world but these change could not have be adverse to america if we have give to our navigation interest a portion of the aid and protection which have be so wisely bestow upon our manufacture i commend the whole subject to the wisdom of congress with the suggestion that no question of great magnitude or far reach importance can engage their attention

 in 1875 the supreme court of the united states declare unconstitutional the statute of certain states which impose upon shipowner or consignee a tax of $ 1.50 for each passenger arrive from a foreign country or in lieu thereof require a bond to indemnify the state and local authority against expense for the future relief or support of such passenger since this decision the expense attend the care and supervision of immigrant have fall on the states at whose port they have land as a large majority of such immigrant immediately upon their arrival proceed to the inlandstates and the territories to seek permanent home it be manifestly unjust to impose upon the state whose shore they first reach the burden which it now bear for this reason and because of the national importance of the subject i recommend legislation regard the supervision and transitory care of immigrant at the port of debarkation

 i regret to state that the people of alaska have reason to complain that they be as yet unprovide with any form of government by which life or property can be protect while the extent of its population do not justify the application of the costly machinery of territorial administration there be immediate necessity for constitute such a form of government as will promote the education of the people and secure the administration of justice

 the senate at its last session pass a bill provide for the construction of a building for the library of congress but it fail to become a law the provision of suitable protection for this great collection of book and for the copyright department connect with it have become a subject of national importance and should receive prompt attention

 the report of the commissioners of the district of columbia herewith transmit will inform you fully of the condition of the affair of thedistrict

 they urge the vital importance of legislation for the reclamation and improvement of the marsh and for the establishment of the harbor line along the potomac river front

 it be represent that in their present condition these marsh seriously affect the health of the resident of the adjacent part of the city and that they greatly mar the general aspect of the park in which stand thewashington monument this improvement would add to that park and to the park south of the executive mansion a large area of valuable land and would transform what be now believe to be a dangerous nuisance into an attractive landscape extend to the river front

 they recommend the removal of the steam railway line from the surface of the street of the city and the location of the necessary depot in such place as may be convenient for the public accommodation and they call attention to the deficiency of the water supply which seriously affect the material prosperity of the city and the health and comfort of its inhabitant

 i commend these subject to your favorable consideration
 the importance of timely legislation with respect to the ascertainment and declaration of the vote for presidential elector be sharply call to the attention of the people more than four year ago

 it be to be hope that some well define measure may be devise before another national election which will render unnecessary a resort to any expedient of a temporary character for the determination of question upon contest return

 question which concern the very existence of the government and the liberty of the people be suggest by the prolonged illness of the late president and his consequent incapacity to perform the function of his office

 it be provide by the second article of the constitution in the fifth clause of its first section that in case of the removal of the president from office or of his death resignation or inability to discharge the power and duty of the said office the same shall devolve on the vice president

 what be the intendment of the constitution in its specification of inability to discharge the power and duty of the said office as one of the contingency which call the vice president to the exercise of presidential function

 be the inability limit in its nature to long continue intellectual incapacity or have it a broad import

 what must be its extent and duration

 how must its existence be establish

to the senate of the united states
 after careful consideration of senate bill no 71 entitle an act to execute certain treaty stipulation relate to chinese i herewith return it to the senate in which it originate with my objection to its passage
 a nation be justify in repudiate its treaty obligation only when they be in conflict with great paramount interest even then all possible reasonable mean for modify or change those obligation by mutual agreement should be exhaust before resort to the supreme fight of refusal to comply with they
 these rule have govern the united states in their past intercourse with other power as one of the family of nation i be persuade that if congress can feel that this act violate the faith of the nation as pledge to china it will concur with i in reject this particular mode of regulate chinese immigration and will endeavor to find another which shall meet the expectation of the people of the united states without come in conflict with the right of china
 the present treaty relation between that power and the united states spring from an antagonism which arise between our paramount domestic interest and our previous relation
 the treaty commonly know as the burlingame treaty confer upon chinese subject the right of voluntary emigration to the united states for the purpose of curiosity or trade or as permanent resident and be in all respect reciprocal as to citizen of the united states in china it give to the voluntary emigrant come to the united states the right to travel there or to reside there with all the privilege immunity or exemption enjoy by the citizen or subject of the most favored nation
 under the operation of this treaty it be find that the institution of the united states and the character of its people and their mean of obtain a livelihood might be seriously affect by the unrestricted introduction of chinese labor congress attempt to alleviate this condition by legislation but the act which it pass prove to be in violation of our treaty obligation and be return by the president with his objection fail to become a law
 diplomatic relief be then seek a new treaty be conclude with china without abrogate the burlingame treaty it be agree to modify it so far that the government of the united states might regulate limit or suspend the coming of chinese laborer to the united states or their residence therein but that it should not absolutely prohibit they and that the limitation or suspension should be reasonable and should apply only to chinese who might go to the united states as laborer other class not be include in the limitation this treaty be unilateral not reciprocal it be a concession from china to the united states in limitation of the right which she be enjoy under the burlingame treaty it leave we by our own act to determine when and how we will enforce those limitation china may therefore fairly have a right to expect that in enforce they we will take good care not to overstep the grant and take more than have be concede to we
 it be but a year since this new treaty under the operation of the constitution become part of the supreme law of the land and the present act be the first attempt to exercise the more enlarged power which it relinquish to the united states
 in its first article the united states be empower to decide whether the come of chinese laborer to the united states or their residence therein affect or threaten to affect our interest or to endanger good order either within the whole country or in any part of it the act recite that in the opinion of the government of the united states the coming of chinese laborer to this country endanger the good order of certain locality thereof but the act itself be much broad than the recital it act upon residence as well as immigration and its provision be effective throughout the united states i think it may fairly be accept as an expression of the opinion of congress that the coming of such laborer to the united states or their residence here affect our interest and endanger good order throughout the country on this point i should feel it my duty to accept the view of congress
 the first article far confer the power upon this government to regulate limit or suspend but not actually to prohibit the coming of such laborer to or their residence in the united states the negotiator of the treaty have record with unusual fullness their understanding of the sense and meaning with which these word be use
 as to the class of person to be affect by the treaty the americans insert in their draft a provision that the word chinese laborer signify all immigration other than that for teaching trade travel study and curiosity the chinese object to this that it operate to include artisan in the class of laborer whose immigration might be forbid the americans reply that they could not consent that artisan shall be exclude from the class of chinese laborer for it be this very competition of skilled labor in the city where the chinese labor immigration concentrate which have cause the embarrassment and popular discontent in the subsequent negotiation this definition drop out and do not appear in the treaty article ii of the treaty confer the right privilege immunity and exemption which be accord to citizen and subject of the most favored nation upon chinese subject proceed to the united states as teacher student merchant or from curiosity the american commissioner report that the chinese government claim that in this article they do by exclusion provide that nobody should be entitle to claim the benefit of the general provision of the burlingame treaty but those who might go to the united states in those capacity or for those purpose i accept this as the definition of the word laborer as use in the treaty
 as to the power of legislate respect this class of person the new treaty provide that we may not absolutely prohibit their coming or their residence the chinese commissioner give notice in the outset that they would never agree to a prohibition of voluntary emigration notwithstanding this the united states commissioner submit a draft in which it be provide that the united states might regulate limit suspend or prohibit it the chinese refuse to accept this the americans reply that they be willing to consult the wish of the chinese government in preserve the principle of free intercourse between the people of the two country as establish by exist treaty provide that the right of the united states government to use its discretion in guard against any possible evil of immigration of chinese laborer be distinctly recognize therefore if such concession remove all difficulty on the part of the chinese commissioner but only in that case the united states commissioner will agree to remove the word 39;prohibit&#39 from their article and to use the word 39;regulate limit or suspend "&#39 the chinese reply to this can only be infer from the fact that in the place of an agreement as propose by our commissioner that we might prohibit the coming or residence of chinese laborer there be insert in the treaty an agreement that we might not do it
 the remain word regulate limit and suspend first appear in the american draft when it be submit to the chinese they say
 we infer that of the phrase regulate limit suspend or prohibit the first be a general expression refer to the other we be entirely ready to negotiate with your excellency to the end that a limitation either in point of time or of number may be fix upon the emigration of chinese laborer to the united states
 at a subsequent interview they say that by limitation in number they mean for example that the united states have as they suppose a record of the number of immigrant in each year as well as the total number of chinese now there that no more should be allow to go in any one year in future than either the great number which have go in any year in the past or that the total number should never be allow to exceed the number now there as to limitation of time they mean for example that chinese should be allow to go in alternate year or every third year or for example that they should not be allow to go for two three or five year
 at a subsequent conference the americans say
 the chinese commissioner have in their project explicitly recognize the right of the united states to use some discretion and have propose a limitation as to time and number this be the right to regulate limit or suspend
 in one of the conference the chinese ask the americans whether they could give they any idea of the law which would be pass to carry the power into execution the americans answer that this could hardly be do that the united states government might never deem it necessary to exercise this power it would depend upon circumstance if chinese immigration concentrate in city where it threaten public order or if it confine itself to locality where it be an injury to the interest of the american people the government of the united states would undoubtedly take step to prevent such accumulation of chinese if on the contrary there be no large immigration or if there be section of the country where such immigration be clearly beneficial then the legislation of the united states under this power would be adapt to such circumstance for example there might be a demand for chinese labor in the south and a surplus of such labor in california and congress might legislate in accordance with these fact in general the legislation would be in view of and depend upon the circumstance of the situation at the moment such legislation become necessary the chinese commissioner say this explanation be satisfactory that they have not intend to ask for a draft of any special act but for some general idea how the power would be exercise what have just be say give they the explanation which they want
 with this entire accord as to the meaning of the word they be about to employ and the object of the legislation which might be have in consequence the party sign the treaty in article i of which-- the government of china agree that the government of the united states may regulate limit or suspend such coming or residence but may not absolutely prohibit it the limitation or suspension shall be reasonable and shall apply only to chinese who may go to the united states as laborer other class not be include in the limitation legislation take in regard to chinese laborer will be of such a character only as be necessary to enforce the regulation limitation or suspension of immigration
 the first section of the act provide that--
 from and after the expiration of sixty day next after the passage of this act and until the expiration of twenty year next after the passage of this act the coming of chinese laborer be and the same be hereby suspend and during such suspension it shall not be lawful for any chinese laborer to come or having so come after the expiration of say sixty day to remain within the united states
 the examination which i have make of the treaty and of the declaration which its negotiator have leave on record of the meaning of its language leave no doubt in my mind that neither contract party in conclude the treaty of 1880 contemplate the passage of an act prohibit immigration for twenty year which be nearly a generation or think that such a period would be a reasonable suspension or limitation or intend to change the provision of the burlingame treaty to that extent i regard this provision of the act as a breach of our national faith and be unable to bring myself in harmony with the view of congress on this vital point the honor of the country constrain i to return the act with this objection to its passage
 deeply convinced of the necessity of some legislation on this subject and concur fully with congress in many of the object which be seek to be accomplish i avail myself of the opportunity to point out some other feature of the present act which in my opinion can be modify to advantage
 the class of chinese who still enjoy the protection of the burlingame treaty be entitle to the privilege immunity and exemption accord to citizen and subject of the most favored nation we have treaty with many power which permit their citizen and subject to reside within the united states and carry on business under the same law and regulation which be enforce against citizen of the united states i think it may be doubt whether provision require personal registration and the taking out of passport which be not impose upon native can be require of chinese without express an opinion on that point i may invite the attention of congress to the fact that the system of personal registration and passport be undemocratic and hostile to the spirit of our institution i doubt the wisdom of put an enter wedge of this kind into our law a nation like the united states jealous of the liberty of its citizen may well hesitate before it incorporate into its polity a system which be fast disappear in europe before the progress of liberal institution a wide experience have show how futile such precaution be and how easily passport may be borrow exchange or even forge by person interested to do so
 if it be nevertheless think that a passport be the most convenient way for identify the chinese entitle to the protection of the burlingame treaty it may still be doubt whether they ought to be require to register it be certainly our duty under the burlingame treaty to make their stay in the united states in the operation of general law upon they as nearly like that of our own citizen as we can consistently with our right to shut out the laborer no good purpose be serve in require they to register
 my attention have be call by the chinese minister to the fact that the bill as it stand make no provision for the transit across the united states of chinese subject now reside in foreign country i think that this point may well claim the attention of congress in legislate on this subject
 i have say that good faith require we to suspend the immigration of chinese laborer for a less period than twenty year i now add that good policy point in the same direction
 our intercourse with china be of recent date our first treaty with that power be not yet forty year old it be only since we acquire california and establish a great seat of commerce on the pacific that we may be say to have break down the barrier which fence in that ancient monarchy the burlingame treaty naturally follow under the spirit which inspire it many thousand chinese laborer come to the united states no one can say that the country have not profit by their work they be largely instrumental in construct the railway which connect the atlantic with the pacific the states of the pacific slope be full of evidence of their industry enterprise profitable alike to the capitalist and to the laborer of caucasian origin would have lain dormant but for they a time have now come when it be suppose that they be not need and when it be think by congress and by those most acquainted with the subject that it be good to try to get along without they there may however be other section of the country where this specie of labor may be advantageously employ without interfere with the laborer of our own race in make the propose experiment it may be the part of wisdom as well as of good faith to fix the length of the experimental period with reference to this fact
 experience have show that the trade of the east be the key to national wealth and influence the opening of china to the commerce of the whole world have benefit no section of it more than the states of our own pacific slope the state of california and its great maritime port especially have reap enormous advantage from this source bless with an exceptional climate enjoy an unrivaled harbor with the rich of a great agricultural and mining state in its rear and the wealth of the whole union pour into it over its line of railway san francisco have before it an incalculable future if our friendly and amicable relation with asia remain undisturbed it need no argument to show that the policy which we now propose to adopt must have a direct tendency to repel oriental nation from we and to drive their trade and commerce into more friendly land it may be that the great and paramount interest of protect our labor from asiatic competition may justify we in a permanent adoption of this policy but it be wise in the first place to make a short experiment with a view hereafter of maintain permanently only such feature as time and experience may commend
 i transmit herewith copy of the paper relate to the recent treaty with china which accompany the confidential message of president hayes to the senate of the 10th january 1881 and also a copy of a memorandum respect the act herewith return which be hand to the secretary of state by the chinese minister in washington

to the senate and house of representatives
 i send herewith a copy of the circular invitation extend to all the independent country of north and south america to participate in a general congress to be hold in the city of washington on the 22d of november next for the purpose of consider and discuss the method of prevent war between the nation of america
 in give this invitation i be not unaware that there exist difference between several of the republics of south america which would militate against the happy result which might otherwise be expect from such an assemblage the difference indicate be such as exist between chile and peru between mexico and guatemala and between the states of central america
 it be hope that these difference would disappear before the time fix for the meeting of the congress this hope have not be realize
 having observe that the authority of the president to convene such a congress have be question i beg leave to state that the constitution confer upon the president the power by and with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaty and that this provision confer the power to take all requisite measure to initiate they and to this end the president may freely confer with one or several commissioner or delegate from other nation the congress contemplate by the invitation could only effect any valuable result by its conclusion eventually take the form of a treaty of peace between the states represent and besides the invitation to the states of north and south america be merely a preliminary act of which constitutionality or the want of it can hardly be affirm
 it have be suggest that while the international congress would have no power to affect the right of nationality there represent still congress might be unwilling to subject the exist treaty right of the united states on the isthmus and elsewhere on the continent to be cloud and render uncertain by the expression of the opinion of a congress compose largely of interested party
 i be glad to have it in my power to refer to the congress of the united states as i now do the propriety of convene the suggest international congress that i may thus be inform of its view which it will be my pleasure to carry out
 inquiry having be make by some of the republic invite whether it be intend that this international congress shall convene it be important that congress should at as early a day as be convenient inform i by resolution or otherwise of its opinion in the premise my action will be in harmony with such expression

 department of state washington november 29 1881
 sir the attitude of the united states with respect to the question of general peace on the american continent be well know through its persistent effort for year past to avert the evil of warfare or these effort fail to bring positive conflict to an end through pacific counsel or the advocacy of impartial arbitration this attitude have be consistently maintain and always with such fairness as to leave no room for impute to our government any motive except the humane and disintereste one of save the kindre states of the american continent from the burden of war the position of the united states as the lead power of the new world might well give to its government a claim to authoritative utterance for the purpose of quiet discord among its neighbor with all of whom the most friendly relation exist nevertheless the good office of this government be not and have not at any time be tender with a show of dictation or compulsion but only as exhibit the solicitous good will of a common friend
 send under the same date mutatis mutandi to the united states minister in the argentine republic bolivia brazil central america chile colombia mexico paraguay and uruguay peru and venezuela also directly to the minister of foreign relation of ecuador in which country the united states have no diplomatic representative
 for some year past a grow disposition have be manifest by certain states of central and south america to refer dispute affect grave question of international relationship and boundary to arbitration rather than to the sword it have be on several such occasion a source of profound satisfaction to the government of the united states to see that this country be in a large measure look to by all the american power as their friend and mediator
 the just and impartial counsel of the president in such case have never be withhold and his effort have be reward by the prevention of sanguinary strife or angry contention between people whom we regard as brother
 the existence of this grow tendency convince the president that the time be ripe for a proposal .that shall enlist the good will and active cooperation of all the states of the western hemisphere both north and south in the interest of humanity and for the common weal of nation
 he conceive that none of the government of america can be less alive than our own to the danger and horror of a state of war and especially of war between kinsman he be sure that none of the chief of government on the continent can be less sensitive than he be to the sacred duty of make every endeavor to do away with the chance of fratricidal strife and he look with hopeful confidence to such active assistance from they as will serve to show the broadness of our common humanity and the strength of the tie which bind we all together as a great and harmonious system of american commonwealths
 impress by these view the president extend to all the independent country of north and south america an earnest invitation to participate in a general congress to be hold in the city of washington on the 24th day of november 1882 for the purpose of consider and discuss the method of prevent war between the nation of america he desire that the attention of the congress shall be strictly confine to this one great object that its sole aim shall be to seek a way of permanently avert the horror of cruel and bloody combat between country oftenest of one blood and speech or the even bad calamity of internal commotion and civil strife that it shall regard the burdensome and far reach consequence of such struggle the legacy of exhausted finance of oppressive debt of onerous taxation of ruined city of paralyzed industry of devastated field of ruthless conscription of the slaughter of man of the grief of the widow and the orphan of imbittered resentment that long survive those who provoke they and heavily afflict the innocent generation that come after
 the president be especially desirous to have it understand that in put forth this invitation the united states do not assume the position of counseling or attempt through the voice of the congress to counsel any determinate solution of exist question which may now divide any of the country of america such question can not properly come before the congress its mission be high it be to provide for the interest of all in the future not to settle the individual difference of the present for this reason especially the president have indicate a day for the assembling of the congress so far in the future as to leave good ground for hope that by the time name the present situation on the south pacific coast will be happily terminate and that those engage in the contest may take peaceable part in the discussion and solution of the general question affect in an equal degree the well being of all
 it seem also desirable to disclaim in advance any purpose on the part of the united states to prejudge the issue to be present to the congress it be far from the intent of this government to appear before the congress as in any sense the protector of its neighbor or the predestined and necessary arbitrator of their dispute the united states will enter into the deliberation of the congress on the same footing as the other power represent and with the loyal determination to approach any propose solution not merely in its own interest or with a view to assert its own power but as a single member among many coordinate and coequal states so far as the influence of this government may be potential it will be exert in the direction of conciliate whatever conflicting interest of blood or government or historical tradition may necessarily come together in response to a call embrace such vast and diverse element
 you will present these view to the minister of foreign relation of mexico enlarging if need be in such term as will readily occur to you upon the great mission which it be within the power of the propose congress to accomplish in the interest of humanity and upon the firm purpose of the united states to maintain a position of the most absolute and impartial friendship toward all you will thereupon in the name of the president of the united states tender to his excellency the president of the mexican republic a formal invitation to send two commissioner to the congress provide with such power and instruction on behalf of their government as will enable they to consider the question bring before that body within the limit of submission contemplate by this invitation
 the united states as well as the other power will in like manner be represent by two commissioner so that equality and impartiality will be amply secure in the proceeding of the congress
 in deliver this invitation through the minister of foreign affair you will read this dispatch to he and leave with he a copy intimate that an answer be desire by this government as promptly as the just consideration of so important a proposition will permit
 i be sir your obedient servant
 james g. blaine

to the house of representatives of the united states
 herewith i return house bill no 2744 entitle an act to regulate the carriage of passenger by sea without my approval in do this i regret that i be not able to give my assent to an act which have receive the sanction of the majority of both houses of congress
 the object propose to be secure by the act be meritorious and philanthropic some correct and accurate legislation upon this subject be undoubtedly necessary steamship that bring large body of emigrant must be subject to strict legal enactment so as to prevent the passenger from be expose to hardship and suffering and such legislation should be make as will give they abundance of space and air and light protect their health by afford all reasonable comfort and convenience and by provide for the quantity and quality of the food to be furnish and all of the other essential of roomy safe and healthful accommodation in their passage across the sea
 a statute provide for all this be absolutely need and in the spirit of humane legislation must be enact the present act by most of its provision will obtain and secure this protection for such passenger and be it not for some serious error contain in it it would be most willingly approve by i
 my objection be these in the first section in line from 13 to 24 inclusive it be provide that the compartment or space etc shall be of sufficient dimension to allow for each and any passenger etc 100 cubic foot if the compartment or space be locate on the first deck next below the uppermost deck of the vessel etc or 120 cubic foot for each passenger etc if the compartment or space be locate on the second deck below the uppermost deck of the vessel etc it shall not be lawful to carry or bring passenger on any deck other than the two deck mention etc
 nearly all of the new and most of the improved ocean steamer have a spar deck which be above the main deck the main deck be in the old style of steamer the only uppermost deck the spar deck be a comparatively new feature of the large and costly steamship and be now practically the uppermost deck below this spar deck be the main deck because of the misuse of the word uppermost deck instead of the use of the word main deck by this act the result will be to exclude nearly all of the large steamship from carry passenger anywhere but on the main deck and on the deck below which be the steerage deck and to leave the orlop or low deck heretofore use for passenger useless and unoccupied by passenger this objection which be now present in connection with other that will be presently explain will if this act be enforce as it be now phrase render useless for passenger traffic and expose to heavy loss all of the great ocean steam line and it will also hinder emigration as there will not be ship enough that could accept these condition to carry all who may now wish to come
 the use of the new and the hitherto unknown term uppermost deck create this difficulty and i can not consent to have an abuse of term like this to operate thus injuriously to these large fleet of ship the passenger will not be benefit by such a statute but emigration will be hinder if not for a while almost prevent for many
 again the act in the first section from line 31 to line 35 inclusive provide and such passenger shall not be carry or bring in any between deck nor in any compartment etc the clear height of which be less than 7 foot between the deck of all ship be the beam they be about a foot in width the legal method of ascertain tonnage for the purpose of taxation be to measure between the beam from the floor to the ceiling if this become a law the space require would be 8 foot from floor to ceiling and this be impracticable for in all ship the space between deck be adjust in proportion to the dimension of the ship and if these space between deck be change so as not to correspond in their proportion with the dimension of the vessel the ship will not work well in the sea her sailing quality will be injure and she will be render unfit for service
 it be only in great ship of vast tonnage that the height between deck can be increase all the ordinary sized ship be necessarily construct with 7 foot space in the interval between the beam from the floor to the ceiling to adopt this act with this provision would be to drive out of the service of transport passenger most all of the steamship now in such trade and no practical good obtain by it for really with the exception of the narrow beam the space between the deck be now 7 foot the purpose of the space command by the act be to obtain sufficient air and ventilation and that be actually now give to the passenger by the 7 foot that exist in all of these vessel between floor and ceiling
 there be also another objection that i must suggest in section 12 from line 14 to line 24 it be provide before such vessel shall be clear or may lawfully depart etc the master of say vessel shall furnish etc,"a correct list of all passenger who have be or be intend to be take on board the vessel and shall specify etc this provision would prevent the clearing of the vessel steam vessel start at an appoint hour and with punctuality down almost to the very hour of their departure new passenger other than those who have engage their passage constantly come on board if this provision be to be the law they must be reject for the ship can not without incur heavy penalty take passenger whose name be not set forth on the list require before such vessel shall be clear they should be allow to take such new passenger upon condition that they would furnish an additional list contain such persons&#39 name there be other point of objection of a minor character that might be present for consideration if the bill could be reconsider and amend but the three that i have recite be conspicuous defect in a bill that ought to be a code for such a purpose dear and explicit free from all such objection the practical result of this law would be to subject all of the compete line of large ocean steamer to great loss by restrict their carrying accommodation it would also stay the current of emigration that it be our policy to encourage as well as to protect a good bill correctly phrase and express and name in plain well know technical term the proper and usual place and deck where passenger be and ought to be place and carry will receive my prompt and immediate assent as a public necessity and blessing

to the house of representatives
 having watch with much interest the progress of house bill no 6242 entitle an act make appropriation for the construction repair and preservation of certain work on river and harbor and for other purpose and having since it be receive carefully examine it after mature consideration i be constrain to return it herewith to the house of representatives in which it originate without my signature and with my objection to its passage
 many of the appropriation in the bill be clearly for the general welfare and most beneficent in their character two of the object for which provision be make be by i consider so important that i feel it my duty to direct to they the attention of congress in my annual message in december last i urge the vital importance of legislation for the reclamation of the marsh and for the establishment of the harbor line along the potomac front in april last by special message i recommend an appropriation for the improvement of the mississippi river it be not necessary that i say that when my signature would make the bill appropriate for these and other valuable national object a law it be with great reluctance and only under a sense of duty that i withhold it
 my principal objection to the bill be that it contain appropriation for purpose not for the common defense or general welfare and which do not promote commerce among the states these provision on the contrary be entirely for the benefit of the particular locality in which it be propose to make the improvement i regard such appropriation of the public money as beyond the power give by the constitution to congress and the president
 i feel the more bound to withhold my signature from the bill because of the peculiar evil which manifestly result from this infraction of the constitution appropriation of this nature to be devote purely to local object tend to an increase in number and in amount as the citizen of one state find that money to raise which they in common with the whole country be tax be to be expend for local improvement in another state they demand similar benefit for themselves and it be not unnatural that they should seek to indemnify themselves for such use of the public fund by secure appropriation for similar improvement in their own neighborhood thus as the bill become more objectionable it secure more support this result be invariable and necessarily follow a neglect to observe the constitutional limitation impose upon the lawmaking power
 the appropriation for river and harbor improvement have under the influence to which i have allude increase year by year out of proportion to the progress of the country great as that have be in 1870 the aggregate appropriation be $ 3,975,900 in 1875 $ 6,648,517.50 in 1880 $ 8,976,500 and in 1881 $ 11,451,000 while by the present act there be appropriate $ 18,743,875
 while feel every disposition to leave to the legislature the responsibility of determine what amount should be appropriate for the purpose of the bill so long as the appropriation be confine to object indicate by the grant of power i can not escape the conclusion that as a part of the lawmaking power of the government the duty devolve upon i to withhold my signature from a bill contain appropriation which in my opinion greatly exceed in amount the need of the country for the present fiscal year it be the usage to provide money for these purpose by annual appropriation bill the president be in effect direct to expend so large an amount of money within so brief a period that the expenditure can not be make economically and advantageously
 the extravagant expenditure of public money be an evil not to be measure by the value of that money to the people who be tax for it they sustain a great injury in the demoralize effect produce upon those who be intrust with official duty through all the ramification of government
 these objection could be remove and every constitutional purpose readily attain should congress enact that one half only of the aggregate amount provide for in the bill be appropriate for expenditure during the fiscal year and that the sum so appropriated be expend only for such object name in the bill as the secretary of war under the direction of the president shall determine provide that in no case shall the expenditure for any one purpose exceed the sum now designate by the bill for that purpose
 i feel authorized to make this suggestion because of the duty impose upon the president by the constitution to recommend to the consideration of congress such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient and because it be my earnest desire that the public work which be in progress shall suffer no injury congress will also convene again in four month when this whole subject will be open for their consideration

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states it be provide by the constitution that the president shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient in review the event of the year which have elapse since the commencement of your session i first call your attention to the gratifying condition of our foreign affair our intercourse with other power have continue to be of the most friendly character such slight difference as have arise during the year have be already settle or be likely to reach an early adjustment the arrest of citizen of the united states in ireland under recent law which owe their origin to the disturbed condition of that country have lead to a somewhat extended correspondence with the government of great britain a disposition to respect our right have be practically manifest by the release of the arrest party the claim of this nation in regard to the supervision and control of any interoceanic canal across the american isthmus have continue to be the subject of conference it be likely that time will be more powerful than discussion in remove the divergence between the two nation whose friendship be so closely cement by the intimacy of their relation and the community of their interest our long establish friendliness with russia have remain unshaken it have prompt i to proffer the earnest counsel of this government that measure be adopt for suppress the proscription which the hebrew race in that country have lately suffer it have not transpire that any american citizen have be subject to arrest or injury but our courteous remonstrance have nevertheless be courteously receive there be reason to believe that the time be not far distant when russia will be able to secure toleration to all faith within her border at an international convention hold at paris in 1880 and attend by representative of the united states an agreement be reach in respect to the protection of trade mark patent article and the right of manufacturing firm and corporation the formulating into treaty of the recommendation thus adopt be receive the attention which it merit the protection of submarine cable be a subject now under consideration by an international conference at paris believe that it be clearly the true policy of this government to favor the neutralization of this mean of intercourse i request our minister to france to attend the convention as a delegate i also designate two of our eminent scientist to attend as our representative at the meeting of an international committee at paris for consider the adoption of a common unit to measure electric force in view of the frequent occurrence of conference for the consideration of important matter of common interest to civilized nation i respectfully suggest that the executive be invest by congress with discretionary power to send delegate to such convention and that provision be make to defray the expense incident thereto the difference between the united states and spain as to the effect of a judgment and certificate of naturalization have not yet be adjust but it be hope and believe that negotiation now in progress will result in the establishment of the position which seem to this government so reasonable and just i have already call the attention of congress to the fact that in the port of spain and its colony onerous fine have lately be impose upon vessel of the united states for trivial technical offense against local regulation effort for the abatement of these exaction have thus far prove unsuccessful i regret to inform you also that the fee demand by spanish consul in american port be in some case so large when compare with the value of the cargo as to amount in effect to a considerable export duty and that our remonstrance in this regard have not as yet receive the attention which they seem to deserve the german government have invite the united states to participate in an international exhibition of domestic cattle to be hold at hamburg in july 1883 if this country be to be represent it be important that in the early day of this session congress should make a suitable appropriation for that purpose the death of mr. marsh our late minister to italy have evoke from that government expression of profound respect for his exalt character and for his honorable career in the diplomatic service of his country the italian government have raise a question as to the propriety of recognize in his dual capacity the representative of this country recently accredit both as secretary of legation and as consul general at rome he have be receive as secretary but his exequatur as consul general have thus far be withhold the extradition convention with belgium which have be in operation since 1874 have be lately supplant by another the senate have signify its approval and ratification have be duly exchange between the contracting country to the list of extraditable crime have be add that of the assassination or attempt assassination of the chief of the state negotiation have be open with switzerland look to a settlement by treaty of the question whether its citizen can renounce their allegiance and become citizen of the united states without obtain the consent of the swiss government i be glad to inform you that the immigration of pauper and criminal from certain of the cantons of switzerland have substantially cease and be no long sanction by the authority the consideration of this subject prompt the suggestion that the act of august 3 1882 which have for its object the return of foreign convict to their own country should be so modified as not to be open to the interpretation that it affect the extradition of criminal on preferred charge of crime the ottoman porte have not yet assent to the interpretation which this government have put upon the treaty of 1830 relative to its jurisdictional right in turkey it may well be however that this difference will be adjust by a general revision of the system of jurisdiction of the united states in the country of the east a subject to which your attention have be already call by the secretary of state in the interest of justice toward china and japan i trust that the question of the return of the indemnity fund to the government of those country will reach at the present session the satisfactory solution which i have already recommend and which have recently be foreshadow by congressional discussion the treaty lately conclude with korea await the action of the senate during the late disturbance in egypt the timely presence of american vessel serve as a protection to the person and property of many of our own citizen and of citizen of other country whose government have express their thank for this assistance the recent legislation restrict immigration of laborer from china have give rise to the question whether chinese proceed to or from another country may lawfully pass through our own construe the act of may 6 1882 in connection with the treaty of november 7 1880 the restriction would seem to be limit to chinese immigrant come to the united states as laborer and would not forbid a mere transit across our territory i ask the attention of congress to the subject for such action if any as may be deem advisable this government have recently have occasion to manifest its interest in the republic of liberia by seek to aid the amicable settlement of the boundary dispute now pende between that republic and the british possession of sierra leone the reciprocity treaty with hawaii will become terminable after september 9 1883 on twelve month notice by either party while certain provision of that compact may have prove onerous its existence have foster commercial relation which it be important to preserve i suggest therefore that early consideration be give to such modification of the treaty as seem to be demand by the interest of our people in view of our increase trade with both hayti and santo domingo i advise that provision be make for diplomatic intercourse with the latter by enlarge the scope of the mission at port au prince i regret that certain claim of american citizen against the government of hayti have thus far be urge unavailingly a recent agreement with mexico provide for the crossing of the frontier by the armed force of either country in pursuit of hostile indians in my message of last year i call attention to the prevalent lawlessness upon the border and to the necessity of legislation for its suppression i again invite the attention of congress to the subject a partial relief from these mischief have be seek in a convention which now await the approval of the senate as do also another touch the establishment of the international boundary between the united states and mexico if the latter be ratify the action of congress will be require for establish suitable commission of survey the boundary dispute between mexico and guatemala which lead this government to proffer its friendly counsel to both party have be amicably settle no change have occur in our relation with venezuela i again invoke your action in the matter of the pende award against that republic to which reference be make by a special message from the executive at your last session an invitation have be receive from the government of venezuela to send representative in july 1883 to caracas for participate in the centennial celebration of the birth of bolivar the founder of south american independence in connection with this event it be design to commence the erection at caracas of a statue of washington and to conduct an industrial exhibition which will be open to american product i recommend that the united states be represent and that suitable provision be make therefor the elevation of the grade of our mission in central america to the plenipotentiary rank which be authorize by congress at its late session have be since effect the war between peru and bolivia on the one side and chile on the other begin more than three year ago on the occupation by chile in 1880 of all the littoral territory of bolivia negotiation for peace be conduct under the direction of the united states the ally refuse to concede any territory but chile have since become master of the whole coast of both country and of the capital of peru a year since as you have already be advise by correspondence transmit to you in january last this government send a special mission to the belligerent power to express the hope that chile would be dispose to accept a money indemnity for the expense of the war and to relinquish her demand for a portion of the territory of her antagonist this recommendation which chile decline to follow this government do not assume to enforce nor can it be enforce without resort to measure which would be in keep neither with the temper of our people nor with the spirit of our institution the power of peru no long extend over its whole territory and in the event of our interference to dictate peace would need to be supplement by the army and navy of the united states such interference would almost inevitably lead to the establishment of a protectorate a result utterly at odd with our past policy injurious to our present interest and full of embarrassment for the future for effect the termination of hostility upon term at once just to the victorious nation and generous to its adversary this government have spare no effort save such as might involve the complication which i have indicate it be greatly to be deplore that chile seems resolve to exact such rigorous condition of peace and indispose to submit to arbitration the term of an amicable settlement no peace be likely to be last that be not sufficiently equitable and just to command the approval of other nation about a year since invitation be extend to the nation of this continent to send representative to a peace congress to assemble at washington in november 1882 the time of meeting be fix at a period then remote in the hope as the invitation itself declare that in the meantime the disturbance between the south american republics would be adjust as that expectation seem unlikely to be realize i ask in april last for an expression of opinion from the two houses of congress as to the advisability of hold the propose convention at the time appoint this action be prompt in part by doubt which mature reflection have suggest whether the diplomatic usage and tradition of the government do not make it fitting that the executive should consult the representative of the people before pursue a line of policy somewhat novel in its character and far reach in its possible consequence in view of the fact that no action be take by congress in the premise and that no provision have be make for necessary expense i subsequently decide to postpone the convocation and so notify the several government which have be invite to attend i be unwilling to dismiss this subject without assure you of my support of any measure the wisdom of congress may devise for the promotion of peace on this continent and throughout the world and i trust that the time be nigh when with the universal assent of civilized people all international difference shall be determine without resort to arm by the benignant process of arbitration change have occur in the diplomatic representation of several foreign power during the past year new minister from the argentine republic austria hungary brazil chile china france japan mexico the netherlands and russia have present their credential the mission of denmark and venezuela at this capital have be raise in grade switzerland have create a plenipotentiary mission to this government and an embassy from madagascar and a minister from siam will shortly arrive our diplomatic intercourse have be enlarge by the establishment of relation with the new kingdom of servia by the creation of a mission to siam and by the restoration of the mission to greece the shah of persia have express his gratification that a charge d'affaire will shortly be send to that country where the right of our citizen have be hitherto courteously guard by the representative of great britain i renew my recommendation of such legislation as will place the united states in harmony with other maritime power with respect to the international rule for the prevention of collision at sea in conformity with your joint resolution of the 3d of august last i have direct the secretary of state to address foreign government in respect to a propose conference for consider the subject of the universal adoption of a common prime meridian to be use in the reckoning of longitude and in the regulation of time throughout the civilized world their reply will in due time be lay before you an agreement be reach at paris in 1875 between the principal power for the interchange of official publication through the medium of their respective foreign department the admirable system which have be build up by the enterprise of the smithsonian institution afford a practical basis for our cooperation in this scheme and an arrangement have be effect by which that institution will perform the necessary labor under the direction of the department of state a reasonable compensation therefor should be provide by law a clause in the act make appropriation for the diplomatic and consular service contemplate the reorganization of both branch of such service on a salaried basis leave fee to inure to the benefit of the treasury i cordially favor such a project as likely to correct abuse in the present system the secretary of state will present to you at an early day a plan for such reorganization a full and interesting exhibit of the operation of the treasury department be afford by the report of

 25,902,683this excess be less than it have be before for any of the previous six year as appear by the follow table year end june 30   excess of exportsover import ofmerchandise   1876 $ 79,643,481 1877 151,152,094 1878 257,814,234 1879 264,661,666 1880 167,683,912 1881 259,712,718 1882 25,902,683during the year there have be organize 171 national bank and of those institution there be now in operation 2,269 a large number than ever before the value of their note in active circulation on july 1 1882 be $ 324,656,458.i commend to your attention the secretary 's view in respect to the likelihood of a serious contraction of this circulation and to the mode by which that result may in his judgment be avert in respect to the coinage of silver dollar and the retirement of silver certificate i have see nothing to alter but much to confirm the sentiment to which i give expression last year a comparison between the respective amount of silver dollar circulation on november 1 1881 and on november 1 1882 show a slight increase of a million and a half of dollar but during the interval there have be in the whole number coin an increase of twenty six million of the one hundred and twenty eight million thus far mint little more than thirty five million be in circulation the mass of accumulate coin have grow so great that the vault room at present available for storage be scarcely sufficient to contain it it be not apparent why it be desirable to continue this coinage now so enormously in excess of the public demand as to the silver certificate in addition to the ground which seem last year to justify their retirement may be mention the effect which be likely to ensue from the supply of gold certificate for whose issuance congress recently make provision and which be now in active circulation you can not fail to note with interest the discussion by the secretary as to the necessity of provide by legislation some mode of free the treasury of an excess of asset in the event that congress fail to reach an early agreement for the reduction of taxation i heartily approve the secretary 's recommendation of immediate and extensive reduction in the annual revenue of the government it will be remember that i urge upon the attention of congress at its last session the importance of relieve the industry and enterprise of the country from the pressure of unnecessary taxation it be one of the trite maxim of political economy that all taxis be burdensome however wisely and prudently impose and though there have always be among our people wide difference of sentiment as to the good method of raise the national revenue and indeed as to the principle upon which taxation should be base there have be substantial accord in the doctrine that only such taxis ought to be levy as be necessary for a wise and economical administration of the government of late the public revenue have far exceed that limit and unless check by appropriate legislation such excess will continue to increase from year to year for the fiscal year end june 30 1881 the surplus revenue amount to $ 100,000,000 for the fiscal year end on the 30th of june last the surplus be more than one hundred and forty five million the report of the secretary show what disposition have be make of these money they have not only answer the requirement of the sink fund but have afford a large balance applicable to other reduction of the public debt but i renew the expression of my conviction that such rapid extinguishment of the national indebtedness as be now take place be by no mean a cause for congratulation it be a cause rather for serious apprehension if it continue it must speedily be follow by one of the evil result so clearly set forth in the report of the secretary either the surplus must lie idle in the treasury or the government will be force to buy at market rate its bond not then redeemable and which under such circumstance can not fail to command an enormous premium or the swollen revenue will be devote to extravagant expenditure which as experience have teach be ever the bane of an overflowing treasury it be make apparent in the course of the animate discussion which this question arouse at the last session of congress that the policy of diminish the revenue by reduce taxation command the general approval of the member of both houses i regret that because of conflict view as to the good method by which that policy should be make operative none of its benefit have as yet be reap in fulfillment of what i deem my constitutional duty but with little hope that i can make valuable contribution to this vex question i shall proceed to intimate briefly my own view in relation to it upon the showing of our financial condition at the close of the last fiscal year i feel justified in recommend to congress the abolition of all internal revenue taxis except those upon tobacco in its various form and upon distilled spirit and ferment liquor and except also the special tax upon the manufacturer of and dealer in such article i venture now to suggest that unless it shall be ascertain that the probable expenditure of the government for the come year have be underestimate all internal taxis save those which relate to distil spirit can be prudently abrogate such a course if accompany by a simplification of the machinery of collection which would then be easy of accomplishment might reasonably be expect to result in diminish the cost of such collection by at least $ 2,500,000 and in the retirement from office of from 1,500 to 2,000 person the system of excise duty have never commend itself to the favor of the american people and have never be resort to except for supply deficiency in the treasury when by reason of special exigency the duty on import have prove inadequate for the need of the government the sentiment of the country doubtless demand that the present excise tax shall be abolish as soon as such a course can be safely pursue it seem to i however that for various reason so sweep a measure as the total abolition of internal taxis would for the present be an unwise step two of these reason be deserve of special mention first it be by no mean clear that even if the exist system of duty on import be continue without modification those duty alone will yield sufficient revenue for all the need of the government it be estimate that $ 100,000,000 will be require for pension during the come year and it may well be doubt whether the maximum annual demand for that object have yet be reach uncertainty upon this question would alone justify in my judgment the retention for the present of that portion of the system of internal revenue which be least objectionable to the people second a total abolition of excise taxis would almost inevitably prove a serious if not an insurmountable obstacle to a thorough revision of the tariff and to any considerable reduction in import duty the present tariff system be in many respect unjust it make unequal distribution both of its burden and its benefit this fact be practically recognize by a majority of each house of congress in the passage of the act create the tariff commission the report of that commission will be place before you at the beginning of this session and will i trust afford you such information as to the condition and prospect of the various commercial agricultural manufacturing mining and other interest of the country and contain such suggestion for statutory revision as will practically aid your action upon this important subject the revenue from custom for the fiscal year end june 30 1879 amount to $ 137,000,000.it have in the three succeed year reach first $ 186,000,000 then $ 198,000,000 and finally as have be already state $ 220,000,000.the income from this source for the fiscal year which will end on june 30 1883 will doubtless be considerably in excess of the sum last mention if the tax on domestic spirit be to be retain it be plain therefore that large reduction from the custom revenue be entirely feasible while recommend this reduction i be far from advise the abandonment of the policy of so discriminate in the adjustment of detail as to afford aid and protection to domestic labor but the present system should be so revise as to equalize the public burden among all class and occupation and bring it into close harmony with the present need of industry without enter into minute detail which under present circumstance be quite unnecessary i recommend an enlargement of the free list so as to include within it the numerous article which yield inconsiderable revenue a simplification of the complex and inconsistent schedule of duty upon certain manufacture particularly those of cotton iron and steel and a substantial reduction of the duty upon those article and upon sugar molasse silk wool and woolen good if a general revision of the tariff shall be find to be impracticable at this session i express the hope that at least some of the more conspicuous inequality of the present law may be correct before your final adjournment one of they be specially refer to by the secretary in view of a recent decision of the supreme court the necessity of amend the law by which the dutch standard of color be adopt as the test of the saccharine strength of sugar be too obvious to require comment from the report of the secretary of war it appear that the only outbreak of indians during the past year occur in arizona and in the southwestern part of new mexico they be promptly quell and the quiet which have prevail in all other part of the country have permit such an addition to be make to the military force in the region endanger by the apaches that there be little reason to apprehend trouble in the future those part of the secretary 's report which relate to our seacoast defense and their armament suggest the grave reflection our exist fortification be notoriously inadequate to the defense of the great harbor and city for whose protection they be build the question of provide an armament suit to our present necessity have be the subject of consideration by a board whose report be transmit to congress at the last session pende the consideration of that report the war department have take no step for the manufacture or conversion of any heavy cannon but the secretary express the hope that authority and mean to begin that important work will be soon provide i invite the attention of congress to the propriety of make more adequate provision for arm and equip the militia than be afford by the act of 1808 which be still upon the statute book the matter have already be the subject of discussion in the senate and a bill which seek to supply the deficiency of exist law be now upon its calendar the secretary of war call attention to an embarrassment grow out of the recent act of congress make the retirement of officer of the army compulsory at the age of 64 the act of 1878 be still in force which limit to 400 the number of those who can be retire for disability or upon their own application the two act when construe together seem to forbid the relieving even for absolute incapacity of officer who do not fall within the purview of the later statute save at such time as there chance to be less than 40 name on the retired list there be now 420 it be not likely that congress intend this result and i concur with the secretary that the law ought to be amend the ground that impel i to withhold my signature from the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the construction repair and preservation of certain work on river and harbor which become a law near the close of your last session prompt i to express the hope that no similar measure will be deem necessary during the present session of congress indeed such a measure would now be open to a serious objection in addition to that which be lately urge upon your attention i be inform by the secretary of war that the great portion of the sum appropriate for the various item specify in that act remain unexpended of the new work which it authorize expense have be incur upon two only for which the total appropriation be $ 210,000 the present available balance be disclose by the follow table amount of appropriation by act of august 2 1882 $ 18,738,875 amount of appropriation by act of june 19 1882 10,000 amount of appropriation for payment to j. b. eads 304,000 unexpended balance of former appropriation 4,738,263     23,791,130 less amount draw from treasury between july 1 1882 andnovember 30 1882 6,056,194     17,134,944it be apparent by this exhibit that so far as concern most of the item to which the act of august 2 1882 relate there can be no need of further appropriation until after the close of the present session if however any action should seem to be necessary in respect to particular object it will be entirely feasible to provide for those object by appropriate legislation it be possible for example that a delay until the assembling of the next congress to make additional provision for the mississippi river improvement might be attend with serious consequence if such should appear to be the case a just bill relate to that subject would command my approval this lead i to offer a suggestion which i trust will commend itself to the wisdom of congress be it not advisable that grant of considerable sum of money for diverse and independent scheme of internal improvement should be make the subject of separate and distinct legislative enactment it will scarcely be gainsay even by those who favor the most liberal expenditure for such purpose as be seek to be accomplish by what be commonly call the river and harbor bill that the practice of group in such a bill appropriation for a great diversity of object widely separate either in their nature or in the locality with which they be concern or in both be one which be much to be deprecate unless it be irremediable it inevitably tend to secure the success of the bill as a whole though many of the item if separately consider could scarcely fail of rejection by the adoption of the course i have recommend every member of congress whenever opportunity should arise for give his influence and vote for meritorious appropriation would be enable so to do without be call upon to sanction other undeserve his approval so also would the executive be afford thereby full opportunity to exercise his constitutional prerogative of oppose whatever appropriation seem to he objectionable without imperil the success of other which commend themselves to his judgment it may be urge in opposition to these suggestion that the number of work of internal improvement which be justly entitle to governmental aid be so great as to render impracticable separate appropriation bill therefor or even for such comparatively limited number as make disposition of large sum of money this objection may be well found and whether it be or not the advantage which would be likely to ensue from the adoption of the course i have recommend may perhaps be more effectually attain by another which i respectfully submit to congress as an alternative proposition it be provide by the constitution of fourteen of our states that the executive may disapprove any item or item of a bill appropriating money whereupon the part of the bill approve shall be law and the part disapprove shall fail to become law unless repasse accord to the provision prescribe for the passage of bill over the veto of the executive the states wherein some such provision as the foregoing be a part of the fundamental law be alabama california colorado florida georgia louisiana minnesota missouri nebraska new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and west virginia i commend to your careful consideration the question whether an amendment of the federal constitution in the particular indicate would not afford the good remedy for what be often a grave embrassment both to member of congress and to the executive and be sometimes a serious public mischief the report of the secretary of the navy state the movement of the various squadron during the year in home and foreign water where our officer and seaman with such ship as we possess have continue to illustrate the high character and excellent discipline of the naval organization on the 21st of december 1881 information be receive that the exploring steamer jeannette have be crush and abandon in the arctic ocean the officer and crew after a journey over the ice embark in three boat for the coast of siberia one of the party under the command of chief engineer george w. melville reach the land and fall in with the native be save another under lieutenant commander de long land in a barren region near the mouth of the lena river after six week have elapse all but two of the number have die from fatigue and starvation no tiding have be receive from the party in the third boat under the command of lieutenant chipp but a long and fruitless investigation leave little doubt that all its member perish at sea as a slight tribute to their heroism i give in this communication the name of the gallant man who sacrifice their life on this expedition lieutenant commander george w. de long surgeon james m. ambler jerome j. collins hans

bring home the remain of lieutenant de long and his comrade in pursuance of the direction of congress the rodgers fit out for the releif of the jeannette in accordance with the act of congress of march 3 1881 sail from san francisco june 16 under the command of lieutenant robert m. berry on november 30 she be accidentally destroy by fire while in winter quarter in st. lawrence bay but the officer and crew succeed in escape to the shore lieutenant berry and one of his officer after make a search for the jeannette along the coast of siberia fall in with chief engineer melville 's party and return home by way of europe the other officer and the crew of the rodgers be bring from st. lawrence bay by the whaling steam north star master charles f. putnam who have be place in charge of a depot of supply at cape serdze return to his post from st. lawrence bay across the ice in a blind snow storm be carry out to sea and lose notwithstanding all effort to rescue he it appear by the secretary 's report that the available naval force of the united states consist of 37 cruiser 14 single turrete monitor build during the rebellion a large number of smoothbore gun and parrott rifle and 87 rifle cannon the cruise vessel should be gradually replace by iron or steel ship the monitor by modern armored vessel and the armament by high power rifle gun the reconstruction of our navy which be recommend in my last message be begin by congress authorize in its recent act the construction of two large unarmored steel vessel of the character recommend by the late naval advisory board and subject to the final approval of a new advisory board to be organize as provide by that act i call your attention to the recommendation of the secretary and the board that authority be give to construct two more cruiser of small dimension and one fleet dispatch vessel and that appropriation be make for high power rifle cannon for the torpedo service and for other harbor defense pende the consideration by congress of the policy to be hereafter adopt in conduct the eight large navy yard and their expensive establishment the secretary advocate the reduction of expenditure therefor to the low possible amount for the purpose of afford the officer and seaman of the navy opportunity for exercise and discipline in their profession under appropriate control and direction the secretary advise that the light house service and coast survey be transfer as now organize from the treasury to the navy department and he also suggest for the reason which he assign that a similar transfer may wisely be make of the cruise revenue vessel the secretary forcibly depict the intimate connection and interdependence of the navy and the commercial marine and invite attention to the continued decadence of the latter and the correspond transfer of our grow commerce to foreign bottom this subject be one of the utmost importance to the national welfare method of revive american shipbuilding and of restore the united states flag in the ocean carry trade should receive the immediate attention of congress we have mechanical skill and abundant material for the manufacture of modern iron steamship in fair competition with our commercial rival our disadvantage in building ship be the great cost of labor and in sail they high taxis and great interest on capital while the ocean highway be already monopolize by our formidable competitor these obstacle should in some way be overcome and for our rapid communication with foreign land we should not continue to depend wholly upon vessel build in the yard of other country and sailing under foreign flag with no united states steamer on the principal ocean line or in any foreign port our facility for extend our commerce be greatly restrict while the nation which build and sail the ship and carry the mail and passenger obtain thereby conspicuous advantage in increase their trade the report of the postmaster general give evidence of the satisfactory condition of that department and contain many valuable datum and accompany suggestion which can not fail to be of interest the information which it afford that the receipt for the fiscal year have exceed the expenditure must be very gratifying to congress and to the people of the country as matter which may fairly claim particular attention i refer you to his observation in reference to the advisability of change the present basis for fix salary and allowance of extend the money order system and of enlarge the function of the postal establishment so as to put under its control the telegraph system of the country though from this last and most important recommendation i must withhold my concurrence at the last session of congress several bill be introduce into the house of representatives for the reduction of letter postage to the rate of 2 cent per half ounce i have give much study and reflection to this subject and be thoroughly persuade that such a reduction would be for the good interest of the public it have be the policy of the government from its foundation to defray as far as possible the expense of carry the mail by a direct tax in the form of postage it have never be claim however that this service ought to be productive of a net revenue as have be state already the report of the postmaster general show that there be now a very considerable surplus in his department and that henceforth the receipt be likely to increase at a much great ratio than the necessary expenditure unless some change be make in the exist law the profit of the postal service will in a very few year swell the revenue of the government many million of dollar the time seem auspicious therefore for some reduction in the rate of postage in what shall that reduction consist?a review of the legislation which have be have upon this subject during the last thirty year disclose that domestic letter constitute the only class of mail matter which have never be favor by a substantial reduction of rate i be convinced that the burden of maintain the service fall most unequally upon that class and that more than any other it be entitle to present relief that such relief may be extend without detriment to other public interest wilt be discover upon review the result of former reduction immediately prior to the act of 1845 the postage upon a letter compose of a single sheet be as follow if conveyed--   cents   30 mile or less 6 between 30 and 80 mile 10 between 80 and 150 mile 12 1/2 between 150 and 400 mile 18 3/4 over 400 mile 25by the act of 1845 the postage upon a single letter convey for any distance under 300 mile be fix at 5 cent and for any great distance at 10 cent by the act of 1851 it be provide that a single letter if prepay should be carry any distance not exceed 3,000 mile for 3 cent and any great distance for 6 cent it will be notice that both of these reduction be of a radical character and relatively quite as important as that which be now propose in each case there ensue a temporary loss of revenue but a sudden and large influx of business which substantially repair that loss within three year unless the experience of past legislation in this country and elsewhere go for naught it may be safely predict that the stimulus of 33 1/3 per cent reduction in the tax for carriage would at once increase the number of letter consign to the mail the advantage of secrecy would lead to a very general substitution of seal packet for postal card and open circular and in diver other way the volume of first class matter would be enormously augment such increase amount in england in the first year after the adoption of penny postage to more than 125 per cent as a result of careful estimate the detail of which can not be here set out i have become convinced that the deficiency for the first year after the propose reduction would not exceed 7 per cent of the expenditure or $ 3,000,000 while the deficiency after the reduction of 1845 be more than 14 per cent and after that of 1851 be 27 per cent another interesting comparison be afford by statistic furnish i by the post office department the act of 1845 be pass in face of the fact that there exist a deficiency of more than $ 30,000 that of 1851 be encourage by the slight surplus of $ 132,000 the excess of revenue in the next fiscal year be likely to be $ 3,500,000.if congress should approve these suggestion it may be deem desirable to supply to some extent the deficiency which must for a time result by increase the charge for carry merchandise which be now only 16 cent per pound but even without such an increase i be confident that the receipt under the diminished rate would equal the expenditure after the lapse of three or four year the report of the department of justice bring anew to your notice the necessity of enlarge the present system of federal jurisprudence so as effectually to answer the requirement of the ever increase litigation with which it be call upon to deal the attorney general renew the suggestion of his predecessor that in the interest of justice well provision than the exist law afford should be make in certain judicial district for fix the fee of witness and juror in my message of december last i refer to pende criminal proceeding grow out of allege fraud in what be know as the star route service of the post office department and advise you that i have enjoin upon the attorney general and associate counsel to whom the interest of the government be intrust the duty of prosecute with the utmost vigor of the law all person who might be find chargeable with those offense a trial of one of these case have since occur it occupy for many week the attention of the supreme court of this district and be conduct with great zeal and ability it result in a disagreement of the jury but the cause have be again place upon the calendar and will shortly be retry if any guilty person shall finally escape punishment for their offense it will not be for lack of diligent and earnest effort on the part of the prosecution i trust that some agreement may be reach which will speedily enable congress with the concurrence of the executive to afford the commercial community the benefit of a national bankrupt law the report of the secretary of the interior with its accompany document present a full statement of the varied operation of that department in respect to indian affair nothing have occur which have change or seriously modify the view to which i devote much space in a former communication to congress i renew the recommendation therein contain as to extend to the indian the protection of the law allot land in severalty to such as desire it and make suitable provision for the education of youth such provision as the secretary forcibly maintain will prove unavaile unless it be broad enough to include all those who be able and willing to make use of it and should not solely relate to intellectual training but also to instruction in such manual labor and simple industrial art as can be make practically available among other important subject which be include within the secretary 's report and which will doubtless furnish occasion for congressional action may be mention the neglect of the railroad company to which large grant of land be make by the act of 1862 and 1864 to take title thereto and their consequent inequitable exemption from local taxation no survey of our material condition can fail to suggest inquiry as to the moral and intellectual progress of the people the census return disclose an alarming state of illiteracy in certain portion of the country where the provision for school be grossly inadequate it be a momentous question for the decision of congress whether immediate and substantial aid should not be extend by the general government for supplement the effort of private beneficence and of state and territorial legislation in behalf of education the regulation of interstate commerce have already be the subject of your deliberation one of the incident of the marvelous extension of the railway system of the country have be the adoption of such measure by the corporation which own or control the road as have tend to impair the advantage of healthful competition and to make hurtful discrimination in the adjustment of freightage these inequality have be correct in several of the states by appropriate legislation the effect of which be necessarily restrict to the limit of their own territory so far as such mischief affect commerce between the states or between any one of the states and a foreign country they be subject of national concern and congress alone can afford relief the result which have thus far attend the enforcement of the recent statute for the suppression of polygamy in the territories be report by the secretary of the interior it be not probable that any additional legislation in this regard will be deem desirable until the effect of exist law shall be more closely observe and study i congratulate you that the commissioner under whose supervision those law have be put in operation be encourage to believe that the evil at which they be aim may be suppress without resort to such radical measure as in some quarter have be think indispensable for success the close relation of the general government to the territories prepare to be great states may well engage your special attention it be there that the indian disturbance mainly occur and that polygamy have find room for its growth i can not doubt that a careful survey of territorial legislation would be of the high utility life and property would become more secure the liability of outbreak between indians and white would be lessen the public domain would be more securely guard and well progress be make in the instruction of the young alaska be still without any form of civil government if mean be provide for the education of its people and for the protection of their life and property the immense resource of the region would invite permanent settlement and open new field for industry and enterprise the report of the commissioner of agriculture present an account of the labor of that department during the past year and include information of much interest to the general public the condition of the forest of the country and the wasteful manner in which their destruction be take place give cause for serious apprehension their action in protect the earth 's surface in modify the extreme of climate and in regulate and sustain the flow of spring and stream be now well understand and their importance in relation to the growth and prosperity of the country can not be safely disregarded they be fast disappear before destructive fire and the legitimate requirement of our increase population and their total extinction can not be long delay unless well method than now prevail shall be adopt for their protection and cultivation the attention of congress be invite to the necessity of additional legislation to secure the preservation of the valuable forest still remain on the public domain especially in the extreme western states and territories where the necessity for their preservation be great than in less mountainous region and where the prevail dryness of the climate render their restoration if they be once destroy well nigh impossible the communication which i make to congress at its first session in december last contain a somewhat full statement of my sentiment in relation to the principle and rule which ought to govern appointment to public service refer to the various plan which have theretofore be the subject of discussion in the national legislature plan which in the main be model upon the system which obtain in great britain but which lack certain of the prominent feature whereby that system be distinguish i feel bound to intimate my doubt whether they or any of they would afford adequate remedy for the evil which they aim to correct i declare nevertheless that if the propose measure should prove acceptable to congress they would receive the unhesitating support of the executive since these suggestion be submit for your consideration there have be no legislation upon the subject to which they relate but there have meanwhile be an increase in the public interest in that subject and the people of the country apparently without distinction of party have in various way and upon frequent occasion give expression to their earnest wish for prompt and definite action in my judgment such action should no long be postpone i may add that my own sense of its press importance have be quicken by observation of a practical phase of the matter to which attention have more than once be call by my predecessor the civil list now comprise about 100,000 person far the large part of whom must under the term of the constitution he select by the president either directly or through his own appointee in the early year of the administration of the government the personal direction of appointment to the civil service may not have be an irksome task for the executive but now that the burden have increase fully a hundredfold it have become great thin he ought to bear and it necessarily divert his time and attention from the proper discharge of other duty no less delicate and responsible and which in the very nature of thing can not be delegate to other hand in the judgment of not a few who have give study and reflection to this matter the nation have outgrow the provision which the constitution have establish for fill the minor office in the public service but whatever may be think of the wisdom or expediency of change the fundamental law in this regard it be certain that much relief may be afford not only to the president and to the head of the departments but to senators and representatives in congress by discreet legislation they would be protect in a great measure by the bill now pende before the senate or by any other which should embody its important feature from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examine conflict claim and pretension of candidate i trust that before the close of the present session some decisive action may be take for the correction of the evil which inhere in the present method of appointment and i assure you of my hearty cooperation in any measure which be likely to conduce to that end as to the most appropriate term and tenure of the official life of the subordinate employee of the government it seem to be generally agree that whatever their extent or character the one should be definite and the other stable and that neither should be regulate by zeal in the service of party or fidelity to the fortune of an individual it matter little to the people at large what competent person be at the head of this department or of that bureau if they feel assured that the removal of one and the accession of another will not involve the retirement of honest and faithful subordinate whose duty be purely administrative and have no legitimate connection with the triumph of any political principle or the success of any political party or faction it be to this latter class of officer that the senate bill to which i have already refer exclusively apply while neither that bill nor any other prominent scheme for improve the civil service concern the high grade of official who be appoint by the president and confirm by the senate i feel bound to correct a prevalent misapprehension as to the frequency with which the present executive have displace the incumbent of an office and appoint another in his stead it have be repeatedly allege that he have in this particular signally depart from the course which have be pursue under recent administration of the government the fact be as follow the whole number of executive appointment during the four year immediately precede mr. garfield 's accession to the presidency be 2,696 of this number 244 or 9 per cent involve the removal of previous incumbent the ratio of removal to the whole number of appointment be much the same during each of those four year in the first year with 790 appointment there be 74 removal or 9.3 per cent in the second with 917 appointment there be 85 removal or 8.5 per cent in the third with 480 appointment there be 48 removal or 10 per cent in the fourth with 429 appointment there be 37 removal or 8.6 per cent in the four month of president garfield 's administration there be 390 appointment and 89 removal or 22.7 per cent precisely the same number of removal 89 have take place in the fourteen month which have since elapse but they constitute only 7.8 per cent of the whole number of appointment 1,118 within that period and less than 2.6 of the entire list of official 3,459 exclusive of the army and navy which be fill by presidential appointment i declare my approval of such legislation as may be find necessary for supplement the exist provision of law in relation to political assessment in july last i authorize a public announcement that employee of the government should regard themselves as at liberty to exercise their pleasure in make or refuse to make political contribution and that their action in that regard would in no manner affect their official status in this announcement i act upon the view which i have always maintain and still maintain that a public officer should be as absolutely free as any other citizen to give or to withhold a contribution for the aid of the political party of his choice it have however be urge and doubtless not without foundation in fact that by solicitation of official superior and by other mode such contribution have at time be obtain from person whose only motive for give have be the fear of what might befall they if they refuse it go without say that such contribution be not voluntary and in my judgment their collection should be prohibit by law a bill which will effectually suppress they will receive my cordial approval i hope that however numerous and urgent may be the demand upon your attention the interest of this district will not be forget the denial to its resident of the great right of suffrage in all its relation to national state and municipal action impose upon congress the duty of afford they the good administration which its wisdom can devise the report of the district commissioners indicate certain measure whose adoption would seem to be very desirable 1 instance in particular those which relate to arrear of taxis to steam railroad and to assessment of real property among the question which have be the topic of recent debate in the hall of congress none be of great gravity than those relate to the ascertainment of the vote for presidential elector and the intendment of the constitution in its provision for devolve executive function upon the vice president when the president suffer from inability to discharge the power and duty of his office i trust that no embarrassment may result from a failure to determine these question before another national election the closing year have be replete with blessing for which we owe to the giver of all good our reverent acknowledgment for the uninterrupted harmony of our foreign relation for the decay of sectional animosity for the exuberance of our harvest and the triumph of our mining and manufacturing industry for the prevalence of health the spread of intelligence and the conservation of the public credit for the growth of the country in all the element of national greatness for these and countless other blessing we should rejoice and be glad i trust that under the inspiration of this great prosperity our counsel may be harmonious and that the dictate of prudence patriotism justice and economy may lead to the adoption of measure in which the congress and the executive may heartily unite
to the congress of the united states at the threshold of your deliberation i congratulate you upon the favorable aspect of the domestic and foreign affair of this government our relation with other country continue to be upon a friendly footing with the argentine republic austria belgium brazil denmark hayti italy santo domingo and sweden and norway no incident have occur which car for special comment the recent opening of new line of telegraphic communication with central america and brazil permit the interchange of message of friendship with the government of those country during the year there have be perfect and proclaim consular and commercial treaty with servia and a consular treaty with roumania thus extend our intercourse with the danubian country while our eastern relation have be put upon a wide basis by treaty with korea and madagascar the new boundary survey treaty with mexico a trade mark convention and a supplementary treaty of extradition with spain and convention extend the duration of the franco american claims commission have also be proclaim notice of the termination of the fishery article of the treaty of washington be duly give to the british government and the reciprocal privilege and exemption of the treaty will accordingly cease on july 1 1885 the fishery industry pursue by a numerous class of our citizen on the northern coast both of the atlantic and pacific ocean be worthy of the foster care of congress whenever bring into competition with the like industry of other country our fisherman as well as our manufacturer of fishing appliance and preparer of fish product have maintain a foremost place i suggest that congress create a commission to consider the general question of our right in the fishery and the mean of opening to our citizen under just and endure condition the richly stock fishing water and sealing ground of british north america question have arise touch the deportation to the united states from the british islands by governmental or municipal aid of person unable there to gain a living and equally a burden on the community here such of these person as fall under the pauper class as define by law have be send back in accordance with the provision of our statute her majesty 's government have insist that precaution have be take before shipment to prevent these objectionable visitor from come hither without guaranty of support by their relative in this country the action of the british authority in apply measure for relief have however in so many case prove ineffectual and especially so in certain recent instance of needy emigrant reach our territory through canada that a revision of our legislation upon this subject may be deem advisable correspondence relative to the clayton bulwer treaty have be continue and will be lay before congress the legislation of france against the importation of prepared swine product from the united states have be repeal that result be due no less to the friendly representation of this government than to a grow conviction in france that the restriction be not demand by any real danger to health germany still prohibit the introduction of all swine product from america i extend to the imperial government a friendly invitation to send expert to the united states to inquire whether the use of those product be dangerous to health this invitation be decline i have believe it of such importance however that the exact fact should be ascertain and promulgate that i have appoint a competent commission to make a thorough investigation of the subject its member have show their public spirit by accept their trust without pledge of compensation but i trust that congress will see in the national and international bearing of the matter a sufficient motive for provide at least for reimbursement of such expense as they may necessarily incur the coronation of the czar at moscow afford to this government an occasion for testify its continued friendship by send a special envoy and a representative of the navy to attend the ceremony while there have arise during the year no grave question affect the status in the russian empire of american citizen of other faith than that hold by the national church this government remain firm in its conviction that the right of its citizen abroad should be in no wise affect by their religious belief it be understand that measure for the removal of the restriction which now burden our trade with cuba and puerto rico be under consideration by the spanish government the proximity of cuba to the united states and the peculiar method of administration which there prevail necessitate constant discussion and appeal on our part from the proceeding of the insular authority i regret to say that the just protest of this government have not as yet produce satisfactory result the commission appoint to decide certain claim of our citizen against the spanish government after the recognition of a satisfactory rule as to the validity and force of naturalization in the united states have finally adjourn some of its award though make more than two year ago have not yet be pay their speedy payment be expect claim to a large amount which be hold by the late commission to be without its jurisdiction have be diplomatically present to the spanish government as the action of the colonial authority which have give rise to these claim be admittedly illegal full reparation for the injury sustain by our citizen should be no long delay the case of the masonic have not yet reach a settlement manila court have find that the proceeding of which this government have complain be unauthorized and it be hope that the government of spain will not withhold the speedy reparation which its sense of justice should impel it to offer for the unusual severity and unjust action of its subordinate colonial officer in the case of this vessel the helvetian confederation have propose the inauguration of a class of international treaty for the referment to arbitration of grave question between nation this government have assent to the propose negotiation of such a treaty with switzerland under the treaty of berlin liberty of conscience and civil right be assure to all stranger in bulgaria as the united states have no distinct conventional relation with that country and be not a party to the treaty they should in my opinion maintain diplomatic representation at sofia for the improvement of intercourse and the proper protection of the many american citizen who resort to that country as missionary and teacher i suggest that i be give authority to establish an agency and consulate general at the bulgarian capital the united states be now participate in a revision of the tariff of the ottoman empire they have assent to the application of a license tax to foreigner do business in turkey but have oppose the oppressive storage tax upon petroleum enter the port of that country the government of the khedive have propose that the authority of the mixed judicial tribunal in egypt be extend so as to cover citizen of the united states accuse of crime who be now triable before consular court this government be not indispose to accept the change but believe that its term should be submit for criticism to the commission appoint to revise the whole subject at no time in our national history have there be more manifest need of close and lasting relation with a neighboring state than now exist with respect to mexico the rapid influx of our capital and enterprise into that country show by what have already be accomplish the vast reciprocal advantage which must attend the progress of its internal development the treaty of commerce and navigation of 1848 have be terminate by the mexican government and in the absence of conventional engagement the right of our citizen in mexico now depend upon the domestic statute of that republic there have be instance of harsh enforcement of the law against our vessel and citizen in mexico and of denial of the diplomatic resort for their protection the initial step toward a well understanding have be take in the negotiation by the commission authorize by congress of a treaty which be still before the senate await its approval the provision for the reciprocal crossing of the frontier by the troop in pursuit of hostile indians have be prolong for another year the operation of the force of both government against these savage have be successful and several of their most dangerous band have be capture or disperse by the skill and valor of united states and mexican soldier fight in a common cause the convention for the resurvey of the boundary from the rio grande to the pacific having be ratify and exchange the preliminary reconnoissance therein stipulate have be effect it now rest with congress to make provision for complete the survey and relocate the boundary monument a convention be sign with mexico on july 13 1882 provide for the rehearing of the case of benjamin well and the abra silver mining company in whose favor award be make by the late american and mexican claims commission that convention still await the consent of the senate meanwhile because of those charge of fraudulent award which have make a new commission necessary the executive have direct the suspension of payment of the distributive quota receive from mexico our geographical proximity to central america and our political and commercial relation with the states of that country justify in my judgment such a material increase of our consular corp as will place at each capital a consul general the contest between bolivia chile and peru have pass from the stage of strategic hostility to that of negotiation in which the counsel of this government have be exercise the demand of chile for absolute cession of territory have be maintain and accept by the party of general iglesias to the extent of conclude a treaty of peace with the government of chile in general conformity with the term of the protocol sign in may last between the chilean commander and general iglesias as a result of the conclusion of this treaty general iglesias have be formally recognize by chile as president of peru and his government instal at lima which have be evacuate by the chileans a call have be issue by general iglesias for a representative assembly to be elect on the 13th of january and to meet at lima on the 1st of march next meanwhile the provisional government of general iglesias have apply for recognition to the principal power of america and europe when the will of the peruvian people shall be manifest i shall not hesitate to recognize the government approve by they diplomatic and naval representative of this government attend at caracas the centennial celebration of the birth of the illustrious bolivar at the same time the inauguration of the statue of washington in the venezuelan capital testify to the veneration in which his memory be there hold congress at its last session authorize the executive to propose to venezuela a reopening of the award of the mixed commission of caracas the departure from this country of the venezuelan minister have delay the opening of negotiation for revive the commission this government hold that until the establishment of a treaty upon this subject the venezuelan government must continue to make the payment provide for in the convention of 1866.there be grind for believe that the dispute grow out of the unpaid obligation due from venezuela to france will be satisfactorily adjust the french cabinet have propose a basis of settlement which meet my approval but as it involve a recasting of the annual quota of the foreign debt it have be deem advisable to submit the proposal to the judgment of the cabinet of berlin copenhagen the hague london and madrid at the recent coronation of his majesty king kalakaua this government be represent both diplomatically and by the formal visit of a vessel of war the question of terminate or modify the exist reciprocity treaty with hawaii be now before congress i be convinced that the charge of abuse and fraud under that treaty have be exaggerated and i renew the suggestion of last year 's message that the treaty be modify wherever its provision have prove onerous to legitimate trade between the two country i be not disposed to favor the entire cessation of the treaty relation which have foster good will between the country and contribute toward the equality of hawaii in the family of nation in pursuance of the policy declare by ibis government of extend our intercourse with the eastern nation legation have during the past year be establish in persia siam and korea it be probable that permanent mission of those country will ere long be maintain in the united states a special embassy from siam be now on its way hither treaty relation with korea be perfect by the exchange at seoul on the 19th of may last of the ratification of the lately conclude convention and envoy from the king of tab chosen have visit this country and receive a cordial welcome korea as yet unacquainted with the method of western civilization now invite the attention of those interested in the advancement of our foreign trade as it need the implement and product which the united states be ready to supply we seek no monopoly of its commerce and no advantage over other nation but as the chosenese in reach for a high civilization have confide in this republic we can not regard with indifference any encroachment on their right china by the payment of a money indemnity have settle certain of the long pende claim of our citizen and i have strong hope that the remainder will soon be adjust question have arise teach the right of american and other foreign manufacturer in china under the provision of treaty which permit alien to exercise their industry in that country on this specific point our own treaty be silent but under the operation of the most favor nation clause we have like privilege with those of other power while it be the duty of the government to see that our citizen have the full enjoyment of every benefit secure by treaty i doubt the expediency of lead in a movement to constrain china to admit an interpretation which we have only an indirect treaty right to exact the transference to china of american capital for the employment there of chinese labor would in effect inaugurate a competition for the control of market now supply by our home industry there be good reason to believe that the law restrict the immigration of chinese have be violate intentionally or otherwise by the official of china upon whom be devolve the duty of certify that the immigrant belong to the excepted class measure have be take to ascertain the fact incident to this suppose infraction and it be believe that the government of china will cooperate with the united states in secure the faithful observance of the law the same consideration which prompt congress at its last session to return to japan the simonoseki indemnity seem to i to require at its hand like action in respect to the canton indemnity fund now amount to $ 300,000.the question of the general revision of the foreign treaty of japan have be consider in an international conference hold at tokyo but without definite result as yet this government be disposed to concede the request of japan to determine its own tariff duty to provide such proper judicial tribunal as may commend themselves to the western power for the trial of cause to which foreigner be party and to assimilate the term and duration of its treaty to those of other civilized state through our minister at london and at monrovia this government have endeavor to aid liberia in its difference with great britain touch the northwestern boundary of that republic there be a prospect of adjustment of the dispute by the adoption of the mannah river as the line this arrangement be a compromise of the conflict territorial claim and take from liberia no country over which it have maintain effective jurisdiction the rich and populous valley of the kongo be be open to commerce by a society call the international african association of which the king of the belgians be the president and a citizen of the united states the chief executive officer large tract of territory have be cede to the association by native chief road have be open steamboat place on the river and the nucleus of state establish at twenty two station under one flag which offer freedom to commerce and prohibit the slave trade the object of the society be philanthropic it do not aim at permanent political control but seek the neutrality of the valley the united states can not be indifferent to this work nor to the interest of their citizen involve in it it may become advisable for we to cooperate with other commercial power in promote the right of trade and residence in the kongo valley free from the interference or political control of any one nation in view of the frequency of invitation from foreign government to participate in social and scientific congress for the discussion of important matter of general concern i repeat the suggestion of my last message that provision be make for the exercise of discretionary power by the executive in appoint delegate to such convocation able specialist be ready to serve the national interest in such capacity without personal profit or other compensation than the defrayment of expense actually incur and this a comparatively small annual appropriation would suffice to meet i have allude in my previous message to the injurious and vexatious restriction suffer by our trade in the spanish west indies brazil whose natural outlet for its great national staple coffee be in and through the united states impose a heavy export duty upon that product our petroleum export be hamper in turkey and in other eastern port by restriction as to storage and by onerous taxation for these mischief adequate relief be not always afford by reciprocity treaty like that with hawaii or that lately negotiate with mexico and now await the action of the senate be it not advisable to provide some measure of equitable retaliation in our relation with government which discriminate against our own if for example the executive be empower to apply to spanish vessel and cargo from cuba and puerto rico the same rule of treatment and scale of penalty for technical fault which be apply to our vessel and cargo in the antilles a resort to that course might not be barren of good result the report of the secretary of the treasury give a full and interesting exhibit of the financial condition of the country it show that the

the basis of exist law the secretary be of the opinion that for that year the receipt will exceed by $ 60,000,000 the ordinary expenditure include the amount devote to the sink fund hitherto the surplus as rapidly as it have accumulate have be devote to the reduction of the national debt as a result the only bond now outstanding which be redeemable at the pleasure of the government be the 3 percent amount to about $ 305,000,000.the 4 1/2 percent amount to $ 250,000,000 and the $ 737,000,000 4 percent be not payable until 1891 and 1907 respectively if the surplus shall hereafter be as large as the treasury estimate now indicate the 3 per cent bond may all be redeem at least four year before any of the 4 1/2 percent can be call in the latter at the same rate of accumulation of surplus can be pay at maturity and the money requisite for the redemption of the 4 percent will be in the treasury many year before those obligation become payable there be cogent reason however why the national indebtedness should not be thus rapidly extinguish chief among they be the fact that only by excessive taxation be such rapidity attainable in a communication to the congress at its last session i recommend that all excise taxis be abolish except those relate to distil spirit and that substantial reduction be also make in the revenue from custom a statute have since be enact by which the annual tax and tariff receipt of the government have be cut down to the extent of at least fifty or sixty million of dollar while i have no doubt that still further reduction may be wisely make i do not advise the adoption at this session of any measure for large diminution of the national revenue the result of the legislation of the last session of the congress have not as yet become sufficiently apparent to justify any radical revision or sweeping modification of exist law in the interval which must elapse before the effect of the act of march 3 1883 can be definitely ascertain a portion at least of the surplus revenue may be wisely apply to the long neglect duty of rehabilitate our navy and provide coast defense for the protection of our harbor this be a matter to which i shall again advert immediately associate with the financial subject just discuss be the important question what legislation be need regard the national currency the aggregate amount of bond now on deposit in the treasury to support the national bank circulation be about $ 350,000,000 nearly $ 200,000,000 of this amount consist of 3 percent which as already state be payable at the pleasure of the government and be likely to be call in within less than four year unless meantime the surplus revenue shall be diminish the probable effect of such an extensive retirement of the security which be the basis of the national bank circulation would be such a contraction of the volume of the currency as to produce grave commercial embarrassment how can this danger be obviate the most effectual plan and one whose adoption at the early practicable opportunity i shall heartily approve have already be indicate if the revenue of the next four year shall be keep substantially commensurate with the expense the volume of circulation will not be likely to suffer any material disturbance but if on the other hand there shall be great delay in reduce taxation it will become necessary either to substitute some other form of currency in place of the national bank note or to make important change in the law by which their circulation be now control in my judgment the latter course be far preferable i commend to your attention the very interesting and thoughtful suggestion upon this subject which appear in the secretary 's report the objection which he urge against the acceptance of any other security than the obligation of the government itself as a foundation for national bank circulation seem to i insuperable for avert the threaten contraction two course have be suggest either of which be probably feasible one be the issuance of new bond have many year to run bear a low rate of interest and exchangeable upon specify term for those now outstanding the other course which commend itself to my own judgment as the well be the enactment of a law repeal the tax on circulation and permit the bank to issue note for an amount equal to 90 per cent of the market value instead of as now the face value of their deposited bond i agree with the secretary in the belief that the adoption of this plan would afford the necessary relief the trade dollar be coin for the purpose of traffic in country where silver pass at its value as ascertain by its weight and fineness it never have a legal tender quality large number of these coin enter however into the volume of our currency by common consent their circulation in domestic trade have now cease and they have thus become a disturbing element they should not be long permit to embarrass our currency system i recommend that provision be make for their reception by the treasury and the mint as bullion at a small percentage above the current market price of silver of like fineness the secretary of the treasury advise a consolidation of certain of the custom district of the country and suggest that the president be vest with such power in relation thereto as be now give he in respect to collector of internal revenue by section 3141 of the revised statutes the statistic upon this subject which be contain in his report furnish of themselves a strong argument in defense of his view at the adjournment of congress the number of internal revenue collection district be 126 by executive order date june 25 1883 i direct that certain of these district be consolidate the result have be a reduction of one third their number which at present be but 83.from the report of the secretary of war it will be see that in only a single instance have there be any disturbance of the quiet condition of our indian tribe a raid from mexico into arizona be make in march last by a small party of indians which be pursue by general crook into the mountain region from which it have come it be confidently hope that serious outbreak will not again occur and that the indian tribe which have for so many year disturb the west will hereafter remain in peaceable submission i again call your attention to the present condition of our extended seacoast upon which be so many large city whose wealth and importance to the country would in time of war invite attack from modern armored ship against which our exist defensive work could give no adequate protection those work be build before the introduction of modern heavy rifle gun into maritime warfare and if they be not put in an efficient condition we may easily be subject to humiliation by a hostile power greatly inferior to ourselves as germane to this subject i call your attention to the importance of perfect our submarine torpedo defense the board authorize by the last congress to report upon the method which should be adopt for the manufacture of heavy ordnance adapt to modern warfare have visit the principal iron and steel work in this country and in europe it be hope that its report will soon be make and that congress will thereupon be dispose to provide suitable facility and plant for the manufacture of such gun as be now imperatively need on several occasion during the past year officer of the army have at the request of the state authority visit their militia encampment for inspection of the troop from the report of these officer i be induce to believe that the encouragement of the state militia organization by the national government would be follow by very gratifying result and would afford it in sudden emergency the aid of a large body of volunteer educate in the performance of military duty the secretary of the navy report that under the authority of the act of august 5 1882 and march 3 1883 the work of strengthen our navy by the construction of modern vessel have be auspiciously begin three cruiser be in process of construction the chicago of 4,500 ton displacement and the boston and atlanta each of 2,500 ton they be to be build of steel with the tensile strength and ductility prescribe by law and in the combination of speed endurance and armament be expect to compare favorably with the well unarmored war vessel of other nation a fourth vessel the dolphin be to be construct of similar material and be intend to serve as a fleet dispatch boat the double turrete monitor puritan amphitrite and terror have be launch on the delaware river and a contract have be make for the supply of their machinery a similar monitor the monadnock have be launch in california the naval advisory board and the secretary recommend the completion of the monitor the construction of four gunboat and also of three additional steel vessel like the chicago boston and dolphin as an important measure of national defense the secretary urge also the immediate creation of an interior coast line of waterway across the peninsula of florida along the coast from florida to hampton roads between the chesapeake bay and the delaware river and through cape cod i feel bound to impress upon the attention of congress the necessity of continue progress in the reconstruction of the navy the condition of the public treasury as i have already intimate make the present an auspicious time for put this branch of the service in a state of efficiency it be no part of our policy to create and maintain a navy able to cope with that of the other great power of the world we have no wish for foreign conquest and the peace which we have long enjoy be in no seem danger of interruption but that our naval strength should be make adequate for the defense of our harbor the protection of our commercial interest and the maintenance of our national honor be a proposition from which no patriotic citizen can withhold his assent the report of the postmaster general contain a gratify exhibit of the condition and prospect of the interesting branch of the public service commit to his care it appear that on june 30 1883 the whole number of post office be 47,863 of which 1,632 be establish during the previous fiscal year the number of office operate under the system of free delivery be 154.at these latter office the postage on local matter amount to $ 4,195,230.52 a sum exceed by $ 1,021,894.01 the entire cost of the carrier service of the country the rate of postage on drop letter pass through these office be now fix by law at 2 cent per half ounce or fraction thereof in office where the carrier system have not be establish the rate be only half as large it will be remember that in 1863 when free delivery be first establish by law the uniform single rate postage upon local letter be 1 cent and so it remain until 1872 when in those city where carrier service be establish it be increase in order to defray the expense of such service it seem to i that the old rate may now with propriety be restore and that too even at the risk of diminish for a time at least the receipt from postage upon local letter i can see no reason why that particular class of mail matter should be hold accountable for the entire cost of not only its own collection and delivery but the collection and delivery of all other class and i be confident after full consideration of the subject that the reduction of rate would be follow by such a grow accession of business as to occasion but slight and temporary loss to the revenue of the post office the postmaster general devote much of his report to the consideration in its various aspect of the relation of the government to the telegraph such reflection as i have be able to give to this subject since my last annual message have not lead i to change the view which i there express in dissent from the recommendation of the then postmaster general that the government assume the same control over the telegraph which it have always exercise over the mail admit that its authority in the premise be as ample as have ever be claim for it it would not in my judgment be a wise use of that authority to purchase or assume the control of exist telegraph line or to construct other with a view of enter into general competition with private enterprise the objection which may be justly urge against either of those project and indeed against any system which would require an enormous increase in the civil service list do not however apply to some of the plan which have lately provoke public comment and discussion it have be claim for example that congress might wisely authorize the postmaster general to contract with some private person or corporation for the transmission of message or of a certain class of message at specify rate and under government supervision various such scheme of the same general nature but widely differ in their special characteristic have be suggest in the public print and the argument by which they have be support and oppose have doubtless attract your attention it be likely that the whole subject will be consider by you at the present session in the nature of thing it involve so many question of detail that your deliberation would probably be aid slightly if at all by any particular suggestion which i might now submit i avow my belief however that the government should be authorize by law to exercise some sort of supervision over interstate telegraphic communication and i express the hope that for attain that end some measure may be devise which will receive your approbation the attorney general criticise in his report the provision of exist law fix the fee of juror and witness in the federal court these provision be chiefly contain in the act of february 26 1853 though some of they be introduce into that act from statute which have be pass many year previous it be manifest that such compensation as might when these law be enact have be just and reasonable would in many instance be justly regard at the present day as inadequate i concur with the attorney general in the belief that the statute should be revise by which these fee be regulate so too should the law which regulate the compensation of district attorney and marshal they should be pay wholly by salary instead of in part by fee as be now the case the change would prove to be a measure of economy and would discourage the institution of needless and oppressive legal proceeding which it be to be fear have in some instance be conduct for the mere sake of personal gain much interesting and varied information be contain in the report of the secretary of the interior i particularly call your attention to his presentation of certain phase of the indian question to his recommendation for the repeal of the preemption and timber culture act and for more stringent legislation to prevent fraud under the pension law the statute which prescribe the definition and punishment of crime relate to pension could doubtless be make more effective by certain amendment and addition which be point out in the secretary 's report i have previously refer to the alarming state of illiteracy in certain portion of the country and again submit for the consideration of congress whether some federal aid should not be extend to public primary education wherever adequate provision therefor have not already be make "the utah commission have submit to the secretary of the interior its second annual report as a result of its labor in supervise the recent election in that territory pursuant to the act of march 22 1882 it appear that person by that act disqualify to the number of about 12,000 be exclude from the poll this fact however afford little cause for congratulation and i fear that it be far from indicate any real and substantial progress toward the extirpation of polygamy all the member elect of the legislature be mormon there be grave reason to believe that they be in sympathy with the practice that this government be seek to suppress and that its effort in that regard will be more likely to encounter their opposition than to receive their encouragement and support even if this view should happily be erroneous the law under which the commissioner have be act should be make more effective by the incorporation of some such stringent amendment as they recommend and as be include in bill no 2238 on the calendar of the senate at its last session i be convince however that polygamy have become so strongly intrench in the territory of utah that it be profitless to attack it with any but the stout weapon which constitutional legislation can fashion i favor therefore the repeal of the act upon which the exist government depend the assumption by the national legislature of the entire political control of the territory and the establishment of a commission with such power and duty as shall be delegate to it by law the department of agriculture be accomplish much in the direction of the agricultural development of the country and the report of the commissioner give the result of his investigation and experiment will be find interesting and valuable at his instance a convention of those interested in the cattle industry of the country be lately hold at chicago the prevalence of pleuropneumonia and other contagious disease of animal be one of the chief topic of discussion a committee of the convention will invite your cooperation in investigate the cause of these disease and provide method for their prevention and cure i trust that congress will not fail at its present session to put alaska under the protection of law its people have repeatedly remonstrate against our neglect to afford they the maintenance and protection expressly guarantee by the term of the treaty whereby that territory be cede to the united states for sixteen year they have plead in vain for that which they should have receive without the asking they have no law for the collection of debt the support of education the conveyance of property the administration of estate or the enforcement of contract none indeed for the punishment of criminal except such as offend against certain custom commerce and navigation act the resource of alaska especially in fur mine and lumber be considerable in extent and capable of large development while its geographical situation be one of political and commercial importance the prompting of interest therefore as well as consideration of honor and good faith demand the immediate establishment of civil government in that territory complaint have lately be numerous and urgent that certain corporation control in whole or in part the facility for the interstate carriage of person and merchandise over the great railroad of the country have resort in their dealing with the public to diver measure unjust and oppressive in their character in some instance the state government have attack and suppress these evil but in other they have be unable to afford adequate relief because of the jurisdictional limitation which be impose upon they by the federal constitution the question how far the national government may lawfully interfere in the premise and what if any supervision or control it ought to exercise be one which merit your careful consideration while we can not fail to recognize the importance of the vast railway system of the country and their great and beneficent influence upon the development of our material wealth we should on the other hand remember that no individual and no corporation ought to be invest with absolute power over the interest of any other citizen or class of citizen the right of these railway corporation to a fair and profitable return upon their investment and to reasonable freedom in their regulation must be recognize but it seem only just that so far as its constitutional authority will permit congress should protect the people at large in their interstate traffic against act of injustice which the state government be powerless to prevent in my last annual message i call attention to the necessity of protect by suitable legislation the forest situate upon the public domain in many portion of the west the pursuit of general agriculture be only make practicable by resort to irrigation while successful irrigation would itself be impossible without the aid afford by forest in contribute to the regularity and constancy of the supply of water during the past year severe suffering and great loss of property have be occasion by profuse flood follow by period of unusually low water in many of the great river of the country these irregularity be in great measure cause by the removal from about the source of the stream in question of the timber by which the water supply have be nourish and protect the preservation of such portion of the forest on the national domain as essentially contribute to the equable flow of important water course be of the high consequence important tributary of the missouri the columbia and the saskatchewan rise in the mountain region of montana near the northern boundary of the united states between the blackfeet and flathead indian reservation this region be unsuitable for settlement but upon the river which flow from it depend the future agricultural development of a vast tract of country the attention of congress be call to the necessity of withdraw from public sale this part of the public domain and establish there a forest preserve the industrial exhibition which have be hold in the united states during the present year attract attention in many foreign country where the announcement of those enterprise have be make public through the foreign agency of this government the industrial exhibition at boston and the southern exposition at louisville be largely attend by the exhibitor of foreign country notwithstanding the absence of any profess national character in those undertaking the centennial exposition to be hold next year at new orleans in commemoration of the centenary of the first shipment of cotton from a port of the united states bid fair to meet with like gratify success under the act of congress of the 10th of february 1883 declare that exposition to be national and international in its character all foreign government with which the united states maintain relation have be invite to participate the promoter of this important undertaking have already receive assurance of the lively interest which it have excite abroad the report of the commissioners of the district of columbia be herewith transmit i ask for it your careful attention especially for those portion which relate to assessment arrear of taxis and increase of water supply the commissioner who be appoint under the act of january 16 1883 entitle an act to regulate and improve the civil service of the united states enter promptly upon the discharge of their duty a series of rule frame in accordance with the spirit of the statute be approve and promulgate by the president in some particular wherein they seem defective those rule be subsequently amend it will be perceive that they discountenance any political or religious test for admission to those office of the public service to which the statute relate the act be limit in its original application to the classified clerkship in the several executive departments at washington number about 5,600 and to similar position in custom district and post office where as many as fifty person be employ a classification of these position analogous to that exist in the washington office be duly make before the law go into effect eleven custom district and twenty three post office be thus bring under the immediate operation of the statute the annual report of the civil service commission which will soon be submit to congress will doubtless afford the mean of a more definite judgment than i be now prepared to express as to the merit of the new system i be persuade that its effect have thus far prove beneficial its practical method appear to be adequate for the end propose and there have be no serious difficulty in carry they into effect since the 16th of july last no person so far as i be aware have be appoint to the public service in the classified portion thereof at any of the departments or at any of the post office and custom district above name except those certify by the commission to be the most competent on the basis of the examination hold in conformity to the rule at the time when the present executive enter upon his office his death removal resignation or inability to discharge his duty would have leave the government without a constitutional head it be possible of course that a similar contingency may again arise unless the wisdom of congress shall provide against its recurrence the senate at its last session after full consideration pass an act relate to this subject which will now i trust commend itself to the approval of both houses of congress the clause of the constitution upon which must depend any law regulate the presidential succession present also for solution other question of paramount importance these question relate to the proper interpretation of the phrase inability to discharge the power and duty of say office our organic law provide that when the president shall suffer from such inability the presidential office shall devolve upon the vice president who must himself under like circumstance give place to such officer as congress may by law appoint to act as president i need not here set forth the numerous and interesting inquiry which be suggest by these word of the constitution they be fully state in my first communication to congress and have since be the subject of frequent deliberation in that body it be greatly to be hope that these momentous question will find speedy solution lest emergency may arise when long delay will be impossible and any determination albeit the wise may furnish cause for anxiety and alarm for the reason fully state in my last annual message i repeat my recommendation that congress propose an amendment to that provision of the constitution which prescribe the formality for the enactment of law whereby in respect to bill for the appropriation of public money the executive may be enable while give his approval to particular item to interpose his veto as to such other as do not commend themselves to his judgment the fourteenth amendment of the constitution confer the right of citizenship upon all person bear or naturalize in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof it be the special purpose of this amendment to insure to member of the colored race the full enjoyment of civil and political right certain statutory provision intend to secure the enforcement of those right have be recently declare unconstitutional by the supreme court any legislation whereby congress may lawfully supplement the guaranty which the constitution afford for the equal enjoyment by all the citizen of the united states of every right privilege and immunity of citizenship will receive my unhesitate approval

 secretary of state

to the congress of the united states since the close of your last session the american people in the exercise of their high right of suffrage have choose their chief magistrate for the four year ensue when it be remember that at no period in the country 's history have the long political contest which customarily precede the day of the national election be wage with great fervor and intensity it be a subject of general congratulation that after the controversy at the poll be over and while the slight preponderance by which the issue have be determine be as yet unascertaine the public peace suffer no disturbance but the people everywhere patiently and quietly await the result nothing could more strikingly illustrate the temper of the american citizen his love of order and his loyalty to law nothing could more signally demonstrate the strength and wisdom of our political institution eight year have pass since a controversy concern the result of a national election sharply call the attention of the congress to the necessity of provide more precise and definite regulation for count the electoral vote it be of the grave importance that this question be solve before conflict claim to the presidency shall again distract the country and i be persuade that by the people at large any of the measure of relief thus far propose would be prefer to continue inaction our relation with all foreign power continue to be amicable with belgium a convention have be sign whereby the scope of present treaty have be so enlarge as to secure to citizen of either country within the jurisdiction of the other equal right and privilege in the acquisition and alienation of property a trade mark treaty have also be conclude the war between chile and peru be at an end for the arbitration of the claim of american citizen who during its continuance suffer through the act of the chilean authority a convention will soon be negotiate the state of hostility between france and china continue to be an embarrassing feature of our eastern relation the chinese government have promptly adjust and pay the claim of american citizen whose property be destroy in the recent riot at canton i renew the recommendation of my last annual message that the canton indemnity fund be return to china the true interpretation of the recent treaty with that country permit the restriction of chinese immigration be likely to be again the subject of your deliberation it may be seriously question whether the statute pass at the last session do not violate the treaty right of certain chinese who leave this country with return certificate valid under the old law and who now seem to be debar from relande for lack of the certificate require by the new the recent purchase by citizen of the united states of a large trading fleet heretofore under the chinese flag have considerably enhance our commercial importance in the east in view of the large number of vessel build or purchase by american citizen in other country and exclusively employ in legitimate traffic between foreign port under the recognize protection of our flag it might be well to provide a uniform rule for their registration and documentation so that the bona fide property right of our citizen therein shall be duly evidence and properly guard pursuant to the advice of the senate at the last session i recognize the flag of the international association of the kongo as that of a friendly government avoid in so do any prejudgment of conflict territorial claim in that region subsequently in execution of the express wish of the congress i appoint a commercial agent for the kongo basin the importance of the rich prospective trade of the kongo valley have lead to the general conviction that it should be open to all nation upon equal term at an international conference for the consideration of this subject call by the emperor of germany and now in session at berlin delegate be in attendance on behalf of the united states of the result of the conference you will be duly advise the government of korea have generously aid the effort of the united states minister to secure suitable premise for the use of the legation as the condition of diplomatic intercourse with eastern nation demand that the legation premise be own by the represent power i advise that an appropriation be make for the acquisition of this property by the government the united states already possess valuable premise at tangier as a gift from the sultan of morocco as be state hereafter they have lately receive a similar gift from the siamese government the government of japan stand ready to present to we extensive ground at tokyo whereon to erect a suitable building for the legation court house and jail and similar privilege can probably be secure in china and persia the owning of such premise would not only effect a large saving of the present rental but would permit of the due assertion of extraterritorial right in those country and would the well serve to maintain the dignity of the united states the failure of congress to make appropriation for our representation at the autonomous court of the khedive have prove a serious embarrassment in our intercourse with egypt and in view of the necessary intimacy of diplomatic relationship due to the participation of this government as one of the treaty power in all matter of administration there affect the right of foreigner i advise the restoration of the agency and consulate general at cairo on its former basis i do not conceive it to be the wish of congress that the united states should withdraw altogether from the honorable position they have hitherto hold with respect to the khedive or that citizen of this republic reside or sojourning in egypt should hereafter be without the aid and protection of a competent representative with france the traditional cordial relationship continue the colossal statue of liberty enlightening the world the generous gift of the people of france be expect to reach new york in may next i suggest that congressional action be take in recognition of the spirit which have prompt this gift and in aid of the timely completion of the pedestal upon which it be to be place our relation with germany a country which contribute to our own some of the good element of citizenship continue to be cordial the united states have extradition treaty with several of the german states but by reason of the confederation of those states under the imperial rule the application of such treaty be not as uniform and comprehensive as the interest of the two country require i propose therefore to open negotiation for a single convention of extradition to embrace all the territory of the empire it afford i pleasure to say that our intercourse with great britain continue to be of a most friendly character the government of hawaii have indicate its willingness to continue for seven year the provision of the exist reciprocity treaty such continuance in view of the relation of that country to the american system of states should in my judgment be favor the revolution in hayti against the established government have terminate while it be in progress it become necessary to enforce our neutrality law by institute proceeding against individual and vessel charge with their infringement these prosecution be in all case successful much anxiety have lately be display by various european governments and especially by the government of italy for the abolition of our import duty upon work of art it be well to consider whether the present discrimination in favor of the production of american artist abroad be not likely to result as they themselves seem very generally to believe it may in the practical exclusion of our painter and sculptor from the rich field for observation study and labor which they have hitherto enjoy there be prospect that the long pende revision of the foreign treaty of japan may be conclude at a new conference to be hold at tokyo while this government fully recognize the equal and independent station of japan in the community of nation it would not oppose the general adoption of such term of compromise as japan may be dispose to offer in furtherance of a uniform policy of intercourse with western nation during the past year the increase good will between our own government and that of mexico have be variously manifest the treaty of commercial reciprocity conclude january 20 1883 have be ratify and await the necessary tariff legislation of congress to become effective this legislation will i doubt not be among the first measure to claim your attention a full treaty of commerce navigation and consular right be much to be desire and such a treaty i have reason to believe that the mexican government stand ready to conclude some embarrassment have be occasion by the failure of congress at its last session to provide mean for the due execution of the treaty of july 29 1882 for the resurvey of the mexican boundary and the relocation of boundary monument with the republic of nicaragua a treaty have be conclude which authorize the construction by the united states of a canal railway and telegraph line across the nicaraguan territory by the term of this treaty 60 mile of the river san juan as well as lake nicaragua an inland sea 40 mile in width be to constitute a part of the project enterprise this leave for actual canal construction 17 mile on the pacific side and 36 mile on the atlantic to the united states whose rich territory on the pacific be for the ordinary purpose of commerce practically cut off from communication by water with the atlantic port the political and commercial advantage of such a project can scarcely be overestimate it be believe that when the treaty be lay before you the justice and liberality of its provision will command universal approval at home and abroad the death of our representative at russia while at his post at st. petersburg afford to the imperial government a renew opportunity to testify its sympathy in a manner befit the intimate friendliness which have ever mark the intercourse of the two country the course of this government in raise its representation at bangkok to the diplomatic rank have evoke from siam evidence of warm friendship and augur well for our enlarged intercourse the siamese government have present to the united states a commodious mansion and ground for the occupancy of the legation and i suggest that by joint resolution congress attest its appreciation of this generous gift this government have more than once be call upon of late to take action in fulfillment of its international obligation toward spain agitation in the island of cuba hostile to the spanish crown having be foment by person abuse the sacred right of hospitality which our territory afford the officer of this government have be instruct to exercise vigilance to prevent infraction of our neutrality law at key west and at other point near the cuban coast i be happy to say that in the only instance where these precautionary measure be successfully elude the offender when find in our territory be subsequently try and convict the grow need of close relationship of intercourse and traffic between the spanish antilles and their natural market in the united states lead to the adoption in january last of a commercial agreement look to that end this agreement have since be supersede by a more carefully frame and comprehensive convention which i shall submit to the senate for approval it have be the aim of this negotiation to open such a favor reciprocal exchange of production carry under the flag of either country as to make the intercourse between cuba and puerto rico and ourselves scarcely less intimate than the commercial movement between our domestic port and to insure a removal of the burden on shipping in the spanish indies of which in the past our shipowner and shipmaster have so often have cause to complain the negotiation of this convention have for a time postpone the prosecution of certain claim of our citizen which be declare to be without the jurisdiction of the late spanish american claims commission and which be therefore remit to diplomatic channel for adjustment the speedy settlement of these claim will now be urge by this government negotiation for a treaty of commercial reciprocity with the dominican republic have be successfully conclude and the result will shortly be lay before the senate certain question between the united states and the ottoman empire still remain unsolved complaint on behalf of our citizen be not satisfactorily adjust the porte have seek to withhold from our commerce the right of favor treatment to which we be entitle by exist conventional stipulation and the revision of the tariff be unaccomplished the final disposition of pende question with venezuela have not as yet be reach but i have good reason to expect an early settlement which will provide the mean of reexamine the caracas award in conformity with the express desire of congress and which will recognize the justice of certain claim prefer against venezuela the central and south american commission appoint by authority of the act of july 7 1884 will soon proceed to mexico it have be furnish with instruction which will be lay before you they contain a statement of the general policy of the government for enlarge its commercial intercourse with american states the commissioner have be actively prepare for their responsible task by hold conference in the principal city with merchant and other interested in central and south american trade the international meridian conference lately convene in washington upon the invitation of the government of the united states be compose of representative from twenty five nation the conference conclude its labor on the 1st of november have with substantial unanimity agree upon the meridian of greenwich as the starting point whence longitude be to be compute through 180 degree eastward and westward and upon the adoption for all purpose for which it may be find convenient of a universal day which shall begin at midnight on the initial meridian and whose hour shall be count from zero up to twenty four the formal report of the transaction of this conference will be hereafter transmit to the congress this government be in frequent receipt of invitation from foreign state to participate in international exhibition often of great interest and importance occupying as we do an advanced position in the world 's production and aim to secure a profitable share for our industry in the general competitive market it be a matter of serious concern that the want of mean for participation in these exhibition should so often exclude our producer from advantage enjoy by those of other country during the past year the attention of congress be draw to the formal invitation in this regard tender by the governments of england holland belgium germany and austria the executive have in some instance appoint honorary commissioner this be however a most unsatisfactory expedient for without some provision to meet the necessary working expense of a commission it can effect little or nothing in behalf of exhibitor an international inventions exhibition be to be hold in london next may this will cover a field of special importance in which our country hold a foremost rank but the executive be at present powerless to organize a proper representation of our vast national interest in this direction i have in several previous message refer to this subject it seem to i that a statute give to the executive general discretionary authority to accept such invitation and to appoint honorary commissioner without salary and place at the disposal of the secretary of state a small fund for defray their reasonable expense would be of great public utility this government have receive official notice that the revise international regulation for prevent collision at sea have be adopt by all the lead maritime power except the united states and come into force on the 1st of september last for the due protection of our shipping interest the provision of our statute should at once be bring into conformity with these regulation the question of securing to author composer and artist copyright privilege in this country in return for reciprocal right abroad be one that may justly challenge your attention it be true that convention will be necessary for fully accomplish this result but until congress shall by statute fix the extent to which foreign holder of copyright shall be here privileged it have be deem inadvisable to negotiate such convention for this reason the united states be not represent at the recent conference at berne i recommend that the scope of the neutrality law of the united states be so enlarge as to cover all patent act of hostility commit in our territory and aim against the peace of a friendly nation exist statute prohibit the fitting out of armed expedition and restrict the shipment of explosive though the enactment in the latter respect be not frame with regard to international obligation but simply for the protection of passenger travel all these statute be intend to meet special emergency that have already arise other emergency have arise since and modern ingenuity supply mean for the organization of hostility without open resort to armed vessel or to filibuster party i see no reason why overt preparation in this country for the commission of criminal act such as be here under consideration should not be alike punishable whether such act be intend to be commit in our own country or in a foreign country with which we be at peace the prompt and thorough treatment of this question be one which intimately concern the national honor our exist naturalization law also need revision those section relate to person reside within the limit of the united states in 1795 and 1798 have now only a historical interest section 2172 recognize the citizenship of the child of naturalized parent be ambiguous in its term and partly obsolete there be special provision of law favor the naturalization of those who serve in the army or in merchant vessel while no similar privilege be grant those who serve in the navy or the marine corps "an uniform rule of naturalization such as the constitution contemplate should among other thing clearly define the status of person bear within the united states subject to a foreign power section 1992 and of minor child of father who have declare their intention to become citizen but have fail to perfect their naturalization it might be wise to provide for a central bureau of registry wherein should be file authenticated transcript of every record of naturalization in the several federal and state court and to make provision also for the vacation or cancellation of such record in case where fraud have be practice upon the court by the applicant himself or where he have renounce or forfeit his acquire citizenship a just and uniform law in this respect would strengthen the hand of the government in protect its citizen abroad and would pave the way for the conclusion of treaty of naturalization with foreign country the legislation of the last session effect in the diplomatic and consular service certain change and reduction which have be productive of embarrassment the population and commercial activity of our country be steadily on the increase and be give rise to new varying and often delicate relationship with other country our foreign establishment now embrace nearly double the area of operation that it occupy twenty year ago the confinement of such a service within the limit of expenditure then establish be not it seem to i in accordance with true economy a community of 60,000,000 people should be adequately represent in its intercourse with foreign nation a project for the reorganization of the consular service and for recast the scheme of extraterritorial jurisdiction be now before you if the limit of a short session will not allow of its full consideration i trust that you will not fail to make suitable provision for the present need of the service it have be customary to define in the appropriation act the rank of each diplomatic office to which a salary be attach i suggest that this course be abandon and that it be leave to the president with the advice and consent of the senate to fix from time to time the diplomatic grade of the representative of this government abroad as may seem advisable provision be definitely make however as now for the amount of salary attach to the respective station the condition of our finance and the operation of the various branch of the public service which be connect with the treasury department be very fully discuss in the report of the secretary it appear that the ordinary revenue for the fiscal year end june 30 1884 be from customs$195,067,489.76from internal revenue121,586,072.51from all other sources31,866,307.65total ordinary

expenditure the aggregate receipt be less than those of the year previous by about $ 54,000,000 the fall off in revenue from custom make up nearly $ 20,000,000 of this deficiency and about $ 23,000,000 of the remainder be due to the diminished receipt from internal taxation the secretary estimate the total receipt for the fiscal year which will end june 30 1885 at $ 330,000,000 and the total expenditure at $ 290,620,201.16 in which sum be include the interest on the debt and the amount payable to the sink fund this would leave a surplus for the entire year of about $ 39,000,000.the value of export from the united states to foreign country during the year end june 30 1884 be as follow domestic merchandise$724,964,852foreign merchandise15,548,757total

cotton30,454,476hide and skin other than fur skins22,350,906i concur with the secretary of the treasury in recommend the immediate suspension of the coinage of silver dollar and of the issuance of silver certificate this be a matter to which in former communication i have more than once invoke the attention of the national legislature it appear that annually for the past six year there have be coin in compliance with the requirement of the act of february 28 1878 more than 27,000,000 silver dollar the number now outstanding be report by the secretary to be nearly 185,000,000 whereof but little more than 40,000,000 or less than 22 per cent be in actual circulation the mere existence of this fact seem to i to furnish of itself a cogent argument for the repeal of the statute which have make such fact possible but there be other and graver consideration that tend in the same direction the secretary avow his conviction that unless this coinage and the issuance of silver certificate be suspend silver be likely at no distant day to become our sole metallic standard the commercial disturbance and the impairment of national credit that would be thus occasioned can scarcely be overestimate i hope that the secretary 's suggestion respect the withdrawal from circulation of the $ 1 and $ 2 note will receive your approval it be likely that a considerable portion of the silver now encumber the vault of the treasury might thus find its way into the currency while trade dollar have cease for the present at least to be an element of active disturbance in our currency system some provision should be make for their surrender to the government in view of the circumstance under which they be coin and of the fact that they have never have a legal tender quality there should be offer for they only a slight advance over their bullion value the secretary in the course of his report consider the propriety of beautify the design of our subsidiary silver coin and of so increase their weight that they may bear their due ratio of value to the standard dollar his conclusion in this regard be cordially approve in my annual message of 1882 i recommend the abolition of all excise taxis except those relate to distil spirit this recommendation be now renew in case these taxis shall be abolish the revenue that will still remain to the government will in my opinion not only suffice to meet its reasonable expenditure but will afford a surplus large enough to permit such tariff reduction as may seem to be advisable when the result of recent revenue law and commercial treaty shall have show in what quarter those reduction can be most judiciously effect one of the grave of the problem which appeal to the wisdom of congress for solution be the ascertainment of the most effective mean for increase our foreign trade and thus relieve the depression under which our industry be now languish the secretary of the treasury advise that the duty of investigate this subject be intrust in the first instance to a competent commission while fully recognize the consideration that may be urge against this course i be nevertheless of the opinion that upon the whole no other would be likely to effect speedy or well result that portion of the secretary 's report which concern the condition of our shipping interest can not fail to command your attention he emphatically recommend that as an incentive to the investment of american capital in american steamship the government shall by liberal payment for mail transportation or otherwise lend its active assistance to individual enterprise and declare his belief that unless that course be pursue our foreign carrying trade must remain as it be to day almost exclusively in the hand of foreigner one phase of this subject be now especially prominent in view of the repeal by the act of june 26 1884 of all statutory provision arbitrarily compelling american vessel to carry the mail to and from the united states as it be necessary to make provision to compensate the owner of such vessel for perform that service after april 1885 it be hope that the whole subject will receive early consideration that will lead to the enactment of such measure for the revival of our merchant marine as the wisdom of congress may devisethe 3 per cent bond of the government to the amount of more than $ 100,000,000 have since my last annual message be redeem by the treasury the bond of that issue still outstanding amount to little over $ 200,000,000 about one fourth of which will be retire through the operation of the sink fund during the come year as these bond still constitute the chief basis for the circulation of the national bank the question how to avert the contraction of the currency cause by their retirement be one of constantly increase importance it seem to be generally concede that the law govern this matter exact from the bank excessive security and that upon their present bond deposit a large circulation than be now allow may be grant with safety i hope that the bill which pass the senate at the last session permit the issue of note equal to the face value of the deposited bond will commend itself to the approval of the house of representatives in the expense of the war department the secretary report a decrease of more than $ 9,000,000 of this reduction $ 5,600,000 be effect in the expenditure for river and harbor and $ 2,700,000 in expenditure for the quartermaster 's department outside of that department the annual expense of all the army bureaus proper except possibly the ordnance bureau be substantially fix charge which can not be materially diminish without a change in the numerical strength of the army the expenditure in the quartermaster 's department can readily be subject to administrative discretion and it be report by the secretary of war that as a result of exercise such discretion in reduce the number of draft and pack animal in the army the annual cost of supply and care for such animal be now $ 1,108,085.90 less than it be in 1881.the report of military commander show that the last year have be notable for its entire freedom from indian outbreak in defiance of the president 's proclamation of july 1 1884 certain intruder seek to make settlement in the indian territory they be promptly remove by a detachment of troop during the past session of congress a bill to provide a suitable fire proof building for the army medical museum and the library of the surgeon general 's office receive the approval of the senate a similar bill report favorably to the house of representatives by one of its committee be still pende before that body it be hope that during the come session the measure may become a law and that thereafter immediate step may be take to secure a place of safe deposit for these valuable collection now in a state of insecurity the fund with which the work for the improvement of river and harbor be prosecute during the past year be derive from the appropriation of the act of august 2 1882 together with such few balance as be on hand from previous appropriation the balance in the treasury subject to requisition july 1 1883 be $ 10,021,649.55 the amount appropriate during the fiscal year 1884 be $ 1,319,634.62 and the amount draw from the treasury during the fiscal year be $ 8,228,703.54 leave a balance of $ 3,112,580.63 in the treasury subject to requisition july 1 1884.the secretary of war submit the report of the chief of engineers as to the practicability of protect our important city on the seaboard by fortification and other defense able to repel modern method of attack the time have now come when such defense can be prepare with confidence that they will not prove abortive and when the possible result of delay in make such preparation be seriously consider delay seem inexcusable for the most important city those whose destruction or capture would be a national humiliation adequate defense inclusive of gun may be make by the gradual expenditure of $ 60,000,000 -a sum much less than a victorious enemy could levy as a contribution an appropriation of about one tenth of that amount be ask to begin the work and i concur with the secretary of war in urge that it be grant the war department be proceed with the conversion of 10 inch smoothbore gun into 8 inch rifle by line the former with tube of forge steel or of coil wrought iron fifty gun will be thus convert within the year this however do not obviate the necessity of provide mean for the construction of gun of the high power both for the purpose of coast defense and for the armament of war vessel the report of the gun foundry board appoint april 2 1883 in pursuance of the act of march 3 1883 be transmit to congress in a special message of february 18 1884 in my message of march 26 1884 i call attention to the recommendation of the board that the government should encourage the production at private steel work of the require material for heavy cannon and that two government factory one for the army and one for the navy should be establish for the fabrication of gun from such material no action having be take the board be subsequently reconvene to determine more fully the plan and estimate necessary for carry out its recommendation it have receive information which indicate that there be responsible steel manufacturer in this country who although not provide at present with the necessary plant be willing to construct the same and to make bid for contract with the government for the supply of the requisite material for the heavy gun adapt to modern warfare if a guarantee order of sufficient magnitude accompany by a positive appropriation extend over a series of year shall be make by congress all doubt as to the feasibility of the plan be thus remove i renew my recommendation that such action be take by congress as will enable the government to construct its own ordnance upon its own territory and so to provide the armament demand by consideration of national safety and honor the report of the secretary of the navy exhibit the progress which have be make on the new steel cruiser authorize by the act of august 5 1882 and march 3 1883 of the four vessel under contract one the chicago of 4,500 ton be more than half finish the atlanta of 3,000 ton have be successfully launch and her machinery be now fitting the boston also of 3,000 ton be ready for launch and the dolphin a dispatch steamer of 1,500 ton be ready for delivery certain adverse criticism upon the design of these cruiser be discuss by the secretary who insist that the correctness of the conclusion reach by the advisory board and by the department have be demonstrate by recent development in shipbuilde abroad the machinery of the double turrete monitor puritan terror and amphitrite contract for under the act of march 3 1883 be in process of construction no work have be do during the past year on their armor for lack of the necessary appropriation a fourth monitor the monadnock still remain unfinished at the navy yard in california it be recommend that early step be take to complete these vessel and to provide also an armament for the monitor miantonomoh the recommendation of the naval advisory board approve by the department comprise the construction of one steel cruiser of 4,500 ton one cruiser of 3,000 ton two heavily armed gunboat one light cruising gunboat one dispatch vessel arm with hotchkiss cannon one armored ram and three torpedo boat the general design all of which be calculate to meet the exist want of the service be now well advanced and the construction of the vessel can be undertake as soon as you shall grant the necessary authority the act of congress approve august 7 1882 authorize the removal to the united states of the body of lieutenant commander george w. de long and his companion of the jeannette expedition this removal have be successfully accomplish by lieutenants harber and schuetze the remain be take from their grave in the lena delta in march 1883 and be retain at yakutsk until the follow winter the season be too far advanced to admit of their immediate transportation they arrive at new york february 20 1884 where they be receive with suitable honor in pursuance of the joint resolution of congress approve february 13 1884 a naval expedition be fit out for the relief of lieutenant a. w. greely united states army and of the party who have be engage under his command in scientific observation at lady franklin bay the fleet consist of the steam sealer thetis purchase in england the bear purchase at st. johns newfoundland and the alert which be generously provide by the british government preparation for the expedition be promptly make by the secretary of the navy with the active cooperation of the secretary of war commander george w. coffin be place in command of the alert and lieutenant william h. emory in command of the bear the thetis be intrust to commander winfield s. schley to whom also be assign the superintendence of the entire expedition immediately upon its arrival at upernavik the fleet begin the dangerous navigation of melville bay and in spite of every obstacle reach littleton island on june 22 a fortnight early than any vessel have before attain that point on the same day it cross over to cape sabine where lieutenant greely and the other survivor of his party be discover after take on board the living and the body of the dead the relief ship sail for st. johns where they arrive on july 17 they be appropriately receive at portsmouth n. h. on august 1 and at new york on august 8 one of the body be land at the former place the other be put on shore at governors island and with the exception of one which be inter in the national cemetery be forward thence to the destination indicate by friend the organization and conduct of this relief expedition reflect great credit upon all who contribute to its success in this the last of the state message that i shall have the honor to transmit to the congress of the united states i can not too strongly urge upon its attention the duty of restore our navy as rapidly as possible to the high state of efficiency which formerly characterize it as the long peace that have lull we into a sense of fancied security may at any time be disturb it be plain that the policy of strengthen this arm of the service be dictate by consideration of wise economy of just regard for our future tranquillity and of true appreciation of the dignity and honor of the republic the report of the postmaster general acquaint you with the present condition and need of the postal service it disclose the gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from the reduction in the rate of letter postage recommend in my message of december 4 1882 and effect by the act of march 3 1883 have be much less than be generally anticipate my recommendation of this reduction be base upon the belief that the actual fall off in receipt from letter postage for the year immediately succeed the change of rate would be $ 3,000,000 it have prove to be only $ 2,275,000.this be a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon be restore to its former volume by the natural increase of seal correspondence i confidently repeat therefore the recommendation of my last annual message that the single rate postage upon drop letter be reduce to 1 cent wherever the payment of 2 cent be now require by law the double rate be only exact at office where the carrier system be in operation and it appear that at those office the increase in the tax upon local letter defray the cost not only of its own collection and delivery but of the collection and delivery of all other mail matter this be an inequality that ought no long to exist i approve the recommendation of the postmaster general that the unit of weight in the rating of first class matter should be 1 ounce instead of one half ounce as it now be in view of the statistic furnish by the department it may well be doubt whether the change would result in any loss of revenue that it would greatly promote the convenience of the public be beyond dispute the free delivery system have be lately apply to five city and the total number of office in which it be now in operation be 159 experience show that its adoption under proper condition be equally an accommodation to the public and an advantage to the postal service it be more than self sustain and for the reason urge by the postmaster general may properly be extend in the opinion of that officer it be important to provide mean whereby exceptional dispatch in deal with letter in free delivery office may be secure by payment of extraordinary postage this scheme might be make effective by employment of a special stamp whose cost should be commensurate with the expense of the extra service in some of the large city private express company have undertake to outstrip the government mail carrier by afford for the prompt transmission of letter well facility than have hitherto be at the command of the post office it have always be the policy of the government to discourage such enterprise and in no well mode can that policy be maintain than in supply the public with the most efficient mail service that with due regard to its own good interest can be furnish for its accommodation the attorney general renew the recommendation contain in his report of last year touch the fee of witness and juror he favor radical change in the fee bill the adoption of a system by which attorney and marshal of the united states shall be compensate solely by salary and the erection by the government of a penitentiary for the confinement of offender against its law of the varied governmental concern in charge of the interior department the report of its secretary present an interesting summary among the topic deserve particular attention i refer you to his observation respect our indian affair the preemption and timber culture act the failure of railroad company to take title to land grant by the government and the operation of the pension office the patent office the census bureau and the bureau of education allusion have be make already to the circumstance that both as between the different indian tribe and as between the indians and the white the past year have be one of unbroken peace in this circumstance the president be glad to find justification for the policy of the government in its dealing with the indian question and confirmation of the view which be fully express in his first communication to the forty seventh congress the secretary urge anew the enactment of a statute for the punishment of crime commit on the indian reservation and recommend the passage of the bill now pende in the house of representatives for the purchase of a tract of 18,000 square mile from the sioux reservation both these measure be worthy of approval i concur with he also in advise the repeal of the preemption law the enactment of statute resolve the present legal complication touch lapse grant to railroad company and the funding of the debt of the several pacific railroad under such guaranty as shall effectually secure its ultimate payment the report of the utah commission will be read with interest it disclose the result of recent legislation look to the prevention and punishment of polygamy in that territory i still believe that if that abominable practice can be suppress by law it can only be by the most radical legislation consistent with the restraint of the constitution i again recommend therefore that congress assume absolute political control of the territory of utah and provide for the appointment of commissioner with such governmental power as in its judgment may justly and wisely be put into their hand in the course of this communication reference have more than once be make to the policy of this government as regard the extension of our foreign trade it seem proper to declare the general principle that should in my opinion underlie our national effort in this direction the main condition of the problem may be thus state we be a people apt in mechanical pursuit and fertile in invention we cover a vast extent of territory rich in agricultural product and in nearly all the raw material necessary for successful manufacture we have a system of productive establishment more than sufficient to supply our own demand the wage of labor be nowhere else so great the scale of living of our artisan class be such as tend to secure their personal comfort and the development of those high moral and intellectual quality that go to the making of good citizen our system of tax and tariff legislation be yield a revenue which be in excess of the present need of the government these be the element from which it be seek to devise a scheme by which without unfavorably change the condition of the workingman our merchant marine shall be raise from its enfeeble condition and new market provide for the sale beyond our border of the manifold fruit of our industrial enterprise the problem be complex and can be solve by no single measure of innovation or reform the country of the american continent and the adjacent island be for the united states the natural mart of supply and demand it be from they that we should obtain what we do not produce or do not produce in sufficiency and it be to they that the surplus production of our field our mill and our workshop should flow under condition that will equalize or favor they in comparison with foreign competition four path of policy seem to point to this end first a series of reciprocal commercial treaty with the country of america which shall foster between we and they an unhampere movement of trade the condition of these treaty should be the free admission of such merchandise as this country do not produce in return for the admission free or under a favor scheme of duty of our own product the benefit of such exchange to apply only to good carry under the flag of the party to the contract the removal on both side from the vessel so privileged of all tonnage due and national impost so that those vessel may ply unhindered between our port and those of the other contracting party though without infringe on the reserved home coasting trade the removal or reduction of burden on the export product of those country come within the benefit of the treaty and the avoidance of the technical restriction and penalty by which our intercourse with those country be at present hamper secondly the establishment of the consular service of the united states on a salaried footing thus permit the relinquishment of consular fee not only as respect vessel under the national flag but also as respect vessel of the treaty nation carry good entitle to the benefit of the treaty thirdly the enactment of measure to favor the construction and maintenance of a steam carry marine under the flag of the united states fourthly the establishment of an uniform currency basis for the country of america so that the coin product of our mine may circulate on equal term throughout the whole system of commonwealth this would require a monetary union of america whereby the output of the bullion produce country and the circulation of those which yield neither gold nor silver could be adjust in conformity with the population wealth and commercial need of each as many of the country furnish no bullion to the common stock the surplus production of our mine and mint might thus be utilize and a step take toward the general remonetization of silver to the accomplishment of these end so far as they can be attain by separate treaty the negotiation already conclude and now in progress have be direct and the favor which this enlarge policy have thus far receive warrant the belief that its operation will ere long embrace all or nearly all the country of this hemisphere it be by no mean desirable however that the policy under consideration should be apply to these country alone the healthful enlargement of our trade with europe asia and africa should be seek by reduce tariff burden on such of their ware as neither we nor the other american states be fit to produce and thus enable ourselves to obtain in return a well market for our supply of food of raw material and of the manufacture in which we excel it seem to i that many of the embarrassing element in the great national conflict between protection and free trade may thus be turn to good account that the revenue may be reduce so as no long to overtax the people that protective duty may be retain without become burdensome that our shipping interest may be judiciously encourage the currency fix on firm basis and above all such an unity of interest establish among the states of the american system as will be of great and ever increase advantage to they all all treaty in the line of this policy which have be negotiate or be in process of negotiation contain a provision deem to be requisite under

respect presidential inability be measure which may justly receive your serious consideration as the time draw nigh when i be to retire from the public service i can not refrain from express to the member of the national legislature with whom i have be bring into personal and official intercourse my sincere appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and of their harmonious cooperation with the executive in so many measure calculate to promote the good interest of the nation and to my fellow citizen generally i acknowledge a deep sense of obligation for the support which they have accord i in my administration of the executive department of this government
to the senate of the united states
 i transmit herewith to the senate for consideration with a view to ratification a treaty sign on the 1st of december with the republic of nicaragua provide for the construction of an interoceanic canal across the territory of that state
 the negotiation of this treaty be enter upon under a conviction that it be imperatively demand by the present and future political and material interest of the united states
 the establishment of water communication between the atlantic and pacific coast of the union be a necessity the accomplishment of which however within the territory of the united states be a physical impossibility while the enterprise of our citizen have respond to the duty of create mean of speedy transit by rail between the two ocean these great achievement be inadequate to supply a most important requisite of national union and prosperity
 for all maritime purpose the states upon the pacific be more distant from those upon the atlantic than if separate by either ocean alone europe and africa be near to new york and asia nearer to california than be these two great states to each other by sea week of steam voyage or month under sail be consume in the passage around the horn with the disadvantage of traverse tempestuous water or risk the navigation of the straits of magellan
 a nation like our can not rest satisfied with such a separation of its mutually dependent member we possess an ocean border of considerably over 10,000 mile on the atlantic and gulf of mexico and include alaska of some 10,000 mile on the pacific within a generation the western coast have develop into an empire with a large and rapidly grow population with vast but partially develop resource at the present rate of increase the end of the century will see we a commonwealth of perhaps nearly 100,000,000 inhabitant of which the west should have a considerably large and rich proportion than now form one nation in interest and aim the east and the west be more widely disjoin for all purpose of direct and economical intercourse by water and of national defense against maritime aggression than be most of the colony of other power from their mother country
 the problem of establish such water communication have long attract attention many project have be form and survey have be make of all possible available route as a knowledge of the true topical condition of the isthmus be gain insuperable difficulty in one case and another become evident until by a process of elimination only two route remain within range of profitable achievement one by way of panama and the other across nicaragua
 the treaty now lay before you provide for such a waterway through the friendly territory of nicaragua
 i invite your special attention to the provision of the convention itself as well evidence its scope
 from respect to the independent sovereignty of the republic through whose cooperation the project can alone be realize the stipulation of the treaty look to the full recognition and protection of nicaraguan right in the premise the united states have no motive or desire for territorial acquisition or political control beyond the present border and none such be contemplate by this treaty the two government unite in frame this scheme as the sole mean by which the work as indispensable to the one as to the other can be accomplish under such circumstance as to prevent alike the possibility of conflict between they and of interference from without
 the canal be primarily a domestic mean of water communication between the atlantic and pacific shore of the two country which unite for its construction the one contribute the territory and the other furnish the money therefor recognize the advantage which the world&#39;s commerce must derive from the work appreciate the benefit of enlarged use to the canal itself by contribute to its maintenance and by yield an interest return on the capital invest therein and inspire by the belief that any great enterprise which inure to the general benefit of the world be in some sort a trust for the common advancement of mankind the two government have by this treaty provide for its peaceable use by all nation on equal term while reserve to the coast trade of both country in which none but the contracting party be interested the privilege of favor toil
 the treaty provide for the construction of a railway and telegraph line if deem advisable as accessory to the canal as both may be necessary for the economical construction of the work and probably in its operation when complete
 the term of the treaty as to the protection of the canal while scrupulously confirm the sovereignty of nicaragua amply secure that state and the work itself from possible contingency of the future which it may not be within the sole power of nicaragua to meet
 from a purely commercial point of view the completion of such a waterway open a most favorable prospect for the future of our country the nation of the pacific coast of south america will by its mean be bring into close connection with our gulf states the relation of those american country to the united states be that of a natural market from which the want of direct communication have hitherto practically exclude we by pierce the isthmus the heretofore insuperable obstacle of time and sea distance disappear and our vessel and production will enter upon the world&#39;s competitive field with a decided advantage of which they will avail themselves
 when to this be join the large coasting trade between the atlantic and pacific states which must necessarily spring up it be evident that this canal afford even alone an efficient mean of restore our flag to its former place on the sea
 such a domestic coast trade would arise immediately for even the fishing vessel of both seaboard which now lie idle in the winter month could then profitably carry good between the eastern and the western states
 the political effect of the canal will be to knit close the states now depend upon railway corporation for all commercial and personal intercourse and it will not only cheapen the cost of transportation but will free individual from the possibility of unjust discrimination
 it will bring the european grain market of demand within easy distance of our pacific states and will give to the manufacturer on the atlantic seaboard economical access to the city of china thus break down the barrier which separate the principal manufacturing center of the united states from the market of the vast population of asia and place the eastern states of the union for all purpose of trade midway between europe and asia in point of time the gain for sailing vessel would be great amount from new york to san francisco to a saving of seventy five day to hongkong of twenty seven day to shanghai of thirty four day and to callao of fifty two day
 lake nicaragua be about 90 mile long and 40 mile in great width the water be fresh and afford abundant depth for vessel of the deep draft several island give facility for establish coaling station supply depot harbor and place for repair the advantage of this vast inland harbor be evident
 the lake be 110 foot above tide water six lock or five intermediate level be require for the pacific end of the canal on the atlantic side but five lock or four intermediate level be propose these lock would in practice no more limit the number of vessel pass through the canal than would the single tide lock on the pacific end which be necessary to any even or sea level route
 seventeen and a half mile of canal lie between the pacific and the lake the distance across the lake be 56 mile and a dam at the mouth of the san carlos a tributary of the san juan raise the water level 49 foot practically extend the lake 63 mile to that point by a channel from 600 to 1,200 foot wide with an abundant depth of water
 from the mouth of the san carlos where the canal will leave the san juan to the harbor of greytown the distance be 36 mile which it be hope may by new survey be shorten 10 mile
 the total canal excavation would thus be from 43 1/2 to 53 1/2 mile and the lake and river navigation amount to 119 mile by the present survey would be somewhat increase if the new survey be successful
 from new york to san francisco by this route for sailing vessel the time be ten day short than by the panama route
 the purely pecuniary prospect of the canal as an investment be subordinate to the great national benefit to accrue from it but it seem evident that the work great as its cost may appear will be a measure of prudent economy and foresight if undertake simply to afford our own vessel a free waterway for its far reach result will even within a few year in the life of a nation amply repay the expenditure by the increase of national prosperity far the canal would unquestionably be immediately remunerative it offer a short sea voyage with more continuously favor wind between the atlantic port of america and europe and the country of the east than any other practicable route and with low toll by reason of its less cost the nicaragua route must be the interoceanic highway for the bulk of the world&#39;s trade between the atlantic and the pacific
 so strong be this consideration that it offer an abundant guaranty for the investment to be make as well as for the speedy payment of the loan of four million which the treaty stipulate shall be make to nicaragua for the construction of internal improvement to serve as aid to the business of the canal
 i might suggest many other consideration in detail but it seem unnecessary to do so enough have be say to more than justify the practical utility of the measure i therefore commit it to the congress in the confident expectation that it will receive approval and that by appropriate legislation mean may be provide for inaugurate the work without delay after the treaty shall have be ratify
 in conclusion i urge the justice of recognize the aid which have recently be render in this matter by some of our citizen the effort of certain gentleman connect with the american company which receive the concession from nicaragua now terminate and replace by this international compact accomplish much of the preliminary labor lead to the conclusion of the treaty
 you may have occasion to examine the matter of their service when such further information as you may desire will be furnish you
 i may add that the canal can be construct by the able engineer corps of our army under their thorough system cheap and well than any work of such magnitude can in any other way be build

fellow citizens in the presence of this vast assemblage of my countryman i be aboutto supplement and seal by the oath which i shall take the manifestationof the will of a great and free people in the exercise of their powerand right of self government they have commit to one of their fellow citizensa supreme and sacred trust and he here consecrate himself to their service this impressive ceremony add little to the solemn sense of responsibilitywith which i contemplate the duty i owe to all the people of the land nothing can relieve i from anxiety lest by any act of mine their interestsmay suffer and nothing be need to strengthen my resolution to engageevery faculty and effort in the promotion of their welfare amid the din of party strife the people 's choice be make but its attendantcircumstance have demonstrate anew the strength and safety of a governmentby the people in each succeed year it more clearly appear that ourdemocratic principle need no apology and that in

proper limitation of purely partisanzeal and effort and a correct appreciation of the time when the heat ofthe partisan should be merge in the patriotism of the citizen to day the executive branch of the government be transfer to newkeeping but this be still the government of all the people and it shouldbe none the less an object of their affectionate solicitude at this hourthe animosity of

revive the long dormant question of the falkland islands by claim from the united states indemnity for their loss attribute to the action of the commander of the sloop of war lexington in break up a piratical colony on those island in 1831 and their subsequent occupation by great britain in view of the ample justification for the act of the lexington and the derelict condition of the island before and after their allege occupation by argentine colonist this government consider the claim as wholly groundless question have arise with the government of austria hungary touch the representation of the united states at vienna have under my constitutional prerogative appoint an estimable citizen of unimpeached probity and competence as minister at that court the government of austria hungary invite this government to take cognizance of certain exception base upon allegation against the personal acceptability of mr. keiley the appoint envoy ask that in view thereof the appointment should be withdraw the reason advance be such as could not be acquiesce in without violation of my oath of office and the precept of the constitution since they necessarily involve a limitation in favor of a foreign government upon the right of selection by the executive and require such an application of a religious test as a qualification for office under the united states as would have result in the practical disfranchisement of a large class of our citizen and the abandonment of a vital principle in our government the austro hungarian government finally decide not to receive mr. keiley as the envoy of the united states and that gentleman have since resign his commission leave the post vacant i have make no new nomination and the interest of this government at

several states into a single government in these contest between our neighbor states the united states forebore to interfere actively but lend the aid of their friendly office in deprecation of war and to promote peace and concord among the belligerent and by such counsel contribute importantly to the restoration of tranquillity in that locality emergency grow out of civil war in the united states of colombia demand of the government at the beginning of this administration the employment of armed force to fulfill its guaranty under the thirty fifth article of the treaty of 1846 in order to keep the transit open across the isthmus of panama desirous of exercise only the power expressly reserve to we by the treaty and mindful of the right of colombia the force send to the isthmus be instruct to confine their action to positively and efficaciously prevent the transit and its accessory from be interrupted or embarrassed "the execution of this delicate and responsible task necessarily involve police control where the local authority be temporarily powerless but always in aid of the sovereignty of colombia the prompt and successful fulfillment of its duty by this government be highly appreciate by the government of colombia and have be follow by expression of its satisfaction high praise be due to the officer and man engage in this service the restoration of peace on the isthmus by the reestablishment of the constituted government there be thus accomplish the force of the united states be withdraw pende these occurrence a question of much importance be present by decree of the colombian government proclaim the closure of certain port then in the hand of insurgent and declare vessel hold by the revolutionist to be piratical and liable to capture by any power to neither of these proposition could the united states assent an effective closure of port not in the possession of the government but hold by hostile partisan could not be recognize neither could the vessel of insurgent against the legitimate sovereignty be deem hoste humani generis within the precept of international law whatever might be the definition and penalty of their act under the municipal law of the state against whose authority they be in revolt the denial by this government of the colombian proposition do not however imply the admission of a belligerent status on the part of the insurgent the colombian government have express its willingness to negotiate convention for the adjustment by arbitration of claim by foreign citizen arise out of the destruction of the city of aspinwall by the insurrectionary force the interest of the united states in a practicable transit for ship across the strip of land separate the atlantic from the pacific have be repeatedly manifest during the last half century my immediate predecessor cause to be negotiate with nicaragua a treaty for the construction by and at the sole cost of the united states of a canal through nicaraguan territory and lay it before the senate pende the action of that body thereon i withdraw the treaty for reexamination attentive consideration of its provision lead i to withhold it from resubmission to the senate maintain as i do the tenet of a line of precedent from washington 's day which proscribe entangle alliance with foreign state i do not favor a policy of acquisition of new and distant territory or the incorporation of remote interest with our own the law of progress be vital and organic and we must be conscious of that irresistible tide of commercial expansion which as the concomitant of our active civilization day by day be be urge onward by those increase facility of production transportation and communication to which steam and electricity have give birth but our duty in the present instruct we to address ourselves mainly to the development of the vast resource of the great area commit to our charge and to the cultivation of the art of peace within our own border though jealously alert in prevent the american hemisphere from be involve in the political problem and complication of distant government therefore i be unable to recommend proposition involve paramount privilege of ownership or right outside of our own territory when couple with absolute and unlimited engagement to defend the territorial integrity of the state where such interest lie while the general project of connect the two ocean by mean of a canal be to be encourage i be of opinion that any scheme to that end to be consider with favor should be free from the feature allude to the tehuantepec route be declare by engineer of the high repute and by competent scientist to afford an entirely practicable transit for vessel and cargo by mean of a ship railway from the atlantic to the pacific the obvious advantage of such a route if feasible over other more remote from the axial line of traffic between europe and the pacific and particularly between the valley of the mississippi and the western coast of north and south america be deserve of consideration whatever highway may be construct across the barrier divide the two great maritime area of the world must be for the world 's benefit a trust for mankind to be remove from the chance of domination by any single power nor become a point of invitation for hostility or a prize for warlike ambition an engagement combine the construction ownership and operation of such a work by this government with an offensive and defensive alliance for its protection with the foreign state whose responsibility and right we would share be in my judgment inconsistent with such dedication to universal and neutral use and would moreover entail measure for its realization beyond the scope of our national polity or present mean the lapse of year have abundantly confirm the wisdom and foresight of those early administration which long before the condition of maritime intercourse be change and enlarge by the progress of the age proclaim the vital need of interoceanic transit across the american isthmus and consecrate it in advance to the common use of mankind by their positive declaration and through the formal obligation of treaty toward such realization the effort of my administration will be apply ever bear in mind the principle on which it must rest and which be declare in no uncertain tone by mr. cass who while secretary of state in 1858 announce that what the united states want in central america next to the happiness of its people be the security and neutrality of the interoceanic route which lead through it "the construction of three transcontinental line of railway all in successful operation wholly within our territory and unite the atlantic and the pacific ocean have be accompany by result of a most interesting and impressive nature and have create new condition not in the route of commerce only but in political geography which powerfully affect our relation toward and necessarily increase our interest in any transisthmian route which may be open and employ for the end of peace and traffic or in other contingency for use inimical to both transportation be a factor in the cost of commodity scarcely second to that of their production and weigh as heavily upon the consumer our experience already have prove the great importance of have the competition between land carriage and water carriage fully develop each act as a protection to the public against the tendency to monopoly which be inherent in the consolidation of wealth and power in the hand of vast corporation these suggestion may serve to emphasize what i have already say on the score of the necessity of a neutralization of any interoceanic transit and this can only be accomplish by make the use of the route open to all nation and subject to the ambition and warlike necessity of none the drawing and report of a recent survey of the nicaragua canal route make by chief engineer menocal will be communicate for your information the claim of citizen of the united states for loss by reason of the late military operation of chile in peru and bolivia be the subject of negotiation for a claim convention with chile provide for their submission to arbitration the harmony of our relation with china be fully sustain in the application of the act lately pass to execute the treaty of 1880 restrictive of the immigration of chinese laborer into the united states individual case of hardship have occur beyond the power of the executive to remedy and call for judicial determination the condition of the chinese question in the western states and territories be despite this restrictive legislation far from be satisfactory the recent outbreak in wyoming territory where number of unoffending chinamen indisputably within the protection of the treaty and the law be murder by a mob and the still more recent threatened outbreak of the same character in washington territory be fresh in the mind of all and there be apprehension lest the bitterness of feeling against the mongolian race on the pacific slope may find vent in similar lawless demonstration all the power of this government should be exert to maintain the ample good faith toward china in the treatment of these man and the inflexible sternness of the law in bring the wrongdoer to justice should be insist upon every effort have be make by this government to prevent these violent outbreak and to aid the representative of china in their investigation of these outrage and it be but just to say that they be traceable to the lawlessness of man not citizen of the united states engage in competition with chinese laborer race prejudice be the chief factor in originate these disturbance and it exist in a large part of our domain jeopardize our domestic peace and the good relationship we strive to maintain with china the admit right of a government to prevent the influx of element hostile to its internal peace and security may not be question even where there be no treaty stipulation on the subject that the exclusion of chinese labor be demand in other country where like condition prevail be strongly evidence in the dominion of canada where chinese immigration be now regulate by law more exclusive than our own if existing law be inadequate to compass the end in view i shall be prepare to give earnest consideration to any further remedial measure within the treaty limit which the wisdom of congress may devise the independent state of the kongo have be organize as a government under the sovereignty of his majesty the king of the belgians who assume its chief magistracy in his personal character only without make the new state a dependency of belgium it be fortunate that a benighted region owe all it have of quicken civilization to the beneficence and philanthropic spirit of this monarch should have the advantage and security of his benevolent supervision the action take by this government last year in be the first to recognize the flag of the international association of the kongo have be follow by formal recognition of the new nationality which succeed to its sovereign power a conference of delegate of the principal commercial nation be hold at berlin last winter to discuss method whereby the kongo basin might be keep open to the world 's trade delegate attend on behalf of the united states on the understanding that their part should be merely deliberative without impart to the result any bind character so far as the united states be concern this reserve be due to the indisposition of this government to share in any disposal by an international congress of jurisdictional question in remote foreign territory the result of the conference be embody in a formal act of the nature of an international convention which lay down certain obligation purport to be bind on the signatory subject to ratification within one year notwithstanding the reservation under which the delegate of the united states attend their signature be attach to the general act in the same manner as those of the plenipotentiary of other government thus make the united states appear without reserve or qualification as signatory to a joint international engagement impose on the signer the conservation of the territorial integrity of distant region where we have no establish interest or control this government do not however regard its reservation of liberty of action in the premise as at all impaired and hold that an engagement to share in the obligation of enforce neutrality in the remote valley of the kongo would be an alliance whose responsibility we be not in a position to assume i abstain from ask the sanction of the senate to that general act the correspondence will be lay before you and the instructive and interesting report of the agent send by this government to the kongo country and his recommendation for the establishment of commercial agency on the african coast be also submit for your consideration the commission appoint by my predecessor last winter to visit the central and south american country and report on the method of enlarge the commercial relation of the united states therewith have submit report which will be lay before you no opportunity have be omit to testify the friendliness of this government toward korea whose entrance into the family of treaty power the united states be the first to recognize i regard with favor the application make by the korean government to be allow to employ american officer as military instructor to which the assent of congress become necessary and i be happy to say this request have the concurrent sanction of china and japan the arrest and imprisonment of julio r. santos a citizen of the united states by the authority of ecuador give rise to a contention with that government in which his right to be release or to have a speedy and impartial trial on announce charge and with all guaranty of defense stipulate by treaty be insist upon by we after an elaborate correspondence and repeat and earnest representation on our part mr. santos be after an allege trial and conviction eventually include in a general decree of amnesty and pardon by the ecuadorian executive and release leave the question of his american citizenship deny by the ecuadorian government but insist upon by our own the amount

citizen against france for spoliation commit prior to 1801 the duty have be perform and the report of the agent will be lay before you i regret to say that the restriction upon the importation of our pork into france continue notwithstanding the abundant demonstration of the absence of sanitary danger in its use but i entertain strong hope that with a well understanding of the matter this vexatious prohibition will be remove it would be pleasing to be able to say as much with respect to germany austria and other country where such food product be absolutely exclude without present prospect of reasonable change the interpretation of our exist treaty of naturalization by germany during the past year have attract attention by reason of an apparent tendency on the part of the imperial government to extend the scope of the residential restriction to which return naturalize citizen of german origin be assert to be liable under the law of the empire the temperate and just attitude take by this government with regard to this class of question will doubtless lead to a satisfactory understanding the dispute of germany and spain relative to the domination of the caroline islands have attract the attention of this government by reason of extensive interest of american citizen having grow up in those part during the past thirty year and because the question of ownership involve jurisdiction of matter affect the status of our citizen under civil and criminal law while stand wholly aloof from the proprietary issue raise between power to both of which the united states be friendly this government expect that nothing in the present contention shall unfavorably affect our citizen carry on a peaceful commerce or there domicile and have so inform the governments of spain and germany the marked good will between the united states and great britain have be maintain during the past year the termination of the fishing clause of the treaty of washington in pursuance of the joint resolution of march 3 1883 must have result in the abrupt cessation on the 1st of july of this year in the midst of their venture of the operation of citizen of the united states engage in fishing in british american water but for a diplomatic understanding reach with her majesty 's government in june last whereby assurance be obtain that no interruption of those operation should take place during the current fishing season in the interest of good neighborhood and of the commercial intercourse of adjacent community the question of the north american fishery be one of much importance follow out the intimation give by i when the extensory arrangement above describe be negotiate i recommend that the congress provide for the appointment of a commission in which the government of the united states and great britain shall be respectively represent charge with the consideration and settlement upon a just equitable and honorable basis of the entire question of the fishing right of the two government and their respective citizen on the coast of the united states and british north america the fishing interest be intimately relate to other general question dependent upon contiguity and intercourse consideration thereof in all their equity might also properly come within the purview of such a commission and the full latitude of expression on both side should be permit the correspondence in relation to the fishing right will be submit the arctic explore steamer alert which be generously give by her majesty 's government to aid in the relief of the greely expedition be after the successful attainment of that humane purpose return to great britain in pursuance of the authority confer by the act of march 3 1885.the inadequacy of the exist engagement for extradition between the united states and great britain have be long apparent the tenth article of the treaty of 1842 one of the early compact in this regard enter into by we stipulate for surrender in respect of a limited number of offense other crime no less inimical to the social welfare should be embrace and the procedure of extradition bring in harmony with present international practice negotiation with her majesty 's government for an enlarged treaty of extradition have be pende since 1870 and i entertain strong hope that a satisfactory result may be soon attain the frontier line between alaska and british columbia as define by the treaty of cession with russia follow the demarcation assign in a prior treaty between great britain and russia modern exploration disclose that this ancient boundary be impracticable as a geographical fact in the unsettled condition of that region the question have lack importance but the discovery of mineral wealth in the territory the line be suppose to traverse admonishe that the time have come when an accurate knowledge of the boundary be needful to avert jurisdictional complication i recommend therefore that provision be make for a preliminary reconnoissance by officer of the united states to the end of acquire more precise information on the subject i have invite her majesty 's government to consider with we the adoption of a more convenient line to be establish by meridian observation or by know geographical feature without the necessity of an expensive survey of the whole the late insurrectionary movement in hayti having be quell the government of that republic have make prompt provision for adjudicate the loss suffer by foreigner because of hostility there and the claim of certain citizen of the united states will be in this manner determine the long pende claim of two citizen of the united states pelletier and lazare have be dispose of by arbitration and an award in favor of each claimant have be make which by the term of the engagement be final it remain for congress to provide for the payment of the stipulate moiety of the expense a question arise with hayti during the past year by reason of the exceptional treatment of an american citizen mr. van bokkelen a resident of port au prince who on suit by creditor reside in the united states be sentence to imprisonment and under the operation of a haytian statute be deny relief secure to a native haytian this government assert his treaty right to equal treatment with native of hayti in all suit at law our contention be deny by the haytian government which however while still profess to maintain the ground take against mr. van bokkelen 's right terminate the controversy by set he at liberty without explanation an international conference to consider the mean of arrest the spread of cholera and other epidemic disease be hold at rome in may last and adjourn to meet again on further notice an expert delegate on behalf of the united states have attend its session and will submit a report our relation with mexico continue to be most cordial as befit those of neighbor between whom the strong tie of friendship and commercial intimacy exist as the natural and grow consequence of our similarity of institution and geographical propinquity the relocation of the boundary line between the united states and mexico westward of the rio grande under the convention of july 29 1882 have be unavoidably delay but i apprehend no difficulty in secure a prolongation of the period for its accomplishment the lately conclude commercial treaty with mexico still await the stipulate legislation to carry its provision into effect for which one year 's additional time have be secure by a supplementary article sign in february last and since ratify on both side as this convention so important to the commercial welfare of the two adjoining country have be constitutionally confirm by the treaty- make branch i express the hope that legislation need to make it effective may not be long delay the large influx of capital and enterprise to mexico from the united states continue to aid in the development of the resource and in augment the material well being of our sister republic line of railway penetrate to the heart and capital of the country bring the two people into mutually beneficial intercourse and enlarge facility of transit add to profitable commerce create new market and furnish avenue to otherwise isolated community i have already advert to the suggest construction of a ship railway across the narrow formation of the territory of mexico at tehuantepec with the gradual recovery of peru from the effect of her late disastrous conflict with chile and with the restoration of civil authority in that distracted country it be hope that pende war claim of our citizen will be adjust in conformity with notification give by the government of peru the exist treaty of commerce and extradition between the united states and that country will terminate march 31 1886.our good relationship with russia continue an officer of the navy detail for the purpose be now on his way to siberia bear the testimonial vote by congress to those who generously succor the survivor of the unfortunate jeannette expedition it be gratify to advert to the cordiality of our intercourse with spain the long pende claim of the owner of the ship masonic for loss suffer through the admit dereliction of the spanish authority in the philippine islands have be adjust by arbitration and an indemnity award the principle of arbitration in such case to which the united states have long and consistently adhere thus receive a fresh and gratifying confirmation other question with spain have be dispose of or be under diplomatic consideration with a view to just and honorable settlement the operation of the commercial agreement with spain of january 2 -february 13 1884 have be find inadequate to the commercial need of the united states and the spanish antilies and the term of the agreement be subject to conflicting interpretation in those island negotiation have be institute at madrid for a full treaty not open to these objection and in the line of the general policy touch the neighborly intercourse of proximate community to which i elsewhere advert and aim moreover at the removal of exist burden and annoying restriction and although a satisfactory termination be promise i be compel to delay its announcement an international copyright conference be hold at berne in september on the invitation of the swiss government the envoy of the united states attend as a delegate but refrain from commit this government to the result even by sign the recommendatory protocol adopt the interesting and important subject of international copyright have be before you for several year action be certainly desirable to effect the object in view and while there may be question as to the relative advantage of treat it by legislation or by specific treaty the mature view of the berne conference can not fail to aid your consideration of the subject the termination of the commercial treaty of 1862 between the united states and turkey have be seek by that government while there be question as to the sufficiency of the notice of termination give yet as the commercial right of our citizen in turkey come under the favor nation guaranty of the prior treaty of 1830 and as equal treatment be admit by the porte no inconvenience can result from the assent of this government to the revision of the ottoman tariff in which the treaty power have be invite to join question concern our citizen in turkey may be affect by the porte 's nonacquiescence in the right of expatriation and by the imposition of religious test as a condition of residence in which this government can not concur the united states must hold in their intercourse with every power that the status of their citizen be to be respect and equal civil privilege accord to they without regard to creed and affect by no consideration save those grow out of domiciliary return to the land of original allegiance or of unfulfilled personal obligation which may survive under municipal law after such voluntary return the negotiation with venezuela relative to the rehearing of the award of the mixed commission constitute under the treaty of 1866 be resume in view of the recent acquiescence of the venezuelan envoy in the principal point advance by this government that the effect of the old treaty could only be set aside by the operation of a new convention a result in substantial accord with the advisory suggestion contain in the joint resolution of march 3 1883 have be agree upon and will shortly be submit to the senate for ratification under section 3659 of the revised statutes all fund hold in trust by the united states and the annual interest accrue thereon when not otherwise require by treaty be to be invest in stock of the united states bear a rate of interest not less than 5 per cent per annum there be now no procurable stock pay so high a rate of interest the letter of the statute be at present inapplicable but its spirit be subserve by continue to make investment of this nature in current stock bear the high interest now pay the statute however make no provision for the disposal of such accretion it be contrary to the general rule of this government to allow interest on claim i recommend the repeal of the provision in question and the disposition under a uniform rule of the present accumulation from investment of trust fund the inadequacy of exist legislation touch citizenship and naturalization demand your consideration while recognize the right of expatriation no statutory provision exist provide mean for renounce citizenship by an american citizen native bear or naturalize nor for terminate and vacate an improper acquisition of citizenship even a fraudulent decree of naturalization can not now be cancel the privilege and franchise of american citizenship should be grant with care and extend to those only who intend in good faith to assume its duty and responsibility when attain its privilege and benefit it should be withhold from those who merely go through the form of naturalization with the intent of escape the duty of their original allegiance without take upon themselves those of their new status or who may acquire the right of american citizenship for no other than a hostile purpose toward their original government these evil have have many flagrant illustration i regard with favor the suggestion put forth by one of my predecessor that provision be make for a central bureau of record of the decree of naturalization grant by the various court throughout the united states now invest with that power the right which spring from domicile in the united states especially when couple with a declaration of intention to become a citizen be worthy of definition by statute the stranger come hither with intent to remain establish his residence in our midst contribute to the general welfare and by his voluntary act declare his purpose to assume the responsibility of citizenship thereby gain an inchoate status which legislation may properly define the law of certain states and territories admit a domiciled alien to the local franchise confer on he the right of citizenship to a degree which place he in the anomalous position of be a citizen of a state and yet not of the united states within the purview of federal and international law it be important within the scope of national legislation to define this right of alien domicile as distinguish from federal naturalization the commercial relation of the united states with their immediate neighbor and with important area of traffic near our shore suggest especially liberal intercourse between they and we follow the treaty of 1883 with mexico which rest on the basis of a reciprocal exemption from custom duty other similar treaty be initiate by my predecessor recognize the need of less obstruct traffic with cuba and puerto rico and meet by the desire of spain to succor languish interest in the antilles step be take to attain those end by a treaty of commerce a similar treaty be afterwards sign by the dominican republic subsequently overture be make by her britannic majesty 's government for a like mutual extension of commercial intercourse with the british west indian and south american dependency but without result on take office i withdraw for reexamination the treaty sign with spain and santo domingo then pende before the senate the result have be to satisfy i of the inexpediency of enter into engagement of this character not cover the entire traffic these treaty contemplate the surrender by the united states of large revenue for inadequate consideration upon sugar alone duty be surrender to an amount far exceed all the advantage offer in exchange even be it intend to relieve our consumer it be evident that so long as the exemption but partially cover our importation such relief would be illusory to relinquish a revenue so essential seem highly improvident at a time when new and large drain upon the treasury be contemplate moreover embarrassing question would have arise under the favor nation clause of treaty with other nation as a further objection it be evident that tariff regulation by treaty diminish that independent control over its own revenue which be essential for the safety and welfare of any government emergency call for an increase of taxation may at any time arise and no engagement with a foreign power should exist to hamper the action of the government by the fourteenth section of the shipping act approve june 26 1884 certain reduction and contingent exemption from tonnage due be make as to vessel enter port of the united states from any foreign port in north and central america the west india islands the bahamas and bermudas mexico and the isthmus as far as aspinwall and panama the government of belgium denmark germany portugal and sweden and norway have assert under the favor nation clause in their treaty with the united states a claim to like treatment in respect of vessel come to the united states from their home port this government however hold that the privilege grant by the act be purely geographical inure to any vessel of any foreign power that may choose to engage in traffic between this country and any port within the define zone and no warrant exist under the most favor nation clause for the extension of the privilege in question to vessel sail to this country from port outside the limitation of the act undoubtedly the relation of commerce with our near neighbor whose territory form so long a frontier line difficult to be guard and who find in our country and equally offer to we natural market demand special and considerate treatment it rest with congress to consider what legislative action may increase facility of intercourse which contiguity make natural and desirable i earnestly urge that congress recast the appropriation for the maintenance of the diplomatic and consular service on a footing commensurate with the importance of our national interest at every post where a representative be necessary the salary should be so grade as to permit he to live with comfort with the assignment of adequate salary the so call notarial extra official fee which our officer abroad be now permit to treat as personal perquisite should be do away with every act require the certification and seal of the officer should be taxable at schedule rate and the fee therefor return to the treasury by restore these revenue to the public use the consular service would be self support even with a liberal increase of the present low salary in further prevention of abuse a system of consular inspection should be institute the appointment of a limited number of secretary of legation at large to be assign to duty wherever necessary and in particular for temporary service at mission which for any cause may be without a head should also be authorize i favor also authorization for the detail of officer of the regular service as military or naval attache at legation some foreign government do not recognize the union of consular with diplomatic function italy and venezuela will only receive the appointee in one of his two capacity but this do not prevent the requirement of a bond and submission to the responsibility of an office whose duty he can not discharge the superadded title of consul general should be abandon at all mission i deem it expedient that a well devise measure for the reorganization of the extraterritorial court in oriental country should replace the present system which labor under the disadvantage of combine judicial and executive function in the same office in several oriental country generous offer have be make of premise for housing the legation of the united states a grant of land for that purpose be make some year since by japan and have be refer to in the annual message of my predecessor the siamese government have make a gift to the united states of commodious quarter in bangkok in korea the late minister be permit to purchase a building from the government for legation use in china the premise rent for the legation be favor as to local charge at tangier the house occupy by our representative have be for many year the property this government having be give for that purpose in 1822 by the sultan of morocco i approve the suggestion heretofore make that view of the condition of life and administration in the eastern country the legation building in china japan korea siam and perhaps persia should be own and furnish by the government with a view to permanency and security to this end i recommend that authority be give to accept the gift advert to in japan and siam and to purchase in the other country name with provision for furniture and repair a considerable saving in rental would result the world 's industrial exposition hold at new orleans last winter with the assistance of the federal government attract a large number of foreign exhibit and prove of great value in spread among the concourse of visitor from mexico and central and south america a wide knowledge of the varied manufacture and production of this country and their availability in exchange for the production of those region past congresses have have under consideration the advisability of abolish the discrimination make by the tariff law in favor of the work of american artist the odium of the policy which subject to a high rate of duty the painting of foreign artist and exempt the production of american artist reside abroad and who receive gratuitously advantage and instruction be visit upon our citizen engage in art culture in europe and have cause they with practical unanimity to favor the abolition of such an ungracious distinction and in their interest and for other obvious reason i strongly recommend it the report of the secretary of the treasury fully exhibit the condition of the public finance and of the several branch of the government connect with his department the suggestion of the secretary relate to the practical operation of this important department and his recommendation in the direction of simplification and economy particularly in the work of collect custom duty be especially urge upon the attention of congress the ordinary receipt from all source for the fiscal year end june 30 1885 be $ 322,690,706.38 of this sum $ 181,471,939.34 be receive from custom and $ 112,498,725.54 from internal revenue the total receipt as give above be $ 24,829,163.54 less than those for the year end june 30 1884 this diminution embrace a fall off of $ 13,595,550.42 in the receipt from custom and $ 9,687,346.97 in the receipt from internal revenue the total ordinary expenditure of the government for the fiscal year be $ 260,226,935.50 leave a surplus in the treasury at the close of the year of $ 63,463,771.27 this be $ 40,929,854.32 less than the surplus report at the close of the previous year the expenditure be classify as follow the amount pay on the public debt during the fiscal year end june 30 1885 be $ 45,993,235.43 and there have be pay since that date and up to november 1 1885 the sum of $ 369,828 leave the amount of the debt at the last name date $ 1,514,475,860.47 there be however at that time in the treasury applicable to the general purpose of the government the sum of $ 66,818,292.38.the total receipt for the current fiscal year end june 30 1886 ascertain to october 1 1885 and estimate for the remainder of the year be $ 315,000,000 the expenditure ascertain and estimate for the same time be $ 245,000,000 leave a surplus at the close of the year estimate at $ 70,000,000.the value of the export from the united states to foreign country during the last fiscal year be as follow some of the principal export with their value and the percentage they respectively bear to the total exportation be give as follow our import during the year be as follow the follow be give as prominent article of import during the year with their value and the percentage they bear to the total importation of the entire amount of duty collect 70 per cent be collect from the following article of import the fact that our revenue be in excess of the actual need of all economical administration of the government justify a reduction in the amount exact from the people for its support our government be but the mean establish by the will of a free people by which certain principle be apply which they have adopt for their benefit and protection and it be never well administer and its true spirit be never well observe than when the people 's taxation for its support be scrupulously limit to the actual necessity of expenditure and distribute accord to a just and equitable plan the proposition with which we have to deal be the reduction of the revenue receive by the government and indirectly pay by the people from custom duty the question of free trade be not involve nor be there now any occasion for the general discussion of the wisdom or expediency of a protective system justice and fairness dictate that in any modification of our present law relate to revenue the industry and interest which have be encourage by such law and in which our citizen have large investment should not be ruthlessly injure or destroy we should also deal with the subject in such manner as to protect the interest of american labor which be the capital of our workingmen its stability and proper remuneration furnish the most justifiable pretext for a protective policy within these limitation a certain reduction should be make in our custom revenue the amount of such reduction having be determine the inquiry follow where can it well be remit and what article can well be release from duty in the interest of our citizens?i think the reduction should be make in the revenue derive from a tax upon the import necessary of life we thus directly lessen the cost of live in every family of the land and release to the people in every humble home a large measure of the reward of frugal industry during the year end november 1 1885 145 national bank be organize with an aggregate capital of $ 16,938,000 and circulate note have be issue to they amount to $ 4,274,910 the whole number of these bank in existence on the day above mention be 2,727.the very limited amount of circulate note issue by our national bank compare with the amount the law permit they to issue upon a deposit of bond for their redemption indicate that the volume of our circulate medium may be largely increase through this instrumentality nothing more important than the present condition of our currency and coinage can claim your attention since february 1878 the government have under the compulsory provision of law purchase silver bullion and coin the same at the rate of more than $ 2,000,000 every month by this process up to the present date 215,759,431 silver dollar have be coin a reasonable appreciation of a delegation of power to the general government would limit its exercise without express restrictive word to the people 's need and the requirement of the public welfare upon this theory the authority to coin money give to congress by the constitution if it permit the purchase by the government of bullion for coinage in any event do not justify such purchase and coinage to an extent beyond the amount need for a sufficient circulate medium the desire to utilize the silver product of the country should not lead to a misuse or the perversion of this power the necessity for such an addition to the silver currency of the nation as be compel by the silver coinage act be negative by the fact that up to the present time only about 50,000,000 of the silver dollar so coined have actually find their way into circulation leave more than 165,000,000 in the possession of the government the custody of which have entail a considerable expense for the construction of vault for it deposit against this latter amount there be outstanding silver certificate amount to about $ 93,000,000.every month two million of gold in the public treasury be pay our for two million or more of silver dollar to be add to the idle mass already accumulate if continue long enough this operation will result in the substitution of silver for all the gold the government own applicable to its general purpose it will not do to rely upon the custom receipt of the government to make good this drain of gold because the silver thus coin having be make legal tender for all debt and due public and private at time during the last six month 58 per cent of the receipt for duty have be in silver or silver certificate while the average within that period have be 20 per cent the proportion of silver and its certificate receive by the government will probably increase as time go on for the reason that the nearer the period approach when it will be oblige to offer silver in payment of its obligation the great inducement there will be to hoard gold against depreciation in the value of silver or for the purpose of speculate this hoarding of gold have already begin when the time come that gold have be withdraw from circulation then will be apparent the difference between the real value of the silver dollar and a dollar in gold and the two coin will part company gold still the standard of value and necessary in our dealing with other country will be at a premium over silver bank which have substitute gold for the deposit of their customer may pay they with silver buy with such gold thus make a handsome profit rich speculator will sell their hoard gold to their neighbor who need it to liquidate their foreign debt at a ruinous premium over silver and the labor man and woman of the land most defenseless of all will find that the dollar receive for the wage of their toil have sadly shrink in its purchasing power it may be say that the latter result will be but temporary and that ultimately the price of labor will be adjust to the change but even if this take place the wage worker can not possibly gain but must inevitably lose since the price he be compel to pay for his living will not only be measure in a coin heavily depreciate and fluctuate and uncertain in its value but this uncertainty in the value of the purchase medium will be make the pretext for an advance in price beyond that justify by actual depreciation the word utter in 1834 by daniel webster in the senate of the united states be true to day the very man of all other who have the deep interest in a sound currency and who suffer most by mischievous legislation in money matter be the man who earn his daily bread by his daily toil the most distinguished advocate of bimetallism discuss our silver coinage have lately write no american citizen 's hand have yet feel the sensation of cheapness either in receive or expend the silver act dollar and those who live by labor or legitimate trade never will feel that sensation of cheapness however plenty silver dollar may become they will not be distribute as gift among the people and if the labor man should receive four depreciate dollar where he now receive but two he will pay in the depreciate coin more than double the price he now pay for all the necessary and comfort of life those who do not fear any disastrous consequence arise from the continue compulsory coinage of silver as now direct by law and who suppose that the addition to the currency of the country intend as its result will be a public benefit be remind that history demonstrate that the point be easily reach in the attempt to float at the same time two sort of money of different excellence when the well will cease to be in general circulation the hoarding of gold which have already take place indicate that we shall not escape the usual experience in such case so if this silver coinage be continue we may reasonably expect that gold and its equivalent will abandon the field of circulation to silver alone this of course must produce a severe contraction of our circulate medium instead of add to it it will not be dispute that any attempt on the part of the government to cause the circulation of silver dollar worth 80 cent side by side with gold dollar worth 100 cent even within the limit that legislation do not run counter to the law of trade to be successful must be second by the confidence of the people that both coin will retain the same purchasing power and be interchangeable at will a special effort have be make by the secretary of the treasury to increase the amount of our silver coin in circulation but the fact that a large share of the limited amount thus put out have soon return to the public treasury in payment of duty lead to the belief that the people do not now desire to keep it in hand and this with the evident disposition to hoard gold give rise to the suspicion that there already exist a lack of confidence among the people touch our financial process there be certainly not enough silver now in circulation to cause uneasiness and the whole amount coin and now on hand might after a time be absorb by the people without apprehension but it be the ceaseless stream that threaten to overflow the land which cause fear and uncertainty what have be thus far submit upon this subject relate almost entirely to consideration of a home nature unconnected with the bearing which the policy of other nation have upon the question but it be perfectly apparent that a line of action in regard to our currency can not wisely be settle upon or persist in without consider the attitude on the subject of other country with whom we maintain intercourse through commerce trade and travel an acknowledgment of this fact be find in the act by virtue of which our silver be compulsorily coin it provide that the president shall invite the government of the country compose the latin union so call and of such other european nation as he may deem advisable to join the united states in a conference to adopt a common ratio between gold and silver for the purpose of establish internationally the use of bimetallic money and secure fixity of relative value between those metal this conference absolutely fail and a similar fate have await all subsequent effort in the same direction and still we continue our coinage of silver at a ratio different from that of any other nation the most vital part of the silver coinage act remain inoperative and unexecuted and without an ally or friend we battle upon the silver field in an illogical and losing contest to give full effect to the design of congress on this subject i have make careful and earnest endeavor since the adjournment of the last congress to this end i delegate a gentleman well instruct in fiscal science to proceed to the financial center of europe and in conjunction with our minister to england france and germany to obtain a full knowledge of the attitude and intent of those government in respect of the establishment of such an international ratio as would procure free coinage of both metal at the mint of those country and our own by my direction our consul general at paris have give close attention to the proceeding of the congress of the latin union in order to indicate our interest in its object and report its action it may be say in brief as the result of these effort that the attitude of the lead power remain substantially unchanged since the monetary conference of 1881 nor be it to be question that the view of these government be in each instance support by the weight of public opinion the step thus take have therefore only more fully demonstrate the uselessness of further attempt at present to arrive at any agreement on the subject with other nation in the meantime we be accumulate silver coin base upon our own peculiar ratio to such an extent and assume so heavy a burden to be provide for in any international negotiation as will render we an undesirable party to any future monetary conference of nation it be a significant fact that four of the five country compose the latin union mention in our coinage act embarrass with their silver currency have just complete an agreement among themselves that no more silver shall be coin by their respective government and that such as have be already coin and in circulation shall be redeem in gold by the country of its coinage the resort to this expedient by these country may well arrest the attention of those who suppose that we can succeed without shock or injury in the attempt to circulate upon its merit all the silver we may coin under the provision of our silver coinage act the condition in which our treasury may be place by a persistence in our present course be a matter of concern to every patriotic citizen who do not desire his government to pay in silver such of its obligation as should be pay in gold nor should our condition be such as to oblige we in a prudent management of our affair to discontinue the calling in and payment of interest bear obligation which we have the right now to discharge and thus avoid the payment of further interest thereon the so call debtor class for whose benefit the continue compulsory coinage of silver be insist upon be not dishonest because they be in debt and they should not be suspect of a desire to jeopardize the financial safety of the country in order that they may cancel their present debt by pay the same in depreciated dollar nor should it be forget that it be not the rich nor the money lender alone that must submit to such a readjustment enforce by the government and their debtor the pittance of the widow and the orphan and the income of helpless beneficiary of all kind would be disastrously reduce the depositor in saving bank and in other institution which hold in trust the saving of the poor when their little accumulation be scale down to meet the new order of thing would in their distress painfully realize the delusion of the promise make to they that plentiful money would improve their condition we have now on hand all the silver dollar necessary to supply the present need of the people and to satisfy those who from sentiment wish to see they in circulation and if their coinage be suspend they can be readily obtain by all who desire they if the need of more be at anytime apparent their coinage may be renew that disaster have not already overtake we furnish no proof that danger do not wait upon a continuation of the present silver coinage we have be save by the most careful management and unusual expedient by a combination of fortunate condition and by a confident expectation that the course of the government in regard to silver coinage would be speedily change by the action of congress prosperity hesitate upon our threshold because of the danger and uncertainty surround this question capital timidly shrink from trade and investor be unwilling to take the chance of the questionable shape in which their money will be return to they while enterprise halt at a risk against which care and sagacious management do not protect as a necessary consequence labor lack employment and suffering and distress be visit upon a portion of our fellow citizen especially entitle to the careful consideration of those charge with the duty of legislation no interest appeal to we so strongly for a safe and stable currency as the vast army of the unemployed i recommend the suspension of the compulsory coinage of silver dollar direct by the law pass in february 1878.the steamboat inspection service on the 30th day of june 1885 be compose of 140 person include officer clerk and messenger the expense of the service over the receipt be $ 138,822.22 during the fiscal year the special inspection of foreign steam vessel organize under a law pass in 1882 be maintain during the year at an expense of $ 36,641.63 since the close of the fiscal year reduction have be make in the force employ which will result in a saving during the current year of $ 17,000 without affect the efficiency of the service the supervising surgeon general report that during the fiscal year 41,714 patient have receive relief through the marine hospital service of whom 12,803 be treat in hospital and 28,911 at the dispensary active and effective effort have be make through the medium of this service to protect the country against an invasion of cholera which have prevail in spain and france and the smallpox which recently break out in canada the most gratifying result have attend the operation of the life saving service during the last fiscal year the observance of the provision of law require the appointment of the force employ in this service to be make solely with reference to their fitness and without reference to their political or party affiliation have secure the result which may confidently be expect in any branch of public employment where such a rule be apply as a consequence this service be compose of man well qualified for the performance of their dangerous and exceptionally important dutiesthe number of station in commission at the close of the year be 203 the number of disaster to vessel and craft of all kind within their field of action be 371 the number of person endanger in such disaster be 2,439 of whom 2,428 be save and only 11 lose other life which be imperil though not by disaster to shipping be also rescue and a large amount of property be save through the aid of this service the cost of its maintenance during the year be $ 828,474.43.the work of the coast and geodetic survey be during the last fiscal year carry on within the boundary and off the coast of thirty two states two territories and the district of columbia in july last certain irregularity be find to exist in the management of this bureau which lead to a prompt investigation of its method the abuse which be bring to light by this examination and the reckless disregard of duty and the interest of the government develop on the part of some of those connect with the service make a change of superintendency and a few of its other officer necessary since the bureau have be in new hand an introduction of economy and the application of business method have produce an important saving to the government and a promise of more useful result this service have never be regulate by anything but the most indefinite legal enactment and the most unsatisfactory rule it be many year ago sanction apparently for a purpose regard as temporary and relate to a survey of our coast having gain a place in the appropriation make by congress it have gradually take to itself power and object not contemplate in its creation and extend its operation until it sadly need legislative attention so far as a further survey of our coast be concern there seem to be a propriety in transfer that work to the navy department the other duty now in charge of this establishment if they can not be profitably attach to some exist department or other bureau should be prosecute under a law exactly define their scope and purpose and with a careful discrimination between the scientific inquiry which may properly be assume by the government and those which should be undertake by state authority or by individual enterprise it be hope that the report of the congressional committee heretofore appoint to investigate this and other like matter will aid in the accomplishment of proper legislation on this subject the report of the secretary of war be herewith submit the attention of congress be invite to the detailed account which it contain of the administration of his department and his recommendation and suggestion for the improvement of the service the army consist at the date of the last consolidated return of 2,154 officer and 24,705 enlisted man the expense of the departments for the fiscal year end june 30 1885 include $ 13,164,394.60 for public work and river and harbor improvement be $ 45,850,999.54.besides the troop which be dispatch in pursuit of the small band of indians who leave their reservation in arizona and commit murder and outrage two regiment of cavalry and one of infantry be send last july to the indian territory to prevent an outbreak which seem imminent they remain to aid if necessary in the expulsion of intruder upon the reservation who seem to have cause the discontent among the indians but the executive proclamation warn they to remove be comply with without their interference troop be also send to rock springs in wyoming territory after the massacre of chinese there to prevent further disturbance and afterwards to seattle in washington territory to avert a threatened attack upon chinese laborer and domestic violence there in both case the mere presence of the troop have the desire effect it appear that the number of desertion have diminish but that during the last fiscal year they number 2,927 and one instance be give by the lieutenant general of six desertion by the same recruit i be convinced that this number of desertion can be much diminish by well discipline and treatment but the punishment should be increase for repeat offense these desertion might also be reduce by lessen the term of first enlistment thus allow a discontent recruit to contemplate a nearer discharge and the army a profitable riddance after one term of service a reenlistment would be quite apt to secure a contented recruit and a good soldier the acting judge advocate general report that the number of trial by general court martial during the year be 2,328 and that 11,851 trial take place before garrison and regimental court martial the suggestion that probably more than half the army have be try for offense great and small in one year may well arrest attention of course many of these trial before garrison and regimental court martial be for offense almost frivolous and there should i think be a way devise to dispose of these in a more summary and less inconvenient manner than by court martial if some of the proceeding of court martial which i have have occasion to examine present the idea of justice which generally prevail in these tribunal i be satisfied that they should be much reform if the honor and the honesty of the army and navy be by their instrumentality to be vindicate and protect the board on fortifications or other defense appoint in pursuance of the provision of the act of congress approve march 3 1885 will in a short time present their report and it be hope that this may greatly aid the legislation so necessary to remedy the present defenseless condition of our seacoast the work of the signal service have be prosecute during the last year with result of increase benefit to the country the field of instruction have be enlarge with a view of add to its usefulness the number of station in operation june 30 1885 be 489 telegraphic report be receive daily from 160 station report be also receive from 25 canadian station 375 volunteer observer 52 army surgeon at military post and 333 foreign station the expense of the service during the fiscal year after deduct receipt from military telegraph line be $ 792,592.97 in view of the fact refer to by the secretary of war that the work of this service ordinarily be of a scientific nature and the further fact that it be assume large proportion constantly and become more and more unsuited to the fix rule which must govern the army i be inclined to agree with he in the opinion that it should be separately establish if this be do the scope and extent of its operation should as nearly as possible be definitely prescribe by law and always capable of exact ascertainment the military academy at west point be report as be in a high state of efficiency and well equip for the satisfactory accomplishment of the purpose of its maintenance the fact that the class which graduate next year be an unusually large one have constrain i to decline to make appointment to second lieutenancy in the army from civil life so that such vacancy as exist in these place may be reserve for such graduate and yet it be not probable that there will be enough vacancy to provide position for they all when they leave the military school under the prevail law and usage those not thus assign to duty never actively enter the military service it be suggest that the law on this subject be change so that such of these young man as be not at once assign to duty after graduation may be retain as second lieutenant in the army if they desire it subject to assignment when opportunity occur and under proper rule as to priority of selection the expenditure on account of the military academy for the last fiscal year exclusive of the sum take for its purpose from appropriation for the support of the army be $ 290,712.07.the act approve march 3 1885 design to compensate officer and enlisted man for loss of private property while in the service of the united states be so indefinite in its term and apparently admit so many claim the adjustment of which could not have be contemplate that if it be to remain upon the statute book it need amendment there should be a general law of congress prohibit the construction of bridge over navigable water in such manner as to obstruct navigation with provision for prevent the same it seem that under exist statute the government can not intervene to prevent such a construction when enter upon without its consent though when such consent be ask and grant upon condition the authority to insist upon such condition be clear thus it be represent that while the officer of the government be with great care guard against the obstruction of navigation by a bridge across the mississippi river at st. paul a large pier for a bridge have be build just below this place directly in the navigable channel of the river if such thing be to be permit a strong argument be present against the appropriation of large sum of money to improve the navigation of this and other important highway of commerce the report of the secretary of the navy give a history of the operation of his department and the present condition of the work commit to his charge he detail in full the course pursue by he to protect the right of the government in respect of certain vessel unfinishe at the time of his accession to office and also concern the dispatch boat dolphin claim to be complete and await the acceptance of the department no one can fail to see from recital contain in this report that only the application of business principle have be insist upon in the treatment of these subject and that whatever controversy have arise be cause by the exaction on the part of the department of contract obligation as they be legally construe in the case of the dolphin with entire justice to the contractor an agreement have be enter into provide for the ascertainment by a judicial inquiry of the complete or partial compliance with the contract in her construction and far provide for the assessment of any damage to which the government may be entitle on account of a partial failure to perform such contract or the payment of the sum still remain unpaid upon her price in case a full performance be adjudge the contractor by reason of his failure in business be unable to complete the other three vessel they be take possession of by the government in their unfinished state under a clause in the contract permit such a course and be now in process of completion in the yard of the contractor but under the supervision of the navy department congress at its last session authorize the construction of two additional new cruiser and two gunboat at a cost not exceed in the aggregate $ 2,995,000 the appropriation for this purpose having become available on the 1st day of july last step be at once take for the procurement of such plan for the construction of these vessel as would be likely to insure their usefulness when complete these be of the utmost importance consider the constant advance in the art of building vessel of this character and the time be not lose which be spend in their careful consideration and selection all must admit the importance of an effective navy to a nation like ours have such an extended seacoast to protect and yet we have not a single vessel of war that could keep the sea against a first class vessel of any important power such a condition ought not long to continue the nation that can not resist aggression be constantly expose to it its foreign policy be of necessity weak and its negotiation be conduct with disadvantage because it be not in condition to enforce the term dictate by its sense of right and justice inspire as i be by the hope share by all patriotic citizen that the day be not very far distant when our navy will be such as befit our standing among the nation of the earth and rejoice at every step that lead in the direction of such a consummation i deem it my duty to especially direct the attention of congress to the close of the report of the secretary of the navy in which the humiliating weakness of the present organization of his department be exhibit and the startling abuse and waste of its present method be expose the conviction be force upon we with the certainty of mathematical demonstration that before we proceed far in the restoration of a navy we need a thoroughly reorganize navy department the fact that within seventeen year more than $ 75,000,000 have be spend in the construction repair equipment and armament of vessel and the further fact that instead of an effective and creditable fleet we have only the discontent and apprehension of a nation undefende by war vessel add to the disclosure now make do not permit we to doubt that every attempt to revive our navy have thus far for the most part be misdirect and all our effort in that direction have be little well than blind groping and expensive aimless folly unquestionably if we be content with the maintenance of a navy department simply as a shabby ornament to the government a constant watchfulness may prevent some of the scandal and abuse which have find their way into our present organization and its incurable waste may be reduce to the minimum but if we desire to build ship for present usefulness instead of naval reminder of the day that be past we must have a department organize for the work supply with all the talent and ingenuity our country afford prepare to take advantage of the experience of other nation systematize so that all effort shall unite and lead in one direction and fully imbue with the conviction that war vessel though new be useless unless they combine all that the ingenuity of man have up to this day bring forth relate to their construction i earnestly commend the portion of the secretary 's report devote to this subject to the attention of congress in the hope that his suggestion touch the reorganization of his department may be adopt as the first step toward the reconstruction of our navy the affair of the postal service be exhibit by the report of the postmaster general which will be lay before you the postal revenue whose ratio of gain upon the rise prosperity of 1882 and 1883 outstrip the increase expense of our grow service be check by the reduction in the rate of letter postage which take effect with the beginning of october in the latter year and it diminish during the two past fiscal year $ 2,790,000 in about the proportion of $ 2,270,000 in 1884 to $ 520,000 in 1885 natural growth and development have meantime increase expenditure result in a deficiency in the revenue to meet the expense of the department of five and a quarter million dollar for the year 1884 and eight and a third million in the last fiscal year the anticipated and natural revival of the revenue have be oppress and retard by the unfavorable business condition of the country of which the postal service be a faithful indicator the gratifying fact be show however by the report that our return prosperity be mark by a gain of $ 380,000 in the revenue of the latter half of the last year over the corresponding period of the precede year the change in the weight of first class matter which may be carry for a single rate of postage from a half ounce to an ounce and the reduction by one half of the rate of newspaper postage which under recent legislation begin with the current year will operate to restrain the augmentation of receipt which otherwise might have be expect to such a degree that the scale of expense may gain upon the revenue and cause an increase deficiency to be show at its close yet after no long period of reawakened prosperity by proper economy it be confidently anticipate that even the present low rate now as favorable as any country afford will be adequate to sustain the cost of the service the operation of the post office department be for the convenience and benefit of the people and the method by which they pay the charge of this useful arm of their public service so that it be just and impartial be of less importance to they than the economical expenditure of the mean they provide for its maintenance and the due improvement of its agency so that they may enjoy its high usefulness a proper attention have be direct to the prevention of waste or extravagance and good result appear from the report to have already be accomplish i approve the recommendation of the postmaster general to reduce the charge on domestic money order of $ 5 and less from 8 to 5 cent this change will materially aid those of our people who most of all avail themselves of this instrumentality but to whom the element of cheapness be of the great importance with this reduction the system would still remain self support the free delivery system have be extend to 19 additional city during the year and 178 now enjoy its convenience experience have commend it to those who enjoy its benefit and further enlargement of its facility be due to other community to which it be adapt in the city where it have be establish take together the local postage exceed its maintenance by nearly $ 1,300,000 the limit to which this system be now confine by law have be nearly reach and the reason give justify its extension which be propose it be decide with my approbation after a sufficient examination to be inexpedient for the post office department to contract for carry our foreign mail under the additional authority give by the last congress the amount limit be inadequate to pay all within the purview of the law the full rate of 50 cent per mile and it would have be unjust and unwise to have give it to some and deny it to other nor could contract have be let under the law to all at a rate to have bring the aggregate within the appropriation without such practical prearrangement of term as would have violate it the rate of sea and inland postage which be proffer under another statute clearly appear to be a fair compensation for the desire service be three time the price necessary to secure transportation by other vessel upon any route and much beyond the charge make to private person for service not less burdensome some of the steamship company upon the refusal of the postmaster general to attempt by the mean provide the distribution of the sum appropriate as an extra compensation withdraw the service of their vessel and thereby occasion slight inconvenience though no considerable injury the mail having be dispatch by other mean whatever may be think of the policy of subsidize any line of public conveyance or travel i be satisfied that it should not be do under cover of an expenditure incident to the administration of a department nor should there be any uncertainty as to the recipient of the subsidy or any discretion leave to an executive officer as to its distribution if such gift of the public money be to be make for the purpose of aid any enterprise in the suppose interest of the public i can not but think that the amount to be pay and the beneficiary might well be determine by congress than in any other way the international congress of delegate from the postal union country convene at lisbon in portugal in february last and after a session of some week the delegate sign a convention amendatory of the present postal union convention in some particular design to advance its purpose this additional act have have my approval and will be lay before you with the departmental report i approve the recommendation of the postmaster general that another assistant be provide for his department i invite your consideration to the several other recommendation contain in his report the report of the attorney general contain a history of the conduct of the department of justice during the last year and a number of valuable suggestion as to need legislation and i invite your careful attention to the same the condition of business in the court of the united states be such that there seem to be an imperative necessity for remedial legislation on the subject some of these court be so overburdened with pende cause that the delay in determine litigation amount often to a denial of justice among the plan suggest for relief be one submit by the attorney general its main feature be the transfer of all the original jurisdiction of the circuit court to the district court and an increase of judge for the latter where necessary an addition of judge to the circuit court and constitute they exclusively court of appeal and reasonably limit appeal thereto further restriction of the right to remove cause from the state to federal court permit appeal to the supreme court from the court of the district of columbia and the territories only in the same case as they be allow from state court and guard against an unnecessary number of appeal from the circuit court i approve the plan thus outline and recommend the legislation necessary for its application to our judicial system the present mode of compensate united states marshal and district attorney should in my opinion be change they be allow to charge against the government certain fee for service their income be measure by the amount of such fee within a fix limit as to their annual aggregate this be a direct inducement for they to make their fee in criminal case as large as possible in an effort to reach the maximum sum permit as an entirely natural consequence unscrupulous marshal be find encourage frivolous prosecution arrest people on petty charge of crime and transport they to distant place for examination and trial for the purpose of earn mileage and other fee and district attorney uselessly attend criminal examination far from their place of residence for the express purpose of swell their account against the government the actual expense incur in these transaction be also charge against the government thus the right and freedom of our citizen be outraged and public expenditure increase for the purpose of furnish public officer pretext for increase the measure of their compensation i think marshal and district attorney should be pay salary adjust by a rule which will make they commensurate with service fairly render in connection with this subject i desire to suggest the advisability if it be find not obnoxious to constitutional objection of invest united states commissioner with the power to try and determine certain violation of law within the grade of misdemeanor such trial might be make to depend upon the option of the accuse the multiplication of small and technical offense especially under the provision of our internal revenue law render some change in our present system very desirable in the interest of humanity as well as economy the district court be now crowd with petty prosecution involve a punishment in case of conviction of only a slight fine while the party accuse be harass by an enforced attendance upon court hold hundred of mile from their home if poor and friendless they be oblige to remain in jail during month perhaps that elapse before a session of the court be hold and be finally bring to trial surround by stranger and with but little real opportunity for defense in the meantime frequently the marshal have charge against the government his fee for an arrest the transportation of the accuse and the expense of the same and for summon witness before a commissioner a grand jury and a court the witness have be pay from the public fund large fee and traveling expense and the commissioner and district attorney have also make their charge against the government this abuse in the administration of our criminal law should be remedie and if the plan above suggest be not practicable some other should be devise the report of the secretary of the interior contain an account of the operation of this important department and much interesting information will be submit for your consideration the most intricate and difficult subject in charge of this department be the treatment and management of the indians i be satisfied that some progress may be note in their condition as a result of a prudent administration of the present law and regulation for their control but it be submit that there be lack of a fix purpose or policy on this subject which should be supply it be useless to dilate upon the wrong of the indians and as useless to indulge in the heartless belief that because their wrong be revenge in their own atrocious manner therefore they should be exterminate they be within the care of our government and their right be or should be protect from invasion by the most solemn obligation they be properly enough call the ward of the government and it should be bear in mind that this guardianship involve on our part effort for the improvement of their condition and the enforcement of their right there seem to be general concurrence in the proposition that the ultimate object of their treatment should be their civilization and citizenship fit by these to keep pace in the march of progress with the advanced civilization about they they will readily assimilate with the mass of our population assume the responsibility and receive the protection incident to this condition the difficulty appear to be in the selection of the mean to be at present employ toward the attainment of this result our indian population exclusive of those in alaska be report as number 260,000 nearly all be locate on land set apart for their use and occupation aggregate over 134,000,000 acre these land be include in the boundary of 171 reservation of different dimension scatter in 21 states and territories present great variation in climate and in the kind and quality of their soil among the indians upon these several reservation there exist the most marked difference in natural trait and disposition and in their progress toward civilization while some be lazy vicious and stupid other be industrious peaceful and intelligent while a portion of they be self support and independent and have so far advanced in civilization that they make their own law administer through officer of their own choice and educate their child in school of their own establishment and maintenance other still retain in squalor and dependence almost the savagery of their natural state in deal with this question the desire manifest by the indians should not be ignore here again we find a great diversity with some the tribal relation be cherish with the utmost tenacity while its hold upon other be considerably relax the love of home be strong with all and yet there be those whose attachment to a particular locality be by no means unyielding the ownership of their land in severalty be much desire by some while by other and sometimes among the most civilized such a distribution would be bitterly opposed the variation of their want grow out of and connect with the character of their several location should be regard some be upon reservation most fit for grazing but without flock or herd and some on arable land have no agricultural implement while some of the reservation be double the size necessary to maintain the number of indians now upon they in a few case perhaps they should be enlarge add to all this the difference in the administration of the agency while the same duty be devolve upon all the disposition of the agent and the manner of their contact with the indians have much to do with their condition and welfare the agent who perfunctorily perform his duty and slothfully neglect all opportunity to advance their moral and physical improvement and fail to inspire they with a desire for well thing will accomplish nothing in the direction of their civilization while he who feel the burden of an important trust and have an interest in his work will by consistent example firm yet considerate treatment and well direct aid and encouragement constantly lead those under his charge toward the light of their enfranchisement the history of all the progress which have be make in the civilization of the indian i think will disclose the fact that the beginning have be religious teaching follow by or accompany secular education while the self sacrifice and pious man and woman who have aid in this good work by their independent endeavor have for their reward the beneficent result of their labor and the consciousness of christian duty well perform their valuable service should be fully acknowledge by all who under the law be charge with the control and management of our indian ward what have be say indicate that in the present condition of the indians no attempt should be make to apply a fixed and unyielde plan of action to their varied and varying need and circumstance the indian bureau burden as it be with their general oversight and with the detail of the establishment can hardly possess itself of the minute phase of the particular case need treatment and thus the propriety of create an instrumentality auxiliary to those already establish for the care of the indians suggest itself i recommend the passage of a law authorize the appointment of six commissioner three of whom shall be detail from the army to be charge with the duty of a careful inspection from time to time of all the indians upon our reservation or subject to the care and control of the government with a view of discover their exact condition and need and determine what step shall be take on behalf of the government to improve their situation in the direction of their self support and complete civilization that they ascertain from such inspection what if any of the reservation may be reduce in area and in such case what part not need for indian occupation may be purchase by the government from the indians and dispose of for their benefit what if any indians may with their consent be remove to other reservation with a view of their concentration and the sale on their behalf of their abandon reservation what indian land now hold in common should be allot in severalty in what manner and to what extent the indians upon the reservation can be place under the protection of our law and subject to their penalty and which if any indians should be invest with the right of citizenship the power and function of the commissioner in regard to these subject should be clearly define though they should in conjunction with the secretary of the interior be give all the authority to deal definitely with the question present deem safe and consistent they should be also charge with the duty of ascertain the indians who might properly be furnish with implement of agriculture and of what kind in what case the support of the government should be withdraw where the present plan of distribute indian supply should be change where school may be establish and where discontinue the conduct method and fitness of agent in charge of reservation the extent to which such reservation be occupy or intrude upon by unauthorized person and generally all matter relate to the welfare and improvement of the indian they should advise with the secretary of the interior concern these matter of detail in management and he should be give power to deal with they fully if he be not now invest with such power this plan contemplate the selection of person for commissioner who be interested in the indian question and who have practical idea upon the subject of their treatment the expense of the indian bureau during the last fiscal year be more than six and a halt million dollar i believe much of this expenditure might be save under the plan propose that its economical effect would be increase with its continuance that the safety of our frontier settler would be subserve under its operation and that the nation would be save through its result from the imputation of inhumanity injustice and mismanagement in order to carry out the policy of allotment of indian land in severalty when deem expedient it will be necessary to have survey complete of the reservation and i hope that provision will be make for the prosecution of this work in may of the present year a small portion of the chiricahua apaches on the white mountain reservation in arizona leave the reservation and commit a number of murder and depredation upon settler in that neighborhood though prompt and energetic action be take by the military the renegade elude capture and escape into mexico the formation of the country through which these indians pass their thorough acquaintance with the same the speed of their escape and the manner in which they scatter and conceal themselves among the mountain near the scene of their outrage put our soldier at a great disadvantage in their effort to capture they though the expectation be still entertain that they will be ultimately take and punish for their crime the threatening and disorderly conduct of the cheyennes in the indian territory early last summer cause considerable alarm and uneasiness investigation prove that their threatening attitude be due in a great measure to the occupation of the land of their reservation by immense herd of cattle which their owner claim be rightfully there under certain lease make by the indians such occupation appear upon examination to be unlawful notwithstanding these lease the intruder be order to remove with their cattle from the land of the indians by executive proclamation the enforcement of this proclamation have the effect of restore peace and order among the indians and they be now quiet and well behave by an executive order issue on february 27 1885 by my predecessor a portion of the tract of country in the territory know as the old winnebago and crow creek reservation be direct to be restore to the public domain and open to settlement under the land law of the united states and a large number of person enter upon those land this action alarm the sioux indians who claim the territory as belong to their reservation under the treaty of 1868 this claim be determine after careful investigation to be well rounded and consequently the executive order refer to be by proclamation of april 17 1885 declare to be inoperative and of no effect and all person upon the land be warn to leave this warning have be substantially comply with the public domain have its origin in cession of land by the states to the general government the first cession be make by the state of new york and the large which in area exceed all the other by the state of virginia the territory the proprietorship of which become thus vest in the general government extend from the western line of pennsylvania to the mississippi river these patriotic donation of the states be encumber with no condition except that they should the hold and use for the common benefit of the united states by purchase with the common fund of all the people addition be make to this domain until it extend to the northern line of mexico the pacific ocean and the polar sea the original trust for the common benefit of the united states attach to all in the execution of that trust the policy of many home rather than large estate be adopt by the government that these might be easily obtain and be the abode of security and contentment the law for their acquisition be few easily understand and general in their character but the pressure of local interest combine with a speculative spirit have in many instance procure the passage of law which mar the harmony of the general plan and encumber the system with a multitude of general and special enactment which render the land law complicated subject the title to uncertainty and the purchaser often to oppression and wrong law which be intend for the common benefit have be pervert so that large quantity of land be vest in single ownership from the multitude and character of the law this consequence seem incapable of correction by mere administration it be not for the common benefit of the united states that a large area of the public land should be acquire directly or through fraud in the hand of a single individual the nation 's strength be in the people the nation 's prosperity be in their prosperity the nation 's glory be in the equality of her justice the nation 's perpetuity be in the patriotism of all her people hence as far as practicable the plan adopt in the disposal of the public land should have in view the original policy which encourage many purchase of these land for home and discourage the massing of large area exclusive of alaska about three fifth of the national domain have be sell or subject to contract or grant of the remain two fifth a considerable portion be either mountain or desert a rapidly increase population create a grow demand for home and the accumulation of wealth inspire an eager competition to obtain the public land for speculative purpose in the future this collision of interest will be more marked than in the past and the execution of the nation 's trust in behalf of our settler will be more difficult i therefore commend to your attention the recommendation contain in the report of the secretary of the interior with reference to the repeal and modification of certain of our land law the nation have make princely grant and subsidy to a system of railroad project as great national highway to connect the pacific states with the east it have be charge that these donation from the people have be divert to private gain and corrupt use and thus public indignation have be arouse and suspicion engender our great nation do not begrudge its generosity but it abhor speculation and fraud and the favorable regard of our people for the great corporation to which these grant be make can only be revive by a restoration of confidence to be secure by their constant unequivocal and clearly manifest integrity a faithful application of the undiminished proceed of the grant to the construction and perfecting of their road an honest discharge of their obligation and entire justice to all the people in the enjoyment of their right on these highway of travel be all the public ask and it will be content with no less to secure these thing should be the common purpose of the officer of the government as well as of the corporation with this accomplishment prosperity would be permanently secure to the road and national pride would take the place of national complaint it appear from the report of the commissioner of pensions that there be on the 1st day of july 1885 345,125 person bear upon the pension roll who be classify as follow

in recognition of the service of our soldier live and dead the sentiment underlie the subject should not be vitiate by the introduction of any fraudulent practice therefore it be fully as important that the roll should be cleanse of all those who by fraud have secure a place thereon as that meritorious claim should be speedily examine and adjust the reform in the method of do the business of this bureau which have lately be inaugurate promise well result in both these direction the operation of the patent office demonstrate the activity of the inventive genius of the country for the year

consideration of congress in the territory of utah the law of the united states pass for the suppression of polygamy have be energetically and faithfully execute during the past year with measurably good result a number of conviction have be secure for unlawful cohabitation and in some case plea of guilty have be enter and a slight punishment impose upon a promise by the accuse that they would not again offend against the law nor advise counsel aid or abet in any way its violation by other the utah commissioner express the opinion base upon such information as they be able to obtain that but few polygamous marriage have take place in the territory during the last year they far report that while there can not be find upon the registration list of voter the name of a man actually guilty of polygamy and while none of that class be hold office yet at the last election in the territory all the officer elect except in one county be man who though not actually live in the practice of polygamy subscribe to the doctrine of polygamous marriage as a divine revelation and a law unto all high and more binding upon the conscience than any human law local or national thus be the strange spectacle present of a community protect by a republican form of government to which they owe allegiance sustain by their suffrage a principle and a belief which set at naught that obligation of absolute obedience to the law of the land which lie at the foundation of republican institution the strength the perpetuity and the destiny of the nation rest upon our home establish by the law of god guard by parental care regulate by parental authority and sanctify by parental love these be not the home of polygamy the mother of our land who rule the nation as they mold the character and guide the action of their son live accord to god s holy ordinance and each secure and happy in the exclusive love of the father of her child shed the warm light of true womanhood unperverted and unpollute upon all within her pure and wholesome family circle these be not the cheerless crush and unwomanly mother of polygamy the father of our family be the good citizen of the republic wife and child be the source of patriotism and conjugal and parental affection beget devotion to the country the man who undefile with plural marriage be surround in his single home with his wife and child have a stake in the country which inspire he with respect for its law and courage for its defense these be not the father of polygamous family there be no feature of this practice or the system which sanction it which be not oppose to all that be of value in our institution there should be no relaxation in the firm but just execution of the law now in operation and i should be glad to approve such further discreet legislation as will rid the country of this blot upon its fair fame since the people uphold polygamy in our territories be reenforce by immigration from other land i recommend that a law be pass to prevent the importation of mormon into the country the agricultural interest of the country demand just recognition and liberal encouragement it sustain with certainty and unfailing strength our nation 's prosperity by the product of its steady toil and bear its full share of the burden of taxation without complaint our agriculturist have but slight personal representation in the council of the nation and be generally content with the humbler duty of citizenship and willing to trust to the bounty of nature for a reward of their labor but the magnitude and value of this industry be appreciate when the statement be make that of our total annual export more than three fourth be the product of agriculture and of our total population nearly one half be exclusively engage in that occupation the department of agriculture be create for the purpose of acquire and diffusing among the people useful information respect the subject it have in charge and aid in the cause of intelligent and progressive farming by the collection of statistic by test the value and usefulness of new seed and plant and distribute such as be find desirable among agriculturist this and other power and duty with which this department be invest be of the utmost importance and if wisely exercise must be of great benefit to the country the aim of our beneficent government be the improvement of the people in every station and the amelioration of their condition surely our agriculturist should not be neglect the instrumentality establish in aid of the farmer of the land should not only be well equipped for the accomplishment of its purpose but those for whose benefit it have be adopt should be encourage to avail themselves fully of its advantage the prohibition of the importation into several country of certain of our animal and their product base upon the suspicion that health be endanger in their use and consumption suggest the importance of such precaution for the protection of our stock of all kind against disease as will disarm suspicion of danger and cause the removal of such an injurious prohibition if the law now in operation be insufficient to accomplish this protection i recommend their amendment to meet the necessity of the situation and i commend to the consideration of congress the suggestion contain in the report of the commissioner of agriculture calculate to increase the value and efficiency of this department the report of the civil service commission which will be submit contain an account of the manner in which the civil service law have be execute during the last year and much valuable information on this important subject i be inclined to think that there be no sentiment more general in the mind of the people of our country than a conviction of the correctness of the principle upon which the law enforce civil service reform be base in its present condition the law regulate only a part of the subordinate public position throughout the country it apply the test of fitness to applicant for these place by mean of a competitive examination and give large discretion to the commissioners as to the character of the examination and many other matter connect with its execution thus the rule and regulation adopt by the commission have much to do with the practical usefulness of the statute and with the result of its application the people may well trust the commission to execute the law with perfect fairness and with as little irritation as be possible but of course no relaxation of the principle which underlie it and no weakening of the safeguard which surround it can be expect experience in its administration will probably suggest amendment of the method of its execution but i venture to hope that we shall never again be remit to the system which distribute public position purely as reward for partisan service doubt may well be entertain whether our government could survive the strain of a continuance of this system which upon every change of administration inspire an immense army of claimant for office to lay siege to the patronage of government engross the time of public officer with their importunity spread abroad the contagion of their disappointment and fill the air with the tumult of their discontent the allurement of an immense number of office and place exhibit to the voter of the land and the promise of their bestowal in recognition of partisan activity debauch the suffrage and rob political action of its thoughtful and deliberative character the evil would increase with the multiplication of office consequent upon our extension and the mania for office holding grow from its indulgence would pervade our population so generally that patriotic purpose the support of principle the desire for the public good and solicitude for the nation 's welfare would be nearly banish from the activity of our party contest and cause they to degenerate into ignoble selfish and disgraceful struggle for the possession of office and public place civil service reform enforce by law come none too soon to check the progress of demoralization one of its effect not enough regard be the freedom it bring to the political action of those conservative and sober man who in fear of the confusion and risk attend an arbitrary and sudden change in all the public office with a change of party rule cast their ballot against such a chance party seem to be necessary and will long continue to exist nor can it be now deny that there be legitimate advantage not disconnect with office holding which follow party supremacy while partisanship continue bitter and pronounced and supply so much of motive to sentiment and action it be not fair to hold public official in charge of important trust responsible for the good result in the performance of their duty and yet insist that they shall rely in confidential and important place upon the work of those not only oppose to they in political affiliation but so steep in partisan prejudice and rancor that they have no loyalty to their chief and no desire for their success civil service reform do not exact this nor do it require that those in subordinate position who fail in yield their good service or who be incompetent should be retain simply because they be in place the whining of a clerk discharge for indolence or incompetency who though he gain his place by the bad possible operation of the spoils system suddenly discover that he be entitle to protection under the sanction of civil service reform represent an idea no less absurd than the clamor of the applicant who claim the vacant position as his compensation for the most questionable party work the civil service law do not prevent the discharge of the indolent or incompetent clerk but it do prevent supply his place with the unfit party worker thus in both these phase be see benefit to the public service and the people who desire good government having secure this statute will not relinquish its benefit without protest nor be they unmindful of the fact that its full advantage can only be gain through the complete good faith of those have its execution in charge and this they will insist upon i recommend that the salary of the civil service commissioners be increase to a sum more nearly commensurate to their important duty it be a source of considerable and not unnatural discontent that no adequate provision have yet be make for accommodate the principal library of the government of the vast collection of book and pamphlet gather at the capitol number some 700,000 exclusive of manuscript map and the product of the graphic art also of great volume and value only about 300,000 volume or less than half the collection be provide with shelf room the other which be increase at the rate of from twenty five to thirty thousand volume a year be not only inaccessible to the public but be subject to serious damage and deterioration from other cause in their present situation a consideration of the fact that the library of the capitol have twice be destroy or damage by fire its daily increase value and its importance as a place of deposit of book under the law relate to copyright make manifest the necessity of prompt action to insure its proper accommodation and protection my attention have be call to a controversy which have arise from the condition of the law relate to railroad facility in the city of washington which have involve the commissioners of the district in much annoyance and trouble i hope this difficulty will be promptly settle by appropriate legislation the commissioners represent that enough of the revenue of the district be now on deposit in the treasury of the united states to repay the sum advance by the government for sewer improvement under the act of june 30 1884 they desire now an advance of the share which ultimately should be bear by the district of the cost of extensive improvement to the street of the city the total expense of these contemplate improvement be estimate at $ 1,000,000 and they be of the opinion that a considerable sum could be save if they have all the money in hand so that contract for the whole work could be make at the same time they express confidence that if the advance ask for should be make the government would be reimburse the same within a reasonable time i have no doubt that these improvement could be make much cheap if undertake together and prosecute accord to a general plan the license law now in force within the district be deficient and uncertain in some of its provision and ought to be amend the commissioners urge with good reason the necessity of provide a building for the use of the district government which shall well secure the safety and preservation of its valuable book and record the present condition of the law relate to the succession to the presidency in the event of the death disability or removal of both the president and vice president be such as to require immediate amendment this subject have repeatedly be consider by congress but no result have be reach the recent lamentable death of the vice president and vacancy at the same time in all other office the incumbent of which might immediately exercise the function of the presidential office have cause public anxiety and a just demand that a recurrence of such a condition of affair should not be permit in conclusion i commend to the wise care and thoughtful attention of congress the need the welfare and the aspiration of an intelligent and generous nation to subordinate these to the narrow advantage of partisanship or the accomplishment of selfish aim be to violate the people 's trust and betray the people 's interest but an individual sense of responsibility on the part of each of we and a stern determination to perform our duty well must give we place among those who have add in their day and generation to the glory and prosperity of our beloved land
to the senate and house of representatives
 it be make the constitutional duty of the president to recommend to the consideration of congress from time to time such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient in no matter can the necessity of this be more evident than when the good faith of the united states under the solemn obligation of treaty with foreign power be concern
 the question of the treatment of the subject of china sojourn within the jurisdiction of the united states present such a matter for the urgent and earnest consideration of the executive and the congress
 in my first annual message upon the assembling of the present congress i advert to this question in the following word
 the harmony of our relation with china be fully sustain
 in the application of the act lately pass to execute the treaty of 1880 restrictive of the immigration of chinese laborer into the united states individual case of hardship have occur beyond the power of the executive to remedy and call for judicial determination
 the condition of the chinese question in the western states and territories be despite this restrictive legislation far from be satisfactory the recent outbreak in wyoming territory where number of unoffending chinamen indisputably within the protection of the treaty and the law be murder by a mob and the still more recent threatened outbreak of the same character in washington territory be fresh in the mind of all and there be apprehension lest the bitterness of feeling against the mongolian race on the pacific slope may find vent in similar lawless demonstration all the power of this government should be exert to maintain the ample good faith toward china in the treatment of these man and the inflexible sternness of the law in bring the wrongdoer to justice should be insist upon
 every effort have be make by this government to prevent these violent outbreak and to aid the representative of china in their investigation of these outrage and it be but just to say that they be traceable to the lawlessness of man not citizen of the united states engage in competition with chinese laborer
 race prejudice be the chief factor in originate these disturbance and it exist in a large part of our domain jeopardize our domestic peace and the good relationship we strive to maintain with china
 the admit right of a government to prevent the influx of element hostile to its internal peace and security may not be question even where there be no treaty stipulation on the subject that the exclusion of chinese labor be demand in other country where like condition prevail be strongly evidence in the dominion of canada where chinese immigration be now regulate by law more exclusive than our own if existing law be inadequate to compass the end in view i shall be prepare to give earnest consideration to any further remedial measure within the treaty limit which the wisdom of congress may devise
 at the time i write this the shocking occurrence at rock springs in wyoming territory be fresh in the mind of all and have be recently present anew to the attention of this government by the chinese minister in a note which while not unnaturally exhibit some misconception of our federal system of administration in the territories while they as yet be not in the exercise of the full measure of that sovereign self government pertaining to the states of the union present in truthful term the main feature of the cruel outrage there perpetrate upon inoffensive subject of china in the investigation of the rock springs outbreak and the ascertainment of the fact on which the chinese minister&#39; statement rest the chinese representative be aid by the agent of the united states and the report submit having be thus frame and recount the fact within the knowledge of witness on both side possess an impartial truthfulness which could not fail to give they great impressiveness
 the fact which so far be not controvert or affect by any exculpatory or mitigate testimony show the murder of a number of chinese subject in september last at rock springs the wounding of many other and the spoliation of the property of all when the unhappy survivor have be drive from their habitation there be no allegation that the victim by any lawless or disorderly act on their part contribute to bring about a collision on the contrary it appear that the law abide disposition of these people who be sojourner in our midst under the sanction of hospitality and express treaty obligation be make the pretext for an attack upon they this outrage upon law and treaty engagement be commit by a lawless mob none of the aggressor happily for the national good fame appear by the report to have be citizen of the united states they be alien engage in that remote district as mining laborer who become excited against the chinese laborer as it would seem because of their refusal to join they in a strike to secure high wage the oppression of chinese subject by their rival in the competition for labor do not differ in violence and illegality from that apply to other class of native or alien labor all be equally under the protection of law and equally entitle to enjoy the benefit of assure public order
 be there no treaty in existence refer to the right of chinese subject do they come hither as all other stranger who voluntarily resort to this land of freedom of self government and of law here peaceably to win their bread and to live their life there can be no question that they would be entitle still to the same measure of protection from violence and the same free forum for the redress of their grievance as any other alien
 so far as the treaty between the united states and china stipulate for the treatment of the chinese subject actually in the united states as the citizen or subject of the most favored nation be treat they create no new status for they they simply recognize and confirm a general and exist rule applicable to all alien alike for none be favor above other by domestic law and none by foreign treaty unless it be the chinese themselves in some respect for by the third article of the treaty of november 17 1880 between the united states and china it be provide that--
 art iii if chinese laborer or chinese of any other class now either permanently or temporarily reside in the territory of the united states meet with ill treatment at the hand of any other person the government of the united states will exert all its power to devise measure for their protection and to secure to they the same right privilege immunity and exemption as may be enjoy by the citizen or subject of the most favored nation and to which they be entitle by treaty
 this article may be hold to constitute a special privilege for chinese subject in the united states as compare with other alien not that it create any peculiar right which other do not share but because in case of ill treatment of the chinese in the united states this government be bind to exert all its power to devise measure for their protection by secure to they the right to which equally with any and all other foreigner they be entitle
 whether it be now incumbent upon the united states to amend their general law or devise new measure in this regard i do not consider in the present communication but confine myself to the particular point raise by the outrage and massacre at rock springs
 the note of the chinese minister and the document which accompany it give as i believe an unexaggerated statement of the lamentable incident and present impressively the regrettable circumstance that the proceeding in the name of justice for the ascertainment of the crime and fix the responsibility therefor be a ghastly mockery of justice so long as the chinese minister under his instruction make this the basis of an appeal to the principle and conviction of mankind no exception can be take but when he go far and take as his precedent the action of the chinese government in past instance where the life of american citizen and their property in china have be endanger argue a reciprocal obligation on the part of the united states to indemnify the chinese subject who suffer at rock springs it become necessary to meet his argument and to deny most emphatically the conclusion he seek to draw as to the existence of such a liability and the right of the chinese government to insist upon it
 i draw the attention of the congress to the latter part of the note of the secretary of state of february 18 1886 in reply to the chinese minister&#39; representation and invite special consideration of the cogent reason by which he reach the conclusion that whilst the united states government be under no obligation whether by the express term of its treaty with china or the principle of international law to indenmify these chinese subject for loss cause by such mean and under the admit circumstance yet that in view of the palpable and discreditable failure of the authority of wyoming territory to bring to justice the guilty party or to assure to the sufferer an impartial forum in which to seek and obtain compensation for the loss which those subject have incur by lack of police protection and consider far the entire absence of provocation or contribution on the part of the victim the executive may be induce to bring the matter to the benevolent consideration of the congress in order that that body in its high discretion may direct the bounty of the government in aid of innocent and peaceful stranger whose maltreatment have bring discredit upon the country with the distinct understanding that such action be in no wise to be hold as a precedent be wholly gratuitous and be resort to in a spirit of pure generosity toward those who be otherwise helpless
 the correspondence exchange be herewith submit for the information of the congress and accompany a like message to the house of representatives

to the senate and house of representatives
 the constitution impose upon the president the duty of recommend to the consideration of congress from time to time such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient
 i be so deeply impressed with the importance of immediately and thoughtfully meet the problem which recent event and a present condition have thrust upon we involve the settlement of dispute arise between our labor man and their employer that i be constrain to recommend to congress legislation upon this serious and press subject
 under our form of government the value of labor as an element of national prosperity should be distinctly recognize and the welfare of the labor man should be regard as especially entitle to legislative care in a country which offer to all its citizen the high attainment of social and political distinction its workingmen can not justly or safely be consider as irrevocably consign to the limit of a class and entitle to no attention and allow no protest against neglect
 the labor man bear in his hand an indispensable contribution to our growth and progress may well insist with manly courage and as a right upon the same recognition from those who make our law as be accord to any other citizen have a valuable interest in charge and his reasonable demand should be meet in such a spirit of appreciation and fairness as to induce a contented and patriotic cooperation in the achievement of a grand national destiny
 while the real interest of labor be not promote by a resort to threat and violent manifestation and while those who under the pretext of an advocacy of the claim of labor wantonly attack the right of capital and for selfish purpose or the love of disorder sow seed of violence and discontent should neither be encourage nor conciliate all legislation on the subject should be calmly and deliberately undertake with no purpose of satisfy unreasonable demand or gain partisan advantage
 the present condition of the relation between labor and capital be far from satisfactory the discontent of the employ be due in a large degree to the grasping and heedless exaction of employer and the alleged discrimination in favor of capital as an object of governmental attention it must also be concede that the labor man be not always careful to avoid causeless and unjustifiable disturbance
 though the importance of a well accord between these interest be apparent it must be bear in mind that any effort in that direction by the federal government must be greatly limit by constitutional restriction there be many grievance which legislation by congress can not redress and many condition which can not by such mean be reform
 i be satisfied however that something may be do under federal authority to prevent the disturbance which so often arise from dispute between employer and the employ and which at time seriously threaten the business interest of the country and in my opinion the proper theory upon which to proceed be that of voluntary arbitration as the mean of settle these difficulty
 but i suggest that instead of arbitrator choose in the heat of conflict claim and after each dispute shall arise for the purpose of determine the same there be create a commission of labor consist of three member who shall be regular officer of the government charge among other duty with the consideration and settlement when possible of all controversy between labor and capital
 a commission thus organize would have the advantage of be a stable body and its member as they gain experience would constantly improve in their ability to deal intelligently and usefully with the question which might be submit to they if arbitrator be choose for temporary service as each case of dispute arise experience and familiarity with much that be involve in the question will be lacking extreme partisanship and bias will be the qualification seek on either side and frequent complaint of unfairness and partiality will be inevitable the imposition upon a federal court of a duty so foreign to the judicial function as the selection of an arbitrator in such case be at least of doubtful propriety
 the establishment by federal authority of such a bureau would be a just and sensible recognition of the value of labor and of its right to be represent in the department of the government so far as its conciliatory office shall have relation to disturbance which interfere with transit and commerce between the states its existence would be justify under the provision of the constitution which give to congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nation and among the several state and in the frequent dispute between the labor man and their employer of less extent and the consequence of which be confine within state limit and threaten domestic violence the interposition of such a commission might be tender upon the application of the legislature or executive of a state under the constitutional provision which require the general government to protect each of the states against domestic violence
 if such a commission be fairly organize the risk of a loss of popular support and sympathy result from a refusal to submit to so peaceful an instrumentality would constrain both party to such dispute to invoke its interference and abide by its decision there would also be good reason to hope that the very existence of such an agency would invite application to it for advice and counsel frequently result in the avoidance of contention and misunderstanding
 if the usefulness of such a commission be doubted because it might lack power to enforce its decision much encouragement be derive from the concede good that have be accomplish by the railroad commission which have be organize in many of the states which have little more than advisory power have exert a most salutary influence in the settlement of dispute between conflict interest
 in july 1884 by a law of congress a bureau of labor be establish and place in charge of a commissioner of labor who be require to collect information upon the subject of labor its relation to capital the hour of labor and the earning of labor man and woman and the mean of promote their material social intellectual and moral prosperity
 the commission which i suggest could easily be ingraft upon the bureau thus already organize by the addition of two more commissioner and by supplement the duty now impose upon it by such other power and function as would permit the commissioner to act as arbitrator when necessary between labor and capital under such limitation and upon such occasion as should be deem proper and useful
 power should also be distinctly confer upon this bureau to investigate the cause of all dispute as they occur whether submit for arbitration or not so that information may always be at hand to aid legislation on the subject when necessary and desirable

to the house of representatives
 i return without my approval house bill no 1471 entitle an act increase the pension of andrew j. hill
 this bill double the pension which the person name therein have be receive for a number of year it appear from the report of the committee to which the bill be refer that a claim make by he for increase pension have be lately reject by the pension bureau on the ground that the claimant be now receive a pension commensurate with the degree of disability find to exist
 the policy of frequently reverse by special enactment the decision of the bureau invest by law with the examination of pension claim fully equip for such examination and which ought not to be suspect of any lack of liberality to our veteran soldier be exceedingly questionable it may well be doubted if a committee of congress have a well opportunity than such an agency to judge of the merit of these claim if however there be any lack of power in the pension bureau for a full investigation it should be supply if the system adopt be inadequate to do full justice to claimant it should be correct and if there be a want of sympathy and consideration for the defender of our government the bureau should be reorganize
 the disposition to concede the most generous treatment to the disabled aged and needy among our veteran ought not to be restrain and it must be admit that in some case justice and equity can not be do nor the charitable tendency of the government in favor of worthy object of its care indulge under fix rule these condition sometimes justify a resort to special legislation but i be convinced that the interposition by special enactment in the granting of pension should be rare and exceptional in the nature of thing if this be lightly do and upon slight occasion an invitation be offer for the presentation of claim to congress which upon their merit could not survive the test of an examination by the pension bureau and whose only hope of success depend upon sympathy often misdirect instead of right and justice the instrumentality organize by law for the determination of pension claim be thus often overrule and discredit and there be danger that in the end popular prejudice will be create against those who be worthily entitle to the bounty of the government
 there have lately be present to i on the same day for approval nearly 240 special bill grant and increase pension and restore to the pension list the name of party which for cause have be drop to aid executive duty they be refer to the pension bureau for examination and report after a delay absolutely necessary they have be return to i within a few hour of the limit constitutionally permit for executive action two hundred and thirty two of these bill be thus classify
 eighty one cover case in which favorable action by the pension bureau be deny by reason of the insufficiency of the testimony file to prove the fact allege
 these bill i have approve on the assumption that the claim be meritorious and that by the passage of the bill the government have waive full proof of the fact
 twenty six of the bill cover claim reject by the pension bureau because the evidence produce tend to prove that the alleged disability exist before the claimant&#39;s enlistment 21 cover claim which have be deny by such bureau because the evidence tend to show that the disability though contract in the service be not incur in the line of duty 33 cover claim which have be deny because the evidence tend to establish that the disability originate after the soldier&#39;s discharge from the army 47 cover claim which have be deny because the general pension law contain no provision under which they could be allow and 24 of the claim have never be present to the pension bureau
 i estimate the expenditure involve in these bill at more than $ 35,000 annually
 though my conception of public duty lead i to the conclusion upon the slight examination which i have be able to give such of these bill as be not comprise in the first class above mention that many of they should be disapprove i be utterly unable to submit within the time allow i for that purpose my objection to the same
 they will therefore become operative without my approval
 a sufficient reason for the return of the particular bill now under consideration be find in the fact that it provide that the name of andrew j. hill be place upon the pension roll while the record of the pension bureau as well as a medical certificate make a part of the committee&#39;s report disclose that the correct name of the intended beneficiary be alfred j. hill

to the senate and house of representatives
 by a joint resolution of congress approve march 3 1877 the president be authorize and direct to accept the colossal statue of liberty enlighten the world when present by the citizen of the french republic and to designate and set apart for the erection thereof a suitable site upon either governors or bedloes island in the harbor of new york and upon the completion thereof to cause the statue to be inaugurate with such ceremony as will serve to testify the gratitude of our people for this expressive and felicitous memorial of the sympathy of the citizen of our sister republic
 the president be far thereby authorize to cause suitable regulation to be make for its future maintenance as a beacon and for the permanent care and preservation thereof as a monument of art and the continue good will of the great nation which aid we in our struggle for freedom
 under the authority of this resolution on the 4th day of july 1884 the minister of the united states to the french republic by direction of the president of the united states accept the statue and receive a deed of presentation from the franco american union which be now preserve in the archive of the department of state
 i now transmit to congress a letter to the secretary of state from joseph w. drexel esq chairman of the executive committee of the american committee on the pedestal of the great statue of 39;liberty enlighten the world,&#39 date the 27th of april 1886 suggest the propriety of the further execution by the president of the joint resolution refer to by prescribe the ceremony of inauguration to be observe upon the complete erection of the statue upon its site on bedloes island in the harbor of new york
 thursday the 3d of september be the anniversary of the signing of the treaty of peace at paris by which the independence of these united states be recognize and secure have be suggest by this committee under whose auspex and agency the pedestal for the statue have be construct as an appropriate day for the ceremony of inauguration
 the international character which have be imprint upon this work by the joint resolution of 1877 make it incumbent upon congress to provide mean to carry their resolution into effect
 therefore i recommend the appropriation of such sum of money as in the judgment of congress shall be deem adequate and proper to defray the cost of the inauguration of this statue
 i have be inform by the committee that certain expense have be incur in the care and custody of the statue since it be deposit on bedloes island and the phraseology of the joint resolution provide for the permanent care and preservation thereof as a monument of art would seem to include the payment by the united states of the expense so incur since the reception of the statue in this country
 the action of the french government and people in relation to the presentation of this statue to the united states will i hope meet with hearty and responsive action upon the part of congress in which the executive will be most happy to cooperate


 to the heads of departments in the service of the general government
 i deem this a proper time to especially warn all subordinate in the several departments and all officeholder under the general government against the use of their official position in attempt to control political movement in their locality
 officeholder be the agent of the people not their master not only be their time and labor due to the government but they should scrupulously avoid in their political action as well as in the discharge of their official duty offend by a display of obtrusive partisanship their neighbor who have relation with they as public official
 they should also constantly remember that their party friend from whom they have receive preferment have not invest they with the power of arbitrarily manage their political affair they have no right as officeholder to dictate the political action of their party associate or to throttle freedom of action within party line by method and practice which pervert every useful and justifiable purpose of party organization
 the influence of federal officeholder should not be feel in the manipulation of political primary meeting and nominating convention the use by these official of their position to compass their selection as delegate to political convention be indecent and unfair and proper regard for the propriety and requirement of official place will also prevent their assume the active conduct of political campaign
 individual interest and activity in political affair be by no mean condemn officeholder be neither disfranchise nor forbid the exercise of political privilege but their privilege be not enlarge nor be their duty to party increase to pernicious activity by office holding
 a just discrimination in this regard between the thing a citizen may properly do and the purpose for which a public office should not be use be easy in the light of a correct appreciation of the relation between the people and those intrust with official place and a consideration of the necessity under our form of government of political action free from official coercion
 you be request to communicate the substance of these view to those for whose guidance they be intend

to the congress of the united states in discharge of a constitutional duty and follow a well establish precedent in the executive office i herewith transmit to the congress at its reassemble certain information concern the state of the union together with such recommendation for legislative consideration as appear necessary and expedient our government have consistently maintain its relation of friendship toward all other power and of neighborly interest toward those whose possession be contiguous to our own few question have arise during the past year with other government and none of those

the convention which our representative at santiago be authorize to negotiate the cruel treatment of inoffensive chinese have i regret to say be repeat in some of the far western states and territories and act of violence against those people beyond the power of the local constituted authority to prevent and difficult to punish be report even in distant alaska much of this violence can be trace to race prejudice and competition of labor which can not however justify the oppression of stranger whose safety be guarantee by our treaty with china equally with the most favored nation in open our vast domain to alien element the purpose of our lawgiver be to invite assimilation and not to provide an arena for endless antagonism the paramount duty of maintain public order and defend the interest of our own people may require the adoption of measure of restriction but they should not tolerate the oppression of individual of a special race i be not without assurance that the government of china whose friendly disposition toward we i be most happy to recognize will meet we halfway in devise a comprehensive remedy by which an effective limitation of chinese emigration join to protection of those chinese subject who remain in this country may be secure legislation be need to execute the provision of our chinese convention of 1880 touch the opium traffic while the good will of the colombian government toward our country be manif the situation of american interest on the isthmus of panama have at time excited concern and invite friendly action look to the performance

earnestly recommend its enactment case have continue to occur in germany give rise to much correspondence in relation to the privilege of sojourn of our naturalized citizen of german origin revisit the land of their birth yet i be happy to state that our relation with that country have lose none of their accustomed cordiality the claim for interest upon the amount of tonnage due illegally exact from certain german steamship line be favorably report in both houses of congress at the last session and i trust will receive final and favorable action at an early day the recommendation contain in my last annual message in relation to a mode of settlement of the fishery right in the water of british north america so long a subject of anxious difference between the united states and great britain be meet by an adverse vote of the senate on april 13 last and thereupon negotiation be institute to obtain an agreement with her britannic majesty 's government for the promulgation of such joint interpretation and definition of the article of the convention of 1818 relate to the territorial water and inshore fishery of the british provinces as should secure the canadian right from encroachment by the united states fisherman and at the same time insure the enjoyment by the latter of the privilege guarantee to they by such convention the question involve be of long standing of grave consequence and from time to time for nearly three quarter of a century have give rise to earnest international discussion not unaccompanie by irritation temporary arrangement by treaty have serve to allay friction which however have revive as each treaty be terminate the last arrangement under the treaty of 1871 be abrogate after due notice by the united states on june 30 1885 but i be enable to obtain for our fisherman for the remainder of that season enjoyment of the full privilege accord by the terminate treaty the joint high commission by whom the treaty have be negotiate although invest with plenary power to make a permanent settlement be content with a temporary arrangement after the termination of which the question be relegate to the stipulation of the treaty of 1818 as to the first article of which no construction satisfactory to both country have ever be agree upon the progress of civilization and growth of population in the british provinces to which the fishery in question be contiguous and the expansion of commercial intercourse between they and the united states present to day a condition of affair scarcely realizable at the date of the negotiation of 1818.new and vast interest have be bring into existence mode of intercourse between the respective country have be invent and multiply the method of conduct the fishery have be wholly change and all this be necessarily entitle to candid and careful consideration in the adjustment of the term and condition of intercourse and commerce between the united states and their neighbor along a frontier of over 3,500 mile this propinquity community of language and occupation and similarity of political and social institution indicate the practicability and obvious wisdom of maintain mutually beneficial and friendly relation whilst i be unfeignedly desirous that such relation should exist between we and the inhabitant of canada yet the action of their official during the past season toward our fisherman have be such as to seriously threaten their continuance although disappoint in my effort to secure a satisfactory settlement of the fishery question negotiation be still pende with reasonable hope that before the close of the present session of congress announcement may be make that an acceptable conclusion have be reach as at an early day there may be lay before congress the correspondence of the department of state in relation to this important subject so that the history of the past fishing season may be fully disclose and the action and the attitude of the administration clearly comprehend a more extended reference be not deem necessary in this communication the recommendation submit last year that provision be make for a preliminary reconnoissance of the conventional boundary line between alaska and british columbia be renew i express my unhesitating conviction that the intimacy of our relation with hawaii should be emphasize as a result of the reciprocity treaty of 1875 those island on the highway of oriental and australasian traffic be virtually an outpost of american commerce and a step stone to the grow trade of the pacific the polynesian island group have be so absorb by other and more powerful government that the hawaiian islands be leave almost alone in the enjoyment of their autonomy which it be important for we should be preserve our treaty be now terminable on one year 's notice but proposition to abrogate it would be in my judgment most ill advise the paramount influence we have there acquire once relinquish could only with difficulty be regain and a valuable ground of vantage for ourselves might be convert into a stronghold for our commercial competitor i earnestly recommend that the exist treaty stipulation be extend for a further term of seven year a recently sign treaty to this end be now before the senate the importance of telegraphic communication between those island and the united states should not be overlook the question of a general revision of the treaty of japan be again under discussion at tokyo as the first to open relation with that empire and as the nation in most direct commercial relation with japan the united states have lose no opportunity to testify their consistent friendship by support the just claim of japan to autonomy and independence among nation a treaty of extradition between the united states and japan the first conclude by that empire have be lately proclaim the weakness of liberia and the difficulty of maintain effective sovereignty over its outlying district have expose that republic to encroachment it can not be forget that this distant community be an offshoot of our own system owe its origin to the associated benevolence of american citizen whose praiseworthy effort to create a nucleus of civilization in the dark continent have command respect and sympathy everywhere especially in this country although a formal protectorate over liberia be contrary to our traditional policy the moral right and duty of the united states to assist in all proper way in the maintenance of its integrity be obvious and have be consistently announce during nearly half a century i recommend that in the reorganization of our navy a small vessel no long find adequate to our need be present to liberia to be employ by it in the protection of its coastwise revenue the encouraging development of beneficial and intimate relation between the united states and mexico which have be so marked within the past few year be at once the occasion of congratulation and of friendly solicitude i urgently renew my former representation of the need or speedy legislation by congress to carry into effect the reciprocity commercial convention of january 20 1883.our commercial treaty of 1831 with mexico be terminate accord to its provision in 1881 upon notification give by mexico in pursuance of her announce policy of recast all her commercial treaty mexico have since conclude with several foreign government new treaty of commerce and navigation define alien right of trade property and residence treatment of shipping consular privilege and the like our yet unexecuted reciprocity convention of 1883 cover none of these point the settlement of which be so necessary to good relationship i propose to initiate with mexico negotiation for a new and enlarged treaty of commerce and navigation in compliance with a resolution of the senate i communicate to that body on august 2 last and also to the house of representatives the correspondence in the case of a. k. cutting an american citizen then imprison in mexico charge with the commission of a penal offense in texas of which a mexican citizen be the object after demand have be make for his release the charge against he be amend so as to include a violation of mexican law within mexican territory this joinder of alleged offense one within and the other exterior to mexico induce i to order a special investigation of the case pende which mr. cutting be release the incident have however disclose a claim of jurisdiction by mexico novel in our history whereby any offense commit anywhere by a foreigner penal in the place of its commission and of which a mexican be the object may if the offender be find in mexico be there try and punish in conformity with mexican law this jurisdiction be sustain by the court of mexico in the cutting case and approve by the executive branch of that government upon the authority of a mexican statute the appellate court in release mr. cutting decide that the abandonment of the complaint by the mexican citizen aggrieve by the alleged crime a libelous publication remove the basis of further prosecution and also declare justice to have be satisfy by the enforcement of a small part of the original sentence the admission of such a pretension would be attend with serious result invasive of the jurisdiction of this government and highly dangerous to our citizen in foreign land therefore i have deny it and protest against its attempt exercise as unwarranted by the principle of law and international usage a sovereign have jurisdiction of offense which take effect within his territory although concoct or commence outside of it but the right be deny of any foreign sovereign to punish a citizen of the united states for an offense consummate on our soil in violation of our law even though the offense be against a subject or citizen of such sovereign the mexican statute in question make the claim broadly and the principle if concede would create a dual responsibility in the citizen and lead to inextricable confusion destructive of that certainty in the law which be an essential of liberty when citizen of the united states voluntarily go into a foreign country they must abide by the law there in force and will not be protect by their own government from the consequence of an offense against those law commit in such foreign country but watchful care and interest of this government over its citizen be not relinquish because they have go abroad and if charge with crime commit in the foreign land a fair and open trial conduct with decent regard for justice and humanity will be demand for they with less than that this government will not be content when the life or liberty of its citizen be at stake whatever the degree to which extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction may have be formerly allow by consent and reciprocal agreement among certain of the european states no such doctrine or practice be ever know to the law of this country or of that from which our institution have mainly be derive in the case of mexico there be reason especially strong for perfect harmony in the mutual exercise of jurisdiction nature have make we irrevocably neighbor and wisdom and kind feeling should make we friend the overflow of capital and enterprise from the united states be a potent factor in assist the development of the resource of mexico and in build up the prosperity of both country to assist this good work all ground of apprehension for the security of person and property should be remove and i trust that in the interest of good neighborhood the statute refer to will be so modified as to eliminate the present possibility of danger to the peace of the two country the government of the netherlands have exhibit concern in relation to certain feature of our tariff law which be suppose by they to be aim at a class of tobacco produce in the dutch east indies comment would seem unnecessary upon the unwisdom of legislation appear to have a special national discrimination for its object which although unintentional may give rise to injurious retaliation the establishment less than four year ago of a legation at teheran be bear fruit in the interest exhibit by the shah 's government in the industrial activity of the united states and the opportunity of beneficial interchange stable government be now happily restore in peru by the election of a constitutional president and a period of rehabilitation be enter upon but the recovery be necessarily slow from the exhaustion cause by the late war and civil disturbance a convention to adjust by arbitration claim of our citizen have be propose and be under consideration the naval officer who bear to siberia the testimonial bestow by congress in recognition of the aid give to the jeannette survivor have successfully accomplish his mission his interesting report will be submit it be pleasant to know that this mark of appreciation have be welcome by the russian government and people as befit the traditional friendship of the two country civil perturbation in the samoan islands have during the past few year be a source of considerable embarrassment to the three governments germany great britain and the united states whose relation and extraterritorial right in that important group be guarantee by treaty the weakness of the native administration and the conflict of oppose interest in the island have lead king malietoa to seek alliance or protection in some one quarter regardless of the distinct engagement whereby no one of the three treaty power may acquire any paramount or exclusive interest in may last malietoa offer to place samoa under the protection of the united states and the late consul without authority assume to grant it the proceeding be promptly disavow and the overzealous official recall special agent of the three government have be depute to examine the situation in the island with a change in the representation of all three power and a harmonious understanding between they the peace prosperity autonomous administration and neutrality of samoa can hardly fail to be secure it appear that the government of spain do not extend to the flag of the united states in the antilles the full measure of reciprocity requisite under our statute for the continuance of the suspension of discrimination against the spanish flag in our port i be constrain in october last to rescind my predecessor 's proclamation of february 14 1884 permit such suspension an arrangement be however speedily reach and upon notification from the government of spain that all differential treatment of our vessel and their cargo from the united states or from any foreign country have be completely and absolutely relinquish i avail myself of the discretion confer by law and issue on the 27th of october my proclamation declare reciprocal suspension in the united states it be most gratifying to bear testimony to the earnest spirit in which the government of the queen regent have meet our effort to avert the initiation of commercial discrimination and reprisal which be ever disastrous to the material interest and the political good will of the country they may affect the profitable development of the large commercial exchange between the united states and the spanish antilles be naturally an object of solicitude lie close at our door and find here their main market of supply and demand the welfare of cuba and puerto rico and their production and trade be scarcely less important to we than to spain their commercial and financial movement be so naturally a part of our system that no obstacle to full and free intercourse should be permit to exist the stand instruction of our representative at madrid and havana have for year be to leave no effort unessayed to far these end and at no time have the equal good desire of spain been more hopefully manifest than now the government of spain by remove the consular tonnage fee on cargo ship to the antilles and by reduce passport fee have show its recognition of the need of less trammeled intercourse an effort have be make during the past year to remove the hindrance to the proclamation of the treaty of naturalization with the sublime porte sign in 1874 which have remain inoperative owe to a disagreement of interpretation of the clause relative to the effect of the return to and sojourn of a naturalize citizen in the land of origin i trust soon to be able to announce a favorable settlement of the difference as to this interpretation it have be highly satisfactory to note the improved treatment of american missionary in turkey as have be attest by their acknowledgment to our late minister to that government of his successful exertion in their behalf the exchange of ratification of the convention of december 5 1885 with venezuela for the reopening of the award of the caracas commission under the claim convention of 1866 have not yet be effect owe to the delay of the executive of that republic in ratify the measure i trust that this postponement will be brief but should it much long continue the delay may well be regard as a rescission of the compact and a failure on the part of venezuela to complete an arrangement so persistently seek by she during many year and assent to by this government in a spirit of international fairness although to the detriment of holder of bona fide award of the impugned commission i renew the recommendation of my last annual message that exist legislation concern citizenship and naturalization be revise we have treaty with many state provide for the renunciation of citizenship by naturalized alien but no statute be find to give effect to such engagement nor any which provide a need central bureau for the registration of naturalized citizen experience suggest that our statute regulate extradition might be advantageously amend by a provision for the transit across our territory now a convenient thoroughfare of travel from one foreign country to another of fugitive surrender by a foreign government to a third state such provision be not unusual in the legislation of other country and tend to prevent the miscarriage of justice it be also desirable in order to remove present uncertainty that authority should be confer on the secretary of state to issue a certificate in case of an arrest for the purpose of extradition to the officer before whom the proceeding be pende show that a requisition for the surrender of the person charge have be duly make such a certificate if require to be receive before the prisoner 's examination would prevent a long and expensive judicial inquiry into a charge which the foreign government might not desire to press i also recommend that express provision be make for the immediate discharge from custody of person commit for extradition where the president be of opinion that surrender should not be make the drift of sentiment in civilized community toward full recognition of the right of property in the creation of the human intellect have bring about the adoption by many important nation of an international copyright convention which be sign at berne on the 18th of september 1885.inasmuch as the constitution give to the congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful art by secure for limited time to author and inventor the exclusive right to their respective writing and discovery this government do not feel warrant in become a signatory pende the action of congress upon measure of international copyright now before it but the right of adhesion to the berne convention hereafter have be reserve i trust the subject will receive at your hand the attention it deserve and that the just claim of author so urgently press will be duly heed representation continue to be make to i of the injurious effect upon american artist study abroad and have free access to the art collection of foreign country of maintain a discriminating duty against the introduction of the work of their brother artist of other country and i be induce to repeat my recommendation for the abolition of that tax pursuant to a provision of the diplomatic and consular appropriation act approve july 1 1886 the estimate submit by the secretary of state for the maintenance of the consular service have be recast on the basis of salary for all officer to whom such allowance be deem advisable advantage have be take of this to redistribute the salary of the office now appropriate for in accordance with the work perform the importance of the representative duty of the incumbent and the cost of live at each post the last consideration have be too often lose sight of in the allowance heretofore make the compensation which may suffice for the decent maintenance of a worthy and capable officer in a position of onerous and representative trust at a post readily accessible and where the necessary of life be abundant and cheap may prove an inadequate pittance in distant land where the well part of a year 's pay be consume in reach the post of duty and where the comfort of ordinary civilized existence can only be obtain with difficulty and at exorbitant cost i trust that in consider the submit schedule no mistaken theory of economy will perpetuate a system which in the past have virtually close to deserve talent many office where capacity and attainment of a high order be indispensable and in not a few instance have bring discredit on our national character and entail embarrassment and even suffer on those depute to uphold our dignity and interest abroad in connection with this subject i earnestly reiterate the practical necessity of supply some mode of trustworthy inspection and report of the manner in which the consulate be conduct in the absence of such reliable information efficiency can scarcely be reward or its opposite correct increase competition in trade have direct attention to the value of the consular report print by the department of state and the effort of the government to extend the practical usefulness of these report have create a wide demand for they at home and a spirit of emulation abroad constitute a record at the change occur in trade and of the progress of the art and invention in foreign country they be much seek for by all interested in the subject which they embrace the report of the secretary of the treasury exhibit in detail the condition of the public finance and of the several branch of the government relate to his department i especially direct the attention of the congress to the recommendation contain in this and the last precede report of the secretary touch the simplification and amendment of the law relate to the collection of our revenue and in the interest of economy and justice to the government i hope they may be adopt by appropriate legislation the ordinary receipt of the government for the fiscal year end june 30 1886 be $ 336,439,727.06 of this amount $ 192,905,023.41 be receive from custom and $ 116,805,936.48 from internal revenue the total receipt as here state be $ 13,749,020.68 great than for the previous year but the increase from custom be $ 11,434,084.10 and from internal revenue $ 4,407,210.94 make a gain in these item for the last year of $ 15,841,295.04 a fall off in other resource reduce the total increase to the small amount mention the expense at the different custom house of collect this increase custom revenue be less than the expense attend the collection of such revenue for the precede year by $ 490,608 and the increase receipt of internal revenue be collect at a cost to the internal revenue bureau $ 155,944.99 less than the expense of such collection for the previous year the total ordinary expense of the government for the fiscal year end june 30 1886 be $ 242,483,138.50 be less by $ 17,788,797 than such expenditure for the year precede and leave a surplus in the treasury at the close of the last fiscal year of $ 93,956,588.56 as against $ 63,463,771.27 at the close of the previous year be an increase in such surplus of $ 30,492,817.29.the expenditure be compare with those of the precede fiscal year and classify as follow for the current year to end june 30 1887 the ascertained receipt up to october 1 1886 with such receipt estimate for the remainder of the year amount to $ 356,000,000.the expenditure ascertain and estimate for the same period be $ 266,000,000 indicate an anticipated surplus at the close of the year of $ 90,000,000.the total value of the export from the united states to foreign country during the fiscal year be state and compare with the precede year as follow the value of some of our lead export during the last fiscal year as compare with the value of the same for the year immediately precede be here give and furnish information both interesting and suggestive our import during the last fiscal year as compare with the previous year be as follow in my last annual message to the congress attention be direct to the fact that the revenue of the government exceed its actual need and it be suggest that legislative action should be take to relieve the people from the unnecessary burden of taxation thus make apparent in view of the press importance of the subject i deem it my duty to again urge its consideration the income of the government by its increase volume and through economy in its collection be now more than ever in excess of public necessity the application of the surplus to the payment of such portion of the public debt as be now at our option subject to extinguishment if continue at the rate which have lately prevail would retire that class of indebtedness within less than one year from this date thus a continuation of our present revenue system would soon result in the receipt of an annual income much great than necessary to meet government expense with no indebtedness upon which it could be apply we should then be confront with a vast quantity of money the circulate medium of the people hoard in the treasury when it should be in their hand or we should be draw into wasteful public extravagance with all the corrupting national demoralization which follow in its train but it be not the simple existence of this surplus and its threatened attendant evil which furnish the strong argument against our present scale of federal taxation its bad phase be the exaction of such a surplus through a perversion of the relation between the people and their government and a dangerous departure from the rule which limit the right of federal taxation good government and especially the government of which every american citizen boast have for its object the protection of every person within its care in the great liberty consistent with the good order of society and his perfect security in the enjoyment of his earning with the least possible diminution for public need when more of the people 's substance be exact through the form of taxation than be necessary to meet the just obligation of the government and the expense of its economical administration such exaction become ruthless extortion and a violation of the fundamental principle of a free government the indirect manner in which these exaction be make have a tendency to conceal their true character and their extent but we have arrive at a stage of superfluous revenue which have arouse the people to a realization of the fact that the amount raise professedly for the support of the government be pay by they as absolutely if add to the price of the thing which supply their daily want as if it be pay at fix period into the hand of the tax gatherer those who toil for daily wage be begin to understand that capital though sometimes vaunt its importance and clamor for the protection and favor of the government be dull and sluggish till touch by the magical hand of labor it spring into activity furnish an occasion for federal taxation and gain the value which enable it to bear its burden and the labor man be thoughtfully inquire whether in these circumstance and consider the tribute he constantly pay into the public treasury as he supply his daily want he receive his fair share of advantage there be also a suspicion abroad that the surplus of our revenue indicate abnormal and exceptional business profit which under the system which produce such surplus increase without correspond benefit to the people at large the vast accumulation of a few among our citizen whose fortune rival the wealth of the most favor in antidemocratic nation be not the natural growth of a steady plain and industrious republic our farmer too and those engage directly and indirectly in supply the product of agriculture see that day by day and as often as the daily want of their household recur they be force to pay excessive and needless taxation while their product struggle in foreign market with the competition of nation which by allow a free exchange of production than we permit enable their people to sell for price which distress the american farmer as every patriotic citizen rejoice in the constantly increase pride of our people in american citizenship and in the glory of our national achievement and progress a sentiment prevail that the lead string useful to a nation in its infancy may well be to a great extent discard in the present stage of american ingenuity courage and fearless self reliance and for the privilege of indulge this sentiment with true american enthusiasm our citizen be quite willing to forego an idle surplus in the public treasury and all the people know that the average rate of federal taxation upon import be to day in time of peace but little less while upon some article of necessary consumption it be actually more than be impose by the grievous burden willingly bear at a time when the government need million to maintain by war the safety and integrity of the union it have be the policy of the government to collect the principal part of its revenue by a tax upon import and no change in this policy be desirable but the present condition of affair constrain our people to demand that by a revision of our revenue law the receipt of the government shall be reduce to the necessary expense of its economical administration and this demand should be recognize and obey by the people 's representative in the legislative branch of the government in readjust the burden of federal taxation a sound public policy require that such of our citizen as have build up large and important industry under present condition should not be suddenly and to their injury deprive of advantage to which they have adapt their business but if the public good require it they should be content with such consideration as shall deal fairly and cautiously with their interest while the just demand of the people for relief from needless taxation be honestly answer a reasonable and timely submission to such a demand should certainly be possible without disastrous shock to any interest and a cheerful concession sometimes avert abrupt and heedless action often the outgrowth of impatience and delay justice due regard should be also accord in any propose readjustment to the interest of american labor so far as they be involve we congratulate ourselves that there be among we no labor class fix within unyielde bound and doom under all condition to the inexorable fate of daily toil we recognize in labor a chief factor in the wealth of the republic and we treat those who have it in their keeping as citizen entitle to the most careful regard and thoughtful attention this regard and attention should be award they not only because labor be the capital of our workingmen justly entitle to its share of government favor but for the further and not less important reason that the labor man surround by his family in his humble home as a consumer be vitally interested in all that cheapen the cost of live and enable he to bring within his domestic circle additional comfort and advantage this relation of the workingman to the revenue law of the country and the manner in which it palpably influence the question of wage should not be forget in the justifiable prominence give to the proper maintenance of the supply and protection of well pay labor and these consideration suggest such an arrangement of government revenue as shall reduce the expense of living while it do not curtail the opportunity for work nor reduce the compensation of american labor and injuriously affect its condition and the dignified place it hold in the estimation of our people but our farmer and agriculturist those who from the soil produce the thing consume by all be perhaps more directly and plainly concerned than any other of our citizen in a just and careful system of federal taxation those actually engage in and more remotely connect with this kind of work number nearly one half of our population none labor hard or more continuously than they no enactment limit their hour of toil and no interposition of the government enhance to any great extent the value of their product and yet for many of the necessary and comfort of life which the most scrupulous economy enable they to bring into their home and for their implement of husbandry they be oblige to pay a price largely increase by an unnatural profit which by the action of the government be give to the more favored manufacturer i recommend that keep in view all these consideration the increase and unnecessary surplus of national income annually accumulate be release to the people by an amendment to our revenue law which shall cheapen the price of the necessary of life and give free entrance to such import material as by american labor may be manufacture into marketable commodity nothing can be accomplish however in the direction of this much need reform unless the subject be approach in a patriotic spirit of devotion to the interest of the entire country and with a willingness to yield something for the public good the sum pay upon the public debt during the fiscal year end june 30 1886 be $ 44,551,043.36.dure the twelve month end october 31,1886 3 per cent bond be call for redemption amount to $ 127,283,100 of which $ 80,643,200 be so call to answer the requirement of the law relate to the sink fund and $ 46,639,900 for the purpose of reduce the public debt by application of a part of the surplus in the treasury to that object of the bond thus call $ 102,269,450 become subject under such call to redemption prior to november 1 1886 the remainder amount to$25,013,650 mature under the call after that date in addition to the amount subject to payment and cancellation prior to november 1 there be also pay before that day certain of these bond with the interest thereon amount to $ 5,072,350 which be anticipate as to their maturity of which $ 2,664,850 have not be call thus $ 107,341,800 have be actually apply prior to the 1st of november 1886 to the extinguishment of our bond and interest bear debt leave on that day still outstanding the sum of $ 1,153,443,112 of this amount $ 86,848,700 be still represent by 3 per cent bond they however have be since november 1 or will at once be far reduce by $ 22,606,150 be bond which have be call as already state but not redeem and cancel before the latter date during the fiscal year end june 30 1886 there be coin under the compulsory silver coinage act of 1878,29,838,905 silver dollar and the cost of the silver use in such coinage be $ 23,448,960.01 there have be coin up to the close of the previous fiscal year under the provision of the law 203,882,554 silver dollar and on the 1st day of december 1886 the total amount of such coinage be $ 247,131,549.the director of the mint report that at the time of the passage of the law of 1878 direct this coinage the intrinsic value of the dollar thus coin be 94 1/4 cent each and that on the 31st day of july 1886 the price of silver reach the low stage ever know so that the intrinsic or bullion price of our standard silver dollar at that date be less than 72 cent the price of silver on the 30th day of november last be such as to make these dollar intrinsically worth 78 cent each these difference in value of the coin represent the fluctuation in the price of silver and they certainly do not indicate that compulsory coinage by the government enhance the price of that commodity or secure uniformity in its value every fair and legal effort have be make by the treasury department to distribute this currency among the people the withdrawal of united states treasury note of small denomination and the issuing of small silver certificate have be resort to in the endeavor to accomplish this result in obedience to the will and sentiment of the representative of the people in the congress on the 27th day of november 1886 the people hold of these coin or certificate represent they the nominal sum of $ 166,873,041 and we still have $ 79,464,345 in the treasury as against about $ 142,894,055 so in the hand of the people and $ 72,865,376 remain in the treasury one year ago the director of the mint again urge the necessity of more vault room for the purpose of store these silver dollar which be not need for circulation by the people i have see no reason to change the view express in my last annual message on the subject of this compulsory coinage and i again urge its suspension on all the ground contain in my former recommendation reenforce by the significant increase of our gold exportation during the last year as appear by the comparative statement herewith present and for the further reason that the more this currency be distribute among the people the great become our duty to protect it from disaster that we now have abundance for all our need and that there seem but little propriety in build vault to store such currency when the only pretense for its coinage be the necessity of its use by the people as a circulate medium the great number of suit now pende in the united states court for the southern district of new york grow out of the collection of custom revenue at the port of new york and the number of such suit that be almost daily institute be certainly worthy the attention of the congress these legal controversy base upon conflicting view by importer and the collector as to the interpretation of our present complex and indefinite revenue law might be largely obviate by an amendment of those law but pende such amendment the present condition of this litigation should be relieve there be now pende about 2,500 of these suit more than 1,100 have be commence within the past eighteen month and many of the other have be at issue for more than twenty five year these delay subject the government to loss of evidence and prevent the preparation necessary to defeat unjust and fictitious claim while constantly accrue interest threaten to double the demand involve in the present condition of the docket of the court well fill with private suit and of the force allow the district attorney no great than be necessary for the ordinary and current business of his office these revenue litigation can not be consider in default of the adoption by the congress of a plan for the general reorganization of the federal court as have be heretofore recommend i urge the propriety of pass a law permit the appointment of an additional federal judge in the district where these government suit have accumulate so that by continuous session of the court devote to the trial of these case they may be determine it be entirely plain that a great saving to the government would be accomplish by such a remedy and the suitor who have honest claim would not be deny justice through delay the report of the secretary of war give a detailed account of the administration of his department and contain sundry recommendation for the improvement of the service which i fully approve the army consist at the date of the last consolidated return of 2,103 officer and 24,946 enlisted man the expense of the department for the last fiscal year be $ 36,990,903.38 include $ 6,294,305.43 for public work and river and harbor improvement i especially direct the attention of the congress to the recommendation that officer be require to submit to an examination as a preliminary to their promotion i see no objection but many advantage in adopt this feature which have operate so beneficially in our navy department as well as in some branch of the army the subject of coast defense and fortification have be fully and carefully treat by the board on fortifications whose report be submit at the last session of congress but no construction work of the kind recommend by the board have be possible during the last year from the lack of appropriation for such purpose the defenseless condition of our seacoast and lake frontier be perfectly palpable the examination make must convince we all that certain of our city name in the report of the board should be fortify and that work on the most important of these fortification should be commence at once the work have be thoroughly consider and lay out the secretary of war report but all be delay in default of congressional action the absolute necessity judge by all standard of prudence and foresight of our preparation for an effectual resistance against the armored ship and steel gun and mortar of modern construction which may threaten the city on our coast be so apparent that i hope effective step will be take in that direction immediately the valuable and suggestive treatment of this question by the secretary of war be earnestly commend to the consideration of the congress in september and october last the hostile apaches who under the leadership of geronimo have for eighteen month be on the war path and during that time have commit many murder and be the cause of constant terror to the settler of arizona surrender to general miles the military commander who succeed general crook in the management and direction of their pursuit under the term of their surrender as then report and in view of the understanding which these murderous savage seem to entertain of the assurance give they it be consider good to imprison they in such manner as to prevent their ever engage in such outrage again instead of try they for murder fort pickens having be select as a safe place of confinement all the adult male be send thither and will be closely guard as prisoner in the meantime the residue of the band who though still remain upon the reservation be regard as unsafe and suspect of furnish aid to those on the war path have be remove to fort marion the woman and large child of the hostile be also take there and arrangement have be make for put the child of proper age in indian school the report of the secretary of the navy contain a detailed exhibit of the condition of his department with such a statement of the action need to improve the same as should challenge the earnest attention of the congress the present navy of the united states aside from the ship in course of construction consist of first fourteen single turrete monitor none of which be in commission nor at the present time serviceable the battery of these ship be obsolete and they can only be rely upon as auxiliary ship in harbor defense and then after such an expenditure upon they as might not be deem justifiable second five fourth rate vessel of small tonnage only one of which be design as a war vessel and all of which be auxiliary merely third twenty seven cruise ship three of which be build of iron of small tonnage and twenty four of wood of these wooden vessel it be estimate by the chief constructor of the navy that only three will be serviceable beyond a period of six year at which time it may be say that of the present naval force nothing worthy the name will remain all the vessel heretofore authorize be under contract or in course of construction except the armored ship the torpedo and dynamite boat and one cruiser as to the last of these the bid be in excess of the limit fix by congress the production in the united states of armor and gun steel be a question which it seem necessary to settle at an early day if the armored war vessel be to be complete with those material of home manufacture this have be the subject of investigation by two board and by two special committee of congress within the last three year the report of the gun foundry board in 1884 of the board on fortifications make in january last and the report of the select committee of the two houses make at the last session of congress have entirely exhaust the subject so far as preliminary investigation be involve and in their recommendation they be substantially agree in the event that the present invitation of the department for bid to furnish such of this material as be now authorize shall fail to induce domestic manufacturer to undertake the large expenditure require to prepare for this new manufacture and no other step be take by congress at its come session the secretary contemplate with dissatisfaction the necessity of obtain abroad the armor and the gun steel for the authorized ship it would seem desirable that the want of the army and the navy in this regard should be reasonably meet and that by unite their contract such inducement might be offer as would result in secure the domestication of these important interest the affair of the postal service show mark and gratifying improvement during the past year a particular account of its transaction and condition be give in the report of the postmaster general which will be lay before you the reduction of the rate of letter postage in 1883 render the postal revenue inadequate to sustain the expenditure and business depression also contribute result in an excess of cost for the fiscal year end june 30 1885 of eight and one third million of dollar an additional check upon receipt by double the measure of weight in rating seal correspondence and diminish one half the charge for newspaper carriage be impose by legislation which take effect with the beginning of the past fiscal year while the constant demand of our territorial development and grow population for the extension and increase of mail facility and machinery necessitate steady annual advance in outlay and the careful estimate of a year ago upon the rate of expenditure then exist contemplate the unavoidable augmentation of the deficiency in the last fiscal year by nearly $ 2,000,000 the anticipated revenue for the last year fail of realization by about $ 64,000 but proper measure of economy have so satisfactorily limit the growth of expenditure that the total deficiency in fact fall below that of 1885 and at this time the increase of revenue be in a gain ratio over the increase of cost demonstrate the sufficiency of the present rate of postage ultimately to sustain the service this be the more pleasing because our people enjoy now both cheap postage proportionably to distance and a vaster and more costly service than any other upon the globe retrenchment have be effect in the cost of supply some expenditure unwarranted by law have cease and the outlay for mail carriage have be subject to beneficial scrutiny at the close of the last fiscal year the expense of transportation on star route stand at an annual rate of cost less by over $ 560,000 than at the close of the previous year and steamboat and mail messenger service at nearly $ 200,000 less the service have be in the meantime enlarge and extend by the establishment of new office increase of route of carriage expansion of carrier delivery convenience and addition to the railway mail facility in accordance with the grow exigency of the country and the long establish policy of the government the postmaster general call attention to the exist law for compensate railroad and express the opinion that a method may be devise which will prove more just to the carrier and beneficial to the government and the subject appear worthy of your early consideration the difference which arise during the year with certain of the ocean steamship company have terminate by the acquiescence of all in the policy of the government approve by the congress in the postal appropriation at its last session and the department now enjoy the utmost service afford by all vessel which sail from our port upon either ocean a service generally adequate to the need of our intercourse petition have however be present to the department by numerous merchant and manufacturer for the establishment of a direct service to the argentine republic and for semimonthly dispatch to the empire of brazil and the subject be commend to your consideration it be an obvious duty to provide the mean of postal communication which our commerce require and with prudent forecast of result the wise extension of it may lead to stimulate intercourse and become the harbinger of a profitable traffic which will open new avenue for the disposition of the product of our industry the circumstance of the country at the far south of our continent be such as to invite our enterprise and afford the promise of sufficient advantage to justify an unusual effort to bring about the close relation which great freedom of communication would tend to establish i suggest that as distinguish from a grant or subsidy for the mere benefit of any line of trade or travel whatever outlay may be require to secure additional postal service necessary and proper and not otherwise attainable should be regard as within the limit of legitimate compensation for such service the extension of the free delivery service as suggest by the postmaster general have heretofore receive my sanction and it be to be hope a suitable enactment may soon be agree upon the request for an appropriation sufficient to enable the general inspection of fourth class office have my approbation i renew my approval of the recommendation of the postmaster general that another assistant be provide for the post office department and i invite your attention to the several other recommendation in his report the conduct of the department of justice for the last fiscal year be fully detailed in the report of the attorney general and i invite the earnest attention of the congress to the same and due consideration of the recommendation therein contain in the report submit by this officer to the last session of the congress he strongly recommend the erection of a penitentiary for the confinement of prisoner convict and sentence in the united states court and he repeat the recommendation in his report for the last year this be a matter of very great importance and should at once receive congressional action united states prisoner be now confine in more than thirty different state prison and penitentiary scatter in every part of the country they be subject to nearly as many different mode of treatment and discipline and be far too much removed from the control and regulation of the government so far as they be entitle to humane treatment and an opportunity for improvement and reformation the government be responsible to they and society that these thing be forthcoming but this duty can scarcely be discharge without more absolute control and direction than be possible under the present system many of our good citizen have interest themselves with the most beneficial result in the question of prison reform the general government should be in a situation since there must be united states prisoner to furnish important aid in this movement and should be able to illustrate what may be practically do in the direction of this reform and to present an example in the treatment and improvement of its prisoner worthy of imitation with prison under its own control the government could deal with the somewhat vex question of convict labor so far as its convict be concern accord to a plan of its own adoption and with due regard to the right and interest of our labor citizen instead of sometimes aid in the operation of a system which cause among they irritation and discontent upon consideration of this subject it might be think wise to erect more than one of these institution locate in such place as would well subserve the purpose of convenience and economy in transportation the considerable cost of maintain these convict as at present in state institution would be save by the adoption of the plan propose and by employ they in the manufacture of such article as be need for use by the government quite a large pecuniary benefit would be realize in partial return for our outlay i again urge a change in the federal judicial system to meet the want of the people and obviate the delay necessarily attend the present condition of affair in our court all be agree that something should be do and much favor be show by those well able to advise to the plan suggest by the attorney general at the last session of the congress and recommend in my last annual message this recommendation be here renew together with another make at the same time touch a change in the manner of compensate district attorney and marshal and the latter subject be commend to the congress for its action in the interest of economy to the government and humanity fairness and justice to our people the report of the secretary of the interior present a comprehensive summary of the work of the various branch of the public service connect with his department and the suggestion and recommendation which it contain for the improvement of the service should receive your careful consideration the exhibit make of the condition of our indian population and the progress of the work for their enlightenment notwithstanding the many embarrassment which hinder the well administration of this important branch of the service be a gratifying and hopeful one the fund appropriate for the indian service for the fiscal year just pass with the available income from indian land and trust money amount in all to $ 7,850,775.12 be ample for the service under the condition and restriction of law regulate their expenditure there remain a balance on hand on june 30 1886 of $ 1,660,023.30 of which $ 1,337,768.21 be permanent fund for fulfillment of treaty and other like purpose and the remainder $ 322,255.09 be subject to be carry to the surplus fund as require by law the estimate present for appropriation for the ensue fiscal year amount to $ 5,608,873.64 or $ 442,386.20 less than those lay before the congress last year the present system of agency while absolutely necessary and well adapt for the management of our indian affair and for the end in view when it be adopt be in the present stage of indian management inadequate stand alone for the accomplishment of an object which have become press in its importance the more rapid transition from tribal organization to citizenship of such portion of the indians as be capable of civilized life when the exist system be adopt the indian race be outside of the limit of organized states and territories and beyond the immediate reach and operation of civilization and all effort be mainly direct to the maintenance of friendly relation and the preservation of peace and quiet on the frontier all this be now change there be no such thing as the indian frontier civilization with the busy hum of industry and the influence of christianity surround these people at every point none of the tribe be outside of the bound of organized government and society except that the territorial system have not be extend over that portion of the country know as the indian territory as a race the indians be no long hostile but may be consider as submissive to the control of the government few of they only be troublesome except the fragment of several band all be now gather upon reservation it be no long possible for they to subsist by the chase and the spontaneous production of the earth with an abundance of land if furnish with the mean and implement for profitable husbandry their life of entire dependence upon government ration from day to day be no long defensible their inclination long foster by a defective system of control be to cling to the habit and custom of their ancestor and struggle with persistence against the change of life which their altered circumstance press upon they but barbarism and civilization can not live together it be impossible that such incongruous condition should coexist on the same soil they be a portion of our people be under the authority of our government and have a peculiar claim upon and be entitle to the foster care and protection of the nation the government can not relieve itself of this responsibility until they be so far train and civilized as to be able wholly to manage and care for themselves the path in which they should walk must be clearly mark out for they and they must be lead or guide until they be familiar with the way and competent to assume the duty and responsibility of our citizenship progress in this great work will continue only at the present slow pace and at great expense unless the system and method of management be improve to meet the change condition and urgent demand of the service the agent have general charge and supervision in many case of more than 5,000 indians scatter over large reservation and burden with the detail of accountability for fund and supply have time to look after the industrial training and improvement of a few indians only the many be neglect and remain idle and dependent condition not favorable for progress and civilization the compensation allow these agent and the condition of the service be not calculate to secure for the work man who be fit by ability and skill to properly plan and intelligently direct the method well adapt to produce the most speedy result and permanent benefit hence the necessity for a supplemental agency or system direct to the end of promote the general and more rapid transition of the tribe from habit and custom of barbarism to the way of civilization with an anxious desire to devise some plan of operation by which to secure the welfare of the indians and to relieve the treasury as far as possible from the support of an idle and dependent population i recommend in my previous annual message the passage of a law authorize the appointment of a commission as an instrumentality auxiliary to those already establish for the care of the indians it be design that this commission should be compose of six intelligent and capable person three to be detail from the army have practical idea upon the subject of the treatment of indians and interested in their welfare and that it should be charge under the direction of the secretary of the interior with the management of such matter of detail as can not with the present organization be properly and successfully conduct and which present different phase as the indians themselves differ in their progress need disposition and capacity for improvement or immediate self support by the aid of such a commission much unwise and useless expenditure of money waste of material and unavaile effort might be avoid and it be hope that this or some measure which the wisdom of congress may well devise to supply the deficiency of the present system may receive your consideration and the appropriate legislation be provide the time be ripe for the work of such an agency there be less opposition to the education and training of the indian youth as show by the increase attendance upon the school and there be a yield tendency for the individual holding of land development and advancement in these direction be essential and should have every encouragement as the rise generation be teach the language of civilization and train in habit of industry they should assume the duty privilege and responsibility of citizenship no obstacle should hinder the location and settlement of any indian willing to take land in severalty on the contrary the inclination to do so should be stimulate at all time when proper and expedient but there be no authority of law for make allotment on some of the reservation and on other the allotment provide for be so small that the indians though ready and desire to settle down be not willing to accept such small area when their reservation contain ample land to afford they homestead of sufficient size to meet their present and future need these inequality of exist special law and treaty should be correct and some general legislation on the subject should be provide so that the more progressive member of the different tribe may be settle upon homestead and by their example lead other to follow break away from tribal custom and substituting therefor the love of home the interest of the family and the rule of the state the indian character and nature be such that they be not easily lead while brood over unadjusted wrong this be especially so regard their land matter arise from the construction and operation of railroad across some of the reservation and claim of title and right of occupancy set up by white person to some of the good land within other reservation require legislation for their final adjustment the settlement of these matter will remove many embarrassment to progress in the work of lead the indians to the adoption of our institution and bring they under the operation the influence and the protection of the universal law of our country the recommendation of the secretary of the interior and the commissioner of the general land office look to the well protection of public land and of the public survey the preservation of national forest the adjudication of grant to states and corporation and of private land claim and the increase efficiency of the public land service be commend to the attention of congress to secure the wide distribution of public land in limited quantity among settler for residence and cultivation and thus make the great number of individual home be the primary object of the public land legislation in the early day of the republic this system be a simple one it commence with an admirable scheme of public survey by which the humblest citizen could identify the tract upon which he wish to establish his home the price of land be place within the reach of all the enterprising industrious and honest pioneer citizen of the country it be soon however find that the object of the law be pervert under the system of cash sale from a distribution of land among the people to an accumulation of land capital by wealthy and speculative person to check this tendency a preference right of purchase be give to settler on the land a plan which culminate in the general preemption act of 1841 the foundation of this system be actual residence and cultivation twenty year later the homestead law be devise to more surely place actual home in the possession of actual cultivator of the soil the land be give without price the sole condition be residence improvement and cultivation other law have follow each design to encourage the acquirement and use of land in limited individual quantity but in later year these law through vicious administrative method and under change condition of communication and transportation have be so evade and violate that their beneficent purpose be threaten with entire defeat the method of such evasion and violation be set forth in detail in the report of the secretary of the interior and commissioner of the general land office the rapid appropriation of our public land without bona fide settlement or cultivation and not only without intention of residence but for the purpose of their aggregation in large holding in many case in the hand of foreigner invite the serious and immediate attention of the congress the energy of the land department have be devote during the present administration to remedy defect and correct abuse in the public land service the result of these effort be so largely in the nature of reform in the process and method of our land system as to prevent adequate estimate but it appear by a compilation from the report of the commissioner of the general land office that the immediate effect in lead case which have come to a final termination have be the restoration to the mass of public land of 2,750,000 acre that 2,370,000 acre be embrace in investigation now pende before the department or the court and that the action of congress have be ask to effect the restoration of 2,790,000 acre additional besides which 4,000,000 acre have be withhold from reservation and the right of entry thereon maintain i recommend the repeal of the preemption and timber culture act and that the homestead law be so amend as to well secure compliance with their requirement of residence improvement and cultivation for the period of five year from date of entry without commutation or provision for speculative relinquishment i also recommend the repeal of the desert land law unless it shall be the pleasure of the congress to so amend these law as to render they less liable to abuse as the chief motive for an evasion of the law and the principal cause of their result in land accumulation instead of land distribution be the facility with which transfer be make of the right intend to be secure to settler it may be deem advisable to provide by legislation some guard and check upon the alienation of homestead right and land cover thereby until patent issue last year an executive proclamation be issue direct the removal of fence which inclose the public domain many of these have be remove in obedience to such order but much of the public land still remain within the line of these unlawful fence the ingenious method resort to in order to continue these trespass and the hardihood of the pretense by which in some case such inclosure be justify be fully detailed in the report of the secretary of the interior the removal of the fence still remain which inclose public land will be enforce with all the authority and mean with which the executive branch of the government be or shall be invest by the congress for that purpose the report of the commissioner of pensions contain a detailed and most satisfactory exhibit of the operation of the pension bureau during the last fiscal year the amount of work do be the large in any year since the organization of the bureau and it have be do at less cost than during the previous year in every division on the 30th day of june 1886 there be 365,783 pensioner on the roll of the bureau since 1861 there have be 1,018,735 application for pension file of which 78,834 be base upon service in the war of 1812 there be 621,754 of these application allow include 60,178 to the soldier of 1812 and their widow the total amount pay for pension since 1861 be $ 808,624,811.57.the number of new pension allow during the year end june 30 1886 be 40,857 a large number than have be allow in any year save one since 1861 the name of 2,229 pensioner which have be previously drop from the roll be restore during the year and after deduct those drop within the same time for various cause a net increase remain for the year of 20,658 name from january 1 1861 to december 1 1885 1,967 private pension act have be pass since the last mention date and during the last session of the congress 644 such act become law it seem to i that no one can examine our pension establishment and its operation without be convince that through its instrumentality justice can be very nearly do to all who be entitle under present law to the pension bounty of the government but it be undeniable that case exist well entitle to relief in which the pension bureau be powerless to aid the really worthy case of this class be such as only lack by misfortune the kind or quantity of proof which the law and regulation of the bureau require or which though their merit be apparent for some other reason can not be justly deal with through general law these condition fully justify application to the congress and special enactment but resort to the congress for a special pension act to overrule the deliberate and careful determination of the pension bureau on the merit or to secure favorable action when it could not be expect under the most liberal execution of general law it must be admit open the door to the allowance of questionable claim and present to the legislative and executive branch of the government application concededly not within the law and plainly devoid of merit but so surround by sentiment and patriotic feeling that they be hard to resist i suppose it will not be deny that many claim for pension be make without merit and that many have be allow upon fraudulent representation this have be declare from the pension bureau not only in this but in prior administration the usefulness and the justice of any system for the distribution of pension depend upon the equality and uniformity of its operation it will be see from the report of the commissioner that there be now pay by the government 131 different rate of pension he estimate from the good information he can obtain that 9,000 of those who have serve in the army and navy of the united states be now support in whole or in part from public fund or by organized charity exclusive of those in soldier home under the direction and control of the government only 13 per cent of these be pensioner while of the entire number of man furnish for the late war something like 20 per cent include their widow and relative have be or now be in receipt of pension the american people with a patriotic and grateful regard for our ex soldier too broad and too sacred to be monopolize by any special advocate be not only willing but anxious that equal and exact justice should be do to all honest claimant for pension in their sight the friendless and destitute soldier dependent on public charity if otherwise entitle have precisely the same right to share in the provision make for those who fight their country 's battle as those well able through friend and influence to push their claim every pension that be grant under our present plan upon any other ground than actual service and injury or disease incur in such service and every instance of the many in which pension be increase on other ground than the merit of the claim work an injustice to the brave and crippled but poor and friendless soldier who be entirely neglect or who must be content with the small sum allow under general law there be far too many neighborhood in which be find glare case of inequality of treatment in the matter of pension and they be largely due to a yielding in the pension bureau to importunity on the part of those other than the pensioner who be especially interested or they arise from special act pass for the benefit of individual the man who fight side by side should stand side by side when they participate in a grateful nation 's kind remembrance every consideration of fairness and justice to our ex soldier and the protection of the patriotic instinct of our citizen from perversion and violation point to the adoption of a pension system broad and comprehensive enough to cover every contingency and which shall make unnecessary an objectionable volume of special legislation as long as we adhere to the principle of grant pension for service and disability as the result of the service the allowance of pension should be restrict to case present these feature every patriotic heart respond to a tender consideration for those who having serve their country long and well be reduce to destitution and dependence not as an incident of their service but with advance age or through sickness or misfortune we be all tempt by the contemplation of such a condition to supply relief and be often impatient of the limitation of public duty yield to no one in the desire to indulge this feeling of consideration i can not rid myself of the conviction that if these ex soldier be to be relieve they and their cause be entitle to the benefit of an enactment under which relief may be claim as a right and that such relief should be grant under the sanction of law not in evasion of it nor should such worthy object of care all equally entitle be remit to the unequal operation of sympathy or the tender mercy of social and political influence with their unjust discrimination the discharged soldier and sailor of the country be our fellow citizen and interested with we in the passage and faithful execution of wholesome law they can not be swerve from their duty of citizenship by artful appeal to their spirit of brotherhood bear of common peril and suffering nor will they exact as a test of devotion to their welfare a willingness to neglect public duty in their behalf on the 4th of march 1885 the current business of the patent office be on an average five and a half month in arrear and in several division more than twelve month behind at the close of the last fiscal year such current work be but three month in arrear and it be assert and believe that in the next few month the delay in obtain an examination of an application for a patent will be but nominal the number of application for patent during the last fiscal year include reissue design trade mark and label equal 40,678 which be considerably in excess of the number receive during any precede year the receipt of the patent office during the year aggregate $ 1,205,167.80 enable the office to turn into the treasury a surplus revenue over and above all expenditure of about $ 163,710.30.the number of patent grant during the last fiscal year include reissue trade mark design and label be 25,619 a number also quite largely in excess of that of any precede year the report of the commissioner show the office to be in a prosperous condition and constantly increase in its business no increase of force be ask for the amount estimate for the fiscal year end june 30 1886 be $ 890,760 the amount estimate for the year end june 30 1887 be $ 853,960 the amount estimate for the fiscal year end june 30 1888 be $ 778,770.the secretary of the interior suggest a change in the plan for the payment of the indebtedness of the pacific subsidize road to the government his suggestion have the unanimous indorsement of the person select by the government to act as director of these road and protect the interest of the united states in the board of direction in consider the plan propose the sole matter which should be take into account in my opinion be the situation of the government as a creditor and the sure way to secure the payment of the principal and interest of its debt by a recent decision of the supreme court of the united states it have be adjudge that the law of the several states be inoperative to regulate rate of transportation upon railroad if such regulation interfere with the rate of carriage from one state into another this important field of control and regulation having be thus leave entirely unoccupied the expediency of federal action upon the subject be worthy of consideration the relation of labor to capital and of labor man to their employer be of the utmost concern to every patriotic citizen when these be strained and distorted unjustifiable claim be apt to be insist upon by both interest and in the controversy which result the welfare of all and the prosperity of the country be jeopardize any intervention of the general government within the limit of its constitutional authority to avert such a condition should be willingly accord in a special message transmit to the congress at its last session i suggest the enlargement of our present labor bureau and add to its present function the power of arbitration in case where difference arise between employer and employ when these difference reach such a stage as to result in the interruption of commerce between the states the application of this remedy by the general government might be regard as entirely within its constitutional power and i think we might reasonably hope that such arbitrator if carefully select and if entitle to the confidence of the party to be affect would be voluntarily call to the settlement of controversy of less extent and not necessarily within the domain of federal regulation i be of the opinion that this suggestion be worthy the attention of the congress but after all have be do by the passage of law either federal or state to relieve a situation full of solicitude much more remain to be accomplish by the reinstatement and cultivation of a true american sentiment which recognize the equality of american citizenship this in the light of our tradition and in loyalty to the spirit of our institution would teach that a hearty cooperation on the part of all interest be the sure path to national greatness and the happiness of all our people that capital should in recognition of the brotherhood of our citizenship and in a spirit of american fairness generously accord to labor its just compensation and consideration and that contented labor be capital 's good protection and faithful ally it would teach too that the diverse situation of our people be inseparable from our civilization that every citizen should in his sphere be a contributor to the general good that capital do not necessarily tend to the oppression of labor and that violent disturbance and disorder alienate from their promoter true american sympathy and kindly feel the department of agriculture represent the old and large of our national industry be subserve well the purpose of its organization by the introduction of new subject of farming enterprise and by open new source of agricultural wealth and the dissemination of early information concern production and price it have contribute largely to the country 's prosperity through this agency advanced thought and investigation touch the subject it have in charge should among other thing be practically apply to the home production at a low cost of article of food which be now import from abroad such an innovation will necessarily of course in the beginning be within the domain of intelligent experiment and the subject in every stage should receive all possible encouragement from the government the interest of million of our citizen engage in agriculture be involve in an enlargement and improvement of the result of their labor and a zealous regard for their welfare should be a willing tribute to those whose productive return be a main source of our progress and power the existence of pleuro pneumonia among the cattle of various states have lead to burdensome and in some case disastrous restriction in an important branch of our commerce threaten to affect the quantity and quality of our food supply this be a matter of such importance and of such far reach consequence that i hope it will engage the serious attention of the congress to the end that such a remedy may be apply as the limit of a constitutional delegation of power to the general government will permit i commend to the consideration of the congress the report of the commissioner and his suggestion concern the interest intrust to his care the continued operation of the law relate to our civil service have add the most convincing proof of its necessity and usefulness it be a fact worthy of note that every public officer who have a just idea of his duty to the people testify to the value of this reform its staunch friend be find among those who understand it well and its warm supporter be those who be restrain and protect by its requirement the meaning of such restraint and protection be not appreciate by those who want place under the government regardless of merit and efficiency nor by those who insist that the selection of such place should rest upon a proper credential show active partisan work they mean to public officer if not their life the only opportunity afford they to attend to public business and they mean to the good people of the country the well performance of the work of their government it be exceedingly strange that the scope and nature of this reform be so little understand and that so many thing not include within its plan be call by its name when cavil yield more fully to examination the system will have large addition to the number of its friend our civil service reform may be imperfect in some of its detail it may be misunderstood and opposed it may not always be faithfully apply its design may sometimes miscarry through mistake or willful intent it may sometimes tremble under the assault of its enemy or languish under the misguided zeal of impracticable friend but if the people of this country ever submit to the banishment of its underlying principle from the operation of their government they will abandon the sure guaranty of the safety and success of american institution i invoke for this reform the cheerful and ungrudge support of the congress i renew my recommendation make last year that the salary of the commissioners be make equal to other officer of the government have like duty and responsibility and i hope that such reasonable appropriation may be make as will enable they to increase the usefulness of the cause they have in charge i desire to call the attention of the congress to a plain duty which the government owe to the depositor in the freedman 's savings and trust company this company be charter by the congress for the benefit of the most illiterate and humble of our people and with the intention of encourage in they industry and thrift most of its branch be preside over by officer hold the commission and clothe in the uniform of the united states these and other circumstance reasonably i think lead these simple people to suppose that the invitation to deposit their hard earn saving in this institution imply an undertaking on the part of their government that their money should be safely keep for they when this company fail it be liable in the sum of $ 2,939,925.22 to 61,131 depositor dividend amount in the aggregate to 62 per cent have be declare and the sum call for and pay of such dividend seem to be $ 1,648,181.72 this sum deduct from the entire amount of deposit leave $ 1,291,744.50 still unpaid past experience have show that quite a large part of this sum will not be call for there be asset still on hand amounting to the estimated sum of $ 16,000.i think the remain 38 per cent of such of these deposit as have claimant should be pay by the government upon principle of equity and fairness the report of the commissioner soon to be lay before congress will give more satisfactory detail on this subject the control of the affair of the district of columbia having be place in the hand of purely executive officer while the congress still retain all legislative authority relate to its government it become my duty to make know the most pressing need of the district and recommend their consideration the law of the district appear to be in an uncertain and unsatisfactory condition and their codification or revision be much need during the past year one of the bridge lead from the district to the state of virginia become unfit for use and travel upon it be forbid this lead i to suggest that the improvement of all the bridge cross the potomac and its branch from the city of washington be worthy the attention of congress the commissioners of the district represent that the law regulate the sale of liquor and grant license therefor should be at once amend and that legislation be need to consolidate define and enlarge the scope and power of charitable and penal institution within the district i suggest that the commissioners be clothe with the power to make within fix limitation police regulation i believe this power grant and carefully guard would tend to subserve the good order of the municipality it seem that trouble still exist grow out of the occupation of the street and avenue by certain railroad have their termini in the city it be very important that such law should be enact upon this subject as will secure to the railroad all the facility they require for the transaction of their business and at the same time protect citizen from injury to their person or property the commissioners again complain that the accommodation afford they for the necessary office for district business and for the safe keeping of valuable book and paper be entirely insufficient i recommend that this condition of affair be remedie by the congress and that suitable quarter be furnish for the need of the district government in conclusion i earnestly invoke such wise action on the part of the people 's legislator as will subserve the public good and demonstrate during the remain day of the congress as at present organize its ability and inclination to so meet the people 's need that it shall be gratefully remember by an expectant constituency
to the house of representatives
 i herewith return without my approval house bill no 10457 entitle an act for the relief of dependent parent and honorably discharge soldier and sailor who be now disabled and dependent upon their own labor for support
 this be the first general bill that have be sanction by the congress since the close of the late civil war permit a pension to the soldier and sailor who serve in that war upon the ground of service and present disability alone and in the entire absence of any injury receive by the casualty or incident of such service
 while by almost constant legislation since the close of this war there have be compensation award for every possible injury receive as a result of military service in the union army and while a great number of law pass for that purpose have be administer with great liberality and have be supplement by numerous private act to reach special case there have not until now be an avow departure from the principle thus far adhere to respect union soldier that the bounty of the government in the way of pension be generously bestow when grant to those who in this military service and in the line of military duty have to a great or less extent be disable
 but it be a mistake to suppose that service pension such as be permit by the second section of the bill under consideration be new to our legislation in 1818 thirty five year after the close of the revolutionary war they be grant to the soldier engage in that struggle conditional upon service until the end of the war or for a term not less than nine month and require every beneficiary under the act to be one who be or hereafter by reason of his reduce circumstance in life shall be in need of assistance from his country for support another law of a like character be pass in 1828 require service until the close of the revolutionary war and still another pass in 1832 provide for those person not include in the previous statute but who serve two year at some time during the war and give a proportionate sum to those who have serve not less than six month
 a service pension law be pass for the benefit of the soldier of 1812 in the year 1871 fifty six year after the close of that war which require only sixty days&#39 service and another be pass in 1878 sixty three year after the war require only fourteen days&#39 service
 the service pension bill pass at this session of congress thirty nine year after the close of the mexican war for the benefit of the soldier of that war require either some degree of disability or dependency or that the claimant under its provision should be 62 year of age and in either case that he should have serve sixty day or be actually engage in a battle
 it will be see that the bill of 1818 and the mexican pension bill be thus pass nearer the close of the war in which its beneficiary be engage than the other one thirty five year and the other thirty nine year after the termination of such war embrace person who be quite advanced in age assume to be comparatively few in number and whose circumstance dependence and disability be clearly define and could be quite easily fix
 the other law refer to appear to have be pass at a time so remote from the military service of the person which they embrace that their extreme age alone be deem to supply a presumption of dependency and need
 the number of enlistment in the revolutionary war be state to be 309,791 and in the war of 1812 576,622 but it be estimate that on account of repeat reenlistment the number of individual engage in these war do not exceed one half of the number represent by these figure in the war with mexico the number of enlistment be report to be 112,230 which represent a great proportion of individual engage than the report enlistment in the two previous war
 the number of pension grant under all law to soldier of the revolution be give at 62,069 to the soldier of the war of 1812 and their widow 60,178 and to soldier of the mexican war and their widow up to june 30 1885 7,619 the latter pension be grant to the soldier of a war involve much hardship for disability incur as a result of such service and it be not till within the last month that the few remain survivor be award a service pension
 the war of the rebellion terminate nearly twenty two year ago the number of man furnish for its prosecution be state to be 2,772,408 no corresponding number of statute have ever be pass to cover every kind of injury or disability incur in the military service of any war under these statute 561,571 pension have be grant from the year 1861 to june 30 1886 and more than 2,600 pensioner have be add to the roll by private act pass to meet case many of they of questionable merit which the general law do not cover
 on this 1st day of july 1886 365,763 pensioner of all class be upon the pension roll of whom 305,605 be survivor of the war of the rebellion and their widow and dependent for the year end june 30 1887 $ 75,000,000 have be appropriate for the payment of pension and the amount expend for that purpose from 1861 to july 1 1886 be $ 808,624,811.51
 while annually pay out such a vast sum for pension already grant it be now propose by the bill under consideration to award a service pension to the soldier of all war in which the united states have be engage include of course the war of the rebellion and to pay those entitle to the benefit of the act the sum of $ 12 per month
 so far as it relate to the soldier of the late civil war the bounty it afford they be give thirteen year early than it have be furnish the soldier of any other war and before a large majority of its beneficiary have advance in age beyond the strength and vigor of the prime of life
 it exact only a military or naval service of three month without any requirement of actual engagement with an enemy in battle and without a subjection to any of the actual danger of war
 the pension it award be allow to enlisted man who have not suffer the least injury disability loss or damage of any kind incur in or in any degree referable to their military service include those who never reach the front at all and those discharge from rendezvous at the close of the war if discharge three month after enlistment under the last call of the president for troop in december 1864 11,303 man be furnish who be thus discharge
 the section allow this pension do however require besides a service of three month and an honorable discharge that those seek the benefit of the act shall be such as be now or may hereafter be suffer from mental or physical disability not the result of their own vicious habit or gross carelessness which incapacitate they for the performance of labor in such a degree as to render they unable to earn a support and who be dependent upon their daily labor for support
 it provide far that such person shall upon make proof of the fact be place on the list of invalid pensioner of the united states and be entitle to receive for such total inability to procure their subsistence by daily labor $ 12 per month and such pension shall commence from the date of the filing of the application in the pension office upon proof that the disability then exist and continue during the existence of the same in the degree herein provide provide that person who be now receive pension under exist law or whose claim be pende in the pension office may by application to the commissioner of pensions in such form as he may prescribe receive the benefit of this act
 it be manifestly of the utmost importance that statute which like pension law should be liberally administer as measure of benevolence in behalf of worthy beneficiary should admit of no uncertainty as to their general object and consequence
 upon a careful consideration of the language of the section of this bill above give it seem to i to be so uncertain and liable to such conflict construction and to be subject to such unjust and mischievous application as to alone furnish sufficient ground for disapprove the propose legislation
 person seek to obtain the pension provide by this section must be now or hereafter--
 1 suffer from mental or physical disability
 2 such disability must not be the result of their own vicious habit or gross carelessness
 3 such disability must be such as incapacitate they for the performance of labor in such a degree as to render they unable to earn a support
 4 they must be dependent upon their daily labor for support
 5 upon proof of these condition they shall be place on the list of invalid pensioner of the united states and be entitle to receive for such total inability to procure their subsistence by daily labor $ 12 per month
 it be not probable that the word last quote such total inability to procure their subsistence by daily labor at all qualify the condition prescribe in the precede language of the section the total inability speak of must be such inability that is the inability already describe and constitute by the condition already detail in the previous part of the section
 it thus become important to consider the meaning and the scope of these last mention condition
 the mental and physical disability speak of have a distinct meaning in the practice of the pension bureau and include every impairment of bodily or mental strength and vigor for such disability there be now pay 131 different rate of pension range from $ 1 to $ 100 per month
 this disability must not be the result of the applicant&#39; vicious habit or gross carelessness practically this provision be not important the attempt of the government to escape the payment of a pension on such a plea would of course in a very large majority of instance and regardless of the merit of the case prove a failure there would be that strange but nearly universal willingness to help the individual as between he and the public treasury which go very far to insure a state of proof in favor of the claimant
 the disability of applicant must be such as to incapacitate they for the performance of labor in such a degree as to render they unable to earn a support
 it will be observe that there be no limitation or definition of the incapacitating injury or ailment itself it need only be such a degree of disability from any cause as render the claimant unable to earn a support by labor it seem to i that the support here mention as one which can not be earn be a complete and entire support with no diminution on account of the least impairment of physical or mental condition if it have be intend to embrace only those who by disease or injury be totally unable to labor it would have be very easy to express that idea instead of recognize as be do a degree of such inability
 what be a support who be to determine whether a man earn it or have it or have it not be the government to enter the home of claimant for pension and after an examination of their surrounding and circumstance settle those question shall the government say to one man that his manner of subsistence by his earning be a support and to another that the thing his earning furnish be not a support any attempt however honest to administer this law in such a manner would necessarily produce more unfairness and unjust discrimination and give more scope for partisan partiality and would result in more perversion of the government&#39;s benevolent intention than the execution of any statute ought to permit
 if in the effort to carry out the propose law the degree of disability as relate to earning be consider for the purpose of discover if in any way it curtail the support which the applicant if entirely sound would earn and to which he be entitle we enter the broad field long occupy by the pension bureau and we recognize as the only difference between the propose legislation and previous law pass for the benefit of the survive soldier of the civil war the incurrence in one case of disability in military service and in the other disability exist but in no way connect with or result from such service
 it must be bear in mind that in no case be there any grading of this propose pension under the operation of the rule first suggest if there be a lack in any degree great or small of the ability to earn such a support as the government determine the claimant should have and by the application of the rule secondly suggest if there be a reduction in any degree of the support which he might earn if sound he be entitle to a pension of $ 12
 in the latter case and under the proviso of the propose bill permit person now receive pension to be admit to the benefit of the act i do not see how those now on the pension roll for disability incur in the service and which diminish their earning capacity can be deny the pension provide in this bill
 of course none will apply who be now receive $ 12 or more per month but on the 30th day of june 1886 there be on the pension roll 202,621 person who be receive fifty eight different rate of pension from $ 1 to $ 11.75 per month of these 28,142 be receive $ 2 per month 63,116 $ 4 per month 37,254 $ 6 per month and 50,274 whose disability be rate as total $ 8 per month
 as to the meaning of the section of the bill under consideration there appear to have be quite a difference of opinion among its advocate in the congress the chairman of the committee on pensions in the house of representatives who report the bill declare that there be in it no provision for pension anyone who have a less disability than a total inability to labor and that it be a charity measure the chairman of the committee on pensions in the senate have charge of the bill in that body dissent from the construction of the bill announce in the house of representatives and declare that it not only embrace all soldier totally disable but in his judgment all who be disabled to any considerable extent and such a construction be substantially give to the bill by another distinguished senator who as a former secretary of the interior have impose upon he the duty of execute pension law and determine their intent and meaning
 another condition require of claimant under this act be that they shall be dependent upon their daily labor for support
 this language which may be say to assume that there exist within the reach of the person mention labor or the ability in some degree to work be more aptly use in a statute describe those not wholly deprived of this ability than in one which deal with those utterly unable to work
 i be of the opinion that it may fairly be contend that under the provision of this section any soldier whose faculty of mind or body have become impair by accident disease or age irrespective of his service in the army as a cause and who by his labor only be leave incapable of gain the fair support he might with unimpaired power have provide for himself and who be not so well endow with this world&#39;s good as to live without work may claim to participate in its bounty that it be not require that he should be without property but only that labor should be necessary to his support in some degree nor be it require that he should be now receive support from other
 believe this to be the proper interpretation of the bill i can not but remember that the soldier of our civil war in their pay and bounty receive such compensation for military service as have never be receive by soldier before since mankind first go to war that never before on behalf of any soldiery have so many and such generous law be pass to relieve against the incident of war that statute have be pass give they a preference in all public employment that the really needy and homeless union soldier of the rebellion have be to a large extent provide for at soldiers&#39 home institute and support by the government where they be maintain together free from the sense of degradation which attach to the usual support of charity and that never before in the history of the country have it be propose to render government aid toward the support of any of its soldier base alone upon a military service so recent and where age and circumstance appear so little to demand such aid
 hitherto such relief have be grant to survive soldier few in number venerable in age after a long lapse of time since their military service and as a parting benefaction tender by a grateful people
 i can not believe that the vast peaceful army of union soldier who having contentedly resume their place in the ordinary avocation of life cherish as sacred the memory of patriotic service or who having be disable by the casualty of war justly regard the present pension roll on which appear their name as a roll of honor desire at this time and in the present exigency to be confound with those who through such a bill as this be willing to be object of simple charity and to gain a place upon the pension roll through alleged dependence
 recent personal observation and experience constrain i to refer to another result which will inevitably follow the passage of this bill it be sad but nevertheless true that already in the matter of procure pension there exist a widespread disregard of truth and good faith stimulate by those who as agent undertake to establish claim for pension heedlessly enter upon by the expectant beneficiary and encourage or at least not condemn by those unwilling to obstruct a neighbor&#39;s plan
 in the execution of this propose law under any interpretation a wide field of inquiry would be open for the establishment of fact largely within the knowledge of the claimant alone and there can be no doubt that the race after the pension offer by this bill would not only stimulate weakness and pretend incapacity for labor but put a further premium on dishonesty and mendacity
 the effect of new invitation to apply for pension or of new advantage add to cause for pension already exist be sometimes startling
 thus in march 1879 large arrearage of pension be allow to be add to all claim file prior to july 1 1880 for the year from july 1 1879 to july 1 1880 there be file 110,673 claim though in the year immediately previous there be but 36,832 file and in the year follow but 18,455
 while cost should not be set against a patriotic duty or the recognition of a right still when a measure propose be base upon generosity or motive of charity it be not amiss to meditate somewhat upon the expense which it involve experience have demonstrate i believe that all estimate concern the probable future cost of a pension list be uncertain and unreliable and always fall far below actual realization
 the chairman of the house committee on pensions calculate that the number of pensioner under this bill would be 33,105 and the increase cost $ 4,767,120 this be upon the theory that only those who be entirely unable to work would be its beneficiary such be the principle of the revolutionary pension law of 1818 much more clearly state it seem to i than in this bill when the law of 1818 be upon its passage in congress the number of pensioner to be benefit thereby be think to be 374 but the number of applicant under the act be 22,297 and the number of pension actually allow 20,485 cost it be report for the first year $ 1,847,900 instead of $ 40,000 the estimate expense for that period
 a law be pass in 1853 for the benefit of the survive widow of revolutionary soldier who be marry after january 1 1800 it be estimate that they number 300 at the time of the passage of the act but the number of pension allow be 3,742 and the amount pay for such pension during the first year of the operation of the act be $ 180,000 instead of $ 24,000 as have be estimate
 i have make no search for other illustration and the above be at hand be give as tend to show that estimate can not be rely upon in such case
 if none should be pension under this bill except those utterly unable to work i be satisfied that the cost state in the estimate refer to would be many time multiply and with a constant increase from year to year and if those partially unable to earn their support should be admit to the privilege of this bill the probable increase of expense would be almost appalling
 i think it may be say that at the close of the war of the rebellion every northern state and a great majority of northern county and city be burden with taxation on account of the large bounty pay our soldier and the bond debt thereby create still constitute a large item in the account of the taxgatherer against the people federal taxation no less bear by the people than that directly levy upon their property be still maintain at the rate make necessary by the exigency of war if this bill should become a law with its tremendous addition to our pension obligation i be thoroughly convinced that further effort to reduce the federal revenue and restore some part of it to our people will and perhaps should be seriously question
 it have constantly be a cause of pride and congratulation to the american citizen that his country be not put to the charge of maintain a large stand army in time of peace yet we be now live under a war tax which have be tolerate in peaceful time to meet the obligation incur in war but for year past in all part of the country the demand for the reduction of the burden of taxation upon our labor and production have increase in volume and urgency
 i be not willing to approve a measure present the objection to which this bill be subject and which moreover will have the effect of disappoint the expectation of the people and their desire and hope for relief from war taxation in time of peace
 in my last annual message the follow language be use
 every patriotic heart respond to a tender consideration for those who having serve their country long and well be reduce to destitution and dependence not as an incident of their service but with advance age or through sickness or misfortune we be all tempt by the contemplation of such a condition to supply relief and be often impatient of the limitation of public duty yield to no one in the desire to indulge this feeling of consideration i can not rid myself of the conviction that if these ex soldier be to be relieve they and their cause be entitle to the benefit of an enactment under which relief may be claim as a right and that such relief should be grant under the sanction of law not in evasion of it nor should such worthy object of care all equally entitle be remit to the unequal operation of sympathy or the tender mercy of social and political influence with their unjust discrimination
 i do not think that the object the condition and the limitation thus suggest be contain in the bill under consideration
 i adhere to the sentiment thus heretofore express but the evil threaten by this bill be in my opinion such that charge with a great responsibility in behalf of the people i can not do otherwise than to bring to the consideration of this measure my good effort of thought and judgment and perform my constitutional duty in relation thereto regardless of all consequence except such as appear to i to be relate to the good and high interest of the country

to the house of representatives
 i return without my approval house bill no 10203 entitle an act to enable the commissioner of agriculture to make a special distribution of seed in the drought stricken county of texas and make an appropriation therefor
 it be represent that a long continue and extensive drought have exist in certain portion of the state of texas result in a failure of crop and consequent distress and destitution
 though there have be some difference in statement concern the extent of the people&#39; need in the locality thus affect there seem to be no doubt that there have exist a condition call for relief and i be willing to believe that notwithstanding the aid already furnish a donation of seed grain to the farmer locate in this region to enable they to put in new crop would serve to avert a continuance or return of an unfortunate blight
 and yet i feel obliged to withhold my approval of the plan as propose by this bill to indulge a benevolent and charitable sentiment through the appropriation of public fund for that purpose
 i can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the constitution and i do not believe that the power and duty of the general government ought to be extend to the relief of individual suffering which be in no manner properly relate to the public service or benefit a prevalent tendency to disregard the limited mission of this power and duty should i think be steadfastly resist to the end that the lesson should be constantly enforce that though the people support the government the government should not support the people
 the friendliness and charity of our countryman can always be rely upon to relieve their fellow citizen in misfortune this have be repeatedly and quite lately demonstrate federal aid in such case encourage the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weaken the sturdiness of our national character while it prevent the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthen the bond of a common brotherhood
 it be within my personal knowledge that individual aid have to some extent already be extend to the sufferer mention in this bill the failure of the propose appropriation of $ 10,000 additional to meet their remain want will not necessarily result in continue distress if the emergency be fully make known to the people of the country
 it be here suggest that the commissioner of agriculture be annually direct to expend a large sum of money for the purchase propagation and distribution of seed and other thing of this description two third of which be upon the request of senators representatives and delegates in congress supply to they for distribution among their constituent
 the appropriation of the current year for this purpose be $ 100,000 and it will probably be no less in the appropriation for the ensue year i understand that a large quantity of grain be furnish for such distribution and it be suppose that this free apportionment among their neighbor be a privilege which may be waive by our senators and representatives
 if sufficient of they should request the commissioner of agriculture to send their share of the grain thus allow they to the suffer farmer of texas they might be enable to sow their crop the constituent for whom in theory this grain be intend could well bear the temporary deprivation and the donor would experience the satisfaction attend deed of charity

to the congress of the united states you be confront at the threshold of your legislative duty with a condition of the national finance which imperatively demand immediate and careful consideration the amount of money annually exact through the operation of present law from the industry and necessity of the people largely exceed the sum necessary to meet the expense of the government when we consider that the theory of our institution guarantee to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruit of his industry and enterprise with only such deduction as may be his share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the government which protect he it be plain that the exaction of more than this be indefensible extortion and a culpable betrayal of american fairness and justice this wrong inflict upon those who bear the burden of national taxation like other wrong multiplie a brood of evil consequence the public treasury which should only exist as a conduit convey the people 's tribute to its legitimate object of expenditure become a hoarding place for money needlessly withdraw from trade and the people 's use thus cripple our national energy suspend our country 's development prevent investment in productive enterprise threaten financial disturbance and invite scheme of public plunder this condition of our treasury be not altogether new and it have more than once of late be submit to the people 's representative in the congress who alone can apply a remedy and yet the situation still continue with aggravate incident more than ever presage financial convulsion and widespread disaster it will not do to neglect this situation because its danger be not now palpably imminent and apparent they exist none the less certainly and await the unforeseen and unexpected occasion when suddenly they will be precipitate upon we on the 30th day of june 1885 the excess of revenue over public expenditure after comply with the annual requirement of the sink fund act be $ 17,859,735.84 during the year end june 30 1886 such excess amount to $ 49,405,545.20 and during the year end june 30 1887 it reach the sum of $ 55,567,849.54.the annual contribution to the sink fund during the three year above specify amount in the aggregate to $ 138,058,320.94 and deduct from the surplus as state be make by call in for that purpose outstanding 3 per cent bond of the government during the six month prior to june 30 1887 the surplus revenue have grow so large by repeat accumulation and it be fear the withdrawal of this great sum of money need by the people would so affect the business of the country that the sum of $ 79,864,100 of such surplus be apply to the payment of the principal and interest of the 3 per cent bond still outstanding and which be then payable at the option of the government the precarious condition of financial affair among the people still need relief immediately after the 30th day of june 1887 the remainder of the 3 per cent bond then outstanding amount with principal and interest to the sum of $ 18,877,500 be call in and apply to the sink fund contribution for the current fiscal year notwithstanding these operation of the treasury department representation of distress in business circle not only continue but increase and absolute peril seem at hand in these circumstance the contribution to the sink fund for the current fiscal year be at once complete by the expenditure of $ 27,684,283.55 in the purchase of government bond not yet due bear 4 and 41/2 per cent interest the premium pay thereon average about 24 per cent for the former and 8 per cent for the latter in addition to this the interest accrue during the current year upon the outstanding bond indebtedness of the government be to some extent anticipate and bank select as depository of public money be permit to somewhat increase their deposit while the expedient thus employ to release to the people the money lie idle in the treasury serve to avert immediate danger our surplus revenue have continue to accumulate the excess for the present year amount on the 1st day of december to $ 55,258,701.19 and estimate to reach the sum of $ 113,000,000 on the 30th of june next at which date it be expect that this sum add to prior accumulation will swell the surplus in the treasury to $ 140,000,000.there seem to be no assurance that with such a withdrawal from use of the people 's circulate medium our business community may not in the near future be subject to the same distress which be quite lately produce from the same cause and while the function of our national treasury should be few and simple and while its good condition would be reach i believe by its entire disconnection with private business interest yet when by a perversion of its purpose it idly hold money uselessly subtract from the channel of trade there seem to be reason for the claim that some legitimate mean should be devise by the government to restore in an emergency without waste or extravagance such money to its place among the people if such an emergency arise there now exist no clear and undoubted executive power of relief heretofore the redemption of 3 per cent bond which be payable at the option of the government have afford a mean for the disbursement of the excess of our revenue but these bond have all be retire and there be no bond outstanding the payment of which we have a right to insist upon the contribution to the sink fund which furnish the occasion for expenditure in the purchase of bond have be already make for the current year so that there be no outlet in that direction in the present state of legislation the only pretense of any exist executive power to restore at this time any part of our surplus revenue to the people by its expenditure consist in the supposition that the secretary of the treasury may enter the market and purchase the bond of the government not yet due at a rate of premium to be agree upon the only provision of law from which such a power could be derive be find in an appropriation bill pass a number of year ago and it be subject to the suspicion that it be intend as temporary and limited in its application instead of confer a continue discretion and authority no condition ought to exist which would justify the grant of power to a single official upon his judgment of its necessity to withhold from or release to the business of the people in an unusual manner money hold in the treasury and thus affect at his will the financial situation of the country and if it be deem wise to lodge in the secretary of the treasury the authority in the present juncture to purchase bond it should be plainly vest and provide as far as possible with such check and limitation as will define this official 's right and discretion and at the same time relieve he from undue responsibility in consider the question of purchase bond as a means of restore to circulation the surplus money accumulate in the treasury it should be bear in mind that premium must of course be pay upon such purchase that there may be a large part of these bond hold as investment which can not be purchase at any price and that combination among holder who be willing to sell may unreasonably enhance the cost of such bond to the government it have be suggest that the present bond debt might be refund at a less rate of interest and the difference between the old and new security pay in cash thus find use for the surplus in the treasury the success of this plan it be apparent must depend upon the volition of the holder of the present bond and it be not entirely certain that the inducement which must be offer they would result in more financial benefit to the government than the purchase of bond while the latter proposition would reduce the principal of the debt by actual payment instead of extend it the proposition to deposit the money hold by the government in bank throughout the country for use by the people be it seem to i exceedingly objectionable in principle as establish too close a relationship between the operation of the government treasury and the business of the country and too extensive a commingling of their money thus foster an unnatural reliance in private business upon public fund if this scheme should be adopt it should only be do as a temporary expedient to meet an urgent necessity legislative and executive effort should generally be in the opposite direction and should have a tendency to divorce as much and as fast as can be safely do the treasury department from private enterprise of course it be not expect that unnecessary and extravagant appropriation will be make for the purpose of avoid the accumulation of an excess of revenue such expenditure besides the demoralization of all just conception of public duty which it entail stimulate a habit of reckless improvidence not in the least consistent with the mission of our people or the high and beneficent purpose of our government i have deem it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my countryman as well as to the attention of their representative charge with the responsibility of legislative relief the gravity of our financial situation the failure of the congress heretofore to provide against the danger which it be quite evident the very nature of the difficulty must necessarily produce cause a condition of financial distress and apprehension since your last adjournment which tax to the utmost all the authority and expedient within executive control and these appear now to be exhaust if disaster result from the continued inaction of congress the responsibility must rest where it belong though the situation thus far consider be fraught with danger which should be fully realize and though it present feature of wrong to the people as well as peril to the country it be but a result grow out of a perfectly palpable and apparent cause constantly reproduce the same alarming circumstance a congested national treasury and a deplete monetary condition in the business of the country it need hardly be state that while the present situation demand a remedy we can only be save from a like predicament in the future by the removal of its cause our scheme of taxation by mean of which this needless surplus be take from the people and put into the public treasury consist of a tariff or duty levy upon importation from abroad and internal revenue taxis levy upon the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt liquor it must be concede that none of the thing subject to internal revenue taxation be strictly speak necessary there appear to be no just complaint of this taxation by the consumer of these article and there seem to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of the people but our present tariff law the vicious inequitable and illogical source of unnecessary taxation ought to be at once revise and amend these law as their primary and plain effect raise the price to consumer of all article import and subject to duty by precisely the sum pay for such duty thus the amount of the duty measure the tax pay by those who purchase for use these import article many of these thing however be raise or manufacture in our own country and the duty now levy upon foreign good and product be call protection to these home manufacture because they render it possible for those of our people who be manufacturer to make these tax article and sell they for a price equal to that demand for the import good that have pay custom duty so it happen that while comparatively a few use the import article million of our people who never use and never see any of the foreign product purchase and use thing of the same kind make in this country and pay therefor nearly or quite the same enhance price which the duty add to the import article those who buy import pay the duty charge thereon into the public treasury but the great majority of our citizen who buy domestic article of the same class pay a sum at least approximately equal to this duty to the home manufacturer this reference to the operation of our tariff law be not make by way of instruction but in order that we may be constantly remind of the manner in which they impose a burden upon those who consume domestic product as well as those who consume import article and thus create a tax upon all our people it be not propose to entirely relieve the country of this taxation it must be extensively continue as the source of the government 's income and in a readjustment of our tariff the interest of american labor engage in manufacture should be carefully consider as well as the preservation of our manufacturer it may be call protection or by any other name but relief from the hardship and danger of our present tariff law should be devise with especial precaution against imperil the existence of our manufacturing interest but this existence should not mean a condition which without regard to the public welfare or a national exigency must always insure the realization of immense profit instead of moderately profitable return as the volume and diversity of our national activity increase new recruit be add to those who desire a continuation of the advantage which they conceive the present system of tariff taxation directly afford they so stubbornly have all effort to reform the present condition be resist by those of our fellow citizen thus engage that they can hardly complain of the suspicion entertain to a certain extent that there exist an organize combination all along the line to maintain their advantage we be in the midst of centennial celebration and with become pride we rejoice in american skill and ingenuity in american energy and enterprise and in the wonderful natural advantage and resource develop by a century 's national growth yet when an attempt be make to justify a scheme which permit a tax to be lay upon every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturer quite beyond a reasonable demand for governmental regard it suit the purpose of advocacy to call our manufacture infant industry still need the high and great degree of favor and foster care that can be wring from federal legislation it be also say that the increase in the price of domestic manufacture result from the present tariff be necessary in order that high wage may be pay to our workingman employ in manufactory than be pay for what be call the pauper labor of europe all will acknowledge the force of an argument which involve the welfare and liberal compensation of our labor people our labor be honorable in the eye of every american citizen and as it lie at the foundation of our development and progress it be entitle without affectation or hypocrisy to the utmost regard the standard of our laborer life should not be measure by that of any other country less favor and they be entitle to their full share of all our advantage by the last census it be make to appear that of the 17,392,099 of our population engage in all kind of industry 7,670,493 be employ in agriculture 4,074,238 in professional and personal service 2,934,876 of whom be domestic servant and laborer while 1,810,256 be employ in trade and transportation and 3,837,112 be class as employ in manufacturing and mining for present purpose however the last number give should be considerably reduce without attempt to enumerate all it will be concede that there should be deduct from those which it include 375,143 carpenter and joiner 285,401 milliner dressmaker and seamstress 172,726 blacksmith 133,756 tailor and tailoresse 102,473 mason 76,241 butcher 41,309 baker 22,083 plasterer and 4,891 engage in manufacture agricultural implement amount in the aggregate to 1,214,023 leave 2,623,089 person employ in such manufacturing industry as be claim to be benefit by a high tariff to these the appeal be make to save their employment and maintain their wage by resist a change there should be no disposition to answer such suggestion by the allegation that they be in a minority among those who labor and therefore should forego an advantage in the interest of low price for the majority their compensation as it may be affect by the operation of tariff law should at all time be scrupulously keep in view and yet with slight reflection they will not overlook the fact that they be consumer with the rest that they too have their own want and those of their family to supply from their earning and that the price of the necessary of life as well as the amount of their wage will regulate the measure of their welfare and comfort but the reduction of taxation demand should be so measure as not to necessitate or justify either the loss of employment by the workingman or the lessening of his wage and the profit still remain to the manufacturer after a necessary readjustment should furnish no excuse for the sacrifice of the interest of his employee either in their opportunity to work or in the diminution of their compensation nor can the worker in manufacture fail to understand that while a high tariff be claim to be necessary to allow the payment of remunerative wage it certainly result in a very large increase in the price of nearly all sort of manufacture which in almost countless form he need for the use of himself and his family he receive at the desk of his employer his wage and perhaps before he reach his home be oblige in a purchase for family use of an article which embrace his own labor to return in the payment of the increase in price which the tariff permit the hard earn compensation of many day of toil the farmer and the agriculturist who manufacture nothing but who pay the increase price which the tariff impose upon every agricultural implement upon all he wear and upon all he use and own except the increase of his flock and herd and such thing as his husbandry produce from the soil be invite to aid in maintain the present situation and he be tell that a high duty on import wool be necessary for the benefit of those who have sheep to shear in order that the price of their wool may be increase they of course be not remind that the farmer who have no sheep be by this scheme oblige in his purchase of clothing and woolen good to pay a tribute to his fellow farmer as well as to the manufacturer and merchant nor be any mention make of the fact that the sheep owner themselves and their household must wear clothing and use other article manufacture from the wool they sell at tariff price and thus as consumer must return their share of this increase price to the tradesman i think it may be fairly assume that a large proportion of the sheep own by the farmer throughout the country be find in small flock number from twenty five to fifty the duty on the grade of import wool which these sheep yield be 10 cent each pound if of the value of 30 cent or less and 12 cent if of the value of more than 30 cent if the liberal estimate of 6 pound be allow for each fleece the duty thereon would be 60 or 72 cent and this may be take as the utmost enhancement of its price to the farmer by reason of this duty eighteen dollar would thus represent the increase price of the wool from twenty five sheep and $ 36 that from the wool of fifty sheep and at present value this addition would amount to about one third of its price if upon its sale the farmer receive this or a less tariff profit the wool leave his hand charge with precisely that sum which in all its change will adhere to it until it reach the consumer when manufacture into cloth and other good and material for use its cost be not only increase to the extent of the farmer 's tariff profit but a further sum have be add for the benefit of the manufacturer under the operation of other tariff law in the meantime the day arrive when the farmer find it necessary to purchase woolen good and material to clothe himself and family for the winter when he face the tradesman for that purpose he discover that he be oblige not only to return in the way of increase price his tariff profit on the wool he sell and which then perhaps lie before he in manufactured form but that he must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further increase in cost cause by a tariff duty on the manufacture thus in the end he be arouse to the fact that he have pay upon a moderate purchase as a result of the tariff scheme which when he sell his wool seem so profitable an increase in price more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he receive upon the wool he produce and sell when the number of farmer engage in wool raising be compare with all the farmer in the country and the small proportion they bear to our population be consider when it be make apparent that in the case of a large part of those who own sheep the benefit of the present tariff on wool be illusory and above all when it must be concede that the increase of the cost of living cause by such tariff become a burden upon those with moderate mean and the poor the employed and unemployed the sick and well and the young and old and that it constitute a tax which with relentless grasp be fasten upon the clothing of every man woman and child in the land reason be suggest why the removal or reduction of this duty should be include in a revision of our tariff law in speaking of the increase cost to the consumer of our home manufacture result from a duty lay upon import article of the same description the fact be not ever look that competition among our domestic producer sometimes have the effect of keep the price of their product below the high limit allow by such duty but it be notorious that this competition be too often strangle by combination quite prevalent at this time and frequently call trust which have for their object the regulation of the supply and price of commodity make and sell by member of the combination the people can hardly hope for any consideration in the operation of these selfish scheme if however in the absence of such combination a healthy and free competition reduce the price of any particular dutiable article of home production below the limit which it might otherwise reach under our tariff law and if with such reduce price its manufacture continue to thrive it be entirely evident that one thing have be discover which should be carefully scrutinize in an effort to reduce taxation the necessity of combination to maintain the price of any commodity to the tariff point furnish proof that someone be willing to accept low price for such commodity and that such price be remunerative and low price produce by competition prove the same thing thus where either of these condition exist a case would seem to be present for an easy reduction of taxation the consideration which have be present touch our tariff law be intend only to enforce an earnest recommendation that the surplus revenue of the government be prevent by the reduction of our custom duty and at the same time to emphasize a suggestion that in accomplish this purpose we may discharge a double duty to our people by grant to they a measure of relief from tariff taxation in quarter where it be most need and from source where it can be most fairly and justly accord nor can the presentation make of such consideration be with any degree of fairness regard as evidence of unfriendliness toward our manufacturing interest or of any lack of appreciation of their value and importance these interest constitute a lead and most substantial element of our national greatness and furnish the proud proof of our country 's progress but if in the emergency that press upon we our manufacturer be ask to surrender something for the public good and to avert disaster their patriotism as well as a grateful recognition of advantage already afford should lead they to willing cooperation no demand be make that they shall forego all the benefit of governmental regard but they can not fail to be admonish of their duty as well as their enlighten self interest and safety when they be remind of the fact that financial panic and collapse to which the present condition tend afford no great shelter or protection to our manufacture than to other important enterprise opportunity for safe careful and deliberate reform be now offer and none of we should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated people heedless of those who have resist timely and reasonable relief may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification of their wrong the difficulty attend a wise and fair revision of our tariff law be not underestimate it will require on the part of the congress great labor and care and especially a broad and national contemplation of the subject and a patriotic disregard of such local and selfish claim as be unreasonable and reckless of the welfare of the entire country under our present law more than 4,000 article be subject to duty many of these do not in any way compete with our own manufacture and many be hardly worth attention as subject of revenue a considerable reduction can be make in the aggregate by add they to the free list the taxation of luxury present no feature of hardship but the necessary of life use and consume by all the people the duty upon which add to the cost of live in every home should be greatly cheapen the radical reduction of the duty impose upon raw material use in manufacture or its free importation be of course an important factor in any effort to reduce the price of these necessary it would not only relieve they from the increase cost cause by the tariff on such material but the manufactured product be thus cheapen that part of the tariff now lay upon such product as a compensation to our manufacturer for the present price of raw material could be accordingly modify such reduction or free importation would serve besides to largely reduce the revenue it be not apparent how such a change can have any injurious effect upon our manufacturer on the contrary it would appear to give they a well chance in foreign market with the manufacturer of other country who cheapen their ware by free material thus our people might have the opportunity of extend their sale beyond the limit of home consumption save they from the depression interruption in business and loss cause by a glut domestic market and afford their employee more certain and steady labor with its result quiet and contentment the question thus imperatively present for solution should be approach in a spirit high than partisanship and consider in the light of that regard for patriotic duty which should characterize the action of those intrust with the weal of a confide people but the obligation to declare party policy and principle be not want to urge prompt and effective action both of the great political party now represent in the government have by repeat and authoritative declaration condemn the condition of our law which permit the collection from the people of unnecessary revenue and have in the most solemn manner promise its correction and neither as citizen nor partisan be our countryman in a mood to condone the deliberate violation of these pledge our progress toward a wise conclusion will not be improve by dwell upon the theory of protection and free trade this savor too much of bandy epithet it be a condition which confront we not a theory relief from this condition may involve a slight reduction of the advantage which we award our home production but the entire withdrawal of such advantage should not be contemplate the question of free trade be absolutely irrelevant and the persistent claim make in certain quarter that all the effort to relieve the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation be scheme of so call free trader be mischievous and far removed from any consideration for the public good the simple and plain duty which we owe the people be to reduce taxation to the necessary expense of an economical operation of the government and to restore to the business of the country the money which we hold in the treasury through the perversion of governmental power these thing can and should be do with safety to all our industry without danger to the opportunity for remunerative labor which our workingman need and with benefit to they and all our people by cheapen their mean of subsistence and increase the measure of their comfort the constitution provide that the president shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union it have be the custom of the executive in compliance with this provision to annually exhibit to the congress at the opening of its session the general condition of the country and to detail with some particularity the operation of the different executive departments it would be especially agreeable to follow this course at the present time and to call attention to the valuable accomplishment of these departments during the last fiscal year but i be so much impressed with the paramount importance of the subject to which this communication have thus far be devoted that i shall forego the addition of any other topic and only urge upon your immediate consideration the state of the union as show in the present condition of our treasury and our general fiscal situation upon which every element of our safety and prosperity depend the report of the head of departments which will be submit contain full and explicit information touch the transaction of the business intrust to they and such recommendation relate to legislation in the public interest as they deem advisable i ask for these report and recommendation the deliberate examination and action of the legislative branch of the government there be other subject not embrace in the departmental report demand legislative consideration and which i should be glad to submit some of they however have be earnestly present in previous message and as to they i beg leave to repeat prior recommendation as the law make no provision for any report from the department of state a brief history of the transaction of that important department together with other matter which it may hereafter be deem essential to commend to the attention of the congress may furnish the occasion for a future communication

 its object be to more effectually accomplish by legislation the exclusion from this country of chinese laborer
 the experiment of blend the social habit and mutual race idiosyncrasy of the chinese labor class with those of the great body of the people of the united states have be prove by the experience of twenty year and ever since the burlingame treaty of 1868 to be in every sense unwise impolitic and injurious to both nation with the lapse of time the necessity for its abandonment have grow in force until those having in charge the government of the respective country have resolve to modify and sufficiently abrogate all those feature of prior conventional arrangement which permit the coming of chinese laborer to the united states
 in modification of prior convention the treaty of november 17 1880 be conclude whereby in the first article thereof it be agree that the united states should at will regulate limit or suspend the coining of chinese laborer to the united states but not absolutely prohibit it and under this article an act of congress approve on may 6 1882 see 22 u. s. statutes at large p. 58 and amend july 5 1884 23 u. s. statutes at large p. 115 suspend for ten year the coming of chinese laborer to the united states and regulate the going and come of such chinese laborer as be at that time in the united states
 it be however soon make evident that the mercenary greed of the party who be trade in the labor of this class of the chinese population be prove too strong for the just execution of the law and that the virtual defeat of the object and intent of both law and treaty be be fraudulently accomplish by false pretense and perjury contrary to the express will of both government
 to such an extent have the successful violation of the treaty and the law enact for its execution progress that the court in the pacific states have be for some time past overwhelm by the examination of case of chinese laborer who be charge with having enter our port under fraudulent certificate of return or seek to establish by perjury the claim of prior residence
 such demonstration of the inoperative and inefficient condition of the treaty and law have produce deep seat and increase discontent among the people of the united states and especially with those resident on the pacific coast this have induce i to omit no effort to find an effectual remedy for the evil complain of and to answer the earnest popular demand for the absolute exclusion of chinese laborer have object and purpose unlike our own and wholly disconnect with american citizenship
 aid by the presence in this country of able and intelligent diplomatic and consular officer of the chinese government and the representation make from time to time by our minister in china under the instruction of the department of state the actual condition of public sentiment and the status of affair in the united states have be fully make known to the government of china
 the necessity for remedy have be fully appreciate by that government and in august 1886 our minister at peking receive from the chinese foreign office a communication announce that china of her own accord propose to establish a system of strict and absolute prohibition of her laborer under heavy penalty from come to the united states and likewise to prohibit the return to the united states of any chinese laborer who have at any time go back to china in order in the word of the communication that the chinese laborer may gradually be reduce in number and cause of danger avert and life preserve
 this view of the chinese government so completely in harmony with that of the united states be by my direction speedily formulate in a treaty draft between the two nation embody the proposition so present by the chinese foreign office
 the deliberation frequent oral discussion and correspondence on the general question that ensue have be fully communicate by i to the senate at the present session and as contain in senate executive document o part 1 and 2 and in senate executive document no 272 may be properly refer to as contain a complete history of the transaction
 it be thus easy to learn how the joint desire and unequivocal mutual understanding of the two government be bring into articulate form in the treaty which after a mutual exhibition of plenary power from the respective government be sign and conclude by the plenipotentiary of the united states and china at this capital on march 12 last
 be submit for the advice and consent of the senate its confirmation on the 7th day of may last be accompany by two amendment which that body ingraft upon it
 on the 12th day of the same month the chinese minister who be the plenipotentiary of his government in the negotiation and the conclusion of the treaty in a note to the secretary of state give his approval to these amendment as they do not alter the term of the treaty and the amendment be at once telegraph to china whither the original treaty have previously be send immediately after its signature on march 12
 on the 13th day of last month i approve senate bill no 3304 to prohibit the coming of chinese laborer to the united states this bill be intend to supplement the treaty and be approve in the confident anticipation of an early exchange of ratification of the treaty and its amendment and the proclamation of the same upon which event the legislation so approve be by its term to take effect
 no information of any definite action upon the treaty by the chinese government be receive until the 21st ultimo the day the bill which i have just approve be present to i when a telegram from our minister at peking to the secretary of state announce the refusal of the chinese government to exchange ratification of the treaty unless further discussion should be have with a view to shorten the period stipulate in the treaty for the exclusion of chinese laborer and to change the condition agree on which should entitle any chinese laborer who might go back to china to return again to the united states
 by a note from the charge&#39 d&#39;affaire ad interim of china to the secretary of state receive on the evening of the 25th ultimo a copy of which be herewith transmit together with the reply thereto a third amendment be propose whereby the certificate under which any depart chinese laborer allege the possession of property in the united states would be enable to return to this country should be grant by the chinese consul instead of the united states collector as have be provide in the treaty
 the obvious and necessary effect of this last proposition would be practically to place the execution of the treaty beyond the control of the united states
 article i of the treaty propose to be so materially altered have in the course of the negotiation be settle in acquiescence with the request of the chinese plenipotentiary and to his express satisfaction
 in 1886 as appear in the document heretofore refer to the chinese foreign office have formally propose to our minister strict exclusion of chinese laborer from the united states without limitation and have otherwise and more definitely state that no term whatever for exclusion be necessary for the reason that china would of itself take step to prevent its laborer from come to the united states
 in the course of the negotiation that follow suggestion from the same quarter lead to the insertion in behalf of the united states of a term of thirty year and this term upon the representation of the chinese plenipotentiary be reduce to twenty year and finally so agree upon
 article ii be wholly of chinese origination and to that alone owe its presence in the treaty
 and it be here pertinent to remark that everywhere in the united states law for the collection of debt be equally available to all creditor without respect to race sex nationality or place of residence and equally with the citizen or subject of the most favored nation and with the citizen of the united states recovery can be have in any court of justice in the united states by a subject of china whether of the laboring or any other class
 no disability accrue from nonresidence of a plaintiff whose claim can be enforce in the usual way by he or his assignee or attorney in our court of justice
 in this respect it can not be allege that there exist the slight discrimination against chinese subject and it be a notable fact that large trading firm and company and individual merchant and trader of that nation be profitably establish at numerous point throughout the union in whose hand every claim transmit by an absent chinaman of a just and lawful nature could be completely enforce
 the admit and paramount right and duty of every government to exclude from its border all element of foreign population which for any reason retard its prosperity or be detrimental to the moral and physical health of its people must be regard as a recognize canon of international law and intercourse china herself have not dissent from this doctrine but have by the expression to which i have refer lead we confidently to rely upon such action on her part in cooperation with we as would enforce the exclusion of chinese laborer from our country
 this cooperation have not however be accord we thus from the unexpected and disappointing refusal of the chinese government to confirm the act of its authorized agent and to carry into effect an international agreement the main feature of which be voluntarily present by that government for our acceptance and which have be the subject of long and careful deliberation an emergency have arise in which the government of the united states be call upon to act in self defense by the exercise of its legislative power i can not but regard the express demand on the part of china for a reexamination and renew discussion of the topic so completely cover by mutual treaty stipulation as an indefinite postponement and practical abandonment of the object we have in view to which the government of china may justly be consider as pledge
 the fact and circumstance which i have narrate lead i in the performance of what seem to i to be my official duty to join the congress in deal legislatively with the question of the exclusion of chinese laborer in lieu of further attempt to adjust it by international agreement
 but while thus exercise our undoubted right in the interest of our people and for the general welfare of our country justice and fairness seem to require that some provision should be make by act or joint resolution under which such chinese laborer as shall actually have embark on their return to the united states before the passage of the law this day approve and be now on their way may be permit to land provide they have duly and lawfully obtain and shall present certificate heretofore issue permit they to return in accordance with the provision of exist law
 nor should our recourse to legislative measure of exclusion cause we to retire from the offer we have make to indemnify such chinese subject as have suffer damage through violence in the remote and comparatively unsettled portion of our country at the hand of lawless man therefore i recommend that without acknowledge legal liability therefor but because it be stipulate in the treaty which have fail to take effect and in a spirit of humanity befit our nation there be appropriate the sum of $ 276,619.75 payable to the chinese minister at this capital on behalf of his government as full indemnity for all loss and injury sustain by chinese subject in the manner and under the circumstance mention

to the congress of the united states as you assemble for the discharge of the duty you have assume as the representative of a free and generous people your meeting be mark by an interesting and impressive incident with the expiration of the present session of the congress the first century of our constitutional existence as a nation will be complete our survival for one hundred year be not sufficient to assure we that we no long have danger to fear in the maintenance with all its promise blessing of a government round upon the freedom of the people the time rather admonish we to soberly inquire whether in the past we have always closely keep in the course of safety and whether we have before we a way plain and clear which lead to happiness and perpetuity when the experiment of our government be undertake the chart adopt for our guidance be the constitution departure from the line there lay down be failure it be only by a strict adherence to the direction they indicate and by restraint within the limitation they fix that we can furnish proof to the world of the fitness of the american people for self government the equal and exact justice of which we boast as the underlie principle of our institution should not be confine to the relation of our citizen to each other the government itself be under bond to the american people that in the exercise of its function and power it will deal with the body of our citizen in a manner scrupulously honest and fair and absolutely just it have agree that american citizenship shall be the only credential necessary to justify the claim of equality before the law and that no condition in life shall give rise to discrimination in the treatment of the people by their government the citizen of our republic in its early day rigidly insist upon full compliance with the letter of this bond and see stretch out before he a clear field for individual endeavor his tribute to the support of his government be measure by the cost of its economical maintenance and he be secure in the enjoyment of the remain recompense of his steady and content toil in those day the frugality of the people be stamp upon their government and be enforce by the free thoughtful and intelligent suffrage of the citizen combination monopoly and aggregation of capital be either avoid or sternly regulate and restrain the pomp and glitter of government less free offer no temptation and present no delusion to the plain people who side by side in friendly competition work for the ennoblement and dignity of man for the solution of the problem of free government and for the achievement of the grand destiny await the land which god have give they a century have pass our city be the abide place of wealth and luxury our manufactory yield fortune never dream of by the father of the republic our business man be madly strive in the race for rich and immense aggregation of capital outrun the imagination in the magnitude of their undertaking we view with pride and satisfaction this bright picture of our country 's growth and prosperity while only a close scrutiny develop a somber shading upon more careful inspection we find the wealth and luxury of our city mingle with poverty and wretchedness and unremunerative toil a crowded and constantly increase urban population suggest the impoverishment of rural section and discontent with agricultural pursuit the farmer 's son not satisfied with his father 's simple and laborious life join the eager chase for easily acquire wealth we discover that the fortune realize by our manufacturer be no long solely the reward of sturdy industry and enlighten foresight but that they result from the discriminating favor of the government and be largely build upon undue exaction from the masse of our people the gulf between employer and the employ be constantly widen and class be rapidly form one comprise the very rich and powerful while in another be find the toil poor as we view the achievement of aggregated capital we discover the existence of trust combination and monopoly while the citizen be struggle far in the rear or be trample to death beneath an iron heel corporation which should be the carefully restrain creature of the law and the servant of the people be fast become the people 's master still congratulate ourselves upon the wealth and prosperity of our country and complacently contemplate every incident of change inseparable from these condition it be our duty as patriotic citizen to inquire at the present stage of our progress how the bond of the government make with the people have be keep and perform instead of limit the tribute draw from our citizen to the necessity of its economical administration the government persist in exact from the substance of the people million which unapplied and useless lie dormant in its treasury this flagrant injustice and this breach of faith and obligation add to extortion the danger attend the diversion of the currency of the country from the legitimate channel of business under the same law by which these result be produce the government permit many million more to be add to the cost of the living of our people and to be take from our consumer which unreasonably swell the profit of a small but powerful minority the people must still be tax for the support of the government under the operation of tariff law but to the extent that the mass of our citizen be inordinately burden beyond any useful public purpose and for the benefit of a favor few the government under pretext of an exercise of its tax power enter gratuitously into partnership with these favorite to their advantage and to the injury of a vast majority of our people this be not equality before the law the exist situation be injurious to the health of our entire body politic it stifle in those for whose benefit it be permit all patriotic love of country and substitute in its place selfish greed and grasping avarice devotion to american citizenship for its own sake and for what it should accomplish as a motive to our nation 's advancement and the happiness of all our people be displace by the assumption that the government instead of be the embodiment of equality be but an instrumentality through which especial and individual advantage be to be gain the arrogance of this assumption be unconceale it appear in the sordid disregard of all but personal interest in the refusal to abate for the benefit of other one iota of selfish advantage and in combination to perpetuate such advantage through effort to control legislation and improperly influence the suffrage of the people the grievance of those not include within the circle of these beneficiary when fully realize will surely arouse irritation and discontent our farmer long suffering and patient struggle in the race of life with the hard and most unremitting toil will not fail to see in spite of misrepresentation and mislead fallacy that they be oblige to accept such price for their product as be fix in foreign market where they compete with the farmer of the world that their land be decline in value while their debt increase and that without compensate favor they be force by the action of the government to pay for the benefit of other such enhanced price for the thing they need that the scanty return of their labor fail to furnish their support or leave no margin for accumulation our workingmen enfranchise from all delusion and no long frighten by the cry that their wage be endanger by a just revision of our tariff law will reasonably demand through such revision steady employment cheap mean of live in their home freedom for themselves and their child from the doom of perpetual servitude and an open door to their advancement beyond the limit of a labor class other of our citizen whose comfort and expenditure be measure by moderate salary and fix income will insist upon the fairness and justice of cheapen the cost of necessary for themselves and their family when to the selfishness of the beneficiary of unjust discrimination under our law there shall be add the discontent of those who suffer from such discrimination we will realize the fact that the beneficent purpose of our government dependent upon the patriotism and contentment of our people be endanger communism be a hateful thing and a menace to peace and organized government but the communism of combined wealth and capital the outgrowth of overweene cupidity and selfishness which insidiously undermine the justice and integrity of free institution be not less dangerous than the communism of oppressed poverty and toil which exasperate by injustice and discontent attack with wild disorder the citadel of rule he mock the people who propose that the government shall protect the rich and that they in turn will care for the labor poor any intermediary between the people and their government or the least delegation of the care and protection the government owe to the humblest citizen in the land make the boast of free institution a glitter delusion and the pretended boon of american citizenship a shameless imposition a just and sensible revision of our tariff law should be make for the relief of those of our countryman who suffer under present condition such a revision should receive the support of all who love that justice and equality due to american citizenship of all who realize that in this justice and equality our government find its strength and its power to protect the citizen and his property of all who believe that the contented competence and comfort of many accord well with the spirit of our institution than colossal fortune unfairly gather in the hand of a few of all who appreciate that the forbearance and fraternity among our people which recognize the value of every american interest be the sure guaranty of our national progress and of all who desire to see the product of american skill and ingenuity in every market of the world with a result restoration of american commerce the necessity of the reduction of our revenue be so apparent as to be generally concede but the mean by which this end shall be accomplish and the sum of direct benefit which shall result to our citizen present a controversy of the utmost importance there should be no scheme accept as satisfactory by which the burden of the people be only apparently remove extravagant appropriation of public money with all their demoralize consequence should not be tolerate either as a means of relieve the treasury of its present surplus or as furnish pretext for resist a proper reduction in tariff rate exist evil and injustice should be honestly recognize boldly meet and effectively remedie there should be no cessation of the struggle until a plan be perfect fair and conservative toward exist industry but which will reduce the cost to consumer of the necessary of life while it provide for our manufacturer the advantage of free raw material and permit no injury to the interest of american labor the cause for which the battle be wage be comprise within line clearly and distinctly define it should never be compromise it be the people 's cause it can not be deny that the selfish and private interest which be so persistently hear when effort be make to deal in a just and comprehensive manner with our tariff law be relate to if they be not responsible for the sentiment largely prevail among the people that the general government be the fountain of individual and private aid that it may be expect to relieve with paternal care the distress of citizen and community and that from the fullness of its treasury it should upon the slight possible pretext of promote the general good apply public fund to the benefit of locality and individual nor can it be deny that there be a grow assumption that as against the government and in favor of private claim and interest the usual rule and limitation of business principle and just deal should be waive these idea have be unhappily much encourage by legislative acquiescence relief from contract make with the government be too easily accord in favor of the citizen the failure to support claim against the government by proof be often supply by no well consideration than the wealth of the government and the poverty of the claimant gratuity in the form of pension be grant upon no other real ground than the needy condition of the applicant or for reason less valid and large sum be expend for public building and other improvement upon representation scarcely claim to be relate to public need and necessity the extent to which the consideration of such matter subordinate and postpone action upon subject of great public importance but involve no special private or partisan interest should arrest attention and lead to reformation a few of the numerous illustration of this condition may be state the crowded condition of the calendar of the supreme court and the delay to suitor and denial of justice result therefrom have be strongly urge upon the attention of the congress with a plan for the relief of the situation approve by those well able to judge of its merit while this subject remain without effective consideration many law have be pass provide for the holding of term of inferior court at place to suit the convenience of locality or to lay the foundation of an application for the erection of a new public building repeat recommendation have be submit for the amendment and change of the law relate to our public land so that their spoliation and diversion to other use than as home for honest settler might be prevent while a measure to meet this concede necessity of reform remain await the action of the congress many claim to the public land and application for their donation in favor of states and individual have be allow a plan in aid of indian management recommend by those well inform as contain valuable feature in furtherance of the solution of the indian problem have thus far fail of legislative sanction while grant of doubtful expediency to railroad corporation permit they to pass through indian reservation have greatly multiply the propriety and necessity of the erection of one or more prison for the confinement of united states convict and a post office building in the national capital be not dispute but these need yet remain answer while score of public building have be erect where their necessity for public purpose be not apparent a revision of our pension law could easily be make which would rest upon just principle and provide for every worthy applicant but while our general pension law remain confused and imperfect hundred of private pension law be annually pass which be the source of unjust discrimination and popular demoralization appropriation bill for the support of the government be deface by item and provision to meet private end and it be freely assert by responsible and experienced party that a bill appropriate money for public internal improvement would fail to meet with favor unless it contain item more for local and private advantage than for public benefit these statement can be much emphasize by an ascertainment of the proportion of federal legislation which either bear upon its face its private character or which upon examination develop such a motive power and yet the people wait and expect from their choose representative such patriotic action as will advance the welfare of the entire country and this expectation can only be answer by the performance of public duty with unselfish purpose our mission among the nation of the earth and our success in accomplish the work god have give the american people to do require of those intrust with the making and execution of our law perfect devotion above all other thing to the public good this devotion will lead we to strongly resist all impatience of constitutional limitation of federal power and to persistently check the increase tendency to extend the scope of federal legislation into the domain of state and local jurisdiction upon the plea of subserve the public welfare the preservation of the partition between proper subject of federal and local care and regulation be of such importance under the constitution which be the law of our very existence that no consideration of expediency or sentiment should tempt we to enter upon doubtful ground we have undertake to discover and proclaim the rich blessing of a free government with the constitution as our guide let we follow the way it point out it will not mislead we and surely no one who have take upon himself the solemn obligation to support and preserve the constitution can find justification or solace for disloyalty in the excuse that he wander and disobey in search of a well way to reach the public welfare than the constitution offer what have be say be deem not inappropriate at a time when from a century 's height we view the way already trod by the american people and attempt to discover their future path the seventh president of the united states the soldier and statesman and at all time the firm and brave friend of the people in vindication of his course as the protector of popular right and the champion of true american citizenship declare the ambition which lead i on be an anxious desire and a fix determination to restore to the people unimpaire the sacred trust they have confide to my charge to heal the wound of the constitution and to preserve it from further violation to persuade my countryman so far as i may that it be not in a splendid government support by powerful monopoly and aristocratical establishment that they will find happiness or their liberty protection but in a plain system void of pomp protect all and grant favor to none dispense its blessing like the dew of heaven unseen and unfelt save in the freshness and beauty they contribute to produce it be such a government that the genius of our people require such an one only under which our state may remain for age to come united prosperous and free in pursuance of a constitutional provision require the president from time to time to give to the congress information of the state of the union i have the satisfaction to announce that the close of the year find the united states in the enjoyment of domestic tranquillity and at peace with all the nation since my last annual message our foreign relation have be strengthen and improve by performance of international good office and by new and renewed treaty of amity commerce and reciprocal extradition of criminal those international question which still await settlement be all reasonably within the domain of amicable negotiation and there be no exist subject of dispute between the united states and any foreign power that be not susceptible of satisfactory adjustment by frank diplomatic treatment the question between great britain and the united states relate to the right of american fisherman under treaty and international comity in the territorial water of canada and newfoundland i regret to say be not yet satisfactorily adjust these matter be fully treat in my message to the senate of february 20 1888 together with which a convention conclude under my authority with her majesty 's government on the 15th of february last for the removal of all cause of misunderstanding be submit by i for the approval of the senate this treaty having be reject by the senate i transmit a message to the congress on the 23d of august last review the transaction and submit for consideration certain recommendation for legislation concern the important question involve afterwards on the 12th of september in response to a resolution of the senate i again communicate fully all the information in my possession as to the action of the government of canada affect the commercial relation between the dominion and the united states include the treatment of american fishing vessel in the port and water of british north america these communication have all be publish and therefore open to the knowledge of both houses of congress although two be address to the senate alone comment upon or repetition of their content would be superfluous and i be not aware that anything have since occur which should be add to the fact therein state therefore i merely repeat as applicable to the present time the statement which will be find in my message to the senate of september 12 last that since march 3 1887 no case have be report to the department of state wherein complaint be make of unfriendly or unlawful treatment of american fishing vessel on the part of the canadian authority in which reparation be not promptly and satisfactorily obtain by the united states consul general at halifax having essay in the discharge of my duty to procure by negotiation the settlement of a long stand cause of dispute and to remove a constant menace to the good relation of the two country and continue to be of opinion that the treaty of february last which fail to receive the approval of the senate do supply a satisfactory practical and final adjustment upon a basis honorable and just to both party of the difficult and vex question to which it relate and having subsequently and unavailingly recommend other legislation to congress which i hope would suffice to meet the exigency create by the rejection of the treaty i now again invoke the earnest and immediate attention of the congress to the condition of this important question as it now stand before they and the country and for the settlement of which i be deeply solicitous near the close of the month of october last occurrence of a deeply regrettable nature be bring to my knowledge which make it my painful but imperative duty to obtain with as little delay as possible a new personal channel of diplomatic intercourse in this

his interference by advice and counsel with the suffrage of american citizen in the very crisis of the presidential election then near at hand and also in his subsequent public declaration to justify his action superadde impugnment of the executive and senate of the united states in connection with important question now pende in controversy between the two government the offense thus commit be most grave involve disastrous possibility to the good relation of the united states and great britain constitute a gross breach of diplomatic privilege and an invasion of the purely domestic affair and essential sovereignty of the government to which the envoy be accredit having first fulfil the just demand of international comity by afford full opportunity for her majesty 's government to act in relief of the situation i consider prolongation of discussion to be unwarranted and thereupon decline to far recognize the diplomatic character of the person whose continuance in such function would destroy that mutual confidence which be essential to the good understanding of the two government and be inconsistent with the welfare and self respect of the government of the united states the usual interchange of communication have since continue through her majesty 's legation in this city my endeavor to establish by international cooperation measure for the prevention of the

reconnoissance and survey to obtain proper knowledge of the locality and the geographical feature of the boundary should be authorize by congress with as little delay as possible knowledge to be only

approval of the senate like disposition of the claim of carlos butterfield against denmark and of van bokkelen against hayti will probably be make and i trust the principle of such settlement may be extend in practice under the approval of the senate through unforeseen cause foreign to the will of both government the ratification of the convention of december 5 1885 with venezuela for the rehearing of claim of citizen of the united states under the treaty of 1866 fail of exchange within the term provide and a supplementary convention far extend the time for exchange of ratification and explanatory of an ambiguous provision of the prior convention now await the advice and consent of the senate although this matter in the stage refer to concern only the concurrent treaty make power of one branch of congress i advert to it in view of the interest repeatedly and conspicuously show by you in your legislative capacity in favor of a speedy and equitable adjustment of the question grow out of the discredit judgment of the previous mixed commission of caracas with every desire to do justice to the representation of venezuela in this regard the time seem to have come to end this matter and i trust the prompt confirmation by both party of the supplementary action refer to will avert the need of legislative or other action to prevent the long withholding of such right of actual claimant as may be show to exist as authorize by the congress preliminary step have be take for the assemblage at this capital during the come year of the representative of south and central american states together with those of mexico hayti and san domingo to discuss sundry important monetary and commercial topic except in those case where from reason of contiguity of territory and the existence of a common border line incapable of be guard reciprocal commercial treaty may be find expedient it be believe that commercial policy induce free mutual exchange of product can be most advantageously arrange by independent but cooperative legislation in the mode last mention the control of our taxation for revenue will be always retain in our own hand unrestricte by conventional agreement with other government in conformity also with congressional authority the maritime power have be invite to confer in washington in april next upon the practicability of devise uniform rule and measure for the great security of life and property at sea a disposition to accept on the part of a number of the power have already be manifest and if the cooperation of the nation chiefly interested shall be secure important result may be confidently anticipate the act of june 26 1884 and the act amendatory thereof in relation to tonnage duty have give rise to extended correspondence with foreign nation with whom we have exist treaty of navigation and commerce and have cause wide and regrettable divergence of opinion in relation to the imposition of the duty refer to these question be important and i shall make they the subject of a special and more detailed communication at the present session with the rapid increase of immigration to our shore and the facility of modern travel abuse of the generous privilege afford by our naturalization law call for their careful revision the easy and unguarded manner in which certificate of american citizenship can now be obtain have induce a class unfortunately large to avail themselves of the opportunity to become absolve from allegiance to their native land and yet by a foreign residence to escape any just duty and contribution of service to the country of their propose adoption thus while evade the duty of citizenship to the united states they may make prompt claim for its national protection and demand its intervention in their behalf international complication of a serious nature arise and the correspondence of the state department disclose the great number and complexity of the question which have be raise our law regulate the issue of passport should be carefully revise and the institution of a central bureau of registration at the capital be again strongly recommend by this mean full particular of each case of naturalization in the united states would be secure and properly index and record and thus many case of spurious citizenship would be detect and unjust responsibility would be avoid the reorganization of the consular service be a matter of serious importance to our national interest the number of exist principal consular office be believe to be great than be at all necessary for the conduct of the public business it need not be our policy to maintain more than a moderate number of principal office each support by a salary sufficient to enable the incumbent to live in comfort and so distribute as to secure the convenient supervision through subordinate agency of affair over a considerable district i repeat the recommendation heretofore make by i that the appropriation for the maintenance of our diplomatic and consular service should be recast that the so call notarial or unofficial fee which our representative abroad be now permit to treat as personal perquisite should be forbid that a system of consular inspection should be institute and that a limited number of secretary of legation at large should be authorize preparation for the centennial celebration on april 30 1889 of the inauguration of george washington as president of the united states at the city of new york have be make by a voluntary organization of the citizen of that locality and believe that an opportunity should be afford for the expression of the interest feel throughout the country in this event i respectfully recommend fitting and cooperative action by congress on behalf of the people of the united states the report of the secretary of the treasury exhibit in detail the condition of our national finance and the operation of the several branch of the government relate to his department the total ordinary revenue of the government for the fiscal year end june 30 1888 amount to $ 379,266,074.76 of which $ 219,091,173.63 be receive from custom duty and $ 124,296,871.98 from internal revenue taxis the total receipt from all source exceed those for the fiscal year end june 30 1887 by $ 7,862,797.10.the ordinary expenditure of the government for the fiscal year end june 30 1888 be $ 259,653,958.67 leave a surplus of $ 119,612,116.09.the decrease in these expenditure as compare with the fiscal year end june 30 1887 be $ 8,278,221.30 notwithstanding the payment of more than $ 5,000,000 for pension in excess of what be pay for that purpose in the latter mention year the revenue of the government for the year end june 30 1889 ascertain for the quarter end september 30 1888 and estimate for the remainder of the time amount to $ 377,000,000 and the actual and estimated ordinary expenditure for the same year be $ 273,000,000 leave an estimate surplus of $ 104,000,000.the estimate receipt for the year end june 30 1890 be $ 377,000,000 and the estimate ordinary expenditure for the same time be $ 275,767,488.34 show a surplus of $ 101,232,511.66.the forego statement of surplus do not take into account the sum necessary to be expend to meet the requirement of the sink fund act amount to more than $ 47,000,000 annually the cost of collect the custom revenue for the last fiscal year be 2.44 per cent for the year 1885 it be 3.77 per cent the excess of internal revenue taxis collect during the last fiscal year over those collect for the year end june 30 1887 be $ 5,489,174.26 and the cost of collect this revenue decrease from 3.4 per cent in 1887 to less than 3.2 per cent for the last year the tax collect on oleomargarine be $ 723,948.04 for the year end june 30 1887 and $ 864,139.88 for the following year the requirement of the sink fund act have be meet for the year end june 30 1888 and for the current year also by the purchase of bond after comply with this law as positively require and bond sufficient for that purpose have be buy at a premium it be not deem prudent to far expend the surplus in such purchase until the authority to do so should be more explicit a resolution however having be pass by both houses of congress remove all doubt as to executive authority daily purchase of bond be commence on the 23d day of april 1888 and have continue until the present time by this plan bond of the government not yet due have be purchase up to and include the 30th day of november 1888 amount to $ 94,700,400 the premium pay thereon amount to $ 17,508,613.08.the premium add to the principal of these bond represent an investment yield about 2 per cent interest for the time they still have to run and the saving to the government represent by the difference between the amount of interest at 2 per cent upon the sum pay for principal and premium and what it would have pay for interest at the rate specify in the bond if they have run to their maturity be about $ 27,165,000.at first sight this would seem to be a profitable and sensible transaction on the part of the government but as suggest by the secretary of the treasury the surplus thus expend for the purchase of bond be money draw from the people in excess of any actual need of the government and be so expended rather than allow it to remain idle in the treasury if this surplus under the operation of just and equitable law have be leave in the hand of the people it would have be worth in their business at least 6 per cent per annum deduct from the amount of interest upon the principal and premium of these bond for the time they have to run at the rate of 6 per cent the saving of 2 per cent make for the people by the purchase of such bond the loss will appear to be $ 55,760,000.this calculation would seem to demonstrate that if excessive and unnecessary taxation be continue and the government be force to pursue this policy of purchase its own bond at the premium which it will be necessary to pay the loss to the people will be hundred of million of dollar since the purchase of bond be undertake as mention nearly all that have be offer be at last accept it have be make quite apparent that the government be in danger of be subject to combination to raise their price as appear by the instance cite by the secretary of the offering of bond of the par value of only $ 326,000 so often that the aggregate of the sum demand for their purchase amount to more than $ 19,700,000.notwithstanding the large sum pay out in the purchase of bond the surplus in the treasury on the 30th day of november 1888 be $ 52,234,610.01 after deduct about $ 20,000,000 just draw out for the payment of pension at the close of the fiscal year end june 30 1887 there have be coin under the compulsory silver coinage act $ 266,988,280 in silver dollar $ 55,504,310 of which be in the hand of the people on the 30th day of june 1888 there have be coin $ 299,708,790 and of this $ 55,829,303 be in circulation in coin and $ 200,387,376 in silver certificate for the redemption of which silver dollar to that amount be hold by the government on the 30th day of november 1888 $ 312,570,990 have be coin $ 60,970,990 of the silver dollar be actually in circulation and $ 237,418,346 in certificate the secretary recommend the suspension of the further coinage of silver and in such recommendation i earnestly concur for far valuable information and timely recommendation i ask the careful attention of the congress to the secretary 's report the secretary of war report that the army at the date of the last consolidated return consist of 2,189 officer and 24,549 enlisted man the actual expenditure of the war department for the fiscal year end june 30 1888 amount to $

be convene october 30 1888 and plan and specification for procure forging for 8 10 and 12 inch gun under provision of section 4 and also for procure 12 inch breech loading mortar cast iron hoop with

instruction to bidder have be prepare and advertisement invite proposal for the excavation for the shop building and for erect the two set of officer quarter have be publish the detailed drawing and specification for the gun factory building be well in hand and will be finish within three or four month when bid will be invite for the erection of the building the list of machine etc be make out

the machine and other fixture will be complete as soon as the shop be in readiness to receive they probably about july 1890.under the provision of the army bill for the procurement of pneumatic dynamite gun the necessary specification be now be prepare and advertisement for proposal will issue early in december the gun will probably be of 15 inch caliber and fire a projectile that will carry a charge each of about 500 pound of explosive gelatine with full caliber projectile the gun will probably be deliver in from six to ten month from the date of the contract so that all the gun of this class that can be procure under the provision of the law will be purchase during the year 1889.i earnestly request that the recommendation contain in the secretary 's report all of which be in my opinion calculate to increase the usefulness and discipline of the army may receive the consideration of the congress among these the proposal that there should be provide a plan for the examination of officer to test their fitness for promotion be of the utmost importance this reform have be before recommend in the report of the secretary and its expediency be so fully demonstrate by the argument he present in its favor that its adoption should no long be neglect the death of general sheridan in august last be a national affliction the army then lose the grandest of its chief the country lose a brave and experienced soldier a wise and discreet counselor and a modest and sensible man those who in any manner come within the range of his personal association will never fail to pay deserved and willing homage to his greatness and the glory of his career but they will cherish with more tender sensibility the love memory of his simple generous and considerate nature the apache indians whose removal from their reservation in arizona follow the capture o those of their number who engage in a bloody and murderous raid during a part of the year 1885 and 1886 be now hold as prisoner of war at mount vernon barracks in the state of alabama they number on the 31st day of october the date of the last report 83 man 170 woman 70 boy and 59 girl in all 382 person the command officer state that they be in good health and content and that they be keep employ as fully as be possible in the circumstance the child as they arrive at a suitable age be send to the indian school at carlisle and hampton last summer some charitable and kind people ask permission to send two teacher to these indians for the purpose of instruct the adult as well as such child as should be find there such permission be readily grant accommodation be provide for the teacher and some portion of the building at the barrack be make available for school purpose the good work contemplate have be commence and the teacher engage be pay by the lady with whom the plan originate i be not at all in sympathy with those benevolent but injudicious people who be constantly insist that these indians should be return to their reservation their removal be an absolute necessity if the life and property of citizen upon the frontier be to be at all regard by the government their continued restraint at a distance from the scene of their repeat and cruel murder and outrage be still necessary it be a mistaken philanthropy every way injurious which prompt the desire to see these savage return to their old haunt they be in their present location as the result of the good judgment of those have official responsibility in the matter and who be by no mean lack in kind consideration for the indians a number of these prisoner have forfeit their life to outraged law and humanity experience have prove that they be dangerous and can not be trust this be true not only of those who on the warpath have heretofore actually be guilty of atrocious murder but of their kindred and friend who while they remain upon their reservation furnish aid and comfort to those absent with bloody intent these prisoner should be treat kindly and keep in restraint far from the locality of their former reservation they should be subject to effort calculate to lead to their improvement and the softening of their savage and cruel instinct but their return to their old home should be persistently resist the secretary in his report give a graphic history of these indians and recite with painful vividness their bloody deed and the unhappy failure of the government to manage they by peaceful mean it will be amazing if a perusal of this history will allow the survival of a desire for the return of these prisoner to their reservation upon sentimental or any other ground the report of the secretary of the navy demonstrate very intelligent management in that important department and disclose the most satisfactory progress in the work of reconstruct the navy make during the past year of the ship in course of construction five viz the charleston baltimore yorktown vesuvius and the petrel have in that time be launch and be rapidly approach completion and in addition to the above the philadelphia the san francisco the newark the bennington the concord and the herreshoff torpedo boat be all under contract for delivery to the department during the next year the progress already make and be make give good ground for the expectation that these eleven vessel will be incorporate as part of the american navy within the next twelve month the report show that notwithstanding the large expenditure for new construction and the additional labor they involve the total ordinary or current expenditure of the department for the three year end june 30 1888 be less by more than 20 per cent than such expenditure for the three year end june 30 1884.the various step which have be take to improve the business method of the department be review by the secretary the purchasing of supply have be consolidate and place under a responsible bureau head this have result in the curtailment of open purchase which in the year 1884 and 1885 amount to over 50 per cent of all the purchase of the department to less than 11 per cent so that at the present time about 90 per cent of the total departmental purchase be make by contract and after competition as the expenditure on this account exceed an average of $ 2,000,000 annually it be evident that an important improvement in the system have be inaugurate and substantial economy introduce the report of the postmaster general show a marked increase of business in every branch of the postal service the number of post office on july 1 1888 be 57,376 an increase of 6,124 in three year and of 2,219 for tthe last fiscal year the latter mention increase be classify as follow new england statesmiddle states181southern states and indian territory 41)1,406the states and territories of the pacific coast190the ten states and territories of the west and northwest435district of columbia2total 2,219 free delivery office have increase from 189 in the fiscal year end june 30 1887 to 358 in the year end june 30 1888.in the railway mail service there have be an increase in one year of 168 route and in the number of mile travel per annum an increase of 15,795,917.48 the estimate increase of railroad service for the year be 6,000 mile but the amount of new railroad service actually put on be 12,764.50 mile the volume of business in the money order division include transaction in postal note reach the sum of upward of $ 143,000,000 for the year during the past year parcel post convention have be conclude with barbados the bahamas british honduras and mexico and be now under negotiation with all the central and south american states the increase of correspondence with foreign country during the past three year be gratify and be especially notable and exceptional with the central and south american states and with mexico as the great part of mail matter exchange with these country be commercial in its character this increase be evidence of the improve business relation with they the practical operation of the parcel post convention so far as negotiate have serve to fulfill the most favorable prediction as to their benefit in january last a general postal convention be negotiate with the dominion of canada which go into operation on march 1 and which practically make one postal territory of the united states and canada under it merchandise parcel may now be transmit through the mail at fourth class rate of postage it be not possible here to touch even the lead head of the great postal establishment to illustrate the enormous and rapid growth of its business and the need for legislative readjustment of much of its machinery that it have outgrow for these and valuable recommendation of the postmaster general attention be earnestly invite to his report a department whose revenue have increase from $ 19,772,000 in 1870 to $ 52,700,000 in 1888 despite reduction of postage which have enormously reduce rate of revenue while greatly increase its business demand the careful consideration of the congress as to all matter suggest by those familiar with its operation and which be calculate to increase its efficiency and usefulness a bill propose by the postmaster general be introduce at the last session of the congress by which a uniform standard in the amount of gross receipt would fix the right of a community to a public building to be erect by the government for post office purpose it be demonstrate that aside from the public convenience and the promotion of harmony among citizen invariably disturb by change of leasing and of site it be a measure of the high economy and of sound business judgment it be find that the government be pay in rent at the rate of from 7 to 10 per cent per annum on what the cost of such public building would be a very great advantage result from such a law would be the prevention of a large number of bill constantly introduce for the erection of public building at place and involve expenditure not justify by public necessity i trust that this measure will become a law at the present session of congress of the total number of postmaster 54,874 be of the fourth class these of course receive no allowance whatever for expense in the service and their compensation be fix by percentage on receipt at their respective office this rate of compensation may have be and probably be at some time just but the standard have remain unchanged through the several reduction in the rate of postage such reduction have necessarily cut down the compensation of these official while it undoubtedly increase the business perform by they simple justice require attention to this subject to the end that fourth class postmaster may receive at least an equivalent to that which the law itself fix the rate intend for they another class of postal employee whose condition seem to demand legislation be that of clerk in post office and i call especial attention to the repeat recommendation of the postmaster general for their classification proper legislation of this character for the relief of carrier in the free delivery service have be frequent provision be make for their promotion for substitute for they on vacation for substitute for holiday and limit their hour of labor seven million dollar have be appropriate for the current year to provide for they though the total number of office where they be employ be but 358 for the past fiscal year with an estimate increase for the current year of but 40 while the total appropriation for all clerk in office throughout the united states be $ 5,950,000.the legislation affect the relation of the government with railroad be in need of revision while for the most part the railroad company throughout the country have cordially cooperate with the post office department in render excellent service yet under the law as it stand while the compensation to they for carry the mail be limited and regulate and although railroad be make post road by law there be no authority repose anywhere to compel the owner of a railroad to take and carry the united states mail the only alternative provide by act of congress in case of refusal be for the postmaster general to send mail forward by pony express this be but an illustration of ill fitting legislation reasonable and proper at the time of its enactment but long since outgrown and require readjustment it be gratify to note from the carefully prepare statistic accompany the postmaster general 's report that notwithstanding the great expansion of the service the rate of expenditure have be lessen and efficiency have be improve in every branch that fraud and crime have decrease that loss from the mail have be reduce and that the number of complaint of the service make to postmaster and to the department be far less than ever before the transaction of the department of justice for the fiscal year end june 30 1888 be contain in the report of the attorney general as well as a number of valuable recommendation the most part of which be repetition of those previously make and ought to receive consideration it be state in this report that though judgment in civil suit amount to $ 552,021.08 be recover in favor of the government during the year only the sum of $ 132,934 be collect thereon and that though fine penalty and forfeiture be impose amounting to $ 541,808.43 only $ 109,648.42 of that sum be pay on account thereof these fact may furnish an illustration of the sentiment which extensively prevail that a debt due the government should cause no inconvenience to the citizen it also appear from this report that though prior to march 1885 there have be but 6 conviction in the territories of utah and idaho under the law of 1862 and 1882 punish polygamy and unlawful cohabitation as crime there have be since that date nearly 600 conviction under these law and the statute of 1887 and the opinion be express that under such a firm and vigilant execution of these law and the advance of idea oppose to the forbidden practice polygamy within the united states be virtually at an end suit institute by the government under the provision of the act of march 3 1887 for the termination of the corporation know as the perpetual emigrating fund company and the church of jesus christ of latter day saint have result in a decree favorable to the government declare the charter of these corporation forfeit and escheate their property such property amount in value to more than $ 800,000 be in the hand of a receiver pende further proceeding an appeal having be take to the supreme court of the united states in the report of the secretary of the interior which will be lay before you the condition of the various branch of our domestic affair connect with that department and its operation during the past year be fully exhibit but a brief reference to some of the subject discuss in this able and interesting report can here be make but i commend the entire report to the attention of the congress and trust that the sensible and valuable recommendation it contain will secure careful consideration i can not too strenuously insist upon the importance of proper measure to insure a right disposition of our public land not only as a matter of present justice but in forecast of the consequence to future generation the broad rich acre of our agricultural plain have be long preserve by nature to become her untrammeled gift to a people civilized and free upon which should rest in well distribute ownership the numerous home of enlighten equal and fraternal citizen they come to national possession with the warn example in our eye of the entail of iniquity in land proprietorship which other country have permit and still suffer we have no excuse for the violation of principle cogently teach by reason and example nor for the allowance of pretext which have sometimes expose our land to colossal greed law which open a door to fraudulent acquisition or administration which permit favor to rapacious seizure by a favor few of expand area that many should enjoy be accessory to offense against our national welfare and humanity not to be too severely condemn or punish it be gratify to know that something have be do at last to redress the injury to our people and check the perilous tendency of the reckless waste of the national domain that over 80,000,000 acre have be arrest from illegal usurpation improvident grant and fraudulent entry and claim to be take for the homestead of honest industry although less than the great area thus unjustly lose must afford a profound gratification to right feel citizen as it be a recompense for the labor and struggle of the recovery our dear experience ought sufficiently to urge the speedy enactment of measure of legislation which will confine the future disposition of our remain agricultural land to the use of actual husbandry and genuine home nor should our vast tract of so call desert land be yield up to the monopoly of corporation or grasp individual as appear to be much the tendency under the exist statute these land require but the supply of water to become fertile and productive it be a problem of great moment how most wisely for the public good that factor shall be furnish i can not but think it perilous to suffer either these land or the source of their irrigation to fall into the hand of monopoly which by such mean may exercise lordship over the area dependent on their treatment for productiveness already step have be take to secure accurate and scientific information of the condition which be the prime basis of intelligent action until this shall be gain the course of wisdom appear clearly to lie in a suspension of further disposal which only promise to create right antagonistic to the common interest no harm can follow this cautionary conduct the land will remain and the public good present no demand for hasty dispossession of national ownership and control i commend also the recommendation that appropriate measure be take to complete the adjustment of the various grant make to the states for internal improvement and of swamp and overflow land as well as to adjudicate and finally determine the validity and extent of the numerous private land claim all these be element of great injustice and peril to the settler upon the locality affect and now that their existence can not be avoid no duty be more pressing than to fix as soon as possible their bound and terminate the threat of trouble which arise from uncertainty the condition of our indian population continue to improve and the proof multiply that the transforming change so much to be desire which shall substitute for barbarism enlightenment and civilize education be in favorable progress our relation with these people during the year have be disturb by no serious disorder but rather mark by a well realization of their true interest and increase confidence and good will these condition testify to the value of the high tone of consideration and humanity which have govern the later method of deal with they and commend its continued observance allotment in severalty have be make on some reservation until all those entitle to land thereon have have their share assign and the work be still continue in direct the execution of this duty i have not aim so much at rapid dispatch as to secure just and fair arrangement which shall well conduce to the object of the law by produce satisfaction with the result of the allotment make no measure of general effect have ever be enter on from which more may be fairly hope if it shall be discreetly administer it proffer opportunity and inducement to that independence of spirit and life which the indian peculiarly need while at the same time the inalienability of title afford security against the risk his inexperience of affair or weakness of character may expose he to in deal with other whenever begin upon any reservation it should be make complete so that all be bring to the same condition and as soon as possible community in land should cease by opening such as remain unallotted to settlement contact with the way of industrious and successful farmer will perhaps add a healthy emulation which will both instruct and stimulate but no agency for the amelioration of this people appear to i so promising as the extension urge by the secretary of such complete facility of education as shall at the early possible day embrace all teachable indian youth of both sex and retain they with a kindly and beneficent hold until their character be form and their faculty and disposition train to the sure pursuit of some form of useful industry capacity of the indian no long need demonstration it be establish it remain to make the most of it and when that shall be do the curse will be lift the indian race save and the sin of their oppression redeem the time of its accomplishment depend upon the spirit and justice with which it shall be prosecute it can not be too soon for the indian nor for the interest and good name of the nation the average attendance of indian pupil on the school increase by over 900 during the year and the total enrollment reach 15,212 the cost of maintenance be not materially raise the number of teachable indian youth be now estimate at 40,000 or nearly three time the enrollment of the school it be believe the obstacle in the way of instructing be all surmountable and that the necessary expenditure would be a measure of economy the sioux tribe on the great reservation of dakota refuse to assent to the act pass by the congress at its last session for open a portion of their land to settlement notwithstanding modification of the term be suggest which meet most of their objection their demand be for immediate payment of the full price of $ 1.25 per acre for the entire body of land the occupancy of which they be ask to relinquish the manner of submission insure their fair understanding of the law and their action be undoubtedly as thoroughly intelligent as their capacity admit it be at least gratifying that no reproach of overreach can in any manner lie against the government however advisable the favorable completion of the negotiation may have be esteem i concur in the suggestion of the secretary regard the turtle mountain indians the two reservation in california and the crees they should in my opinion receive immediate attention the number of pensioner add to the roll during the fiscal year end june 30 1888 be 60,252 and increase of pension be grant in 45,716 case the name of 15,730 pensioner be drop from the roll during the year from various cause and at the close of the year the number of person of all class receive pension be 452,557 of these there be 806 survivor of the war of 1812 10,787 widow of those who serve in that war 16,060 soldier of the mexican war and 5,104 widow of say soldier one hundred and two different rate of pension be pay to these beneficiary range from $ 2 to $ 416.66 per month the amount pay for pension during the fiscal year be $ 78,775,861.92 be an increase over the precede year of $ 5,308,280.22 the expense attend the maintenance and operation of the pension bureau during that period be $ 3,262,524.67 make the entire expenditure of the bureau $ 82,038,386.57 be 21 1/2 per cent of the gross income and nearly 31 per cent of the total expenditure of the government during the year i be thoroughly convinced that our general pension law should be revise and adjust to meet as far as possible in the light of our experience all meritorious case the fact that 102 different rate of pension be pay can not in my opinion be make consistent with justice to the pensioner or to the government and the numerous private pension bill that be pass predicate upon the imperfection of general law while they increase in many case exist inequality and injustice lend additional force to the recommendation for a revision of the general law on this subject the laxity of idea prevail among a large number of our people regard pension be become every day more marked the principle upon which they should be grant be in danger of be altogether ignore and already pension be often claim because the applicant be as much entitle as other successful applicant rather than upon any disability reasonably attributable to military service if the establishment of vicious precedent be continue if the granting of pension be not divorce from partisan and other unworthy and irrelevant consideration and if the honorable name of veteran unfairly become by these mean but another term for one who constantly clamor for the aid of the government there be danger that injury will be do to the fame and patriotism of many whom our citizen all delight to honor and that a prejudice will be arouse unjust to meritorious applicant for pension the department of agriculture have continue with a good measure of success its effort to develop the process enlarge the result and augment the profit of american husbandry it have collect and

almost equally affected with this great danger upon we and with the contagion already in the channel of commerce with the enormous direct and indirect loss already be cause by it and when only prompt and energetic action could be successful there be in none of these states any law authorize this department to eradicate the malady or give the state official power to cooperate with it for this purpose the department even lack both the requisite appropriation and authority by secure state cooperation in connection with authority from congress the work of eradication have be press successfully and this dread disease have be extirpate from the western states and also from the eastern states with the exception of a few restricted area which be still under supervision the danger have thus be remove and trade and commerce have be free from the vexatious state restriction which be deem necessary for a time during the past four year the process of diffusion as apply to the manufacture of sugar from sorghum and sugar cane have be introduce into this country and fully perfect by the experiment carry on by the department of agriculture this process be now universally consider to be the most economical one and it be through it that the sorghum sugar industry have be establish upon a firm basis and the road to its future success open the adoption of this diffusion

which with the matter in course of preparation will make the most complete treatise on that subject that have ever be publish in any country the department seek a progressive development it would combine the discovery of science with the economic and amelioration of rural practice a supervision of the endow experimental station system recently provide for be a proper function of the department

appear to be able to comply with well guard and exact term of such extension and the reenforcement of their opinion by gentleman of undoubted business judgment and experience appoint to protect the interest of the government as director of say corporation may well lead to the belief that such an extension would be to the advantage of the government the subject should be treat as a business

policy have then its opponent the argument be make asnow that its benefit inure to particular class or section if the question become in any sense or at any time sectional it wasonly because slavery exist in some of the states but for this therewa no reason why the cotton produce states should not have lead or walkedabreast with the new england states in the production of cotton fabric there be this reason only why the states that divide with pennsylvaniathe mineral treasure of the great southeastern and central mountain rangesshould have be so tardy in bring to the smelt furnace and to themill the coal and iron from their near oppose hillside mill fire werelighte at the funeral pile of slavery the emancipation proclamation washeard in the depth of the earth as well as in the sky man

state more real and valuablethan add territory shall the prejudice and paralysis of slavery continue to hang uponthe skirt of progress how long will those who rejoice that slavery nolonger exist cherish or tolerate the incapacity it put upon their communities?i look hopefully to the continuance of our protective system and to theconsequent development of manufacturing and mining enterprise in the stateshitherto wholly give to agriculture as a potent influence in the perfectunification of our people the man who have invest their capital in theseenterprise the farmer who have feel the benefit of their neighborhood and the man who work in shop or field will not fail to find and to defenda community of interest be it not quite possible that the farmer and the promoter of the greatmine and manufacturing enterprise which have recently be establishedin the south may yet find that the free ballot of the workingman withoutdistinction of race be need for their defense as well as for his own?i do not doubt that if those man in the south who now accept the tariffview of clay and the constitutional exposition of webster would courageouslyavow and defend their real conviction they would not find it difficult by friendly instruction and cooperation to make the black man their efficientand safe ally not only in establish correct principle in our nationaladministration but in preserve for their local community the benefitsof social order and economical and honest government at least until thegood office of kindness and education have be fairly try the contraryconclusion can not be plausibly urge i have altogether reject the suggestion of a special executive policyfor any section of our country it be the duty of the executive to administerand enforce in the method and by the instrumentality point out andprovide by the constitution all the law enact by congress these lawsare general and their administration should be uniform and equal as acitizen may not elect what law he will obey neither may the executiveeject which he will enforce the duty to obey and to execute embrace theconstitution in its entirety and the whole code of law enact under it the evil example of permit individual corporation or communitiesto nullify the law because they cross some selfish or local interest orprejudice be full of danger not only to the nation at large but muchmore to those who use this pernicious expedient to escape their just obligationsor to obtain an unjust advantage over other they will presently themselvesbe compel to appeal to the law for protection and those who would usethe law as a defense must not deny that use of it to other if our great corporation would more scrupulously observe their legallimitation and duty they would have less cause to complain of the unlawfullimitation of their right or of violent interference with their operation the community that by concert open or secret among its citizen deniesto a portion of its member their plain right under the law have severedthe only safe bond of social order and prosperity the evil work froma bad center both way it demoralize those who practice it and destroysthe faith of those who suffer by it in the efficiency of the law as a safeprotector the man in whose breast that faith have be darken be naturallythe subject of dangerous and uncanny suggestion those who use unlawfulmethod if move by no high motive than the selfishness that promptedthem may well stop and inquire what be to be the end of this an unlawful expedient can not become a permanent condition of government if the educated and influential class in a community either practiceor connive at the systematic violation of law that seem to they to crosstheir convenience what can they expect when the lesson that convenienceor a suppose class interest be a sufficient cause for lawlessness hasbeen well learn by the ignorant class a community where law be therule of conduct and where court not mob execute its penalty be theonly attractive field for business investment and honest labor our naturalization law should be so amend as to make the inquiryinto the character and good disposition of person apply for citizenshipmore careful and search our exist law have be in their administrationan unimpressive and often an unintelligible form we accept the man asa citizen without any knowledge of his fitness and he assume the dutiesof citizenship without any knowledge as to what they be the privilegesof american citizenship be so great and its duty so grave that we maywell insist upon a good knowledge of every person apply for citizenshipand a good knowledge by he of our institution we should not cease tobe hospitable to immigration but we should cease to be careless as tothe character of it there be man of all race even the good whose comingis necessarily a burden upon our public revenue or a threat to socialorder these should be identify and exclude we have happily maintain a policy of avoid all interference witheuropean affair we have be only interested spectator of their contentionsin diplomacy and in war ready to use our friendly office to promote peace but never obtrude our advice and never attempt unfairly to coin thedistresse of other power into commercial advantage to ourselves we havea just right to expect that our european policy will be the american policyof european court it be so manifestly incompatible with those precaution for our peaceand safety which all the great power habitually observe and enforce inmatter affect they that a short waterway between our eastern andwestern seaboard should be dominate by any european government that wemay confidently expect that such a purpose will not be entertain by anyfriendly power we shall in the future as in the past use every endeavor to maintainand enlarge our friendly relation with all the great power but theywill not expect we to look kindly upon any project that would leave ussubject to the danger of a hostile observation or environment we havenot seek to dominate or to absorb any of our weak neighbor but ratherto aid and encourage they to establish free and stable government restingupon the consent of their own people we have a clear right to expect therefore that no european government will seek to establish colonialdependencie upon the territory of these independent american states thatwhich a sense of justice restrain we from seek they may be reasonablyexpecte willingly to forego it must not be assume however that our interest be so exclusivelyamerican that our entire inattention to any event that may transpire elsewherecan be take for grant our citizen domicile for purpose of tradein all country and in many of the island of the sea demand and willhave our adequate care in their personal and commercial right the necessitiesof our navy require convenient coaling station and dock and harbor privilege these and other trading privilege we will feel free to obtain only bymean that do not in any degree partake of coercion however feeble thegovernment from which we ask such concession but have fairly obtainedthem by method and for purpose entirely consistent with the most friendlydisposition toward all other power our consent will be necessary to anymodification or impairment of the concession we shall neither fail to respect the flag of any friendly nation orthe just right of its citizen nor to exact the like treatment for ourown calmness justice and consideration should characterize our diplomacy the office of an intelligent diplomacy or of friendly arbitration in propercase should be adequate to the peaceful adjustment of all internationaldifficultie by such method we will make our contribution to the world'speace which no nation value more highly and avoid the opprobrium whichmust fall upon the nation that ruthlessly break it the duty devolve by law upon the president to nominate and by andwith the advice and consent of the senate to appoint all public officerswhose appointment be not otherwise provide for in the constitution orby act of congress have become very burdensome and its wise and efficientdischarge full of difficulty the civil list be so large that a personalknowledge of any large number of the applicant be impossible the presidentmust rely upon the representation of other and these be often madeinconsiderately and without any just sense of responsibility i have aright i think to insist that those who volunteer or be invite to giveadvice as to appointment shall exercise consideration and fidelity ahigh sense of duty and an ambition to improve the service should characterizeall public officer there be many way in which the convenience and comfort of those whohave business with our public office may be promote by a thoughtful andoblige officer and i shall expect those whom i may appoint to justifytheir selection by a conspicuous efficiency in the discharge of their duty honorable party service will certainly not be esteem by i a disqualificationfor public office but it will in no case be allow to serve as a shieldof official negligence incompetency or delinquency it be entirely creditableto seek public office by proper method and with proper motive and allapplicant will be treat with consideration but i shall need and thehead of departments will need time for inquiry and deliberation persistentimportunity will not therefore be the good support of an applicationfor office head of departments bureau and all other public officershave any duty connect therewith will be expect to enforce the civil service law fully and without evasion beyond this obvious duty i hopeto do something more to advance the reform of the civil service the ideal or even my own ideal i shall probably not attain retrospect will be asafer basis of judgment than promise we shall not however i be sure be able to put our civil service upon a nonpartisan basis until we havesecure an incumbency that fair minded man of the opposition will approvefor impartiality and integrity as the number of such in the civil listis increase removal from office will diminish while a treasury surplus be not the great evil it be a serious evil our revenue should be ample to meet the ordinary annual demand upon ourtreasury with a sufficient margin for those extraordinary but scarcelyless imperative demand which arise now and then expenditure should alwaysbe make with economy and only upon public necessity wastefulness profligacy or favoritism in public expenditure be criminal but there be nothingin the condition of our country or of our people to suggest that anythingpresently necessary to the public prosperity security or honor shouldbe unduly postpone it will be the duty of congress wisely to forecast and estimate theseextraordinary demand and having add they to our ordinary expenditure to so adjust our revenue law that no considerable annual surplus willremain we will fortunately be able to apply to the redemption of the publicdebt any small and unforeseen excess of revenue this be well than toreduce our income below our necessary expenditure with the resultingchoice between another change of our revenue law and an increase of thepublic debt it be quite possible i be sure to effect the necessary reductionin our revenue without break down our protective tariff or seriouslyinjure any domestic industry the construction of a sufficient number of modern war ship and of theirnecessary armament should progress as rapidly as be consistent with careand perfection in plan and workmanship the spirit courage and skillof our naval officer and seaman have many time in our history give toweak ship and inefficient gun a rating greatly beyond that of the navallist that they will again do so upon occasion i do not doubt but theyought not by premeditation or neglect to be leave to the risk and exigenciesof an unequal combat we should encourage the establishment of americansteamship line the exchange of commerce demand state reliable andrapid mean of communication and until these be provide the developmentof our trade with the states lie south of we be impossible our pension law should give more adequate and discriminating reliefto the union soldier and sailor and to their widow and orphan suchoccasion as this should remind we that we owe everything to their valorand sacrifice it be a subject of congratulation that there be a near prospect of theadmission into the union of the dakotas and montana and washington territories this act of justice have be unreasonably delay in the case of some ofthem the people who have settle these territories be intelligent enterprising and patriotic and the accession these new states will add strength tothe nation it be due to the settler in the territories who have availedthemselve of the invitation of our land law to make home upon the publicdomain that their title should be speedily adjust and their honest entriesconfirme by patent it be very gratifying to observe the general interest now be manifestedin the reform of our election law those who have be for year callingattention to the press necessity of throw about the ballot box andabout the elector far safeguard in order that our election mightnot only be free and pure but might clearly appear to be so will welcomethe accession of any who do not so soon discover the need of reform thenational congress have not as yet take control of election in that caseover which the constitution give it jurisdiction but have accept andadopte the election law of the several states provide penalty fortheir violation and a method of supervision only the inefficiency of thestate law or an unfair partisan administration of they could suggest adeparture from this policy it be clearly however in the contemplation of the framer of theconstitution that such an exigency might arise and provision be wiselymade for it the freedom of the ballot be a condition of our national life and no power vest in congress or in the executive to secure or perpetuateit should remain unused upon occasion the people of all the congressionaldistrict have an equal interest that the election in each shall trulyexpress the view and wish of a majority of the qualified elector residingwithin it the result of such election be not local and the insistenceof elector reside in other district that they shall be pure and freedoe not savor at all of impertinence if in any of the states the public security be think to be threatenedby ignorance among the elector the obvious remedy be education the sympathyand help of our people will not be withhold from any community strugglingwith special embarrassment or difficulty connect with the suffrageif the remedy propose proceed upon lawful line and be promote byjust and honorable method how shall those who practice election fraudsrecover that respect for the sanctity of the ballot which be the firstcondition and obligation of good citizenship the man who have come to regardthe ballot box as a juggler 's hat have renounce his allegiance let we exalt patriotism and moderate our party contention let thosewho would die for the flag on the field of battle give a well proof oftheir patriotism and a high glory to their country by promote fraternityand justice a party success that be achieve by unfair method or by practicesthat partake of revolution be hurtful and evanescent even from a partystandpoint we should hold our differ opinion in mutual respect and having submit they to the arbitrament of the ballot should accept anadverse judgment with the same respect that we would have demand of ouropponent if the decision have be in our favor no other people have a government more worthy of their respect and loveor a land so magnificent in extent so pleasant to look upon and so fullof generous suggestion to enterprise and labor god have place upon ourhead a diadem and have lay at our foot power and wealth beyond definitionor calculation but we must not forget that we take these gift upon thecondition that justice and mercy shall hold the rein of power and thatthe upward avenue of hope shall be free to all the people i do not mistrust the future danger have be in frequent ambush alongour path but we have uncover and vanquish they all passion have sweptsome of our community but only to give we a new

my fellow citizens
 everyone here to day be distressingly conscious of the circumstance which have convene this meeting it would be wholly superfluous for i to attempt to set before you more impressively than the newspaper have already do the horror attend the calamity which have fall upon the city of johnstown and the neighbor hamlet in a large section of pennsylvania situate on the susquehanna river the grim pencil of dor&eacute would be inadequate to portray the distress and horror of this visitation in such meeting as we have to day here in the national capital and other like gathering that be take place in all the city of this land we have the only relief to the distress and darkness of the picture when such calamitous visitation fall upon any section of our country we can only put about the dark picture the golden border of love and charity it be in such fire as this that the brotherhood of man be weld and where more appropriately than here at the national capital can we give expression to that sympathy and brotherhood which be now so strongly appeal to by the distress of large body of our fellow citizen
 i be glad to say that early this morning from a city not long ago visit with pestilence and not long ago appeal to the charity of the philanthropic people of the whole land for relief the city of jacksonville f1a.-there come the reflex the ebb of that tide of charity which flow toward they in a telegram from the chairman of the relief association of that city authorize i to draw upon they for $ 2,000 for the relief of the sufferer at johnstown
 but this be no time for speech while i talk man and woman and child be suffer for the relief which we plan to give to day
 a word or two of practical suggestion and i will place this meeting in the hand of those who have assemble here to give effect to our love purpose i have to day have a dispatch from the governor of pennsylvania advise i that communication have just be open with williamsport on a branch of the susquehanna river and that the loss in that section have be appalling that thousand of people there be hungry and homeless and penniless and there be immediate urgency for food to relieve their necessity and he advise i that any supply of food that can be hastily gather here should be send direct to williamsport where they will be distribute i suggest therefore and the occasion be such that bell might be ring in your street to call the attention of the thoughtless to this great exigency that a committee should be appoint to speedily collect contribution of food in order that a train load with provision might be dispatch to night or in the early morning to these sufferer
 i suggest secondly that as many of these people have have the entire furniture of their house sweep away and have now only a temporary shelter that a committee be appoint to collect from your citizen such article of clothing especially bedclothe as can be spare and now that the summer season be on there can hardly be many household in washington that can not spare a blanket or a coverlid for the relief of the suffer one
 i suggest thirdly that of your substantial business people banker and other there be appoint a committee who shall collect money for after the first exigency have pass there will be find in those community very many who have lose their all who will need aid in the reconstruction of their demolish home and in furnish they in order that they may be again inhabit
 need i say in conclusion that as a temporary citizen of washington it would give i great satisfaction if the national capital should so generously respond to this call of our distressed fellow citizen as to be conspicuous among the city of the land for its ample and generous answer
 i feel as i be call for subscription that i should say that on saturday on be first apprise of the need at johnstown i telegraph to the mayor of that city my subscription i do not care now or at any time to speak of anything that be so personal as this but i feel it due to you as i be place here to day to solicit and urge other to give that i should say so much as that

to the senate and house of representatives there be few transaction in the administration of the government that be even temporarily hold in the confidence of those charge with the conduct of the public business every step take be under the observation of an intelligent and watchful people the state of the union be know from day to day and suggestion as to need legislation find an early voice than that which speak in these annual communication of the president to congress good will and cordiality have characterize our relation and correspondence with other government and the year just close leave few international question of importance remain unadjusted no obstacle be believe to exist that can long postpone the consideration and adjustment of the still pende question upon satisfactory and honorable term the dealing of this government with other state have be and should always be mark by frankness and sincerity our purpose avow and our method free from intrigue this course have bear rich fruit in the past and it be our duty as a nation to preserve the heritage of good repute which a century of right dealing with foreign government have secure to we it be a matter of high significance and no less of congratulation that the first year of the second century of our constitutional existence find as honor guest within our border the representative of all the independent states of north and south america meet together in earnest conference touch the good method of perpetuate and expand the relation of mutual interest and friendliness exist among they that the opportunity thus afford for promote close international relation and the increase prosperity of the states represent will be use for the mutual good of all i can not permit myself to doubt our people will await with interest and confidence the result to flow from so auspicious a meeting of allied and in large part identical interest the recommendation of this international conference of enlightened statesman will doubtless have the considerate attention of congress and its cooperation in the removal of unnecessary barrier to beneficial intercourse between the nation of america but while the commercial result which it be hope will follow this conference be worthy of pursuit and of the great interest they have excite it be believe that the crowning benefit will be find in the well security which may be devise for the maintenance of peace among all american nation and the settlement of all contention by method that a christian civilization can approve while view with

also recommend that timely provision be make for extend to hawaii an invitation to be represent in the international conference now sit at this capital our relation with china have the attentive consideration which their magnitude and interest demand the failure of the treaty negotiate under the administration of my predecessor for the further and more complete restriction of chinese labor immigration and with it the legislation of the last session of congress dependent thereon leave some question open which congress should now approach in that wise and just spirit which should characterize the relation of two great and friendly power while our supreme interest demand the exclusion of a labor element which experience have show to be incompatible with our social life all step to compass this imperative need should be accompany with a recognition of the claim of those stranger now lawfully among we to humane and just treatment the accession of the young emperor of china mark we may hope an era of progress and prosperity for the great country over which he be call to rule the present state of affair in respect to the samoan islands be encouraging the conference which

abeyance or in course of amicable adjustment on the part of the government of the dominion of canada an effort have be apparent during the season just end to administer the law and regulation applicable to the fishery with as little occasion for friction as be possible and the temperate representation of this government in respect of case of undue hardship or of harsh interpretation have be in most case meet with measure of transitory relief it be trust that the attainment of our just right under exist treaty and in virtue of the concurrent legislation of the two contiguous country will not be long deferred and that all exist cause of difference may be equitably adjust i recommend that provision be make by an international agreement for visibly mark the water boundary between the united states and canada in the narrow channel that join the great lakes the conventional line therein trace by the northwestern boundary survey year ago be not in all case readily ascertainable for the settlement of jurisdictional question a just and acceptable enlargement of the list of offense for which extradition may be claim and grant be most desirable between this country and great britain the territory of neither should become a secure harbor for the evil doer of the other through any avoidable shortcoming in this regard a new treaty on this subject between the two power have be recently negotiate and will soon be lay before the senate the importance of the commerce of cuba and puerto rico with the united states their near and principal market justify the expectation that the exist relation may be beneficially expand the impediment result from vary due on navigation and from the vexatious treatment of our vessel on merely technical ground of complaint in west india port should be remove the progress toward an adjustment of pende claim between the united states and spain be not as rapid as could be desire question affect american interest in connection with railway construct and operate by our citizen in peru have claim the attention of this government it be urge that other government in press peru to the payment of their claim have disregard the

in africa be construct under a concession by portugal to an american citizen when nearly complete the road be seize by the agent of the portuguese government formal protest have be make through our minister at lisbon against this act and no proper effort will be spare to secure proper relief in pursuance of the charter grant by congress and under the term of its contract with the government of nicaragua the interoceanic canal company have begin the construction of the important waterway between the two ocean which its organization contemplate grave complication for a time seem imminent in view of a suppose conflict of jurisdiction between nicaragua and costa rica in regard to the accessory privilege to be concede by the latter republic toward the construction of work on the san juan river of which the right bank be costa rican territory i be happy to learn that a friendly arrangement have be effect between the two nation this government have hold itself ready to promote in every proper way the adjustment of all question that might present obstacle to the completion of a work of such transcendent importance to the commerce of this country and indeed to the commercial interest of the world the traditional good feeling between this country and the french republic have receive additional testimony in the participation of our government and people in the international exposition hold at paris during the past summer the success of our exhibitor have be gratify the report of the commission will be lay before congress in due season this government have accept under proper reserve as to its policy in foreign territory the invitation of the government of belgium to take part in an international congress which open at brussels on the 16th of november for the purpose of devise measure to promote the abolition of the slave trade in africa and to prevent the shipment of slave by sea our interest in the extinction of this crime against humanity in the region where it yet survive have be increase by the result of emancipation within our own border with germany the most cordial relation continue the question arise from the return to the empire of germans naturalize in this country be consider and dispose of in a temperate spirit to the entire satisfaction of both government it be a source of great satisfaction that the internal disturbance of the republic of hayti be at last happily end and that an apparently stable government have be constitute it have be duly recognize by the united states a mixed commission be now in session in this capital for the settlement of long stand claim against the republic of venezuela and it be hope that a satisfactory conclusion will be speedily reach this government have not hesitate to express its earnest desire that the boundary dispute now pende between great britain and venezuela may be adjust amicably and in strict accordance with the historic title of the party the advancement of the empire of japan have be evidence by the recent promulgation of a new constitution contain valuable guaranty of liberty and provide for a responsible ministry to conduct the government it be earnestly recommend that our judicial right and process in korea be establish on a firm basis by provide the machinery necessary to carry out treaty stipulation in that regard the friendliness of the persian government continue to be show by its generous treatment of americans engage in missionary labor and by the cordial disposition of the shah to encourage the enterprise of our citizen in the development of persian resource a discussion be in progress touch the jurisdictional treaty right of the united states in turkey an earnest effort will be make to define those right to the satisfaction of both government question continue to arise in our relation with several country in respect to the right of naturalized citizen especially be this the case with france italy russia and turkey and to a less extent with switzerland from time to time earnest effort have be make to regulate this subject by convention with those country an improper use of naturalization should not be permit but it be most important that those who have be duly naturalize should everywhere be accord recognition of the right pertain to the citizenship of the country of their adoption the appropriateness of special convention for that purpose be recognize in treaty which this government have conclude with a number of european states and it be advisable that the difficulty which now arise in our relation with other country on the same subject should be similarly adjust the recent revolution in brazil in favor of the establishment of a republican form of government be an event of great interest to the united states our minister at rio de janeiro be at once instruct to maintain friendly diplomatic relation with the provisional government and the brazilian representative at this capital be instruct by the provisional government to continue their function our friendly intercourse with brazil have therefore suffer no interruption our minister have be far instruct to extend on the part of this government a formal and cordial recognition of the new republic so soon as the majority of the people of brazil shall have signify their assent to its establishment and maintenance within our own border a general condition of prosperity prevail the harvest of the last summer be exceptionally abundant and the trade condition now prevail seem to promise a successful season to the merchant and the manufacturer and general employment to our work people the report of the secretary of the treasury for the fiscal year end june 30 1889 have be prepare and will be present to congress it present with clearness the fiscal operation of the government and i avail myself of it to obtain some fact for use here the aggregate receipt from all source for the year be $ 387,050,058.84 derive as follow from customs$223 832 741.69from internal revenue130,881,513.92from miscellaneous sources32,335,803.23the ordinary expenditure for the same period be $ 281,996,615.60 and the total expenditure include the sink fund be $ 329,579,929.25 the excess of receipt over expenditure be after provide for the sink fund $ 57,470,129.59.for the current fiscal year the total revenue actual and estimated be $ 385,000,000 and the ordinary expenditure actual and estimate be $ 293,000,000 make with the sink fund a total expenditure of $ 341,321,116.99 leave an estimate surplus of $ 43,678,883.01.during the fiscal year there be apply to the purchase of bond in addition to those for the sink fund $ 90,456,172.35 and during the first quarter of the current year the sum of $ 37,838,937.77 all of which be credit to the sink fund the revenue for the fiscal year end june 30 1891 be estimate by the treasury department at $ 385,000,000 and the expenditure for the same period include the sink fund at $ 341,430,477.70 this show an estimate surplus for that year of $ 43,569,522.30 which be more likely to be increase than reduce when the actual transaction be write up the existence of so large an actual and anticipated surplus should have the immediate attention of congress with a view to reduce the receipt of the treasury to the need of the government as closely as may be the collection of money not need for public use impose an unnecessary burden upon our people and the presence of so large a surplus in the public vault be a disturbing element in the conduct of private business it have call into use expedient for put it into circulation of very questionable propriety we should not collect revenue for the purpose of anticipate our bond beyond the requirement of the sink fund but any unappropriated surplus in the treasury should be so used as there be no other lawful way of return the money to circulation and the profit realize by the government offer a substantial advantage the loaning of public fund to the bank without interest upon the security of government bond i regard as an unauthorized and dangerous expedient it result in a temporary and unnatural increase of the banking capital of favor locality and compel a cautious and gradual recall of the deposit to avoid injury to the commercial interest it be not to be expect that the bank have these deposit will sell their bond to the treasury so long as the present highly beneficial arrangement be continue they now practically get interest both upon the bond and their proceed no further use should be make of this method of get the surplus into circulation and the deposit now outstanding should be gradually withdraw and apply to the purchase of bond it be fortunate that such a use can be make of the exist surplus and for some time to come of any casual surplus that may exist after congress have take the necessary step for a reduction of the revenue such legislation should be promptly but very considerately enact i recommend a revision of our tariff law both in its administrative feature and in the schedule the need of the former be generally concede and an agreement upon the evil and inconvenience to be remedie and the good method for their correction will probably not be difficult uniformity of valuation at all our port be essential and effective measure should be take to secure it it be equally desirable that question affect rate and classification should be promptly decide the preparation of a new schedule of custom duty be a matter of great delicacy because of its direct effect upon the business of the country and of great difficulty by reason of the wide divergence of opinion as to the object that may properly be promote by such legislation some disturbance of business may perhaps result from the consideration of this subject by congress but this temporary ill effect will be reduce to the minimum by prompt action and by the assurance which the country already enjoy that any necessary change will be so make as not to impair the just and reasonable protection of our home industry the inequality of the law should be adjust but the protective principle should be maintain and fairly apply to the product of our farm as well as of our shop these duty necessarily have relation to other thing besides the public revenue we can not limit their effect by fix our eye on the public treasury alone they have a direct relation to home production to work to wage and to the commercial independence of our country and the wise and patriotic legislator should enlarge the field of his vision to include all of these the necessary reduction in our public revenue can i be sure be make without make the small burden more onerous than the large by reason of the disability and limitation which the process of reduction put upon both capital and labor the free list can very safely be extend by place thereon article that do not offer injurious competition to such domestic product as our home labor can supply the removal of the internal tax upon tobacco would relieve an important agricultural product from a burden which be impose only because our revenue from custom duty be insufficient for the public need if safe provision against fraud can be devise the removal of the tax upon spirit use in the art and in manufacture would also offer an unobjectionable method of reduce the surplus a table present by the secretary of the treasury show the amount of money of all kind in circulation each year from 1878 to the present time be of interest it appear that the amount of national bank note in circulation have decrease during that period $ 114,109,729 of which $ 37,799,229 be chargeable to the last year the withdrawal of bank circulation will necessarily continue under exist condition it be probable that the adoption of the suggestion make by the comptroller of the currency namely that the minimum deposit of bond for the establishment of bank be reduce and that an issue of note to the par value of the bond be allow would help to maintain the bank circulation but while this withdrawal of bank note have be go on there have be a large increase in the amount of gold and silver coin in circulation and in the issue of gold and silver certificate the total amount of money of all kind in circulation on march 1 1878 be $ 805,793,807 while on october 1 1889 the total be $ 1,405,018,000 there be an increase of $ 293,417,552 in gold coin of $ 57,554,100 in standard silver dollar of $ 72,311,249 in gold certificate of $ 276,619,715 in silver certificate and of $ 14,073,787 in united states note make a total of $ 713,976,403 there be during the same period a decrease of $ 114,109,729 in bank circulation and of $ 642,481 in subsidiary silver the net increase be $ 599,224,193 the circulation per capita have increase about $ 5 during the time cover by the table refer to the total coinage of silver dollar be on november 1 1889 $ 343,638,001 of which $ 283,539,521 be in the treasury vault and $ 60,098,480 be in circulation of the amount in the vault $ 277,319,944 be represent by outstanding silver certificate leave $ 6,219,577 not in circulation and not represent by certificate the law require the purchase by the treasury of $ 2,000,000 worth of silver bullion each month to be coin into silver dollar of 412 1/2 grain have be observe by the department but neither the present secretary nor any of his predecessor have deem it safe to exercise the discretion give by law to increase the monthly purchase to $ 4,000,000 when the law be enact february 28 1878 the price of silver in the market be $ 1.204 per ounce make the bullion value of the dollar 93 cent since that time the price have fall as low as 91.2 cent per ounce reduce the bullion value of the dollar to 70.6 cent within the last few month the market price have somewhat advanced and on the 1st day of november last the bullion value of the silver dollar be 72 cent the evil anticipation which have accompany the coinage and use of the silver dollar have not be realize as a coin it have not have general use and the public treasury have be compel to store it but this be manifestly owe to the fact that its paper representative be more convenient the general acceptance and the use of the silver certificate show that silver have not be otherwise discredit some favorable condition have contribute to maintain this practical equality in their commercial use between the gold and silver dollar but some of these be trade condition that statutory enactment do not control and of the continuance of which we can not be certain i think it be clear that if we should make the coinage of silver at the present ratio free we must expect that the difference in the bullion value of the gold and silver dollar will be take account of in commercial transaction and i fear the same result would follow any considerable increase of the present rate of coinage such a result would be discreditable to our financial management and disastrous to all business interest we should not tread the dangerous edge of such a peril and indeed nothing more harmful could happen to the silver interest any safe legislation upon this subject must secure the equality of the two coin in their commercial use i have always be an advocate of the use of silver in our currency we be large producer of that metal and should not discredit it to the plan which will be present by the secretary of the treasury for the issuance of note or certificate upon the deposit of silver bullion at its market value i have be able to give only a hasty examination owe to the press of other matter and to the fact that it have be so recently formulate the detail of such a law require careful consideration but the general plan suggest by he seem to satisfy the purpose to continue the use of silver in connection with our currency and at the same time to obviate the danger of which i have speak at a late day i may communicate far with congress upon this subject the enforcement of the chinese exclusion act have be find to be very difficult on the northwestern frontier chinaman land at victoria find it easy to pass our border owe to the impossibility with the force at the command of the custom officer of guard so long an inland line the secretary of the treasury have authorize the employment of additional officer who will be assign to this duty and every effort will be make to enforce the law the dominion exact a head tax of $ 50 for each chinaman land and when these person in fraud of our law cross into our territory and be apprehend our officer do not know what to do with they as the dominion authority will not suffer they to be send back without a second payment of the tax an effort will be make to reach an understanding that will remove this difficulty the proclamation require by section 3 of the act of march 2 1889 relate to the killing of seal and other fur bear animal be issue by i on the 21st day of march and a revenue vessel be dispatch to enforce the law and protect the interest of the united states the establishment of a refuge station at point barrow as direct by congress be successfully accomplish judge by modern standard we be practically without coast defense many of the structure we have would enhance rather than diminish the peril of their garrison if subject to the fire of improved gun and very few be so locate as to give full effect to the great range of such gun as we be now make for coast defense use this general subject have have consideration in congress for some year and the appropriation for the construction of large rifle gun make one year ago be i be sure the expression of a purpose to provide suitable work in which these gun might be mount an appropriation now make for that purpose would not advance the completion of the work beyond our ability to supply they with fairly effective gun the security of our coast city against foreign attack should not rest altogether in the friendly disposition of other nation there should be a second line wholly in our own keeping i very urgently recommend an appropriation at this session for the construction of such work in our most expose harbor i approve the suggestion of the secretary of war that provision be make for encamp company of the national guard in our coast work for a specify time each year and for their training in the use of heavy gun his suggestion that an increase of the artillery force of the army be desirable be also in this connection commend to the consideration of congress the improvement of our important river and harbor should be promote by the necessary appropriation care should be take that the government be not commit to the prosecution of work not of public and general advantage and that the relative usefulness of work of that class be not overlook so far as this work can ever be say to be complete i do not doubt that the end would be soon and more economically reach if few separate work be undertake at the same time and those select for their great general interest be more rapidly push to completion a work once considerably begin should not be subject to the risk and deterioration which interrupt or insufficient appropriation necessarily occasion the assault make by david s. terry upon the person of justice field of the supreme court of the united states at lathtop cal in august last and the killing of the assailant by a deputy united states marshal who have be depute to accompany justice field and to protect he from anticipated violence at the hand of terry in connection with the legal proceeding which have follow suggest question which in my judgment be worthy of the attention of congress i recommend that more definite provision be make by law not only for the protection of federal officer but for a full trial of such case in the united states court in recommend such legislation i do not at all impeach either the general adequacy of the provision make by the state law for the protection of all citizen or the general good disposition of those charge with the execution of such law to give protection to the officer of the united states the duty of protect its officer as such and of punish those who assault they on account of their official act should not be devolve expressly or by acquiescence upon the local authority event which have be bring to my attention happen in other part of the country have also suggest the propriety of extend by legislation full protection to those who may be call as witness in the court of the united states the law compel those who be suppose to have knowledge of public offense to attend upon our court and grand jury and to give evidence there be a manifest result duty that these witness shall be protect from injury on account of their testimony the investigation of criminal offense be often render futile and the punishment of crime impossible by the intimidation of witness the necessity of provide some more speedy method for dispose of the case which now come for final adjudication to the supreme court become every year more apparent and urgent the plan of provide some intermediate court have final appellate jurisdiction of certain class of question and case have i think receive a more general approval from the bench and bar of the country than any other without attempt to discuss detail i recommend that provision be make for the establishment of such court the salary of the judge of the district court in many of the district be in my judgment inadequate i recommend that all such salary now below $ 5,000 per annum be increase to that amount it be quite true that the amount of labor perform by these judge be very unequal but as they can not properly engage in other pursuit to supplement their income the salary should be such in all case as to provide an independent and comfortable support earnest attention should be give by congress to a consideration of the question how far the restraint of those combination of capital commonly call trust be matter of federal jurisdiction when organize as they often be to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize the production or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity they be dangerous conspiracy against the public good and should be make the subject of prohibitory and even penal legislation the subject of an international copyright have be frequently commend to the attention of congress by my predecessor the enactment of such a law would be eminently wise and just our naturalization law should be so revise as to make the inquiry into the moral character and good disposition toward our government of the person apply for citizenship more thorough this can only be do by take full control of the examination by fix the time for hear such application and by require the presence of some one who shall represent the government in the inquiry those who be the avow enemy of social order or who come to our shore to swell the injurious influence and to extend the evil practice of any association that defy our law should not only be deny citizenship but a domicile the enactment of a national bankrupt law of a character to be a permanent part of our general legislation be desirable it should be simple in its method and inexpensive in its administration the report of the postmaster general not only exhibit the operation of the department for the last fiscal year but contain many valuable suggestion for the improvement and extension of the service which be commend to your attention no other branch of the government have so close a contact with the daily life of the people almost everyone use the service it offer and every hour gain in the transmission of the great commercial mail have an actual and possible value that only those engage in trade can understand the saving of one day in the transmission of the mail between new york and san francisco which have recently be accomplish be an incident worthy of mention the plan suggest of a supervision of the post office in separate district that shall involve instruction and suggestion and a rating of the efficiency of the postmaster would i have no doubt greatly improve the service a press necessity exist for the erection of a building for the joint use of the department and of the city post office the department be partially relieve by rent .outside quarter for a part of its force but it be again overcrowded the building use by the city office never be fit for the purpose and be now inadequate and unwholesome the unsatisfactory condition of the law relate to the transmission through the mail of lottery advertisement and remittance be clearly state by the postmaster general and his suggestion as to amendment should have your favorable consideration the report of the secretary of the navy show a reorganization of the bureaus of the department that will i do not doubt promote the efficiency of each in general satisfactory progress have be make in the construction of the new ship of war authorize by congress the first vessel of the new navy the dolphin be subject to very severe trial test and to very much adverse criticism but it be gratify to be able to state that a cruise around the world from which she have recently return have demonstrate that she be a first class vessel of her rate the report of the secretary show that while the effective force of the navy be rapidly increase by reason of the improve build and armament of the new ship the number of our ship fit for sea duty grow very slowly we have on the 4th of march last 37 serviceable ship and though 4 have since be add to the list the total have not be increase because in the meantime 4 have be lose or condemn twenty six additional vessel have be authorize and appropriate for but it be probable that when they be complete our list will only be increase to 42 -a gain of 5 the old wooden ship be disappear almost as fast as the new vessel be add these fact carry their own argument one of the new ship may in fighting strength be equal to two of the old but it can not do the cruise duty of two it be important therefore that we should have a more rapid increase in the number of serviceable ship i concur in the recommendation of the secretary that the construction of 8 armored ship 3 gunboat and 5 torpedo boat be authorize an appalling calamity befell three of our naval vessel on duty at the samoan islands in the harbor of apia in march last involve the loss of 4 officer and 47 seaman of two vessel the trenton and the vandalia and the disabling of a third the nipsic three vessel of the german navy also in the harbor share with our ship the force of the hurricane and suffer even more heavily while mourn the brave officer and man who died face with high resolve peril great than those of battle it be most gratifying to state that the credit of the american navy for seamanship courage and generosity be magnificently sustain in the storm beat harbor of apia the report of the secretary of the interior exhibit the transaction of the government with the indian tribe substantial progress have be make in the education of the child of school age and in the allotment of land to adult indians it be to be regret that the policy of break up the tribal relation and of deal with the indian as an individual do not appear early in our legislation large reservation hold in common and the maintenance of the authority of the chief and headman have deprive the individual of every incentive to the exercise of thrift and the annuity have contribute an affirmative impulse toward a state of confirm pauperism our treaty stipulation should be observe with fidelity and our legislation should be highly considerate of the good interest of an ignorant and helpless people the reservation be now generally surround by white settlement we can no long push the indian back into the wilderness and it remain only by every suitable agency to push he upward into the estate of a self support and responsible citizen for the adult the first step be to locate he upon a farm and for the child to place he in a school school attendance should be promote by every moral agency and those fail should be compel the national school for indians have be very successful and should be multiply and as far as possible should be so organized and conduct as to facilitate the transfer of the school to the states or territories in which they be locate when the indians in a neighborhood have accept citizenship and have become otherwise fit for such a transfer this condition of thing will be attain slowly but it will be hasten by keep it in mind and in the meantime that cooperation between the government and the mission school which have work much good should be cordially and impartially maintain the last congress enact two distinct law relate to negotiation with the sioux indians of dakota for a relinquishment of a portion of their land to the united states and for divide the remainder into separate reservation both be approve on the same day march 2 the one submit to the indians a specific proposition the other section 3 of the indian appropriation act authorize the president to appoint three commissioner to negotiate with these indians for the accomplishment of the same general purpose and require that any agreement make should be submit to congress for ratification on the 16th day of april last i appoint hon charles foster of ohio hon william warner of missouri and major general george crook of the united states army commissioner under the last name law they be however authorize and direct first to submit to the indians the definite proposition make to they by the act first mention and only in the event of a failure to secure the assent of the requisite number to that proposition to open negotiation for modify term under the other act the work of the commission be prolonged and arduous but the assent of the requisite number be it be understand finally obtain to the proposition make by congress though the report of the commission have not yet be submit in view of these fact i shall not as at present advise deem it necessary to submit the agreement to congress for ratification but it will in due course be submit for information this agreement release to the united states about 9,000,000 acre of land the commission provide for by section 14 of the indian appropriation bill to negotiate with the cherokee indians and all other indians own or claim land lie west of the ninety sixth degree of longitude for the cession to the united states of all such land be constitute by the appointment of hon lucius fairchild of wisconsin hon john f. hartranft of pennsylvania and hon alfred m. wilson of arkansas and organize on june 29 last their first conference with the representative of the cherokees be hold at tahlequah july 29 with no definite result general john f. hartranft of pennsylvania be prevent by ill health from take part in the conference his death which occur recently be justly and generally lament by a people he have serve with conspicuous gallantry in war and with great fidelity in peace the vacancy thus create be fill by the appointment of hon warren g. sayre of indiana a second conference between the commission and the cherokees be begin november 6 but no result have yet be obtain nor be it believe that a conclusion can be immediately expect the cattle syndicate now occupy the land for graze purpose be clearly one of the agency responsible for the obstruction of our negotiation with the cherokees the large body of agricultural land constitute what be know as the cherokee outlet ought not to be and indeed can not long be hold for graze and for the advantage of a few against the public interest and the good advantage of the indians themselves the united states have now under the treaty certain right in these land these will not be use oppressively but it can not be allow that those who by sufferance occupy these land shall interpose to defeat the wise and beneficent purpose of the government i can not but believe that the advantageous character of the offer make by the united states to the cherokee nation for a full release of these land as compare with other suggestion now make to they will yet obtain for it a favorable consideration under the agreement make between the united states and the muscogee or creek nation of indians on the 19th day of january 1889 an absolute title be secure by the united states to about 3,500,000 acre of land section 12 of the general indian appropriation act approve march 2 1889 make provision for the purchase by the united states from the seminole tribe of a certain portion of their land the delegate of the seminole nation having first duly evidence to i their power to act in that behalf deliver a proper release or conveyance to the united states of all the land mention in the act which be accept by i and certify to be in compliance with the statute by the term of both the act refer to all the land so purchase be declare to be a part of the public domain and open to settlement under the homestead law but of the land embrace in these purchase be in the aggregate about 5,500,000 acre 3,500,000 acre have already under the term of the treaty of 1866 be acquire by the united states for the purpose of settle other indian tribe thereon and have be appropriate to that purpose the land remain and available for settlement consist of 1,887,796 acre surround on all side by land in the occupancy of indian tribe congress have provide no civil government for the people who be to be invite by my proclamation to settle upon these land except as the new court which have be establish at muscogee or the united states court in some of the adjoining states have power to enforce the general law of the united states in this condition of thing i be quite reluctant to open the land to settlement but in view of the fact that several thousand person many of they with their family have gather upon the border of the indian territory with a view to secure homestead on the ceded land and that delay would involve they in much loss and suffering i do on the 23d day of march last issue a proclamation declare that the land therein describe would be open to settlement under the provision of the law on the 22d day of april follow at 12 o'clock noon two land district have be establish and the office be open for the transaction of business when the appoint time arrive it be much to the credit of the settler that they very generally observe the limitation as to the time when they might enter the territory care will be take that those who enter in violation of the law do not secure the advantage they unfairly seek there be a good deal of apprehension that the strife for location would result in much violence and bloodshed but happily these anticipation be not realize it be estimate that there be now in the territory about 60,000 people and several considerable town have spring up for which temporary municipal government have be organize guthrie be say to have now a population of almost 8,000 eleven school and nine church have be establish and three daily and five weekly newspaper be publish in this city whose charter and ordinance have only the sanction of the voluntary acquiescence of the people from day to day oklahoma city have a population of about 5,000 and be proportionately as well provide as guthrie with church school and newspaper other town and village have population of from 100 to 1,000 be scatter over the territory in order to secure the peace of this new community in the absence of civil government i direct general merritt command the department of the missouri to act in conjunction with the marshal of the united states to preserve the peace and upon their requisition to use the troop to aid they in execute warrant and in quiet any riot or breach of the peace that might occur he be far direct to use his influence to promote good order and to avoid any conflict between or with the settler believe that the introduction and sale of liquor where no legal restraint or regulation exist would endanger the public peace and in view of the fact that such liquor must first be introduce into the indian reservation before reach the white settlement i far direct the general commanding to enforce the law relate to the introduction of ardent spirit into the indian country the presence of the troop have give a sense of security to the well dispose citizen and have tend to restrain the lawless in one instance the officer in immediate command of the troop go far than i deem justifiable in support the de facto municipal government of guthrie and he be so informed and direct to limit the interference of the military to the support of the marshal on the line indicate in the original order i very urgently recommend that congress at once provide a territorial government for these people serious question which may at any time lead to violent outbreak be await the institution of court for their peaceful adjustment the american genius for self government have be well illustrate in oklahoma but it be neither safe nor wise to leave these people long to the expedient which have temporarily serve they provision should be make for the acquisition of title to town lot in the town now establish in alaska for locate town site and for the establishment of municipal government only the mining law have be extend to that territory and no other form of title to land can now be obtain the general land law be frame with reference to the disposition of agricultural land and it be doubtful if their operation in alaska would be beneficial we have fortunately not extend to alaska the mistaken policy of establish reservation for the indian tribe and can deal with they from the beginning as individual with i be sure well result but any disposition of the public land and any regulation relate to timber and to the fishery should have a kindly regard to their interest have no power to levy taxis the people of alaska be wholly dependent upon the general government to whose revenue the seal fishery make a large annual contribution an appropriation for education should neither be overlook nor stint the smallness of the population and the great distance between the settlement offer serious obstacle to the establishment of the usual territorial form of government perhaps the organization of several sub district with a small municipal council of limited power for each would be safe and useful attention be call in this connection to the suggestion of the secretary of the treasury relate to the establishment of another port of entry in alaska and of other need custom facility and regulation in the administration of the land law the policy of facilitate in every proper way the adjustment of the honest claim of individual settler upon the public land have be pursue the number of pende case have during the precede administration be greatly increase under the operation of order for a time suspend final action in a large part of the case originate in the west and northwest and by the subsequent use of unusual method of examination only those who be familiar with the condition under which our agricultural land have be settle can appreciate the serious and often fatal consequence to the settler of a policy that put his title under suspicion or delay the issuance of his patent while care be take to prevent and to expose fraud it should not be impute without reason the manifest purpose of the homestead and preemption law be to promote the settlement of the public domain by person have a bona fide intent to make a home upon the select land where this intent be well establish and the requirement of the law have be substantially comply with the claimant be entitle to a prompt and friendly consideration of his case but where there be reason to believe that the claimant be the mere agent of another who be seek to evade a law intend to promote small holding and to secure by fraudulent method large tract of timber and other land both principal and agent should not only be thwart in their fraudulent purpose but should be make to feel the full penalty of our criminal statute the law should be so administer as not to confound these two class and to visit penalty only upon the latter the unsettled state of the title to large body of land in the territories of new mexico and arizona have greatly retard the development of those territories provision should be make by law for the prompt trial and final adjustment before a judicial tribunal or commission of all claim base upon mexican grant it be not just to an intelligent and enterprise people that their peace should be disturb and their prosperity retard by these old contention i express the hope that difference of opinion as to method may yield to the urgency of the case the law now provide a pension for every soldier and sailor who be muster into the service of the united states during the civil war and be now suffer from wound or disease have an origin in the service and in the line of duty two of the three necessary fact viz muster and disability be usually susceptible of easy proof but the third origin in the service be often difficult and in many deserving case impossible to establish that very many of those who endure the hardship of our most bloody and arduous campaign be now disabled from disease that have a real but not traceable origin in the service i do not doubt besides these there be another class compose of man many of whom serve an enlistment of three full year and of reenliste veteran who add a fourth year of service who escape the casualty of battle and the assault of disease who be always ready for any detail who be in every battle line of their command and be muster out in sound health and have since the close of the war while fight with the same indomitable and independent spirit the contest of civil life be overcome by disease or casualty i be not unaware that the pension roll already involve a very large annual expenditure neither be i deter by that fact from recommend that congress grant a pension to such honorably discharge soldier and sailor of the civil war as having render substantial service during the war be now dependent upon their own labor for a maintenance and by disease or casualty be incapacitate from earn it many of the man who would be include in this form of relief be now dependent upon public aid and it do not in my judgment consist with the national honor that they shall continue to subsist upon the local relief give indiscriminately to pauper instead of upon the special and generous provision of the nation they serve so gallantly and unselfishly our people will i be sure very generally approve such legislation and i be equally sure that the survivor of the union army and navy will feel a grateful sense of relief when this worthy and suffer class of their comrade be fairly care for there be some manifest inequality in the exist law that should be remedie to some of these the secretary of the interior have call attention it be gratify to be able to state that by the adoption of new and well method in the war department the call of the pension office for information as to the military and hospital record of pension claimant be now promptly answer and the injurious and vexatious delay that have heretofore occur be entirely avoid this will greatly facilitate the adjustment of all pende claim the advent of four new states south dakota north dakota montana and washington into the union under the constitution in the same month and the admission of their duly choose representative to our national congress at the same session be an event as unexampled as it be interesting the certification of the vote cast and of the constitution adopt in each of the states be file with i as require by the eighth section of the act of february 22 1889 by the governor of say territories respectively have after a careful examination find that the several constitution and government be republican in form and not repugnant to the constitution of the united states that all the provision of the act of congress have be comply with and that a majority of the vote cast in each of say propose states be in favor of the adoption of the constitution submit therein i do so declare by a separate proclamation as to each as to north dakota and south dakota on saturday november 2 as to montana on friday november 8 and as to washington on monday november 11.each of these states have within it resource the development of which will employ the energy of and yield a comfortable subsistence to a great population the small of these new states washington stand twelfth and the large montana third among the forty two in area the people of these states be already well train intelligent and patriotic american citizen have common interest and sympathy with those of the old states and a common purpose to defend the integrity and uphold the honor of the nation the attention of the interstate commerce commission have be call to the urgent need of congressional legislation for the well protection of the life and limb of those engage in operate the great interstate freight line of the country and especially of the yardman and brakeman a petition sign by nearly 10,000 railway brakeman be present to the commission ask that step might be take to bring about the use of automatic brake and coupler on freight car at a meeting of state railroad commissioner and their accredited representative hold at washington in march last upon the invitation of the interstate commerce commission a resolution be unanimously adopt urge the commission to consider what can be do to prevent the loss of life and limb in couple and uncouple freight car and in handle the brake of such car during the year end june 30 1888 over 2,000 railroad employee be kill in service and more than 20,000 injure it be competent i think for congress to require uniformity in the construction of car use in interstate commerce and the use of improved safety appliance upon such train time will be necessary to make the need change but an earnest and intelligent beginning should be make at once it be a reproach to our civilization that any class of american workman should in the pursuit of a necessary and useful vocation be subject to a peril of life and limb as great as that of a soldier in time of war the creation of an executive department to be know as the department of agriculture by the act of february 9 last be a wise and timely response to a request which have long be respectfully urge by the farmer of the country but much remain to be do to perfect the organization of the department so that it may fairly realize the expectation which its creation excite in this connection attention be call to the suggestion contain in the report of the secretary which be herewith submit the need of a law officer for the department such as be provide for the other executive departments be manif the failure of the last congress to make the usual provision for the publication of the annual report should be promptly remedie the public interest in the report and its value to the farming community i be sure will not be diminish under the new organization of the department i recommend that the weather service be separate from the war department and establish as a bureau in the department of agriculture this will involve an entire reorganization both of the weather bureau and of the signal corps make of the first a purely civil organization and of the other a purely military staff corps the report of the chief signal officer show that the work of the corps on its military side have be deteriorate the interest of the people of the district of columbia should not be lose sight of in the pressure for consideration of measure affect the whole country have no legislature of its own either municipal or general its people must look to congress for the regulation of all those concern that in the states be the subject of local control our whole people have an interest that the national capital should be make attractive and beautiful and above all that its repute for social order should be well maintain the law regulate the sale of intoxicate drink in the district should be revise with a view to bring the traffic under stringent limitation and control in execution of the power confer upon i by the act make appropriation for the expense of the district of columbia for the year end june 30 1890 i do on the 17th day of august last appoint rudolph hering of new york samuel m. gray of rhode island and frederick p. stearns of massachusetts three eminent sanitary engineer to examine and report upon the system of sewerage exist in the district of columbia their report which be not yet complete will be in due course submit to congress the report of the commissioners of the district be herewith transmit and the attention of congress be call to the suggestion contain therein the proposition to observe the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of america by the opening of a world 's fair or exposition in some one of our great city will be present for the consideration of congress the value and interest of such an exposition may well claim the promotion of the general government on the 4th of march last the civil service commission have but a single member the vacancy be fill on the 7th day of may and since then the commissioners have be industriously though with an inadequate force engage in execute the law they be assure by i that a cordial support would be give they in the faithful and impartial enforcement of the statute and of the rule and regulation adopt in aid of it heretofore the book of eligible have be close to everyone except as certification be make upon the requisition of the appoint officer this secrecy be the source of much suspicion and of many charge of favoritism in the administration of the law what be secret be always suspect what be open can be judge the commission with the full approval of all its member have now open the list of eligible to the public the eligible list for the classified post office and custom house be now publicly post in the respective office as be also the certification for appointment the purpose of the civil service law be absolutely to exclude any other consideration in connection with appointment under it than that of merit as test by the examination the business proceed upon the theory that both the examine board and the appoint officer be absolutely ignorant as to the political view and association of all person on the civil service list it be not too much to say however that some recent congressional investigation have somewhat shake public confidence in the impartiality of the selection for appointment the reform of the civil service will make no safe or satisfactory advance until the present law and its equal administration be well establish in the confidence of the people it will be my pleasure as it be my duty to see that the law be execute with firmness and impartiality if some of its provision have be fraudulently evade by appoint officer our resentment should not suggest the repeal of the law but reform in its administration we should have one view of the matter and hold it with a sincerity that be not affect by the consideration that the party to which we belong be for the time in power my predecessor on the 4th day of january 1889 by an executive order to take effect march 15 bring the railway mail service under the operation of the civil service law provision be make that the order should take effect soon in any state where an eligible list be soon obtain on the 11th day of march mr. lyman then the only member of the commission report to i in write that it would not be possible to have the list of eligible ready before may 1 and request that the take effect of the order be postpone until that time which be do subject to the same provision contain in the original order as to states in which an eligible list be soon obtain as a result of the revision of the rule of the new classification and of the inclusion of the railway mail service the work of the commission have be greatly increase and the present clerical force be find to be inadequate i recommend that the additional clerk ask by the commission be appropriate for the duty of appointment be devolve by the constitution or by the law and the appoint officer be properly hold to a high responsibility in its exercise the growth of the country and the consequent increase of the civil list have magnify this function of the executive disproportionally it can not be deny however that the labor connect with this necessary work be increase often to the point of actual distress by the sudden and excessive demand that be make upon an incoming administration for removal and appointment but on the other hand it be not true that incumbency be a conclusive argument for continuance in office impartiality moderation fidelity to public duty and a good attainment in the discharge of it must be add before the argument be complete when those hold administrative office so conduct themselves as to convince just political opponent that no party consideration or bias affect in any way the discharge of their public duty we can more easily stay the demand for removal i be satisfied that both in and out of the classified service great benefit would accrue from the adoption of some system by which the officer would receive the distinction and benefit that in all private employment come from exceptional faithfulness and efficiency in the performance of duty i have suggest to the head of the executive departments that they consider whether a record might not be keep in each bureau of all those element that be cover by the term faithfulness and efficiency and a rating make show the relative merit of the clerk of each class this rating to be regard as a test of merit in make promotion i have also suggest to the postmaster general that he adopt some plan by which he can upon the basis of the report to the department and of frequent inspection indicate the relative merit of postmaster of each class they will be appropriately indicate in the official register and in the report of the department that a great stimulus would thus be give to the whole service i do not doubt and such a record would be the good defense against inconsiderate removal from office the interest of the general government in the education of the people find an early expression not only in the thoughtful and sometimes warn utterance of our able statesman but in liberal appropriation from the common resource for the support of education in the new states no one will deny that it be of the grave national concern that those who hold the ultimate control of all public affair should have the necessary intelligence wisely to direct and determine they national aid to education have heretofore take the form of land grant and in that form the constitutional power of congress to promote the education of the people be not seriously question i do not think it can be successfully question when the form be change to that of a direct grant of money from the public treasury such aid should be as it always have be suggest by some exceptional condition the sudden emancipation of the slave of the south the bestowal of the suffrage which soon follow and the impairment of the ability of the states where these new citizen be chiefly find to adequately provide educational facility present not only exceptional but unexampled condition that the situation have be much ameliorate there be no doubt the ability and interest of the states have happily increase but a great work remain to be do and i think the general government should lend its aid as the suggestion of a national grant in aid of education grow chiefly out of the condition and need of the emancipate slave and his descendant the relief should as far as possible while necessarily proceed upon some general line be apply to the need that suggest it it be essential if much good be to be accomplish that the sympathy and active interest of the people of the states should be enlist and that the method adopt should be such as to stimulate and not to supplant local taxation for school purpose as one congress can not bind a succeed one in such a case and as the effort must in some degree be experimental i recommend that any appropriation make for this purpose be so limited in annual amount and as to the time over which it be to extend as will on the one hand give the local school authority opportunity to make the good use of the first year 's allowance and on the other deliver they from the temptation to unduly postpone the assumption of the whole burden themselves the colored people do not intrude themselves upon we they be bring here in chain and hold in the community where they be now chiefly find by a cruel slave code happily for both race they be now free they have from a standpoint of ignorance and poverty which be our shame not theirs make remarkable advance in education and in the acquisition of property they have as a people show themselves to be friendly and faithful toward the white race under temptation of tremendous strength they have their representative in the national cemetery where a grateful government have gather the ashe of those who die in its defense they have furnish to our regular army regiment that have win high praise from their command officer for courage and soldierly quality and for fidelity to the enlistment oath in civil life they be now the toiler of their community make their full contribution to the widen stream of prosperity which these community be receive their sudden withdrawal would stop production and bring disorder into the household as well as the shop generally they do not desire to quit their home and their employer resent the interference of the emigration agent who seek to stimulate such a desire but notwithstanding all this in many part of our country where the colored population be large the people of that race be by various device deprive of any effective exercise of their political right and of many of their civil right the wrong do not expend itself upon those whose vote be suppress every constituency in the union be wrong it have be the hope of every patriot that a sense of justice and of respect for the law would work a gradual cure of these flagrant evil surely no one suppose that the present can be accept as a permanent condition if it be say that these community must work out this problem for themselves we have a right to ask whether they be at work upon it do they suggest any solution when and under what condition be the black man to have a free ballot when be he in fact to have those full civil right which have so long be his in law when be that equality of influence which our form of government be intend to secure to the elector to be restore this generation should courageously face these grave question and not leave they as a heritage of woe to the next the consultation should proceed with candor calmness and great patience upon the line of justice and humanity not of prejudice and cruelty no question in our country can be at rest except upon the firm base of justice and of the law i earnestly invoke the attention of congress to the consideration of such measure within its well define constitutional power as will secure to all our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and every other civil right under the constitution and law of the united states no evil however deplorable can justify the assumption either on the part of the executive or of congress of power not grant but both will be highly blamable if all the power grant be not wisely but firmly use to correct these evil the power to take the whole direction and control of the election of member of the house of representatives be clearly give to the general government a partial and qualified supervision of these election be now provide for by law and in my opinion this law may be so strengthen and extend as to secure on the whole well result than can be attain by a law take all the process of such election into federal control the colored man should be protect in all of his relation to the federal government whether as litigant juror or witness in our court as an elector for member of congress or as a peaceful traveler upon our interstate railway there be nothing more justly humiliating to the national pride and nothing more hurtful to the national prosperity than the inferiority of our merchant marine compare with that of other nation whose general resource wealth and seacoast line do not suggest any reason for their supremacy on the sea it be not always so and our people be agree i think that it shall not continue to be so it be not possible in this communication to discuss the cause of the decay of our shipping interest or the differ method by which it be propose to restore they the statement of a few well authenticate fact and some general suggestion as to legislation be all that be practicable that the great steamship line sail under the flag of england france germany spain and italy and engage in foreign commerce be .promote and have since be and now be liberally aid by grant of public money in one form or another be generally know that the american line of steamship have be abandon by we to an unequal contest with the aid line of other nation until they have be withdraw or in the few case where they be still maintain be subject to serious disadvantage be matter of common knowledge the present situation be such that traveler and merchandise find liverpool often a necessary intermediate port between new york and some of the south american capital the fact that some of the delegate from south american states to the conference of american nation now in session at washington reach our shore by reverse that line of travel be very conclusive of the need of such a conference and very suggestive as to the first and most necessary step in the direction of full and more beneficial intercourse with nation that be now our neighbor upon the line of latitude but not upon the line of establish commercial intercourse i recommend that such appropriation be make for ocean mail service in american steamship between our port and those of central and south america china japan and the important island in both of the great ocean as will be liberally remunerative for the service render and as will encourage the establishment and in some fair degree equalize the chance of american steamship line in the competition which they must meet that the american states lie south of we will cordially cooperate in establish and maintain such line of steamship to their principal port i do not doubt we should also make provision for a naval reserve to consist of such merchant ship of american construction and of a specified tonnage and speed as the owner will consent to place at the use of the government in case of need as armed cruiser england have adopt this policy and as a result can now upon necessity at once place upon her naval list some of the fast steamship in the world a proper supervision of the construction of such vessel would make their conversion into effective ship of war very easy i be an advocate of economy in our national expenditure but it be a misuse of term to make this word describe a policy that withhold an expenditure for the purpose of extend our foreign commerce the enlargement and improvement of our merchant marine the development of a sufficient body of train american seaman the promotion of rapid and regular mail communication between the port of other country and our own and the adaptation of large and swift american merchant steamship to naval use in time of war be public purpose of the high concern the enlarged participation of our people in the carrying trade the new and increase market that will be open for the product of our farm and factory and the full and well employment of our mechanic which will result from a liberal promotion of our foreign commerce insure the wide possible diffusion of benefit to all the states and to all our people everything be most propitious for the present inauguration of a liberal and progressive policy upon this subject and we should enter upon it with promptness and decision the legislation which i have suggest it be sincerely believe will promote the peace and honor of our country and the prosperity and security of the people i invoke the diligent and serious attention of congress to the consideration of these and such other measure as may be present have the same great end in view
to the senate and house of representatives

 the recommendation of this international conference of enlightened statesman will doubtless have the considerate attention of congress and its cooperation in the removal of unnecessary barrier to beneficial intercourse between the nation of america but while the commercial result which it be hope will follow this conference be worthy of pursuit and of the great interest they have excite it be believe that the crowning benefit will be find in the well security which may be devise for the maintenance of peace among all american nation and the settlement of all contention by method that a christian civilization can approve while view with interest our national resource and product the delegate will i be sure find a high satisfaction in the evidence of unselfish friendship which everywhere attend their intercourse with our people

 the report of the secretary of the treasury for the fiscal year end june 30 1889 have be prepare and will be present to congress it present with clearness the fiscal operation of the government and i avail myself of it to obtain some fact for use here
 the aggregate receipt from all source for the year be $ 387,050,058.84 derive as follow
 from custom $ 223 832 741.69
 from internal revenue 130,881,513.92
 from miscellaneous source 32,335,803.23
 the ordinary expenditure for the same period be $ 281,996,615.60 and the total expenditure include the sink fund be $ 329,579,929.25 the excess of receipt over expenditure be after provide for the sink fund $ 57,470,129.59
 for the current fiscal year the total revenue actual and estimated be $ 385,000,000 and the ordinary expenditure actual and estimate be $ 293,000,000 make with the sink fund a total expenditure of $ 341,321,116.99 leave an estimate surplus of $ 43,678,883.01
 during the fiscal year there be apply to the purchase of bond in addition to those for the sink fund $ 90,456,172.35 and during the first quarter of the current year the sum of $ 37,838,937.77 all of which be credit to the sink fund the revenue for the fiscal year end june 30 1891 be estimate by the treasury department at $ 385,000,000 and the expenditure for the same period include the sink fund at $ 341,430,477.70 this show an estimate surplus for that year of $ 43,569,522.30 which be more likely to be increase than reduce when the actual transaction be write up
 the existence of so large an actual and anticipated surplus should have the immediate attention of congress with a view to reduce the receipt of the treasury to the need of the government as closely as may be the collection of money not need for public use impose an unnecessary burden upon our people and the presence of so large a surplus in the public vault be a disturbing element in the conduct of private business it have call into use expedient for put it into circulation of very questionable propriety we should not collect revenue for the purpose of anticipate our bond beyond the requirement of the sink fund but any unappropriated surplus in the treasury should be so used as there be no other lawful way of return the money to circulation and the profit realize by the government offer a substantial advantage
 the loaning of public fund to the bank without interest upon the security of government bond i regard as an unauthorized and dangerous expedient it result in a temporary and unnatural increase of the banking capital of favor locality and compel a cautious and gradual recall of the deposit to avoid injury to the commercial interest it be not to be expect that the bank have these deposit will sell their bond to the treasury so long as the present highly beneficial arrangement be continue they now practically get interest both upon the bond and their proceed no further use should be make of this method of get the surplus into circulation and the deposit now outstanding should be gradually withdraw and apply to the purchase of bond it be fortunate that such a use can be make of the exist surplus and for some time to come of any casual surplus that may exist after congress have take the necessary step for a reduction of the revenue such legislation should be promptly but very considerately enact
 i recommend a revision of our tariff law both in its administrative feature and in the schedule the need of the former be generally concede and an agreement upon the evil and inconvenience to be remedie and the good method for their correction will probably not be difficult uniformity of valuation at all our port be essential and effective measure should be take to secure it it be equally desirable that question affect rate and classification should be promptly decide
 the preparation of a new schedule of custom duty be a matter of great delicacy because of its direct effect upon the business of the country and of great difficulty by reason of the wide divergence of opinion as to the object that may properly be promote by such legislation some disturbance of business may perhaps result from the consideration of this subject by congress but this temporary ill effect will be reduce to the minimum by prompt action and by the assurance which the country already enjoy that any necessary change will be so make as not to impair the just and reasonable protection of our home industry the inequality of the law should be adjust but the protective principle should be maintain and fairly apply to the product of our farm as well as of our shop these duty necessarily have relation to other thing besides the public revenue we can not limit their effect by fix our eye on the public treasury alone they have a direct relation to home production to work to wage and to the commercial independence of our country and the wise and patriotic legislator should enlarge the field of his vision to include all of these the necessary reduction in our public revenue can i be sure be make without make the small burden more onerous than the large by reason of the disability and limitation which the process of reduction put upon both capital and labor the free list can very safely be extend by place thereon article that do not offer injurious competition to such domestic product as our home labor can supply the removal of the internal tax upon tobacco would relieve an important agricultural product from a burden which be impose only because our revenue from custom duty be insufficient for the public need if safe provision against fraud can be devise the removal of the tax upon spirit use in the art and in manufacture would also offer an unobjectionable method of reduce the surplus
 a table present by the secretary of the treasury show the amount of money of all kind in circulation each year from 1878 to the present time be of interest it appear that the amount of national bank note in circulation have decrease during that period $ 114,109,729 of which $ 37,799,229 be chargeable to the last year the withdrawal of bank circulation will necessarily continue under exist condition it be probable that the adoption of the suggestion make by the comptroller of the currency namely that the minimum deposit of bond for the establishment of bank be reduce and that an issue of note to the par value of the bond be allow would help to maintain the bank circulation but while this withdrawal of bank note have be go on there have be a large increase in the amount of gold and silver coin in circulation and in the issue of gold and silver certificate
 the total amount of money of all kind in circulation on march 1 1878 be $ 805,793,807 while on october 1 1889 the total be $ 1,405,018,000 there be an increase of $ 293,417,552 in gold coin of $ 57,554,100 in standard silver dollar of $ 72,311,249 in gold certificate of $ 276,619,715 in silver certificate and of $ 14,073,787 in united states note make a total of $ 713,976,403 there be during the same period a decrease of $ 114,109,729 in bank circulation and of $ 642,481 in subsidiary silver the net increase be $ 599,224,193 the circulation per capita have increase about $ 5 during the time cover by the table refer to
 the total coinage of silver dollar be on november 1 1889 $ 343,638,001 of which $ 283,539,521 be in the treasury vault and $ 60,098,480 be in circulation of the amount in the vault $ 277,319,944 be represent by outstanding silver certificate leave $ 6,219,577 not in circulation and not represent by certificate
 the law require the purchase by the treasury of $ 2,000,000 worth of silver bullion each month to be coin into silver dollar of 412 1/2 grain have be observe by the department but neither the present secretary nor any of his predecessor have deem it safe to exercise the discretion give by law to increase the monthly purchase to $ 4,000,000 when the law be enact february 28 1878 the price of silver in the market be $ 1.204 per ounce make the bullion value of the dollar 93 cent since that time the price have fall as low as 91.2 cent per ounce reduce the bullion value of the dollar to 70.6 cent within the last few month the market price have somewhat advanced and on the 1st day of november last the bullion value of the silver dollar be 72 cent
 the evil anticipation which have accompany the coinage and use of the silver dollar have not be realize as a coin it have not have general use and the public treasury have be compel to store it but this be manifestly owe to the fact that its paper representative be more convenient the general acceptance and the use of the silver certificate show that silver have not be otherwise discredit some favorable condition have contribute to maintain this practical equality in their commercial use between the gold and silver dollar but some of these be trade condition that statutory enactment do not control and of the continuance of which we can not be certain
 i think it be clear that if we should make the coinage of silver at the present ratio free we must expect that the difference in the bullion value of the gold and silver dollar will be take account of in commercial transaction and i fear the same result would follow any considerable increase of the present rate of coinage such a result would be discreditable to our financial management and disastrous to all business interest we should not tread the dangerous edge of such a peril and indeed nothing more harmful could happen to the silver interest any safe legislation upon this subject must secure the equality of the two coin in their commercial use
 i have always be an advocate of the use of silver in our currency we be large producer of that metal and should not discredit it to the plan which will be present by the secretary of the treasury for the issuance of note or certificate upon the deposit of silver bullion at its market value i have be able to give only a hasty examination owe to the press of other matter and to the fact that it have be so recently formulate the detail of such a law require careful consideration but the general plan suggest by he seem to satisfy the purpose to continue the use of silver in connection with our currency and at the same time to obviate the danger of which i have speak at a late day i may communicate far with congress upon this subject
 the enforcement of the chinese exclusion act have be find to be very difficult on the northwestern frontier chinaman land at victoria find it easy to pass our border owe to the impossibility with the force at the command of the custom officer of guard so long an inland line the secretary of the treasury have authorize the employment of additional officer who will be assign to this duty and every effort will be make to enforce the law the dominion exact a head tax of $ 50 for each chinaman land and when these person in fraud of our law cross into our territory and be apprehend our officer do not know what to do with they as the dominion authority will not suffer they to be send back without a second payment of the tax an effort will be make to reach an understanding that will remove this difficulty
 the proclamation require by section 3 of the act of march 2 1889 relate to the killing of seal and other fur bear animal be issue by i on the 21st day of march and a revenue vessel be dispatch to enforce the law and protect the interest of the united states the establishment of a refuge station at point barrow as direct by congress be successfully accomplish
 judge by modern standard we be practically without coast defense many of the structure we have would enhance rather than diminish the peril of their garrison if subject to the fire of improved gun and very few be so locate as to give full effect to the great range of such gun as we be now make for coast defense use this general subject have have consideration in congress for some year and the appropriation for the construction of large rifle gun make one year ago be i be sure the expression of a purpose to provide suitable work in which these gun might be mount an appropriation now make for that purpose would not advance the completion of the work beyond our ability to supply they with fairly effective gun
 the security of our coast city against foreign attack should not rest altogether in the friendly disposition of other nation there should be a second line wholly in our own keeping i very urgently recommend an appropriation at this session for the construction of such work in our most expose harbor
 i approve the suggestion of the secretary of war that provision be make for encamp company of the national guard in our coast work for a specify time each year and for their training in the use of heavy gun his suggestion that an increase of the artillery force of the army be desirable be also in this connection commend to the consideration of congress
 the improvement of our important river and harbor should be promote by the necessary appropriation care should be take that the government be not commit to the prosecution of work not of public and general advantage and that the relative usefulness of work of that class be not overlook so far as this work can ever be say to be complete i do not doubt that the end would be soon and more economically reach if few separate work be undertake at the same time and those select for their great general interest be more rapidly push to completion a work once considerably begin should not be subject to the risk and deterioration which interrupt or insufficient appropriation necessarily occasion
 the assault make by david s. terry upon the person of justice field of the supreme court of the united states at lathtop cal in august last and the killing of the assailant by a deputy united states marshal who have be depute to accompany justice field and to protect he from anticipated violence at the hand of terry in connection with the legal proceeding which have follow suggest question which in my judgment be worthy of the attention of congress
 i recommend that more definite provision be make by law not only for the protection of federal officer but for a full trial of such case in the united states court in recommend such legislation i do not at all impeach either the general adequacy of the provision make by the state law for the protection of all citizen or the general good disposition of those charge with the execution of such law to give protection to the officer of the united states the duty of protect its officer as such and of punish those who assault they on account of their official act should not be devolve expressly or by acquiescence upon the local authority
 event which have be bring to my attention happen in other part of the country have also suggest the propriety of extend by legislation full protection to those who may be call as witness in the court of the united states the law compel those who be suppose to have knowledge of public offense to attend upon our court and grand jury and to give evidence there be a manifest result duty that these witness shall be protect from injury on account of their testimony the investigation of criminal offense be often render futile and the punishment of crime impossible by the intimidation of witness
 the necessity of provide some more speedy method for dispose of the case which now come for final adjudication to the supreme court become every year more apparent and urgent the plan of provide some intermediate court have final appellate jurisdiction of certain class of question and case have i think receive a more general approval from the bench and bar of the country than any other without attempt to discuss detail i recommend that provision be make for the establishment of such court
 the salary of the judge of the district court in many of the district be in my judgment inadequate i recommend that all such salary now below $ 5,000 per annum be increase to that amount it be quite true that the amount of labor perform by these judge be very unequal but as they can not properly engage in other pursuit to supplement their income the salary should be such in all case as to provide an independent and comfortable support
 earnest attention should be give by congress to a consideration of the question how far the restraint of those combination of capital commonly call trust be matter of federal jurisdiction when organize as they often be to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize the production or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity they be dangerous conspiracy against the public good and should be make the subject of prohibitory and even penal legislation
 the subject of an international copyright have be frequently commend to the attention of congress by my predecessor the enactment of such a law would be eminently wise and just
 our naturalization law should be so revise as to make the inquiry into the moral character and good disposition toward our government of the person apply for citizenship more thorough this can only be do by take full control of the examination by fix the time for hear such application and by require the presence of some one who shall represent the government in the inquiry those who be the avow enemy of social order or who come to our shore to swell the injurious influence and to extend the evil practice of any association that defy our law should not only be deny citizenship but a domicile
 the enactment of a national bankrupt law of a character to be a permanent part of our general legislation be desirable it should be simple in its method and inexpensive in its administration
 the report of the postmaster general not only exhibit the operation of the department for the last fiscal year but contain many valuable suggestion for the improvement and extension of the service which be commend to your attention no other branch of the government have so close a contact with the daily life of the people almost everyone use the service it offer and every hour gain in the transmission of the great commercial mail have an actual and possible value that only those engage in trade can understand
 the saving of one day in the transmission of the mail between new york and san francisco which have recently be accomplish be an incident worthy of mention
 the plan suggest of a supervision of the post office in separate district that shall involve instruction and suggestion and a rating of the efficiency of the postmaster would i have no doubt greatly improve the service
 a press necessity exist for the erection of a building for the joint use of the department and of the city post office the department be partially relieve by rent .outside quarter for a part of its force but it be again overcrowded the building use by the city office never be fit for the purpose and be now inadequate and unwholesome
 the unsatisfactory condition of the law relate to the transmission through the mail of lottery advertisement and remittance be clearly state by the postmaster general and his suggestion as to amendment should have your favorable consideration
 the report of the secretary of the navy show a reorganization of the bureaus of the department that will i do not doubt promote the efficiency of each
 in general satisfactory progress have be make in the construction of the new ship of war authorize by congress the first vessel of the new navy the dolphin be subject to very severe trial test and to very much adverse criticism but it be gratify to be able to state that a cruise around the world from which she have recently return have demonstrate that she be a first class vessel of her rate
 the report of the secretary show that while the effective force of the navy be rapidly increase by reason of the improve build and armament of the new ship the number of our ship fit for sea duty grow very slowly we have on the 4th of march last 37 serviceable ship and though 4 have since be add to the list the total have not be increase because in the meantime 4 have be lose or condemn twenty six additional vessel have be authorize and appropriate for but it be probable that when they be complete our list will only be increase to 42 -a gain of 5 the old wooden ship be disappear almost as fast as the new vessel be add these fact carry their own argument one of the new ship may in fighting strength be equal to two of the old but it can not do the cruise duty of two it be important therefore that we should have a more rapid increase in the number of serviceable ship i concur in the recommendation of the secretary that the construction of 8 armored ship 3 gunboat and 5 torpedo boat be authorize
 an appalling calamity befell three of our naval vessel on duty at the samoan islands in the harbor of apia in march last involve the loss of 4 officer and 47 seaman of two vessel the trenton and the vandalia and the disabling of a third the nipsic three vessel of the german navy also in the harbor share with our ship the force of the hurricane and suffer even more heavily while mourn the brave officer and man who died face with high resolve peril great than those of battle it be most gratifying to state that the credit of the american navy for seamanship courage and generosity be magnificently sustain in the storm beat harbor of apia
 the report of the secretary of the interior exhibit the transaction of the government with the indian tribe substantial progress have be make in the education of the child of school age and in the allotment of land to adult indians it be to be regret that the policy of break up the tribal relation and of deal with the indian as an individual do not appear early in our legislation large reservation hold in common and the maintenance of the authority of the chief and headman have deprive the individual of every incentive to the exercise of thrift and the annuity have contribute an affirmative impulse toward a state of confirm pauperism
 our treaty stipulation should be observe with fidelity and our legislation should be highly considerate of the good interest of an ignorant and helpless people the reservation be now generally surround by white settlement we can no long push the indian back into the wilderness and it remain only by every suitable agency to push he upward into the estate of a self support and responsible citizen for the adult the first step be to locate he upon a farm and for the child to place he in a school
 school attendance should be promote by every moral agency and those fail should be compel the national school for indians have be very successful and should be multiply and as far as possible should be so organized and conduct as to facilitate the transfer of the school to the states or territories in which they be locate when the indians in a neighborhood have accept citizenship and have become otherwise fit for such a transfer this condition of thing will be attain slowly but it will be hasten by keep it in mind and in the meantime that cooperation between the government and the mission school which have work much good should be cordially and impartially maintain
 the last congress enact two distinct law relate to negotiation with the sioux indians of dakota for a relinquishment of a portion of their land to the united states and for divide the remainder into separate reservation both be approve on the same day march 2 the one submit to the indians a specific proposition the other section 3 of the indian appropriation act authorize the president to appoint three commissioner to negotiate with these indians for the accomplishment of the same general purpose and require that any agreement make should be submit to congress for ratification
 on the 16th day of april last i appoint hon charles foster of ohio hon william warner of missouri and major general george crook of the united states army commissioner under the last name law they be however authorize and direct first to submit to the indians the definite proposition make to they by the act first mention and only in the event of a failure to secure the assent of the requisite number to that proposition to open negotiation for modify term under the other act the work of the commission be prolonged and arduous but the assent of the requisite number be it be understand finally obtain to the proposition make by congress though the report of the commission have not yet be submit in view of these fact i shall not as at present advise deem it necessary to submit the agreement to congress for ratification but it will in due course be submit for information this agreement release to the united states about 9,000,000 acre of land
 the commission provide for by section 14 of the indian appropriation bill to negotiate with the cherokee indians and all other indians own or claim land lie west of the ninety sixth degree of longitude for the cession to the united states of all such land be constitute by the appointment of hon lucius fairchild of wisconsin hon john f. hartranft of pennsylvania and hon alfred m. wilson of arkansas and organize on june 29 last their first conference with the representative of the cherokees be hold at tahlequah july 29 with no definite result general john f. hartranft of pennsylvania be prevent by ill health from take part in the conference his death which occur recently be justly and generally lament by a people he have serve with conspicuous gallantry in war and with great fidelity in peace the vacancy thus create be fill by the appointment of hon warren g. sayre of indiana
 a second conference between the commission and the cherokees be begin november 6 but no result have yet be obtain nor be it believe that a conclusion can be immediately expect the cattle syndicate now occupy the land for graze purpose be clearly one of the agency responsible for the obstruction of our negotiation with the cherokees the large body of agricultural land constitute what be know as the cherokee outlet ought not to be and indeed can not long be hold for graze and for the advantage of a few against the public interest and the good advantage of the indians themselves the united states have now under the treaty certain right in these land these will not be use oppressively but it can not be allow that those who by sufferance occupy these land shall interpose to defeat the wise and beneficent purpose of the government i can not but believe that the advantageous character of the offer make by the united states to the cherokee nation for a full release of these land as compare with other suggestion now make to they will yet obtain for it a favorable consideration
 under the agreement make between the united states and the muscogee or creek nation of indians on the 19th day of january 1889 an absolute title be secure by the united states to about 3,500,000 acre of land section 12 of the general indian appropriation act approve march 2 1889 make provision for the purchase by the united states from the seminole tribe of a certain portion of their land the delegate of the seminole nation having first duly evidence to i their power to act in that behalf deliver a proper release or conveyance to the united states of all the land mention in the act which be accept by i and certify to be in compliance with the statute
 by the term of both the act refer to all the land so purchase be declare to be a part of the public domain and open to settlement under the homestead law but of the land embrace in these purchase be in the aggregate about 5,500,000 acre 3,500,000 acre have already under the term of the treaty of 1866 be acquire by the united states for the purpose of settle other indian tribe thereon and have be appropriate to that purpose the land remain and available for settlement consist of 1,887,796 acre surround on all side by land in the occupancy of indian tribe congress have provide no civil government for the people who be to be invite by my proclamation to settle upon these land except as the new court which have be establish at muscogee or the united states court in some of the adjoining states have power to enforce the general law of the united states
 in this condition of thing i be quite reluctant to open the land to settlement but in view of the fact that several thousand person many of they with their family have gather upon the border of the indian territory with a view to secure homestead on the ceded land and that delay would involve they in much loss and suffering i do on the 23d day of march last issue a proclamation declare that the land therein describe would be open to settlement under the provision of the law on the 22d day of april follow at 12 o&#39;clock noon two land district have be establish and the office be open for the transaction of business when the appoint time arrive
 it be much to the credit of the settler that they very generally observe the limitation as to the time when they might enter the territory care will be take that those who enter in violation of the law do not secure the advantage they unfairly seek there be a good deal of apprehension that the strife for location would result in much violence and bloodshed but happily these anticipation be not realize it be estimate that there be now in the territory about 60,000 people and several considerable town have spring up for which temporary municipal government have be organize guthrie be say to have now a population of almost 8,000 eleven school and nine church have be establish and three daily and five weekly newspaper be publish in this city whose charter and ordinance have only the sanction of the voluntary acquiescence of the people from day to day
 oklahoma city have a population of about 5,000 and be proportionately as well provide as guthrie with church school and newspaper other town and village have population of from 100 to 1,000 be scatter over the territory
 in order to secure the peace of this new community in the absence of civil government i direct general merritt command the department of the missouri to act in conjunction with the marshal of the united states to preserve the peace and upon their requisition to use the troop to aid they in execute warrant and in quiet any riot or breach of the peace that might occur he be far direct to use his influence to promote good order and to avoid any conflict between or with the settler believe that the introduction and sale of liquor where no legal restraint or regulation exist would endanger the public peace and in view of the fact that such liquor must first be introduce into the indian reservation before reach the white settlement i far direct the general commanding to enforce the law relate to the introduction of ardent spirit into the indian country
 the presence of the troop have give a sense of security to the well dispose citizen and have tend to restrain the lawless in one instance the officer in immediate command of the troop go far than i deem justifiable in support the de facto municipal government of guthrie and he be so informed and direct to limit the interference of the military to the support of the marshal on the line indicate in the original order i very urgently recommend that congress at once provide a territorial government for these people serious question which may at any time lead to violent outbreak be await the institution of court for their peaceful adjustment the american genius for self government have be well illustrate in oklahoma but it be neither safe nor wise to leave these people long to the expedient which have temporarily serve they
 provision should be make for the acquisition of title to town lot in the town now establish in alaska for locate town site and for the establishment of municipal government only the mining law have be extend to that territory and no other form of title to land can now be obtain the general land law be frame with reference to the disposition of agricultural land and it be doubtful if their operation in alaska would be beneficial
 we have fortunately not extend to alaska the mistaken policy of establish reservation for the indian tribe and can deal with they from the beginning as individual with i be sure well result but any disposition of the public land and any regulation relate to timber and to the fishery should have a kindly regard to their interest have no power to levy taxis the people of alaska be wholly dependent upon the general government to whose revenue the seal fishery make a large annual contribution an appropriation for education should neither be overlook nor stint
 the smallness of the population and the great distance between the settlement offer serious obstacle to the establishment of the usual territorial form of government perhaps the organization of several sub district with a small municipal council of limited power for each would be safe and useful
 attention be call in this connection to the suggestion of the secretary of the treasury relate to the establishment of another port of entry in alaska and of other need custom facility and regulation
 in the administration of the land law the policy of facilitate in every proper way the adjustment of the honest claim of individual settler upon the public land have be pursue the number of pende case have during the precede administration be greatly increase under the operation of order for a time suspend final action in a large part of the case originate in the west and northwest and by the subsequent use of unusual method of examination only those who be familiar with the condition under which our agricultural land have be settle can appreciate the serious and often fatal consequence to the settler of a policy that put his title under suspicion or delay the issuance of his patent while care be take to prevent and to expose fraud it should not be impute without reason
 the manifest purpose of the homestead and preemption law be to promote the settlement of the public domain by person have a bona fide intent to make a home upon the select land where this intent be well establish and the requirement of the law have be substantially comply with the claimant be entitle to a prompt and friendly consideration of his case but where there be reason to believe that the claimant be the mere agent of another who be seek to evade a law intend to promote small holding and to secure by fraudulent method large tract of timber and other land both principal and agent should not only be thwart in their fraudulent purpose but should be make to feel the full penalty of our criminal statute the law should be so administer as not to confound these two class and to visit penalty only upon the latter
 the unsettled state of the title to large body of land in the territories of new mexico and arizona have greatly retard the development of those territories provision should be make by law for the prompt trial and final adjustment before a judicial tribunal or commission of all claim base upon mexican grant it be not just to an intelligent and enterprise people that their peace should be disturb and their prosperity retard by these old contention i express the hope that difference of opinion as to method may yield to the urgency of the case
 the law now provide a pension for every soldier and sailor who be muster into the service of the united states during the civil war and be now suffer from wound or disease have an origin in the service and in the line of duty two of the three necessary fact viz muster and disability be usually susceptible of easy proof but the third origin in the service be often difficult and in many deserving case impossible to establish that very many of those who endure the hardship of our most bloody and arduous campaign be now disabled from disease that have a real but not traceable origin in the service i do not doubt besides these there be another class compose of man many of whom serve an enlistment of three full year and of reenliste veteran who add a fourth year of service who escape the casualty of battle and the assault of disease who be always ready for any detail who be in every battle line of their command and be muster out in sound health and have since the close of the war while fight with the same indomitable and independent spirit the contest of civil life be overcome by disease or casualty
 i be not unaware that the pension roll already involve a very large annual expenditure neither be i deter by that fact from recommend that congress grant a pension to such honorably discharge soldier and sailor of the civil war as having render substantial service during the war be now dependent upon their own labor for a maintenance and by disease or casualty be incapacitate from earn it many of the man who would be include in this form of relief be now dependent upon public aid and it do not in my judgment consist with the national honor that they shall continue to subsist upon the local relief give indiscriminately to pauper instead of upon the special and generous provision of the nation they serve so gallantly and unselfishly our people will i be sure very generally approve such legislation and i be equally sure that the survivor of the union army and navy will feel a grateful sense of relief when this worthy and suffer class of their comrade be fairly care for
 there be some manifest inequality in the exist law that should be remedie to some of these the secretary of the interior have call attention
 it be gratify to be able to state that by the adoption of new and well method in the war department the call of the pension office for information as to the military and hospital record of pension claimant be now promptly answer and the injurious and vexatious delay that have heretofore occur be entirely avoid this will greatly facilitate the adjustment of all pende claim

 the creation of an executive department to be know as the department of agriculture by the act of february 9 last be a wise and timely response to a request which have long be respectfully urge by the farmer of the country but much remain to be do to perfect the organization of the department so that it may fairly realize the expectation which its creation excite in this connection attention be call to the suggestion contain in the report of the secretary which be herewith submit the need of a law officer for the department such as be provide for the other executive departments be manif the failure of the last congress to make the usual provision for the publication of the annual report should be promptly remedie the public interest in the report and its value to the farming community i be sure will not be diminish under the new organization of the department
 i recommend that the weather service be separate from the war department and establish as a bureau in the department of agriculture this will involve an entire reorganization both of the weather bureau and of the signal corps make of the first a purely civil organization and of the other a purely military staff corps the report of the chief signal officer show that the work of the corps on its military side have be deteriorate
 the interest of the people of the district of columbia should not be lose sight of in the pressure for consideration of measure affect the whole country have no legislature of its own either municipal or general its people must look to congress for the regulation of all those concern that in the states be the subject of local control our whole people have an interest that the national capital should be make attractive and beautiful and above all that its repute for social order should be well maintain the law regulate the sale of intoxicate drink in the district should be revise with a view to bring the traffic under stringent limitation and control
 in execution of the power confer upon i by the act make appropriation for the expense of the district of columbia for the year end june 30 1890 i do on the 17th day of august last appoint rudolph hering of new york samuel m. gray of rhode island and frederick p. stearns of massachusetts three eminent sanitary engineer to examine and report upon the system of sewerage exist in the district of columbia their report which be not yet complete will be in due course submit to congress
 the report of the commissioners of the district be herewith transmit and the attention of congress be call to the suggestion contain therein
 the proposition to observe the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of america by the opening of a world&#39;s fair or exposition in some one of our great city will be present for the consideration of congress the value and interest of such an exposition may well claim the promotion of the general government
 on the 4th of march last the civil service commission have but a single member the vacancy be fill on the 7th day of may and since then the commissioners have be industriously though with an inadequate force engage in execute the law they be assure by i that a cordial support would be give they in the faithful and impartial enforcement of the statute and of the rule and regulation adopt in aid of it
 heretofore the book of eligible have be close to everyone except as certification be make upon the requisition of the appoint officer this secrecy be the source of much suspicion and of many charge of favoritism in the administration of the law what be secret be always suspect what be open can be judge the commission with the full approval of all its member have now open the list of eligible to the public the eligible list for the classified post office and custom house be now publicly post in the respective office as be also the certification for appointment the purpose of the civil service law be absolutely to exclude any other consideration in connection with appointment under it than that of merit as test by the examination the business proceed upon the theory that both the examine board and the appoint officer be absolutely ignorant as to the political view and association of all person on the civil service list it be not too much to say however that some recent congressional investigation have somewhat shake public confidence in the impartiality of the selection for appointment
 the reform of the civil service will make no safe or satisfactory advance until the present law and its equal administration be well establish in the confidence of the people it will be my pleasure as it be my duty to see that the law be execute with firmness and impartiality if some of its provision have be fraudulently evade by appoint officer our resentment should not suggest the repeal of the law but reform in its administration we should have one view of the matter and hold it with a sincerity that be not affect by the consideration that the party to which we belong be for the time in power
 my predecessor on the 4th day of january 1889 by an executive order to take effect march 15 bring the railway mail service under the operation of the civil service law provision be make that the order should take effect soon in any state where an eligible list be soon obtain on the 11th day of march mr. lyman then the only member of the commission report to i in write that it would not be possible to have the list of eligible ready before may 1 and request that the take effect of the order be postpone until that time which be do subject to the same provision contain in the original order as to states in which an eligible list be soon obtain
 as a result of the revision of the rule of the new classification and of the inclusion of the railway mail service the work of the commission have be greatly increase and the present clerical force be find to be inadequate i recommend that the additional clerk ask by the commission be appropriate for
 the duty of appointment be devolve by the constitution or by the law and the appoint officer be properly hold to a high responsibility in its exercise the growth of the country and the consequent increase of the civil list have magnify this function of the executive disproportionally it can not be deny however that the labor connect with this necessary work be increase often to the point of actual distress by the sudden and excessive demand that be make upon an incoming administration for removal and appointment but on the other hand it be not true that incumbency be a conclusive argument for continuance in office impartiality moderation fidelity to public duty and a good attainment in the discharge of it must be add before the argument be complete when those hold administrative office so conduct themselves as to convince just political opponent that no party consideration or bias affect in any way the discharge of their public duty we can more easily stay the demand for removal
 i be satisfied that both in and out of the classified service great benefit would accrue from the adoption of some system by which the officer would receive the distinction and benefit that in all private employment come from exceptional faithfulness and efficiency in the performance of duty
 i have suggest to the head of the executive departments that they consider whether a record might not be keep in each bureau of all those element that be cover by the term faithfulness and efficiency and a rating make show the relative merit of the clerk of each class this rating to be regard as a test of merit in make promotion
 i have also suggest to the postmaster general that he adopt some plan by which he can upon the basis of the report to the department and of frequent inspection indicate the relative merit of postmaster of each class they will be appropriately indicate in the official register and in the report of the department that a great stimulus would thus be give to the whole service i do not doubt and such a record would be the good defense against inconsiderate removal from office
 the interest of the general government in the education of the people find an early expression not only in the thoughtful and sometimes warn utterance of our able statesman but in liberal appropriation from the common resource for the support of education in the new states no one will deny that it be of the grave national concern that those who hold the ultimate control of all public affair should have the necessary intelligence wisely to direct and determine they national aid to education have heretofore take the form of land grant and in that form the constitutional power of congress to promote the education of the people be not seriously question i do not think it can be successfully question when the form be change to that of a direct grant of money from the public treasury
 such aid should be as it always have be suggest by some exceptional condition the sudden emancipation of the slave of the south the bestowal of the suffrage which soon follow and the impairment of the ability of the states where these new citizen be chiefly find to adequately provide educational facility present not only exceptional but unexampled condition that the situation have be much ameliorate there be no doubt the ability and interest of the states have happily increase
 but a great work remain to be do and i think the general government should lend its aid as the suggestion of a national grant in aid of education grow chiefly out of the condition and need of the emancipate slave and his descendant the relief should as far as possible while necessarily proceed upon some general line be apply to the need that suggest it it be essential if much good be to be accomplish that the sympathy and active interest of the people of the states should be enlist and that the method adopt should be such as to stimulate and not to supplant local taxation for school purpose
 as one congress can not bind a succeed one in such a case and as the effort must in some degree be experimental i recommend that any appropriation make for this purpose be so limited in annual amount and as to the time over which it be to extend as will on the one hand give the local school authority opportunity to make the good use of the first year&#39;s allowance and on the other deliver they from the temptation to unduly postpone the assumption of the whole burden themselves
 the colored people do not intrude themselves upon we they be bring here in chain and hold in the community where they be now chiefly find by a cruel slave code happily for both race they be now free they have from a standpoint of ignorance and poverty which be our shame not theirs make remarkable advance in education and in the acquisition of property they have as a people show themselves to be friendly and faithful toward the white race under temptation of tremendous strength they have their representative in the national cemetery where a grateful government have gather the ashe of those who die in its defense they have furnish to our regular army regiment that have win high praise from their command officer for courage and soldierly quality and for fidelity to the enlistment oath in civil life they be now the toiler of their community make their full contribution to the widen stream of prosperity which these community be receive their sudden withdrawal would stop production and bring disorder into the household as well as the shop generally they do not desire to quit their home and their employer resent the interference of the emigration agent who seek to stimulate such a desire
 but notwithstanding all this in many part of our country where the colored population be large the people of that race be by various device deprive of any effective exercise of their political right and of many of their civil right the wrong do not expend itself upon those whose vote be suppress every constituency in the union be wrong
 it have be the hope of every patriot that a sense of justice and of respect for the law would work a gradual cure of these flagrant evil surely no one suppose that the present can be accept as a permanent condition if it be say that these community must work out this problem for themselves we have a right to ask whether they be at work upon it do they suggest any solution when and under what condition be the black man to have a free ballot when be he in fact to have those full civil right which have so long be his in law when be that equality of influence which our form of government be intend to secure to the elector to be restore this generation should courageously face these grave question and not leave they as a heritage of woe to the next the consultation should proceed with candor calmness and great patience upon the line of justice and humanity not of prejudice and cruelty no question in our country can be at rest except upon the firm base of justice and of the law
 i earnestly invoke the attention of congress to the consideration of such measure within its well define constitutional power as will secure to all our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and every other civil right under the constitution and law of the united states no evil however deplorable can justify the assumption either on the part of the executive or of congress of power not grant but both will be highly blamable if all the power grant be not wisely but firmly use to correct these evil the power to take the whole direction and control of the election of member of the house of representatives be clearly give to the general government a partial and qualified supervision of these election be now provide for by law and in my opinion this law may be so strengthen and extend as to secure on the whole well result than can be attain by a law take all the process of such election into federal control the colored man should be protect in all of his relation to the federal government whether as litigant juror or witness in our court as an elector for member of congress or as a peaceful traveler upon our interstate railway
 there be nothing more justly humiliating to the national pride and nothing more hurtful to the national prosperity than the inferiority of our merchant marine compare with that of other nation whose general resource wealth and seacoast line do not suggest any reason for their supremacy on the sea it be not always so and our people be agree i think that it shall not continue to be so it be not possible in this communication to discuss the cause of the decay of our shipping interest or the differ method by which it be propose to restore they the statement of a few well authenticate fact and some general suggestion as to legislation be all that be practicable that the great steamship line sail under the flag of england france germany spain and italy and engage in foreign commerce be .promote and have since be and now be liberally aid by grant of public money in one form or another be generally know that the american line of steamship have be abandon by we to an unequal contest with the aid line of other nation until they have be withdraw or in the few case where they be still maintain be subject to serious disadvantage be matter of common knowledge
 the present situation be such that traveler and merchandise find liverpool often a necessary intermediate port between new york and some of the south american capital the fact that some of the delegate from south american states to the conference of american nation now in session at washington reach our shore by reverse that line of travel be very conclusive of the need of such a conference and very suggestive as to the first and most necessary step in the direction of full and more beneficial intercourse with nation that be now our neighbor upon the line of latitude but not upon the line of establish commercial intercourse
 i recommend that such appropriation be make for ocean mail service in american steamship between our port and those of central and south america china japan and the important island in both of the great ocean as will be liberally remunerative for the service render and as will encourage the establishment and in some fair degree equalize the chance of american steamship line in the competition which they must meet that the american states lie south of we will cordially cooperate in establish and maintain such line of steamship to their principal port i do not doubt
 we should also make provision for a naval reserve to consist of such merchant ship of american construction and of a specified tonnage and speed as the owner will consent to place at the use of the government in case of need as armed cruiser england have adopt this policy and as a result can now upon necessity at once place upon her naval list some of the fast steamship in the world a proper supervision of the construction of such vessel would make their conversion into effective ship of war very easy
 i be an advocate of economy in our national expenditure but it be a misuse of term to make this word describe a policy that withhold an expenditure for the purpose of extend our foreign commerce the enlargement and improvement of our merchant marine the development of a sufficient body of train american seaman the promotion of rapid and regular mail communication between the port of other country and our own and the adaptation of large and swift american merchant steamship to naval use in time of war be public purpose of the high concern the enlarged participation of our people in the carrying trade the new and increase market that will be open for the product of our farm and factory and the full and well employment of our mechanic which will result from a liberal promotion of our foreign commerce insure the wide possible diffusion of benefit to all the states and to all our people everything be most propitious for the present inauguration of a liberal and progressive policy upon this subject and we should enter upon it with promptness and decision
 the legislation which i have suggest it be sincerely believe will promote the peace and honor of our country and the prosperity and security of the people i invoke the diligent and serious attention of congress to the consideration of these and such other measure as may be present have the same great end in view

gentleman
 i find in this parting call of the delegate of the conference of american states both pain and pleasure i participate in the regret which the delegate from the united states feel who be to part with those from other country i take pleasure in the knowledge of the fact that your labor have be bring to a happy conclusion the difference of opinion have be happily reconcile i remark with pleasure the proposition which will be productive of peace among the american states represent in the conference it will be without excuse if one of they shall lift a hostile hand against the other we give you the other day a review of the small detachment of the american army not to show you that we have an army but that we have none that our security be lodge with our people and that they be safe

mr. chairman and fellow citizen
 i thank you most sincerely for this cordial greeting but i shall not be betray by it into a lengthy speech the selection of this day for these exercise a day consecrate to the memory of those who die that there might be one flag of honor and authority in this republic be most fitting that one flag encircle we with its fold to day the unrivaled object of our loyal love
 this monument so impose and tasteful fittingly typify the grand and symmetrical character of he in whose honor it have be build his be the arduous greatness of thing do no friendly hand construct and place for his ambition a ladder upon which he might climb his own brave hand frame and nail the cleat upon which he climb to the height of public usefulness and fame he never cease to be student and instructor turn from peaceful pursuit to army service he quickly master tactic and strategy and in a brief army career teach some valuable lesson in military science turn again from the field to the council of the state he stand among the great debater that have make our national congress illustrious what he might have be or do as president of the united states be chiefly leave to friendly augury base upon a career that have no incident of failure or inadequacy the cruel circumstance attend his death have but one amelioration that space of life be give he to teach from his die bed a great lesson of patience and forbearance his mortal part will find honorable rest here but the lesson of his life and death will continue to be instructive and inspiring incident in american history

to the senate and house of representatives
 i transmit herewith for your information a letter from the secretary of state inclose a report of the international american conference which recommend that reciprocal commercial treaty be enter into between the united states and the several other republics of this hemisphere
 it have be so often and so persistently state that our tariff law offer an insurmountable barrier to a large exchange of product with the latin american nation that i deem it proper to call especial attention to the fact that more than 87 per cent of the product of those nation send to our port be now admit free if sugar be place upon the free list practically every important article export from those states will be give untaxe access to our market except wool the real difficulty in the way of negotiate profitable reciprocity treaty be that we have give freely so much that would have have value in the mutual concession which such treaty imply i can not doubt however that the present advantage which the product of these near and friendly states enjoy in our market though they be not by law exclusive will with other consideration favorably dispose they to adopt such measure by treaty or otherwise as will tend to equalize and greatly enlarge our mutual exchange
 it will certainly be time enough for we to consider whether we must cheapen the cost of production by cheapen labor in order to gain access to the south american market when we have fairly try the effect of established and reliable steam communication and of convenient method of money exchange there can be no doubt i think that with these facility well establish and with a rebate of duty upon import raw material use in the manufacture of good for export our merchant will be able to compete in the port of the latin american nation with those of any other country
 if after the congress shall have act upon pende tariff legislation it shall appear that under the general treaty make power or under any special power give by law our trade with the states represent in the conference can be enlarge upon a basis of mutual advantage it will be promptly do

358,618,584.52 the postal receipt have not heretofore be include in the statement of these aggregate and for the purpose of comparison the sum of $ 60,882,097.92 should be deduct from both side of the

expenditure for the post office department be equal be not include in this statement on either side the act direct the purchase of silver bullion and the issue of treasury note thereon approve july 14 1890 have be administer by the secretary of the treasury with an earnest purpose to get into circulation at the early possible date the full monthly amount of treasury note contemplate by its provision and at the same time to give to the market for the silver bullion such support as the law contemplate the recent depreciation in the price of silver have be observe with regret the rapid rise in price which anticipate and follow the passage of the act be influence in some degree by speculation and the recent reaction be in part the result of the same cause and in part of the recent monetary disturbance some month of further trial will be necessary to determine the permanent effect of the recent legislation upon silver value but it be gratify to know that the increase circulation secure by the act have exert and will continue to exert a most beneficial influence upon business and upon general value while it have not be think well to renew formally the suggestion of an international conference look to an agreement touch the full use of silver for coinage at a uniform ratio care have be take to observe closely any change in the situation abroad and no favorable opportunity will be lose to promote a result which it be confidently believe would confer very large benefit upon the commerce of the world the recent monetary disturbance in england be not unlikely to suggest a reexamination of opinion upon this subject our very large supply of gold will if not lose by impulsive legislation in the suppose interest of silver give we a position of advantage in promote a permanent and safe international agreement for the free use of silver as a coin metal the effort of the secretary to increase the volume of money in circulation by keep down the treasury surplus to the low practicable limit have be unremitting and in a very high degree successful the table present by he show the increase of money in circulation during the last two decade and especially the table show the increase during the nineteen month he have administer the affair of the department be interesting and instructive the increase of money in circulation during the nineteen month have be in the aggregate $ 93,866,813 or about $ 1.50 per capita and of this increase only $ 7,100,000 be due to the recent silver legislation that this substantial and need aid give to commerce result in an enormous reduction of the public debt and of the annual interest charge be matter of increase satisfaction there have be purchase and redeem since march 4 1889 4 and 4 12 per cent bond to the amount of $ 211,832,450 at a cost of $ 246,620,741 result in the reduction of the annual interest charge of $ 8,967,609 and a total saving of interest of $ 51,576,706.i notice with great pleasure the statement of the secretary that the receipt from internal revenue have increase during the last fiscal year nearly $ 12,000,000 and that the cost of collect this large revenue be less by $ 90,617 than for the same purpose in the precede year the percentage of cost of collect the custom revenue be less for the last fiscal year than ever before the customs administration board provide for by the act of june 10 1890 be select with great care and be compose in part of man whose previous experience in the administration of the old custom regulation have make they familiar with the evil to be remedie and in part of man whose legal and judicial acquirement and experience seem to fit they for the work of interpret and apply the new statute the chief aim of the law be to secure honest valuation of all dutiable merchandise and to make these valuation uniform at all our port of entry it have be make manifest by a congressional investigation that a system of undervaluation have be long in use by certain class of importer result not only in a great loss of revenue but in a most intolerable discrimination against honesty it be not see how this legislation when it be understand can be regard by the citizen of any country have commercial dealing with we as unfriendly if any duty be suppose to be excessive let the complaint be lodge there it will surely not be claim by any well dispose people that a remedy may be seek and allow in a system of quasi smuggling the report of the secretary of war exhibit several gratifying result attain during the year by wise and unostentatious method the percentage of desertion from the army an evil for which both congress and the department have long be seek a remedy have be reduce during the past year 24 per cent and for the month of august and september during which time the favorable effect of the act of june 16 be feel 33 per cent as compare with the same month of 1889.the result attain by a reorganization and consolidation of the division have charge of the hospital and service record of the volunteer soldier be very remarkable this change be effect in july 1889 and at that time there be 40,654 case await attention more than half of these be call from the pension office for information necessary to the adjudication of pension claim on the 30th day of june last though over 300,000 new call have come in there be not a single case that have not be examine and answer i concur in the recommendation of the secretary that adequate and regular appropriation be continue for coast defense work and ordnance plan have be practically agree upon and there can be no good reason for delay the execution of they while the defenseless state of our great seaport furnish an urgent reason for wise expedition the encouragement that have be extend to the militia of the states generally and most appropriately designate the national guard should be continue and enlarge these military organization constitute in a large sense the army of the united states while about five sixth of the annual cost of their maintenance be defray by the states the report of the attorney general be under the law submit directly to congress but as the department of justice be one of the executive departments some reference to the work do be appropriate here a vigorous and in the main an effective effort have be make to bring to trial and punishment all violator of the law but at the same time care have be take that frivolous and technical offense should not be use to swell the fee of officer or to harass well dispose citizen especial attention be call to the fact connect with the prosecution of violation of the election law and of offense against united states officer the number of conviction secure very many of they upon plea of guilty will it be hope have a salutary restraining influence there have be several case where postmaster appoint by i have be subject to violent interference in the discharge of their official duty and to persecution and personal violence of the most extreme character some of these case have be deal with through the department of justice and in some case the post office have be abolish or suspend i have direct the postmaster general to pursue this course in all case where other effort fail to secure for any postmaster not himself in fault an opportunity peacefully to exercise the duty of his office but such action will not supplant the effort of the department of justice to bring the particular offender to punishment the vacation by judicial decree of fraudulent certificate of naturalization upon bill in equity file by the attorney general in the circuit court of the united states be a new application of a familiar equity jurisdiction nearly one hundred such decree have be take during the year the evidence disclose that a very large number of fraudulent certificate of naturalization have be issue and in this connection i beg to renew my recommendation that the law be so amend as to require a more full and search inquiry into all the fact necessary to naturalization before any certificate be grant it certainly be not too much to require that an application for american citizenship shall be hear with as much care and record with as much formality as be give to case involve the pettiest property right at the last session i return without my approval a bill entitle an act to prohibit bookmaking and pool selling in the district of columbia and state my objection to be that it do not prohibit but in fact license what it purport to prohibit an effort will be make under exist law to suppress this evil though it be not certain that they will be find adequate the report of the postmaster general show the most gratifying progress in the important work commit to his direction the business method have be greatly improve a large economy in expenditure and an increase of four and three quarter million in receipt have be realize the deficiency this year be $ 5,786,300 as against $ 6,350,183 last year notwithstanding the great enlargement of the service mail route have be extend and quicken and great accuracy and dispatch in distribution and delivery have be attain the report will be find to be full of interest and suggestion not only to congress but to those thoughtful citizen who may be interested to know what business method can do for that department of public administration which most nearly touch all our people the passage of the act to amend certain section of the revised statutes relate to lottery approve september 19 1890 have be receive with great and deserve popular favor the post office department and the department of justice at once enter upon the enforcement of the law with sympathetic vigor and already the public mail have be largely free from the fraudulent and demoralize appeal and literature emanating from the lottery company the construction and equipment of the new ship for the navy have make very satisfactory progress since march 4 1889 nine new vessel have be put in commission and during this winter four more include one monitor will be add the construction of the other vessel authorize be be push both in the government and private yard with energy and watch with the most scrupulous care the experiment conduct during the year to test the relative resist power of armor plate have be so valuable as to attract great attention in europe the only part of the work upon the new ship that be threaten by unusual delay be the armor plate and every effort be be make to reduce that to the minimum it be a source of congratulation that the anticipated influence of these modern vessel upon the esprit de corps of the officer and seaman have be fully realize confidence and pride in the ship among the crew be equivalent to a secondary battery your favorable consideration be invite to the recommendation of the secretary the report of the secretary of the interior exhibit with great fullness and clearness the vast work of that department and the satisfactory result attain the suggestion make by he be earnestly commend to the consideration of congress though they can not all be give particular mention here the several act of congress look to the reduction of the large indian reservation to the more rapid settlement of the indians upon individual allotment and the restoration to the public domain of land in excess of their need have be largely carry into effect so far as the work be confide to the executive agreement have be conclude since march 4 1889 involve the cession to the united states of about 14,726,000 acre of land these contract have as require by law be submit to congress for ratification and for the appropriation necessary to carry they into effect those with the sisseton and wahpeton sac and fox iowa pottawatomies and absentee shawnees and coeur d'alene tribe have not yet receive the sanction of congress attention be also call to the fact that the appropriation make in the case of the sioux indians have not cover all the stipulate payment this should be promptly correct if an agreement be confirm all of its term should be comply with without delay and full appropriation should be make the policy outline in my last annual message in relation to the patenting of land to settler upon the public domain have be carry out in the administration of the land office no general suspicion or imputation of fraud have be allow to delay the hearing and adjudication of individual case upon their merit the purpose have be to perfect the title of honest settler with such promptness that the value of the entry might not be swallow up by the expense and extortion to which delay subject the claimant the average monthly issue of agricultural patent have be increase about 6,000.the disability pension act which be approve on the 27th of june last have be put into operation as rapidly as be practicable the increase clerical force provide be select and assign to work and a considerable part of the force engage in examination in the field be recall and add to the work force of the office the examination and adjudication of claim have by reason of improved method be more rapid than ever before there be no economy to the government in delay while there be much hardship and injustice to the soldier the anticipated expenditure while very large will not it be believe be in excess of the estimate make before the enactment of the law this liberal enlargement of the general law should suggest a more careful scrutiny of bill for special relief both as to the case where relief be grant and as to the amount allow the increase number and influence of the non mormon population of utah be observe with satisfaction the recent letter of wilford woodruff president of the mormon church in which he advise his people to refrain from contract any marriage forbid by the law of the land have attract wide attention and it be hope that its influence will be highly beneficial in restrain infraction of the law of the united states but the fact should not be overlook that the doctrine or belief of the church that polygamous marriage be rightful and support by divine revelation remain unchanged president woodruff do not renounce the doctrine but refrain from teach it and advise against the practice of it because the law be against it now it be quite true that the law should not attempt to deal with the faith or belief of anyone but it be quite another thing and the only safe thing so to deal with the territory of utah as that those who believe polygamy to be rightful shall not have the power to make it lawful the admission of the states of wyoming and idaho to the union be event full of interest and congratulation not only to the people of those states now happily endow with a full participation in our privilege and responsibility but to all our people another belt of states stretch from the atlantic to the pacific the work of the patent office have win from all source very high commendation the amount accomplish have be very largely increase and all the result have be such as to secure confidence and consideration for the suggestion of the commissioner the enumeration of the people of the united states under the provision of the act of march 1 1889 have be complete and the result will be at once officially communicate to congress the completion of this decennial enumeration devolve upon congress the duty of make a new apportionment of representatives among the several states accord to their respective number "at the last session i have occasion to return with my objection several bill make provision for the erection of public building for the reason that the expenditure contemplate be in my opinion greatly in excess of any public need no class of legislation be more liable to abuse or to degenerate into an unseemly scramble about the public treasury than this there should be exercise in this matter a wise economy base upon some responsible and impartial examination and report as to each case under a general law the report of the secretary of agriculture deserve especial attention in view of the fact that the year have be mark in a very unusual degree by agitation and organization among the farmer look to an increase in the profit of their business it will be find that the effort of the department have be intelligently and zealously devote to the promotion of the interest intrust to its care a very substantial improvement in the market price of the lead farm product during the year be notice the price of wheat advance from 81 cent in october 1889 to $ 1.00 3/4 in october 1890 corn from 31 cent to 50 1/4 cent oat from 19 1/4 cent to 43 cent and barley from 63 cent to 78 cent meat show a substantial but not so large an increase the export trade in live animal and fowl show a very large increase the total value of such export for the year end june 30 1890 be $ 33,000,000 and the increase over the precede year be over $ 15,000,000 nearly 200,000 more cattle and over 45,000 more hog be export than in the precede year the export trade in beef and pork product and in dairy product be very largely increase the increase in the article of butter alone be from 15,504,978 pound to 29,748,042 pound and the total increase in the value of meat and dairy product export be $ 34,000,000 this trade so directly helpful to the farmer it be believe will be yet further and very largely increase when the system of inspection and sanitary supervision now provide by law be bring fully into operation the effort of the secretary to establish the healthfulness of our meat against the disparage imputation that have be put upon they abroad have result in substantial progress veterinary surgeon send out by the department be now allow to participate in the inspection of the live cattle from this country land at the english dock and during the several month they have be on duty no case of contagious pleuro pneumonia have be report this inspection abroad and the domestic inspection of live animal and pork product provide for by the act of august 30 1890 will afford as perfect a guaranty for the wholesomeness of our meat offer for foreign consumption as be anywhere give to any food product and its nonacceptance will quite clearly reveal the real motive of any continue restriction of their use and that having be make clear the duty of the executive will be very plain the information give by the secretary of the progress and prospect of the beet sugar industry be full of interest it have already pass the experimental stage and be a commercial success the area over which the sugar beet can be successfully cultivate be very large and another field crop of great value be offer to the choice of the farmer the secretary of the treasury concur in the recommendation of the secretary of agriculture that the official supervision provide by the tariff law for sugar of domestic production shall be transfer to the department of agriculture the law relate to the civil service have so far as i can learn be execute by those have the power of appointment in the classified service with fidelity and impartiality and the service have be increasingly satisfactory the report of the commission show a large amount of good work do during the year with very limited appropriation i congratulate the congress and the country upon the passage at the first session of the fifty first congress of an unusual number of law of very high importance that the result of this legislation will be the quickening and enlargement of our manufacturing industry large and well market for our breadstuff and provision both at home and abroad more constant employment and well wage for our work people and an increase supply of a safe currency for the transaction of business i do not doubt some of these measure be enact at so late a period that the beneficial effect upon commerce which be in the contemplation of congress have as yet but partially manifest themselves the general trade and industrial condition throughout the country during the year have show a marked improvement for many year prior to 1888 the merchandise balance of foreign trade have be largely in our favor but during that year and the year follow they turn against we it be very gratifying to know that the last fiscal year again show a balance in our favor of over $ 68,000,000 the bank clearing which furnish a good test of the volume of business transact for the first ten month of the year 1890 show as compare with the same month of 1889 an increase for the whole country of about 8.4 per cent while the increase outside of the city of new york be over 13 per cent during the month of october the clearing of the whole country show an increase of 3.1 per cent over october 1889 while outside of new york the increase be 11.5 per cent these figure show that the increase in the volume of business be very general throughout the country that this large business be be conduct upon a safe and profitable basis be show by the fact that there be 300 less failure report in october 1890 than in the same month of the precede year with liability diminish by about $ 5,000,000.the value of our export of domestic merchandise during the last year be over $ 115,000,000 great than the precede year and be only exceed once in our history about $ 100,000,000 of this excess be in agricultural product the production of pig iron always a good gauge of general prosperity be show by a recent census bulletin to have be 153 per cent great in 1890 than in 1880 and the production of steel 290 per cent great mining in coal have have no limitation except that result from deficient transportation the general testimony be that labor be everywhere fully employ and the report for the last year show a small number of employee affect by strike and lockout than in any year since 1884 the depression in the price of agricultural product have be greatly relieve and a buoyant and hopeful tone be begin to be feel by all our people these promising influence have be in some degree check by the surprising and very unfavorable monetary event which have recently take place in england it be gratify to know that these do not grow in any degree out of the financial relation of london with our people or out of any discredit attach to our security hold in that market the return of our bond and stock be cause by a money stringency in england not by any loss of value or credit in the security themselves we could not however wholly escape the ill effect of a foreign monetary agitation accompany by such extraordinary incident as characterize this it be not believe however that these evil incident which have for the time unfavorably affect value in this country can long withstand the strong safe and wholesome influence which be operate to give to our people profitable return in all branch of legitimate trade and industry the apprehension that our tariff may again and at once be subject to important general change would undoubtedly add a depressing influence of the most serious character the general tariff act have only partially go into operation some of its important provision be limit to take effect at date yet in the future the general provision of the law have be in force less than sixty day its permanent effect upon trade and price still largely stand in conjecture it be curious to note that the advance in the price of article wholly unaffected by the tariff act be by many hastily ascribe to that act notice be not take of the fact that the general tendency of the market be upward from influence wholly apart from the recent tariff legislation the enlargement of our currency by the silver bill undoubtedly give an upward tendency to trade and have a marked effect on price but this natural and desire effect of the silver legislation be by many erroneously attribute to the tariff act there be neither wisdom nor justice in the suggestion that the subject of tariff revision shall be again open before this law have have a fair trial it be quite true that every tariff schedule be subject to objection no bill be ever frame i suppose that in all of its rate and classification have the full approval even of a party caucus such legislation be always and necessarily the product of compromise as to detail and the present law be no exception but in its general scope and effect i think it will justify the support of those who believe that american legislation should conserve and defend american trade and the wage of american workman the misinformation as to the term of the act which have be so widely disseminate at home and abroad will be correct by experience and the evil augury as to its result confound by the market report the saving bank international trade balance and the general prosperity of our people already we begin to hear from abroad and from our customhouse that the prohibitory effect upon importation impute to the act be not justify the import at the port of new york for the first three week of november be nearly 8 per cent great than for the same period in 1889 and 29 per cent great than in the same period of 1888 and so far from be an act to limit export i confidently believe that under it we shall secure a large and more profitable participation in foreign trade than we have ever enjoy and that we shall recover a proportionate participation in the ocean carry trade of the world the criticism of the bill that have come to we from foreign source may well be reject for repugnancy if these critic really believe that the adoption by we of a free trade policy or of tariff rate have reference solely to revenue would diminish the participation of their own country in the commerce of the world their advocacy and promotion by speech and other form of organized effort of this movement among our people be a rare exhibition of unselfishness in trade and on the other hand if they sincerely believe that the adoption of a protective tariff policy by this country inure to their profit and our hurt it be noticeably strange that they should lead the outcry against the author of a policy so helpful to their countryman and crown with their favor those who would snatch from they a substantial share of a trade with other land already inadequate to their necessity there be no disposition among any of our people to promote prohibitory or retaliatory legislation our policy be adopt not to the hurt of other but to secure for ourselves those advantage that fairly grow out of our favor position as a nation our form of government with its incident of universal suffrage make it imperative that we shall save our work people from the agitation and distress which scant work and wage that have no margin for comfort always beget but after all this be do it will be find that our market be open to friendly commercial exchange of enormous value to the other great power from the time of my induction into office the duty of use every power and influence give by law to the executive department for the development of large market for our product especially our farm product have be keep constantly in mind and no effort have be or will be spare to promote that end we be under no disadvantage in any foreign market except that we pay our workman and workwoman well wage than be pay elsewhere well abstractly well relatively to the cost of the necessary of life i do not doubt that a very largely increase foreign trade be accessible to we without barter for it either our home market for such product of the farm and shop as our own people can supply or the wage of our work people in many of the product of wood and iron and in meat and breadstuff we have advantage that only need well facility of intercourse and transportation to secure for they large foreign market the reciprocity clause of the tariff act wisely and effectively open the way to secure a large reciprocal trade in exchange for the free admission to our port of certain product the right of independent nation to make special reciprocal trade concession be well establish and do not impair either the comity due to other power or what be know as the favor nation clause so generally find in commercial treaty what be give to one for an adequate agree consideration can not be claim by another freely the state of the revenue be such that we could dispense with any import duty upon coffee tea hide and the low grade of sugar and molasse that the large advantage result to the country produce and export these article by place they on the free list entitle we to expect a fair return in the way of custom concession upon article export by we to they be so obvious that to have gratuitously abandon this opportunity to enlarge our trade would have be an unpardonable error there be but two method of maintain control of this question open to congress to place all of these article upon the dutiable list subject to such treaty agreement as could be secure or to place they all presently upon the free list but subject to the reimposition of specified duty if the country from which we receive they should refuse to give to we suitable reciprocal benefit this latter method i think possess great advantage it express in advance the consent of congress to reciprocity arrangement affect these product which must otherwise have be delay and unascertaine until each treaty be ratify by the senate and the necessary legislation enact by congress experience have show that some treaty look to reciprocal trade have fail to secure a two third vote in the senate for ratification and other having pass that stage have for year await the concurrence of the house and senate in such modification of our revenue law as be necessary to give effect to their provision we now have the concurrence of both houses in advance in a distinct and definite offer of free entry to our port of specific article the executive be not require to deal in conjecture as to what congress will accept indeed this reciprocity provision be more than an offer our part of the bargain be complete delivery have be make and when the country from which we receive sugar coffee tea and hide have place on their free list such of our product as shall be agree upon as an equivalent for our concession a proclamation of that fact complete the transaction and in the meantime our own people have free sugar tea coffee and hide the indication thus far give be very hopeful of early and favorable action by the country from which we receive our large import of coffee and sugar and it be confidently believe that if steam communication with these country can be promptly improve and enlarge the next year will show a most gratifying increase in our export of breadstuff and provision as well as of some important line of manufactured good in addition to the important bill that become law before the adjournment of the last session some other bill of the high importance be well advanced toward a final vote and now stand upon the calendar of the two houses in favored position the present session have a fix limit and if these measure be not now bring to a final vote all the work that have be do upon they by this congress be lose the proper consideration of these of an apportionment bill and of the annual appropriation bill will require not only that no work day of the session shall be lose but that measure of minor and local interest shall not be allow to interrupt or retard the progress of those that be of universal interest in view of these condition i refrain from bring before you at this time some suggestion that would otherwise be make and most earnestly invoke your attention to the duty of perfect the important legislation now well advanced to some of these measure which seem to i most important i now briefly call your attention i desire to repeat with add urgency the recommendation contain in my last annual message in relation to the development of american steamship line the reciprocity clause of the tariff bill will be largely limited and its benefit retard and diminish if provision be not contemporaneously make to encourage the establishment of first class steam communication between our port and the port of such nation as may meet our overture for enlarge commercial exchange the steamship carry the mail statedly and frequently and offer to passenger a comfortable safe and speedy transit be the first condition of foreign trade it carry the order or the buyer but not all that be order or buy it give to the sailing vessel such cargo as be not urgent or perishable and indirectly at least promote that important adjunct of commerce there be now both in this country and in the nation of central and south america a state of expectation and confidence as to increase trade that will give a double value to your prompt action upon this question the present situation of our mail communication with australia illustrate the importance of early action by congress the oceanic steamship company maintain a line of steamer between san francisco sydney and auckland consist of three vessel two of which be of united states registry and one of foreign registry for the service do by this line in carry the mail we pay annually the sum of $ 46,000 be as estimate the full sea and united states inland postage which be the limit fix by law the colony of new south wales and new zealand have be pay annually to these line lbs 37,000 for carry the mail from sydney and auckland to san francisco the contract under which this payment have be make be now about to expire and those colony have refuse to renew the contract unless the united states shall pay a more equitable proportion of the whole sum necessary to maintain the service i be advise by the postmaster general that the united states receive for carry the australian mail bring to san francisco in these steamer by rail to vancouver an estimate annual income of $ 75,000 while as i have state we be pay out for the support of the steamship line that bring this mail to we only $ 46,000 leave an annual surplus result from this service of $ 29,000 the trade of the united states with australia which be in a considerable part carry by these steamer and the whole of which be practically dependent upon the mail communication which they maintain be largely in our favor our total export of merchandise to australasian port during the fiscal year end june 30 1890 be $ 11,266,484 while the total import of merchandise from these port be only $ 4,277,676 if we be not willing to see this important steamship line withdraw or continue with vancouver substitute for san francisco as the american terminal congress should put it in the power of the postmaster general to make a liberal increase in the amount now pay for the transportation of this important mail the south atlantic and gulf port occupy a very favor position toward the new and important commerce which the reciprocity clause of the tariff act and the postal shipping bill be design to promote steamship line from these port to some northern port of south america will almost certainly effect a connection between the railroad system of the continent long before any continuous line of railroad can be put into operation the very large appropriation make at the last session for the harbor of galveston be justify as it seem to i by these consideration the great northwest will feel the advantage of trunk line to the south as well as to the east and of the new market open for their surplus food product and for many of their manufactured product i have occasion in may last to transmit to congress a report adopt by the international american conference upon the subject of the incorporation of an international american bank with a view to facilitate money exchange between the states represent in that conference such an institution would greatly promote the trade we be seek to develop i renew the recommendation that a careful and well guard charter be grant i do not think the power grant should include those ordinarily exercise by trust guaranty and safe deposit company or that more branch in the united states should be authorize than be strictly necessary to accomplish the object primarily in view namely convenient foreign exchange it be quite important that prompt action should be take in this matter in order that any appropriation for well communication with these country and any agreement that may be make for reciprocal trade may not be hinder by the inconvenience of make exchange through european money center or burden by the tribute which be an incident of that method of business the bill for the relief of the supreme court have after many year of discussion reach a position where final action be easily attainable and it be hope that any difference of opinion may be so harmonized as to save the essential feature of this very important measure in this connection i earnestly renew my recommendation that the salary of the judge of the united states district court be so readjust that none of they shall receive less than $ 5,000 per annum the subject of the unadjusted spanish and mexican land grant and the urgent necessity for provide some commission or tribunal for the trial of question of title grow out of they be twice bring by i to the attention of congress at the last session bill have be report from the proper committee in both houses upon the subject and i very earnestly hope that this congress will put an end to the delay which have attend the settlement of the dispute as to the title between the settler and the claimant under these grant these dispute retard the prosperity and disturb the peace of large and important community the governor of new mexico in his last report to the secretary of the interior suggest some modification of the provision of the pende bill relate to the small holding of farm land i commend to your attention the suggestion of the secretary of the interior upon this subject the enactment of a national bankrupt law i still regard as very desirable the constitution having give to congress jurisdiction of this subject it should be exercise and uniform rule provide for the administration of the affair of insolvent debtor the inconvenience result from the occasional and temporary exercise of this power by congress and from the conflict state code of insolvency which come into force intermediately should be remove by the enactment of a simple inexpensive and permanent national bankrupt law i also renew my recommendation in favor of legislation afford just copyright protection to foreign author on a footing of reciprocal advantage for our author abroad it may still be possible for this congress to inaugurate by suitable legislation a movement look to uniformity and increase safety in the use of coupler and brake upon freight train engage in interstate commerce the chief difficulty in the way be to secure agreement as to the good appliance simplicity effectiveness and cost be consider this difficulty will only yield to legislation which should be base upon full inquiry and impartial test the purpose should be to secure the cooperation of all well dispose manager and owner but the fearful fact that every year 's delay involve the sacrifice of 2,000 life and the maiming of 20,000 young man should plead both with congress and the manager against any needless delay the subject of the conservation and equal distribution of the water supply of the arid region have have much attention from congress but have not as yet be put upon a permanent and satisfactory basis the urgency of the subject do not grow out of any large present demand for the use of these land for agriculture but out of the danger that the water supply and the site for the necessary catch basin may fall into the hand of individual or private corporation and be use to render subservient the large area dependent upon such supply the owner of the water be the owner of the land however the title may run all unappropriated natural water source and all necessary reservoir site should be hold by the government for the equal use at fair rate of the homestead settler who will eventually take up these land the united states should not in my opinion undertake the construction of dam or canal but should limit its work to such survey and observation as will determine the water supply both surface and subterranean the area capable of irrigation and the location and storage capacity of reservoir this do the use of the water and of the reservoir site might be grant to the respective states or territories or to individual or association upon the condition that the necessary work should be construct and the water furnish at fair rate without discrimination the rate to be subject to supervision by the legislature or by board of water commissioner duly constitute the essential thing to be secure be the common and equal use at fair rate of the accumulate water supply it be almost well that these land should remain arid than that those who occupy they should become the slave of unrestrained monopoly control the one essential element of land value and crop result the use of the telegraph by the post office department as a means for the rapid transmission of write communication be i believe upon proper term quite desirable the government do not own or operate the railroad and it should not i think own or operate the telegraph line it do however seem to be quite practicable for the government to contract with the telegraph company as it do with railroad company to carry at specify rate such communication as the sender may designate for this method of transmission i recommend that such legislation be enact as will enable the post office department fairly to test by experiment the advantage of such a use of the telegraph if any intelligent and loyal company of american citizen be require to catalogue the essential human condition of national life i do not doubt that with absolute unanimity they would begin with free and honest election and it be gratify to know that generally there be a grow and nonpartisan demand for well election law but against this sign of hope and progress must be set the depressing and undeniable fact that election law and method be sometimes cunningly contrive to secure minority control while violence complete the shortcoming of fraud in my last annual message i suggest that the development of the exist law provide a federal supervision of congressional election offer an effective method of reform these abuse the need of such a law have manifest itself in many part of the country and its wholesome restraint and penalty will be useful in all the constitutionality of such legislation have be affirm by the supreme court its probable effectiveness be evidence by the character of the opposition that be make to it it have be denounce as if it be a new exercise of federal power and an invasion of the right of states nothing could be far from the truth congress have already fix the time for the election of member of congress it have declare that vote for member of congress must be by write or print ballot it have provide for the appointment by the circuit court in certain case and upon the petition of a certain number of citizen of election supervisor and make it their duty to supervise the registration of voter conduct by the state officer to challenge person offer to register to personally inspect and scrutinize the registry list and to affix their name to the list for the purpose of identification and the prevention of fraud to attend at election and remain with the box till they be all cast and count to attach to the registry list and election return any statement touch the accuracy and fairness of the registry and election and to take and transmit to the clerk of the house of representatives any evidence of fraudulent practice which may be present to they the same law provide for the appointment of deputy united states marshal to attend at the poll support the supervisor in the discharge of their duty and to arrest person violate the election law the provision of this familiar title of the revised statutes have be put into exercise by both the great political party and in the north as well as in the south by the filing with the court of the petition require by the law it be not therefore a question whether we shall have a federal election law for we now have one and have have for nearly twenty year but whether we shall have an effective law the present law stop just short of effectiveness for it surrender to the local authority all control over the certification which establish the prima facie right to a seat in the house of representatives this defect should be cure equality of representation and the parity of the elector must be maintain or everything that be valuable in our system of government be lose the qualification of an elector must be seek in the law net in the opinion prejudice or fear of any class however powerful the path of the elector to the ballot box must be free from the ambush of fear and the enticement of fraud the count so true and open that none shall gainsay it such a law should be absolutely nonpartisan and impartial it should give the advantage to honesty and the control to majority surely there be nothing sectional about this creed and if it shall happen that the penalty of law intend to enforce these right fall here and not there it be not because the law be sectional but because happily crime be local and not universal nor should it be forget that every law whether relate to election or to any other subject whether enact by the state or by the nation have force behind it the court the marshal or constable the posse comitatus the prison be all and always behind the law one can not be justly charge with unfriendliness to any section or class who seek only to restrain violation of law and of personal right no community will find lawlessness profitable no community can afford to have it know that the officer who be charge with the preservation of the public peace and the restraint of the criminal class be themselves the product of fraud or violence the magistrate be then without respect and the law without sanction the flood of lawlessness can not be leveed and make to run in one channel the killing of a united states marshal carry a writ of arrest for an election offense be full of prompt and suggestion to man who be pursue by a city marshal for a crime against life or property but it be say that this legislation will revive race animosity and some have even suggest that when the peaceful method of fraud be make impossible they may be supplant by intimidation and violence if the propose law give to any qualified elector by a hair 's weight more than his equal influence or detract by so much from any other qualified elector it be fatally impeach but if the law be equal and the animosity it be to evoke grow out of the fact that some elector have be accustom to exercise the franchise for other as well as for themselves then these animosity ought not to be confess without shame and can not be give any weight in the discussion without dishonor no choice be leave to i but to enforce with vigor all law intend to secure to the citizen his constitutional right and to recommend that the inadequacy of such law be promptly remedie if to promote with zeal and ready interest every project for the development of its material interest its river harbor mine and factory and the intelligence peace and security under the law of its community and its home be not accept as sufficient evidence of friendliness to any state or section i can not add connivance at election practice that not only disturb local result but rob the elector of other state and section of their most priceless political right the preparation of the general appropriation bill should be conduct with the great care and the close scrutiny of expenditure appropriation should be adequate to the need of the public service but they should be absolutely free from prodigality i venture again to remind you that the brief time remain for the consideration of the important legislation now await your attention offer no margin for waste if the present duty

 i congratulate the congress and the country upon the passage at the first session of the fifty first congress of an unusual number of law of very high importance that the result of this legislation will be the quickening and enlargement of our manufacturing industry large and well market for our breadstuff and provision both at home and abroad more constant employment and well wage for our work people and an increase supply of a safe currency for the transaction of business i do not doubt some of these measure be enact at so late a period that the beneficial effect upon commerce which be in the contemplation of congress have as yet but partially manifest themselves
 the general trade and industrial condition throughout the country during the year have show a marked improvement for many year prior to 1888 the merchandise balance of foreign trade have be largely in our favor but during that year and the year follow they turn against we it be very gratifying to know that the last fiscal year again show a balance in our favor of over $ 68,000,000 the bank clearing which furnish a good test of the volume of business transact for the first ten month of the year 1890 show as compare with the same month of 1889 an increase for the whole country of about 8.4 per cent while the increase outside of the city of new york be over 13 per cent during the month of october the clearing of the whole country show an increase of 3.1 per cent over october 1889 while outside of new york the increase be 11.5 per cent these figure show that the increase in the volume of business be very general throughout the country that this large business be be conduct upon a safe and profitable basis be show by the fact that there be 300 less failure report in october 1890 than in the same month of the precede year with liability diminish by about $ 5,000,000
 the value of our export of domestic merchandise during the last year be over $ 115,000,000 great than the precede year and be only exceed once in our history about $ 100,000,000 of this excess be in agricultural product the production of pig iron always a good gauge of general prosperity be show by a recent census bulletin to have be 153 per cent great in 1890 than in 1880 and the production of steel 290 per cent great mining in coal have have no limitation except that result from deficient transportation the general testimony be that labor be everywhere fully employ and the report for the last year show a small number of employee affect by strike and lockout than in any year since 1884 the depression in the price of agricultural product have be greatly relieve and a buoyant and hopeful tone be begin to be feel by all our people
 these promising influence have be in some degree check by the surprising and very unfavorable monetary event which have recently take place in england it be gratify to know that these do not grow in any degree out of the financial relation of london with our people or out of any discredit attach to our security hold in that market the return of our bond and stock be cause by a money stringency in england not by any loss of value or credit in the security themselves we could not however wholly escape the ill effect of a foreign monetary agitation accompany by such extraordinary incident as characterize this it be not believe however that these evil incident which have for the time unfavorably affect value in this country can long withstand the strong safe and wholesome influence which be operate to give to our people profitable return in all branch of legitimate trade and industry the apprehension that our tariff may again and at once be subject to important general change would undoubtedly add a depressing influence of the most serious character
 the general tariff act have only partially go into operation some of its important provision be limit to take effect at date yet in the future the general provision of the law have be in force less than sixty day its permanent effect upon trade and price still largely stand in conjecture it be curious to note that the advance in the price of article wholly unaffected by the tariff act be by many hastily ascribe to that act notice be not take of the fact that the general tendency of the market be upward from influence wholly apart from the recent tariff legislation the enlargement of our currency by the silver bill undoubtedly give an upward tendency to trade and have a marked effect on price but this natural and desire effect of the silver legislation be by many erroneously attribute to the tariff act
 there be neither wisdom nor justice in the suggestion that the subject of tariff revision shall be again open before this law have have a fair trial it be quite true that every tariff schedule be subject to objection no bill be ever frame i suppose that in all of its rate and classification have the full approval even of a party caucus such legislation be always and necessarily the product of compromise as to detail and the present law be no exception but in its general scope and effect i think it will justify the support of those who believe that american legislation should conserve and defend american trade and the wage of american workman
 the misinformation as to the term of the act which have be so widely disseminate at home and abroad will be correct by experience and the evil augury as to its result confound by the market report the saving bank international trade balance and the general prosperity of our people already we begin to hear from abroad and from our customhouse that the prohibitory effect upon importation impute to the act be not justify the import at the port of new york for the first three week of november be nearly 8 per cent great than for the same period in 1889 and 29 per cent great than in the same period of 1888 and so far from be an act to limit export i confidently believe that under it we shall secure a large and more profitable participation in foreign trade than we have ever enjoy and that we shall recover a proportionate participation in the ocean carry trade of the world
 the criticism of the bill that have come to we from foreign source may well be reject for repugnancy if these critic really believe that the adoption by we of a free trade policy or of tariff rate have reference solely to revenue would diminish the participation of their own country in the commerce of the world their advocacy and promotion by speech and other form of organized effort of this movement among our people be a rare exhibition of unselfishness in trade and on the other hand if they sincerely believe that the adoption of a protective tariff policy by this country inure to their profit and our hurt it be noticeably strange that they should lead the outcry against the author of a policy so helpful to their countryman and crown with their favor those who would snatch from they a substantial share of a trade with other land already inadequate to their necessity
 there be no disposition among any of our people to promote prohibitory or retaliatory legislation our policy be adopt not to the hurt of other but to secure for ourselves those advantage that fairly grow out of our favor position as a nation our form of government with its incident of universal suffrage make it imperative that we shall save our work people from the agitation and distress which scant work and wage that have no margin for comfort always beget but after all this be do it will be find that our market be open to friendly commercial exchange of enormous value to the other great power
 from the time of my induction into office the duty of use every power and influence give by law to the executive department for the development of large market for our product especially our farm product have be keep constantly in mind and no effort have be or will be spare to promote that end we be under no disadvantage in any foreign market except that we pay our workman and workwoman well wage than be pay elsewhere well abstractly well relatively to the cost of the necessary of life i do not doubt that a very largely increase foreign trade be accessible to we without barter for it either our home market for such product of the farm and shop as our own people can supply or the wage of our work people
 in many of the product of wood and iron and in meat and breadstuff we have advantage that only need well facility of intercourse and transportation to secure for they large foreign market the reciprocity clause of the tariff act wisely and effectively open the way to secure a large reciprocal trade in exchange for the free admission to our port of certain product the right of independent nation to make special reciprocal trade concession be well establish and do not impair either the comity due to other power or what be know as the favor nation clause so generally find in commercial treaty what be give to one for an adequate agree consideration can not be claim by another freely the state of the revenue be such that we could dispense with any import duty upon coffee tea hide and the low grade of sugar and molasse that the large advantage result to the country produce and export these article by place they on the free list entitle we to expect a fair return in the way of custom concession upon article export by we to they be so obvious that to have gratuitously abandon this opportunity to enlarge our trade would have be an unpardonable error
 there be but two method of maintain control of this question open to congress to place all of these article upon the dutiable list subject to such treaty agreement as could be secure or to place they all presently upon the free list but subject to the reimposition of specified duty if the country from which we receive they should refuse to give to we suitable reciprocal benefit this latter method i think possess great advantage it express in advance the consent of congress to reciprocity arrangement affect these product which must otherwise have be delay and unascertaine until each treaty be ratify by the senate and the necessary legislation enact by congress experience have show that some treaty look to reciprocal trade have fail to secure a two third vote in the senate for ratification and other having pass that stage have for year await the concurrence of the house and senate in such modification of our revenue law as be necessary to give effect to their provision we now have the concurrence of both houses in advance in a distinct and definite offer of free entry to our port of specific article the executive be not require to deal in conjecture as to what congress will accept indeed this reciprocity provision be more than an offer our part of the bargain be complete delivery have be make and when the country from which we receive sugar coffee tea and hide have place on their free list such of our product as shall be agree upon as an equivalent for our concession a proclamation of that fact complete the transaction and in the meantime our own people have free sugar tea coffee and hide
 the indication thus far give be very hopeful of early and favorable action by the country from which we receive our large import of coffee and sugar and it be confidently believe that if steam communication with these country can be promptly improve and enlarge the next year will show a most gratifying increase in our export of breadstuff and provision as well as of some important line of manufactured good
 in addition to the important bill that become law before the adjournment of the last session some other bill of the high importance be well advanced toward a final vote and now stand upon the calendar of the two houses in favored position the present session have a fix limit and if these measure be not now bring to a final vote all the work that have be do upon they by this congress be lose the proper consideration of these of an apportionment bill and of the annual appropriation bill will require not only that no work day of the session shall be lose but that measure of minor and local interest shall not be allow to interrupt or retard the progress of those that be of universal interest in view of these condition i refrain from bring before you at this time some suggestion that would otherwise be make and most earnestly invoke your attention to the duty of perfect the important legislation now well advanced to some of these measure which seem to i most important i now briefly call your attention
 i desire to repeat with add urgency the recommendation contain in my last annual message in relation to the development of american steamship line the reciprocity clause of the tariff bill will be largely limited and its benefit retard and diminish if provision be not contemporaneously make to encourage the establishment of first class steam communication between our port and the port of such nation as may meet our overture for enlarge commercial exchange the steamship carry the mail statedly and frequently and offer to passenger a comfortable safe and speedy transit be the first condition of foreign trade it carry the order or the buyer but not all that be order or buy it give to the sailing vessel such cargo as be not urgent or perishable and indirectly at least promote that important adjunct of commerce there be now both in this country and in the nation of central and south america a state of expectation and confidence as to increase trade that will give a double value to your prompt action upon this question
 the present situation of our mail communication with australia illustrate the importance of early action by congress the oceanic steamship company maintain a line of steamer between san francisco sydney and auckland consist of three vessel two of which be of united states registry and one of foreign registry for the service do by this line in carry the mail we pay annually the sum of $ 46,000 be as estimate the full sea and united states inland postage which be the limit fix by law the colony of new south wales and new zealand have be pay annually to these line lbs 37,000 for carry the mail from sydney and auckland to san francisco the contract under which this payment have be make be now about to expire and those colony have refuse to renew the contract unless the united states shall pay a more equitable proportion of the whole sum necessary to maintain the service
 i be advise by the postmaster general that the united states receive for carry the australian mail bring to san francisco in these steamer by rail to vancouver an estimate annual income of $ 75,000 while as i have state we be pay out for the support of the steamship line that bring this mail to we only $ 46,000 leave an annual surplus result from this service of $ 29,000 the trade of the united states with australia which be in a considerable part carry by these steamer and the whole of which be practically dependent upon the mail communication which they maintain be largely in our favor our total export of merchandise to australasian port during the fiscal year end june 30 1890 be $ 11,266,484 while the total import of merchandise from these port be only $ 4,277,676 if we be not willing to see this important steamship line withdraw or continue with vancouver substitute for san francisco as the american terminal congress should put it in the power of the postmaster general to make a liberal increase in the amount now pay for the transportation of this important mail
 the south atlantic and gulf port occupy a very favor position toward the new and important commerce which the reciprocity clause of the tariff act and the postal shipping bill be design to promote steamship line from these port to some northern port of south america will almost certainly effect a connection between the railroad system of the continent long before any continuous line of railroad can be put into operation the very large appropriation make at the last session for the harbor of galveston be justify as it seem to i by these consideration the great northwest will feel the advantage of trunk line to the south as well as to the east and of the new market open for their surplus food product and for many of their manufactured product
 i have occasion in may last to transmit to congress a report adopt by the international american conference upon the subject of the incorporation of an international american bank with a view to facilitate money exchange between the states represent in that conference such an institution would greatly promote the trade we be seek to develop i renew the recommendation that a careful and well guard charter be grant i do not think the power grant should include those ordinarily exercise by trust guaranty and safe deposit company or that more branch in the united states should be authorize than be strictly necessary to accomplish the object primarily in view namely convenient foreign exchange it be quite important that prompt action should be take in this matter in order that any appropriation for well communication with these country and any agreement that may be make for reciprocal trade may not be hinder by the inconvenience of make exchange through european money center or burden by the tribute which be an incident of that method of business
 the bill for the relief of the supreme court have after many year of discussion reach a position where final action be easily attainable and it be hope that any difference of opinion may be so harmonized as to save the essential feature of this very important measure in this connection i earnestly renew my recommendation that the salary of the judge of the united states district court be so readjust that none of they shall receive less than $ 5,000 per annum
 the subject of the unadjusted spanish and mexican land grant and the urgent necessity for provide some commission or tribunal for the trial of question of title grow out of they be twice bring by i to the attention of congress at the last session bill have be report from the proper committee in both houses upon the subject and i very earnestly hope that this congress will put an end to the delay which have attend the settlement of the dispute as to the title between the settler and the claimant under these grant these dispute retard the prosperity and disturb the peace of large and important community the governor of new mexico in his last report to the secretary of the interior suggest some modification of the provision of the pende bill relate to the small holding of farm land i commend to your attention the suggestion of the secretary of the interior upon this subject
 the enactment of a national bankrupt law i still regard as very desirable the constitution having give to congress jurisdiction of this subject it should be exercise and uniform rule provide for the administration of the affair of insolvent debtor the inconvenience result from the occasional and temporary exercise of this power by congress and from the conflict state code of insolvency which come into force intermediately should be remove by the enactment of a simple inexpensive and permanent national bankrupt law
 i also renew my recommendation in favor of legislation afford just copyright protection to foreign author on a footing of reciprocal advantage for our author abroad
 it may still be possible for this congress to inaugurate by suitable legislation a movement look to uniformity and increase safety in the use of coupler and brake upon freight train engage in interstate commerce the chief difficulty in the way be to secure agreement as to the good appliance simplicity effectiveness and cost be consider this difficulty will only yield to legislation which should be base upon full inquiry and impartial test the purpose should be to secure the cooperation of all well dispose manager and owner but the fearful fact that every year&#39;s delay involve the sacrifice of 2,000 life and the maiming of 20,000 young man should plead both with congress and the manager against any needless delay
 the subject of the conservation and equal distribution of the water supply of the arid region have have much attention from congress but have not as yet be put upon a permanent and satisfactory basis the urgency of the subject do not grow out of any large present demand for the use of these land for agriculture but out of the danger that the water supply and the site for the necessary catch basin may fall into the hand of individual or private corporation and be use to render subservient the large area dependent upon such supply the owner of the water be the owner of the land however the title may run all unappropriated natural water source and all necessary reservoir site should be hold by the government for the equal use at fair rate of the homestead settler who will eventually take up these land the united states should not in my opinion undertake the construction of dam or canal but should limit its work to such survey and observation as will determine the water supply both surface and subterranean the area capable of irrigation and the location and storage capacity of reservoir this do the use of the water and of the reservoir site might be grant to the respective states or territories or to individual or association upon the condition that the necessary work should be construct and the water furnish at fair rate without discrimination the rate to be subject to supervision by the legislature or by board of water commissioner duly constitute the essential thing to be secure be the common and equal use at fair rate of the accumulate water supply it be almost well that these land should remain arid than that those who occupy they should become the slave of unrestrained monopoly control the one essential element of land value and crop result
 the use of the telegraph by the post office department as a means for the rapid transmission of write communication be i believe upon proper term quite desirable the government do not own or operate the railroad and it should not i think own or operate the telegraph line it do however seem to be quite practicable for the government to contract with the telegraph company as it do with railroad company to carry at specify rate such communication as the sender may designate for this method of transmission i recommend that such legislation be enact as will enable the post office department fairly to test by experiment the advantage of such a use of the telegraph
 if any intelligent and loyal company of american citizen be require to catalogue the essential human condition of national life i do not doubt that with absolute unanimity they would begin with free and honest election and it be gratify to know that generally there be a grow and nonpartisan demand for well election law but against this sign of hope and progress must be set the depressing and undeniable fact that election law and method be sometimes cunningly contrive to secure minority control while violence complete the shortcoming of fraud
 in my last annual message i suggest that the development of the exist law provide a federal supervision of congressional election offer an effective method of reform these abuse the need of such a law have manifest itself in many part of the country and its wholesome restraint and penalty will be useful in all the constitutionality of such legislation have be affirm by the supreme court its probable effectiveness be evidence by the character of the opposition that be make to it it have be denounce as if it be a new exercise of federal power and an invasion of the right of states nothing could be far from the truth congress have already fix the time for the election of member of congress it have declare that vote for member of congress must be by write or print ballot it have provide for the appointment by the circuit court in certain case and upon the petition of a certain number of citizen of election supervisor and make it their duty to supervise the registration of voter conduct by the state officer to challenge person offer to register to personally inspect and scrutinize the registry list and to affix their name to the list for the purpose of identification and the prevention of fraud to attend at election and remain with the box till they be all cast and count to attach to the registry list and election return any statement touch the accuracy and fairness of the registry and election and to take and transmit to the clerk of the house of representatives any evidence of fraudulent practice which may be present to they the same law provide for the appointment of deputy united states marshal to attend at the poll support the supervisor in the discharge of their duty and to arrest person violate the election law the provision of this familiar title of the revised statutes have be put into exercise by both the great political party and in the north as well as in the south by the filing with the court of the petition require by the law
 it be not therefore a question whether we shall have a federal election law for we now have one and have have for nearly twenty year but whether we shall have an effective law the present law stop just short of effectiveness for it surrender to the local authority all control over the certification which establish the prima facie right to a seat in the house of representatives this defect should be cure equality of representation and the parity of the elector must be maintain or everything that be valuable in our system of government be lose the qualification of an elector must be seek in the law net in the opinion prejudice or fear of any class however powerful the path of the elector to the ballot box must be free from the ambush of fear and the enticement of fraud the count so true and open that none shall gainsay it such a law should be absolutely nonpartisan and impartial it should give the advantage to honesty and the control to majority surely there be nothing sectional about this creed and if it shall happen that the penalty of law intend to enforce these right fall here and not there it be not because the law be sectional but because happily crime be local and not universal nor should it be forget that every law whether relate to election or to any other subject whether enact by the state or by the nation have force behind it the court the marshal or constable the posse comitatus the prison be all and always behind the law
 one can not be justly charge with unfriendliness to any section or class who seek only to restrain violation of law and of personal right no community will find lawlessness profitable no community can afford to have it know that the officer who be charge with the preservation of the public peace and the restraint of the criminal class be themselves the product of fraud or violence the magistrate be then without respect and the law without sanction the flood of lawlessness can not be leveed and make to run in one channel the killing of a united states marshal carry a writ of arrest for an election offense be full of prompt and suggestion to man who be pursue by a city marshal for a crime against life or property
 but it be say that this legislation will revive race animosity and some have even suggest that when the peaceful method of fraud be make impossible they may be supplant by intimidation and violence if the propose law give to any qualified elector by a hair&#39; weight more than his equal influence or detract by so much from any other qualified elector it be fatally impeach but if the law be equal and the animosity it be to evoke grow out of the fact that some elector have be accustom to exercise the franchise for other as well as for themselves then these animosity ought not to be confess without shame and can not be give any weight in the discussion without dishonor no choice be leave to i but to enforce with vigor all law intend to secure to the citizen his constitutional right and to recommend that the inadequacy of such law be promptly remedie if to promote with zeal and ready interest every project for the development of its material interest its river harbor mine and factory and the intelligence peace and security under the law of its community and its home be not accept as sufficient evidence of friendliness to any state or section i can not add connivance at election practice that not only disturb local result but rob the elector of other state and section of their most priceless political right
 the preparation of the general appropriation bill should be conduct with the great care and the close scrutiny of expenditure appropriation should be adequate to the need of the public service but they should be absolutely free from prodigality
 i venture again to remind you that the brief time remain for the consideration of the important legislation now await your attention offer no margin for waste if the present duty be discharge with diligence fidelity and courage the work of the fifty first congress may be confidently submit to the considerate judgment of the people

 the sudden death of the hon william windore secretary of the treasury in new york on the evening of the 29th instant have direct my attention to the present state of the law as to the filling of a vacancy occasion by the death of the head of a department
 i transmit herewith an opinion of the attorney general from which it will be see that under the statute in force no officer in the treasury department or other person designate by i can exercise the duty of secretary of the treasury for a long period than ten day this limitation be i be sure unwise and necessarily involve in such a case as that now present undue haste and even indelicacy the president should not be require to take up the question of the selection of a successor before the last office of affection and respect have be pay to the dead if the propriety of an occasion as sad as that which now overshadow we be observe possibly one half of the brief time allow be go before with due regard to the decency of life the president and those with whom he should advise can take up the consideration of the grave duty of select a head for one of the great departments of the government
 hasty action by the senate be also necessarily involve and geographical limitation be practically impose by the necessity of select someone who can reach the capital and take the necessary oath of office before the expiration of the ten day
 it may be a very proper restriction of the power of the president in this connection that he shall not designate for any great length of time a person to discharge these important duty who have not be confirm by the senate but there would seem to be no reason why one of the assistant secretary of the department wherein the vacancy exist might not discharge the duty of secretary until a successor be select confirm and qualify the inconvenience of this limitation be make apparent at the time of the death of secretary folger president arthur in that case allow one of the assistant secretary who have be designate to act in the absence of the secretary to continue in the discharge of such duty for ten day then designate the same person to discharge the duty for a further term of ten day and then make a temporary appointment as secretary in order to secure the consideration that he need in fill this important place
 i recommend such a modification of the exist law as will permit the first or sole assistant or in the case of the treasury department where the assistant be not grade that one who may be designate by the president to discharge the duty of the head of the department until a successor be appoint and qualified

to the senate and house of representatives
 the report of the head of the several executive departments require by law to be submit to i which be herewith transmit and the report of the secretary of the treasury and the attorney general make directly to congress furnish a comprehensive view of the administrative work of the last fiscal year relate to internal affair it would be of great advantage if these report could have an alternative perusal by every member of congress and by all who take an interest in public affair such a perusal could not fail to excite a high appreciation of the vast labor and conscientious effort which be give to the conduct of our civil administration

 the work of the state department during the last year have be characterize by an unusual number of important negotiation and by diplomatic result of a notable and highly beneficial character among these be the reciprocal trade arrangement which have be conclude in the exercise of the power confer by section 3 of the tariff law with the republic of brazil with spain for its west india possession and with santo domingo like negotiation with other country have be much advanced and it be hope that before the close of the year far definitive trade arrangement of great value will be conclude
 in view of the report which have be receive as to the diminution of the seal herd in the bering sea i deem it wise to propose to her majesty&#39;s government in february last that an agreement for a closed season should be make pende the negotiation for arbitration which then seem to be approach a favorable conclusion after much correspondence and delay for which this government be not responsible an agreement be reach and sign on the 15th of june by which great britain undertake from that date and until may 1 1892 to prohibit the killing by her subject of seal in the bering sea and the government of the united states during the same period to enforce its exist prohibition against pelagic sealing and to limit the catch by the fur seal company upon the island to 7,500 skin if this agreement could have be reach early in response to the strenuous endeavor of this government it would have be more effective but come even as late as it do it unquestionably result in greatly diminish the destruction of the seal by the canadian sealer
 in my last annual message i state that the basis of arbitration propose by her majesty&#39;s government for the adjustment of the long pende controversy as to the seal fishery be not acceptable i be glad now to be able to announce that term satisfactory to this government have be agree upon and that an agreement as to the arbitrator be all that be necessary to the completion of the convention in view of the advanced position which this government have take upon the subject of international arbitration this renew expression of our adherence to this method for the settlement of dispute such as have arise in the bering sea will i doubt not meet with the concurrence of congress
 provision should be make for a joint demarcation of the frontier line between canada and the united states wherever require by the increase border settlement and especially for the exact location of the water boundary in the strait and river
 i should have be glad to announce some favorable disposition of the boundary dispute between great britain and venezuela touch the western frontier of british guiana but the friendly effort of the united states in that direction have thus far be unavaile this government will continue to express its concern at any appearance of foreign encroachment on territory long under the administrative control of american states the determination of a dispute boundary be easily attainable by amicable arbitration where the right of the respective party rest as here on historic fact readily ascertainable
 the law of the last congress provide a system of inspection for our meat intend for export and clothe the president with power to exclude foreign product from our market in case the country send they should perpetuate unjust discrimination against any product of the united states place this government in a position to effectively urge the removal of such discrimination against our meat it be gratify to be able to state that germany denmark italy austria and france in the order name have open their port to inspect american pork product the removal of these restriction in every instance be ask for and give solely upon the ground that we have now provide a meat inspection that should be accept as adequate to the complete removal of the danger real or fancy which have be previously urge the state department our minister abroad and the secretary of agriculture have cooperate with unflagge and intelligent zeal for the accomplishment of this great result the outline of an agreement have be reach with germany look to equitable trade concession in consideration of the continue free importation of her sugar but the time have not yet arrive when this correspondence can be submit to congress
 the recent political disturbance in the republic of brazil have excite regret and solicitude the information we possess be too meager to enable we to form a satisfactory judgment of the cause lead to the temporary assumption of supreme power by president fonseca but this government do not fail to express to he its anxious solicitude for the peace of brazil and for the maintenance of the free political institution which have recently be establish there nor to offer our advice that great moderation should be observe in the clash of party and the contest for leadership these counsel be receive in the most friendly spirit and the late information be that constitutional government have be reestablish without bloodshed
 the lynching at new orleans in march last of eleven man of italian nativity by a mob of citizen be a most deplorable and discreditable incident it do not however have its origin in any general animosity to the italian people nor in any disrespect to the government of italy with which our relation be of the most friendly character the fury of the mob be direct against these man as the suppose participant or accessory in the murder of a city officer i do not allude to this as mitigate in any degree this offense against law and humanity but only as affect the international question which grow out of it it be at once represent by the italian minister that several of those whose life have be take by the mob be italian subject and a demand be make for the punishment of the participant and for an indemnity to the family of those who be kill it be to be regret that the manner in which these claim be present be not such as to promote a calm discussion of the question involve but this may well be attribute to the excitement and indignation which the crime naturally evoke the view of this government as to its obligation to foreigner domicile here be fully state in the correspondence as well as its purpose to make an investigation of the affair with a view to determine whether there be present any circumstance that could under such rule of duty as we have indicate create an obligation upon the united states the temporary absence of a minister plenipotentiary of italy at this capital have retard the further correspondence but it be not doubt that a friendly conclusion be attainable
 some suggestion grow out of this unhappy incident be worthy the attention of congress it would i believe be entirely competent for congress to make offense against the treaty right of foreigner domicile in the united states cognizable in the federal court this have not however be do and the federal officer and court have no power in such case to intervene either for the protection of a foreign citizen or for the punishment of his slayer it seem to i to follow in this state of the law that the officer of the state charge with police and judicial power in such case must in the consideration of international question grow out of such incident be regard in such sense as federal agent as to make this government answerable for their act in case where it would be answerable if the united states have use its constitutional power to define and punish crime against treaty right

 the provisional government have learn by the cablegram of the associated press that the transport itata detain in san diego by order of the united states for take on board munition of war and in possession of the marshal leave the port carry on board this official who be land at a point near the coast and then continue her voyage if this news be correct this government would deplore the conduct of the itata and as an evidence that it be not dispose to support or agree to the infraction of the law of the united states the undersigned take advantage of the personal relation you have be good enough to maintain with he since your arrival in this port to declare to you that as soon as she be within reach of our order his government will put the itata with the arm and munition she take on board in sail diego at the disposition of the united states

 during the progress of the war in chile this government tender its good office to bring about a peaceful adjustment and it be at one time hope that a good result might be reach but in this we be disappoint
 the instruction to our naval officer and to our minister at santiago from the first to the last of this struggle enjoin upon they the most impartial treatment and absolute noninterference i be satisfied that these instruction be observe and that our representative be always watchful to use their influence impartially in the interest of humanity and on more than one occasion do so effectively we could not forget however that this government be in diplomatic relation with the then established government of chile as it be now in such relation with the successor of that government i be quite sure that president montt who have under circumstance of promise for the peace of chile be instal as president of that republic will not desire that in the unfortunate event of any revolt against his authority the policy of this government should be other than that which we have recently observe no official complaint of the conduct of our minister or of our naval officer during the struggle have be present to this government and it be a matter of regret that so many of our own people should have give ear to unofficial charge and complaint that manifestly have their origin in rival interest and in a wish to pervert the relation of the united states with chile
 the collapse of the government of balmaceda bring about a condition which be unfortunately too familiar in the history of the central and south american states with the overthrow of the balmaceda government he and many of his councilor and officer become at once fugitive for their life and appeal to the command officer of the foreign naval vessel in the harbor of valparaiso and to the resident foreign minister at santiago for asylum this asylum be freely give accord to my information by the naval vessel of several foreign power and by several of the legation at santiago the american minister as well as his colleague act upon the impulse of humanity extend asylum to political refugee whose life be in peril i have not be willing to direct the surrender of such of these person as be still in the american legation without suitable condition
 it be believe that the government of chile be not in a position in view of the precedent with which it have be connect to broadly deny the right of asylum and the correspondence have not thus far present any such denial the treatment of our minister for a time be such as to call for a decided protest and it be very gratifying to observe that unfriendly measure which be undoubtedly the result of the prevail excitement be at once rescind or suitably relaxed

 so far as i have yet be able to learn no other explanation of this bloody work have be suggest than that it have its origin in hostility to those man as sailor of the united states wear the uniform of their government and not in any individual act or personal animosity the attention of the chilean government be at once call to this affair and a statement of the fact obtain by the investigation we have conduct be submit accompany by a request to be advise of any other or qualifying fact in the possession of the chilean government that might tend to relieve this affair of the appearance of an insult to this government the chilean government be also advise that if such qualifying fact do not exist this government would confidently expect full and prompt reparation

 the arbitration treaty formulate by the international american conference lapse by reason of the failure to exchange ratification fully within the limit of time provide but several of the government concern have express a desire to save this important result of the conference by an extension of the period it be in my judgment incumbent upon the united states to conserve the influential initiative it have take in this measure by ratify the instrument and by advocate the propose extension of the time for exchange these view have be make known to the other signatory
 this government have find occasion to express in a friendly spirit but with much earnestness to the government of the czar its serious concern because of the harsh measure now be enforce against the hebrews in russia by the revival of antisemitic law long in abeyance great number of those unfortunate people have be constrain to abandon their home and leave the empire by reason of the impossibility of find subsistence within the pale to which it be seek to confine they the immigration of these people to the united states many other country be close to they be largely increase and be likely to assume proportion which may make it difficult to find home and employment for they here and to seriously affect the labor market be estimate that over 1,000,000 will be force from russia within a few year the hebrew be never a beggar he have always keep the law life by toil often under severe and oppressive civil restriction it be also true that no race sect or class have more fully care for its own than the hebrew race but the sudden transfer of such a multitude under condition that tend to strip they of their small accumulation and to depress their energy and courage be neither good for they nor for we

 the annual report of the maritime canal company of nicaragua show that much costly and necessary preparatory work have be do during the year in the construction of shop railroad track and harbor pier and breakwater and that the work of canal construction have make some progress
 i deem it to be a matter of the high concern to the united states that this canal connect the water of the atlantic and pacific ocean and give to we a short water communication between our port upon those two great sea should be speedily construct and at the small practicable limit of cost the gain in freight to the people and the direct saving to the government of the united states in the use of its naval vessel would pay the entire cost of this work within a short series of year the report of the secretary of the navy show the saving in our naval expenditure which would result
 the senator from alabama mr. morgan in his argument upon this subject before the senate at the last session do not overestimate the importance of this work when he say that the canal be the most important subject now connect with the commercial growth and progress of the united states
 if this work be to be promote by the usual financial method and without the aid of this government the expenditure in its interest bear security and stock will probably be twice the actual cost this will necessitate high toll and constitute a heavy and altogether needless burden upon our commerce and that of the world every dollar of the bond and stock of the company should represent a dollar expend in the legitimate and economical prosecution of the work this be only possible by give to the bond the guaranty of the united states government such a guaranty would secure the ready sale at par of a 3 per cent bond from time to time as the money be need i do not doubt that build upon these business method the canal would when fully inaugurate earn its fix charge and operating expense but if its bond be to be market at heavy discount and every bond sell be to be accompany by a gift of stock as have come to be expect by investor in such enterprise the traffic will be seriously burden to pay interest and dividend i be quite willing to recommend government promotion in the prosecution of a work which if no other mean offer for secure its completion be of such transcendent interest that the government should in my opinion secure it by direct appropriation from its treasury
 a guaranty of the bond of the canal company to an amount necessary to the completion of the canal could i think be so give as not to involve any serious risk of ultimate loss the thing to be carefully guard be the completion of the work within the limit of the guaranty the subrogation of the united states to the right of the first mortgage bondholder for any amount it may have to pay and in the meantime a control of the stock of the company as a security against mismanagement and loss i most sincerely hope that neither party nor sectional line will be draw upon this great american project so full of interest to the people of all our states and so influential in its effect upon the prestige and prosperity of our common country
 the island of navassa in the west indian group have under the provision of title vii of the revised statutes be recognize by the president as appertain to the united states it contain guano deposit be own by the navassa phosphate company and be occupy solely its employee in september 1889 a revolt take place among these laborer result in the killing of some of the agent of the company cause as the laborer claim by cruel treatment these man be arrest and try in the united states court at baltimore under section 5576 of the statute refer to as if the offense have be commit on board a merchant vessel of the united states on the high sea there appear on the trial and otherwise come to i such evidence of the bad treatment of the man that in consideration of this and of the fact that the man have no access to any public officer or tribunal for protection or the redress of their wrong i commute the death sentence that have be pass by the court upon three of they in april last my attention be again call to this island and to the unregulated condition of thing there by a letter from a colored laborer who complain that he be wrongfully detain upon the island by the phosphate company after the expiration of his contract of service a naval vessel be send to examine into the case of this man and generally into the condition of thing on the island it be find that the laborer refer to have be detain beyond the contract limit and that a condition of revolt again exist among the laborer a board of naval officer report among other thing as follow
 we would desire to state far that the discipline maintain on the island seem to be that of a convict establishment without its comfort and cleanliness and that until more attention be pay to the shipping of laborer by place it under government supervision to prevent misunderstanding and misrepresentation and until some amelioration be show in the treatment of the laborer these disorder will be of constant occurrence
 i recommend legislation that shall place labor contract upon this and other island have the relation that navassa have to the united states under the supervision of a court commissioner and that shall provide at the expense of the owner an officer to reside upon the island with power to judge and adjust dispute and to enforce a just and humane treatment of the employee it be inexcusable that american laborer should be leave within our own jurisdiction without access to any government officer or tribunal for their protection and the redress of their wrong

 the general interest in the operation of the treasury department have be much augment during the last year by reason of the conflict prediction which accompany and follow the tariff and other legislation of the last congress affect the revenue as to the result of this legislation upon the treasury and upon the country on the one hand it be contend that import would so fall off as to leave the treasury bankrupt and that the price of article enter into the living of the people would be so enhanced as to disastrously affect their comfort and happiness while on the other it be argue that the loss to the revenue largely the result of place sugar on the free list would be a direct gain to the people that the price of the necessary of life include those most highly protect would not be enhance that labor would have a large market and the product of the farm advanced price while the treasury surplus and receipt would be adequate to meet the appropriation include the large exceptional expenditure for the refunding to the states of the direct tax and the redemption of the 4 1/2 per cent bond
 it be not my purpose to enter at any length into a discussion of the effect of the legislation to which i have refer but a brief examination of the statistic of the treasury and a general glance at the state of business throughout the country will i think satisfy any impartial inquirer that its result have disappoint the evil prophecy of its opponent and in a large measure realize the hopeful prediction of its friend rarely if ever before in the history of the country have there be a time when the proceed of one day&#39 s labor or the product of one farm acre would purchase so large an amount of those thing that enter into the living of the masse of the people i believe that a full test will develop the fact that the tariff act of the fifty first congress be very favorable in its average effect upon the price of article enter into common use
 during the twelve month from october 1 1890 to september 30 1891 the total value of our foreign commerce import and export combine be $ 1,747,806,406 which be the large of any year in the history of the united states the large in any previous year be in 1890 when our commerce amount to $ 1,647,139,093 and the last year exceed this enormous aggregate by over one hundred million it be interesting and to some will be surprising to know that during the year end september 30 1891 our import of merchandise amount to $ 824,715,270 which be an increase of more than $ 11,000,000 over the value of the import of the corresponding month of the precede year when the import of merchandise be unusually large in anticipation of the tariff legislation then pende the average annual value of the import of merchandise for the ten year from 1881 to 1890 be $ 692,186,522 and during the year end september 30 1891 this annual average be exceed by $ 132,528,469
 the value of free import during the twelve month end september 30 1891 be $ 118,092,387 more than the value of free import during the corresponding twelve month of the precede year and there be during the same period a decrease of $ 106,846,508 in the value of import of dutiable merchandise the percentage of merchandise admit free of duty during the year to which i have refer the first under the new tariff be 48.18 while during the precede twelve month under the old tariff the percentage be 34.27 an increase of 13.91 per cent if we take the six month end september 30 last which cover the time during which sugar have be admit free of duty the per cent of value of merchandise import free of duty be find to be 55.37 which be a large percentage of free import than during any prior fiscal year in the history of the government
 if we turn to export of merchandise the statistic be full of gratification the value of such export of merchandise for the twelve month end september 30 1891 be $ 923,091,136 while for the correspond previous twelve month it be $ 860,177,115 an increase of $ 62,914,021 which be nearly three time the average annual increase of export of merchandise for the precede twenty year this exceed in amount and value the export of merchandise during any year in the history of the government the increase in the value of export of agricultural product during the year refer to over the corresponding twelve month of the prior year be $ 45,846,197 while the increase in the value of export of manufacture product be $ 16,838,240
 there be certainly nothing in the condition of trade foreign or domestic there be certainly nothing in the condition of our people of any class to suggest that the exist tariff and revenue legislation bear oppressively upon the people or retard the commercial development of the nation it may be argue that our condition would be well if tariff legislation be upon a free trade basis but it can not be deny that all the condition of prosperity and of general contentment be present in a large degree than ever before in our history and that too just when it be prophesy they would be in the bad state agitation for radical change in tariff and financial legislation can not help but may seriously impede business to the prosperity of which some degree of stability in legislation be essential
 i think there be conclusive evidence that the new tariff have create several great industry which will within a few year give employment to several hundred thousand american work man and woman in view of the somewhat overcrowded condition of the labor market of the united states every patriotic citizen should rejoice at such a result
 the report of the secretary of the treasury show that the total receipt of the government from all source for the fiscal year end june 30 1891 be $ 458,544,233.03 while the expenditure for the same period be $ 421,304,470.46 leave a surplus of $ 37,239,762.57
 the receipt of the fiscal year end june 30 1892 actual and estimate be $ 433,000,000 and the expenditure $ 409,000,000 for the fiscal year end june 30 1893 the estimate receipt be $ 455,336,350 and the expenditure $ 441,300,093
 under the law of july 14 1890 the secretary of the treasury have purchase since august 13 during the fiscal year 48,393,113 ounce of silver bullion at an average cost of $ 1.045 per ounce the high price pay during the year be $ 1.2025 and the low $ 0.9636 in exchange for this silver bullion there have be issue $ 50,577,498 of the treasury note authorize by the act the low price of silver reach during the fiscal year be $ 0.9636 on april 22 1891 but on november 1 the market price be only $ 0.96 which would give to the silver dollar a bullion value of 74 1/4 cent
 before the influence of the prospective silver legislation be feel in the market silver be worth in new york about $ 0.955 per ounce the able advocate of free coinage in the last congress be most confident in their prediction that the purchase by the government require by the law would at once bring the price of silver to $ 1.2929 per ounce which would make the bullion value of a dollar 100 cent and hold it there the prophecy of the antisilver man of disaster to result from the coinage of $ 2,000,000 per month be not wide of the mark the friend of free silver be not agree i think as to the cause that bring their hopeful prediction to naught some fact be know the export of silver from london to india during the first nine month of this calendar year fall off over 50 per cent or $ 17,202,730 compare with the same month of the precede year the export of domestic silver bullion from this country which have average for the last ten year over $ 17,000,000 fall in the last fiscal year to $ 13,797,391 while for the first time in recent year the import of silver into this country exceed the export by the sum of $ 2,745,365 in the previous year the net export of silver from the united states amount to $ 8,545,455 the production of the united states increase from 50,000,000 ounce in 1889 to 54,500,000 in 1890 the government be now buy and put aside annually 54,000,000 ounce which allow for 7,140,000 ounce of new bullion use in the art be 6,640,000 more than our domestic product available for coinage
 i hope the depression in the price of silver be temporary and that a further trial of this legislation will more favorably affect it that the increase volume of currency thus supply for the use of the people be need and that beneficial result upon trade and price have follow this legislation i think must be very clear to everyone nor should it be forget that for every dollar of these note issue a full dollar&#39; worth of silver bullion be at the time deposit in the treasury as a security for its redemption upon this subject as upon the tariff my recommendation be that the exist law be give a full trial and that our business interest be spare the distressing influence which threat of radical change always impart under exist legislation it be in the power of the treasury department to maintain that essential condition of national finance as well as of commercial prosperity the parity in use of the coin dollar and their paper representative the assurance that these power would be freely and unhesitatingly use have do much to produce and sustain the present favorable business condition
 i be still of the opinion that the free coinage of silver under exist condition would disastrously affect our business interest at home and abroad we could not hope to maintain an equality in the purchasing power of the gold and silver dollar in our own market and in foreign trade the stamp give no add value to the bullion contain in coin the producer of the country its farmer and laborer have the high interest that every dollar paper or coin issue by the government shall be as good as any other if there be one less valuable than another its sure and constant errand will be to pay they for their toil and for their crop the money lender will protect himself by stipulate for payment in gold but the laborer have never be able to do that to place business upon a silver basis would mean a sudden and severe contraction of the currency by the withdrawal of gold and gold note and such an unsettling of all value as would produce a commercial panic i can not believe that a people so strong and prosperous as ours will promote such a policy
 the producer of silver be entitle to just consideration but they should not forget that the government be now buy and put out of the market what be the equivalent of the entire product of our silver mine this be more than they themselves think of ask two year ago i believe it be the earnest desire of a great majority of the people as it be mine that a full coin use shall be make of silver just as soon as the cooperation of other nation can be secure and a ratio fix that will give circulation equally to gold and silver the business of the world require the use of both metal but i do not see any prospect of gain but much of loss by give up the present system in which a full use be make of gold and a large use of silver for one in which silver alone will circulate such an event would be at once fatal to the further progress of the silver movement bimetallism be the desire end and the true friend of silver will be careful not to overrun the goal and bring in silver monometallism with its necessary attendant the loss of our gold to europe and the relief of the pressure there for a large currency i have endeavor by the use of official and unofficial agency to keep a close observation of the state of public sentiment in europe upon this question and have not find it to be such as to justify i in propose an international conference there be however i be sure a grow sentiment in europe in favor of a large use of silver and i know of no more effectual way of promote this sentiment than by accumulate gold here a scarcity of gold in the european reserve will be the most persuasive argument for the use of silver
 the export of gold to europe which begin in february last and continue until the close of july aggregate over $ 70,000,000 the net loss of gold during the fiscal year be nearly $ 68,000,000 that no serious monetary disturbance result be most gratifying and give to europe fresh evidence of the strength and stability of our financial institution with the movement of crop the outflow of gold be speedily stop and a return set in up to december 1 we have recover of our gold lose at the port of new york $ 27,854,000 and it be confidently believe that during the winter and spring this aggregate will be steadily and largely increase
 the presence of a large cash surplus in the treasury have for many year be the subject of much unfavorable criticism and have furnish an argument to those who have desire to place the tariff upon a purely revenue basis it be agree by all that the withdrawal from circulation of so large an amount of money be an embarrassment to the business of the country and make necessary the intervention of the department at frequent interval to relieve threaten monetary panic the surplus on march 1 1889 be $ 183,827,190.29 the policy of apply this surplus to the redemption of the interest bear security of the united states be think to be preferable to that of deposit it without interest in select national bank there have be redeem since the date last mention of interest bear security $ 259,079,350 result in a reduction of the annual interest charge of $ 11,684,675 the money which have be deposit in bank without interest have be gradually withdraw and use in the redemption of bond
 the result of this policy of the silver legislation and of the refunding of the 4 1/2 per cent bond have be a large increase of the money in circulation at the date last name the circulation be $ 1,404,205,896 or $ 23.03 per capita while on the 1st day of december 1891 it have increase to $ 1,577,262,070 or $ 24.38 per capita the offer of the secretary of the treasury to the holder of the 4 1/2 per cent bond to extend the time of redemption at the option of the government at an interest of 2 per cent be accept by the holder of about one half the amount and the unextended bond be be redeem on presentation

 i have in a message to the precede congress express my view as to a modify use of the telegraph in connection with the postal service in pursuance of the ocean mail law of march 3 1891 and after a most careful study of the whole subject and frequent conference with ship owner board of trade and other advertisement be issue by the postmaster general for 53 line of ocean mail service--10 to great britain and the continent 27 to south america 3 to china and japan 4 to australia and the pacific island 7 to the west indies and 2 to mexico it be not of course expect that bid for all these line would be receive or that service upon they all would be contract for it be intend in furtherance of the act to secure as many new line as possible while include in the list most or all of the foreign line now occupy by american ship it be hope that a line to england and perhaps one to the continent would be secure but the outlay require to equip such line wholly with new ship of the first class and the difficulty of establish new line in competition with those already establish deter bidder whose interest have be enlist it be hope that a way may yet be find of overcome these difficulty

 the work in the bureau of indian affairs be perhaps never so large as now by reason of the numerous negotiation which have be proceed with the tribe for a reduction of the reservation with the incident labor of make allotment and be never more carefully conduct the provision of adequate school facility for indian child and the locating of adult indians upon farm involve the solution of the indian question everything else ration annuity and tribal negotiation with the agent inspector and commissioner who distribute and conduct they must pass away when the indian have become a citizen secure in the individual ownership of a farm from which he derive his subsistence by his own labor protect by and subordinate to the law which govern the white man and provide by the general government or by the local community in which he live with the mean of educate his child when an indian become a citizen in an organized state or territory his relation to the general government cease in great measure to be that of a ward but the general government ought not at once to put upon the state or territory the burden of the education of his child
 it have be my thought that the government school and school building upon the reservation would be absorb by the school system of the states and territories but as it have be find necessary to protect the indian against the compulsory alienation of his land by exempt he from taxation for a period of twenty five year it would seem to be right that the general government certainly where there be tribal fund in its possession should pay to the school fund of the state what would be equivalent to the local school tax upon the property of the indian it will be notice from the report of the commissioner of indian affairs that already some contract have be make with district school for the education of indian child there be great advantage i think in bring the indian child into mixed school this process will be gradual and in the meantime the present educational provision and arrangement the result of the good experience of those who have be charge with this work should be continue this will enable those religious body that have undertake the work of indian education with so much zeal and with result so restrain and beneficent to place their institution in new and useful relation to the indian and to his white neighbor
 the outbreak among the sioux which occur in december last be as to its cause and incident fully report upon by the war department and the department of the interior that these indians have some just complaint especially in the matter of the reduction of the appropriation for ration and in the delay attend the enactment of law to enable the department to perform the engagement enter into with they be probably true but the sioux tribe be naturally warlike and turbulent and their warrior be excite by their medicine man and chief who preach the coming of an indian messiah who be to give they power to destroy their enemy in view of the alarm that prevail among the white settler near the reservation and of the fatal consequence that would have result from an indian incursion i place at the disposal of general miles command the division of the missouri all such force as be think by he to be require he be entitle to the credit of having give thorough protection to the settler and of bring the hostile into subjection with the least possible loss of life
 the appropriation of $ 2,991,450 for the choctaws and chickasaws contain in the general indian appropriation bill of march 3 1891 have not be expend for the reason that i have not yet approve a release to the government of the indian claim to the land mention this matter will be make the subject of a special message place before congress all the fact which have come to my knowledge
 the relation of the five civilized tribes now occupy the indian territory to the united states be not i believe that well calculate to promote the high advancement of these indians that there should be within our border five independent state have no relation except those grow out of treaty with the government of the united states no representation in the national legislature its people not citizen be a startling anomaly
 it seem to i to be inevitable that there shall be before long some organic change in the relation of these people to the united states what form these change should take i do not think it desirable now to suggest even if they be well define in my own mind they should certainly involve the acceptance of citizenship by the indians and a representation in congress these indians should have opportunity to present their claim and grievance upon the floor rather than as now in the lobby if a commission could be appoint to visit these tribe to confer with they in a friendly spirit upon this whole subject even if no agreement be presently reach the feeling of the tribe upon this question would be develop and discussion would prepare the way for change which must come soon or later
 the good work of reduce the large indian reservation by allotment in severalty to the indians and the cession of the remain land to the united states for disposition under the homestead law have be prosecute during the year with energy and success in september last i be enable to open to settlement in the territory of oklahoma 900,000 acre of land all of which be take up by settler in a single day the rush for these land be accompany by a great deal of excitement but be happily free from incident of violence
 it be a source of great regret that i be not able to open at the same time the surplus land of the cheyenne and arapahoe reservation amount to about 3,000,000 acre by reason of the insufficiency of the appropriation for make the allotment deserving and impatient settler be wait to occupy these land and i urgently recommend that a special deficiency appropriation be promptly make of the small amount need so that the allotment may be complete and the surplus land open in time to permit the settler to get upon their homestead in the early spring
 during the past summer the cherokee commission have complete arrangement with the wichita kickapoo and tonkawa tribe whereby if the agreement be ratify by congress over 800,000 additional acre will be open to settlement in oklahoma
 the negotiation for the release by the cherokees of their claim to the cherokee strip have make no substantial progress so far as the department be officially advise but it be still hope that the cession of this large and valuable tract may be secure the price which the commission be authorize to offer--$1.25 per acre be in my judgment when all the circumstance as to title and the character of the land be consider a fair and adequate one and should have be accept by the indians
 since march 4 1889 about 23,000,000 acre have be separate from indian reservation and add to the public domain for the use of those who desire to secure free home under our beneficent law it be difficult to estimate the increase of wealth which will result from the conversion of these waste land into farm but it be more difficult to estimate the betterment which will result to the family that have find renew hope and courage in the ownership of a home and the assurance of a comfortable subsistence under free and healthful condition it be also gratify to be able to feel as we may that this work have proceed upon line of justice toward the indian and that he may now if he will secure to himself the good influence of a settle habitation the fruit of industry and the security of citizenship

 the commissioner be quite confident that there will be no call this year for a deficiency appropriation notwithstanding the rapidity with which the work be be push the mistake which have be make by many in their exaggerated estimate of the cost of pension be in not take account of the diminish value of first payment under the recent legislation these payment under the general law have be for many year very large as the pension when allowed date from the time of file the claim and most of these claim have be pende for year the first payment under the law of june 1890 be relatively small and as the per cent of these case increase and that of the old case diminish the annual aggregate of first payment be largely reduce the commissioner under date of november 13 furnish i with the statement that during the last four month 113,175 certificate be issue 27,893 under the general law and 85,282 under the act of june 27 1890 the average first payment during these four month be $ 131.85 while the average first payment upon case allow during the year end june 30 1891 be $ 239.33 be a reduction in the average first payment during these four month of $ 107.48
 the estimate for pension expenditure for the fiscal year end june 30 1893 be $ 144,956,000 which after a careful examination of the subject the commissioner be of the opinion will be sufficient while these disbursement to the disabled soldier of the great civil war be large they do not realize the exaggerated estimate of those who oppose this beneficent legislation the secretary of the interior show with great fullness the care that be take to exclude fraudulent claim and also the gratifying fact that the person to whom these pension be go be man who render not slight but substantial war service
 the report of the commissioner of railroads show that the total debt of the subsidize railroad to the united states be on december 31 1890 $ 112,512,613.06 a large part of this debt be now fast approach maturity with no adequate provision for its payment some policy for deal with this debt with a view to its ultimate collection should be at once adopt it be very difficult well nigh impossible for so large a body as the congress to conduct the necessary negotiation and investigation i therefore recommend that provision be make for the appointment of a commission to agree upon and report a plan for deal with this debt
 the work of the census bureau be now far in advance and the great bulk of the enormous labor involve complete it will be more strictly a statistical exhibit and less encumber by essay than its immediate predecessor the method pursue have be fair careful and intelligent and have secure the approval of the statistician who have follow they with a scientific and nonpartisan interest the appropriation necessary to the early completion and publication of the authorized volume should be give in time to secure against delay which increase the cost and at the same time diminish the value of the work
 the report of the secretary exhibit with interesting fullness the condition of the territories they have share with the states the great increase in farm product and be bring yearly large area into cultivation by extend their irrigating canal this work be be do by individual or local corporation and without that system which a full preliminary survey of the water supply and of the irrigable land would enable they to adopt the future of the territories of new mexico arizona and utah in their material growth and in the increase independence and happiness of their people be very largely dependent upon wise and timely legislation either by congress or their own legislature regulate the distribution of the water supply furnish by their stream if this matter be much long neglect private corporation will have unrestricted control of one of the element of life and the patentee of the arid land will be tenant at will of the water company
 the united states should part with its ownership of the water source and the site for reservoir whether to the states and territories or to individual or corporation only upon condition that will insure to the settler their proper water supply upon equal and reasonable term in the territories this whole subject be under the full control of congress and in the states it be practically so as long as the government hold the title to the reservoir site and water source and can grant they upon such condition as it choose to impose the improvident grant of franchise of enormous value without recompense to the state or municipality from which they proceed and without proper protection of the public interest be the most noticeable and flagrant evil of modern legislation this fault should not be commit in deal with a subject that will before many year affect so vitally thousand of our people
 the legislation of congress for the repression of polygamy have after year of resistance on the part of the mormons at last bring they to the conclusion that resistance be unprofitable and unavailing the power of congress over this subject should not be surrender until we have satisfactory evidence that the people of the state to be create would exercise the exclusive power of the state over this subject in the same way the question be not whether these people now obey the law of congress against polygamy but rather would they make enforce and maintain such law themselves if absolutely free to regulate the subject we can not afford to experiment with this subject for when a state be once constitute the act be final and any mistake irretrievable no compact in the enable act could in my opinion be bind or effective
 i recommend that provision be make for the organization of a simple form of town government in alaska with power to regulate such matter as be usually in the states under municipal control these local civil organization will give well protection in some matter than the present skeleton territorial organization proper restriction as to the power to levy taxis and to create debt should be impose
 if the establishment of the department of agriculture be regard by anyone as a mere concession to the unenlightened demand of a worthy class of people that impression have be most effectually remove by the great result already attain its home influence have be very great in disseminate agricultural and horticultural information in stimulate and direct a further diversification of crop in detect and eradicate disease of domestic animal and more than all in the close and informal contact which it have establish and maintain with the farmer and stock raiser of the whole country every request for information have have prompt attention and every suggestion merit consideration the scientific corps of the department be of a high order and be push its investigation with method and enthusiasm
 the inspection by this department of cattle and pork product intend for shipment abroad have be the basis of the success which have attend our effort to secure the removal of the restriction maintain by the european governments
 for ten year protest and petition upon this subject from the packer and stock raiser of the united states have be direct against these restriction which so seriously limit our market and curtail the profit of the farm it be a source of general congratulation that success have at last be attain for the effect of an enlarged foreign market for these meat will be feel not only by the farmer but in our public finance and in every branch of trade it be particularly fortunate that the increase demand for food product result from the removal of the restriction upon our meat and from the reciprocal trade arrangement to which i have refer should have come at a time when the agricultural surplus be so large without the help thus derive low price would have prevail the secretary of agriculture estimate that the restriction upon the importation of our pork product into europe lose we a market for $ 20,000,000 worth of these product annually
 the grain crop of this year be the large in our history--50 per cent great than that of last year and yet the new market that have be open and the large demand result from short crop in europe have sustain price to such an extent that the enormous surplus of meat and breadstuff will be market at good price bring relief and prosperity to an industry that be much depressed the value of the grain crop of the united states be estimate by the secretary to be this year $ 500,000,000 more than last of meat $ 150,000,000 more and of all product of the farm $ 700,000,000 more it be not inappropriate i think here to suggest that our satisfaction in the contemplation of this marvelous addition to the national wealth be uncloude by any suspicion of the currency by which it be measure and in which the farmer be pay for the product of his field
 the report of the civil service commission should receive the careful attention of the opponent as well as the friend of this reform the commission invite a personal inspection by senator and representatives of its record and method and every fair critic will feel that such an examination should precede a judgment of condemnation either of the system or its administration it be not claim that either be perfect but i believe that the law be be execute with impartiality and that the system be incomparably well and fair than that of appointment upon favor i have during the year extend the classified service to include superintendent teacher matron and physician in the indian service this branch of the service be largely related to educational and philanthropic work and will obviously be the well for the change
 the head of the several executive departments have be direct to establish at once an efficiency record as the basis of a comparative rating of the clerk within the classified service with a view to place promotion therein upon the basis of merit i be confident that such a record fairly keep and open to the inspection of those interested will powerfully stimulate the work of the departments and will be accept by all as place the troublesome matter of promotion upon a just basis
 i recommend that the appropriation for the civil service commission be make adequate to the increase work of the next fiscal year
 i have twice before urgently call the attention of congress to the necessity of legislation for the protection of the life of railroad employee but nothing have yet be do during the year end june 30 1890 369 brakeman be kill and 7,841 maim while engage in couple car the total number of railroad employee kill during the year be 2,451 and the number injure 22,390 this be a cruel and largely needless sacrifice the government be spend nearly $ 1,000,000 annually to save the life of shipwreck seaman every steam vessel be rigidly inspect and require to adopt the most approve safety appliance all this be good but how shall we excuse the lack of interest and effort in behalf of this army of brave young man who in our land commerce be be sacrifice every year by the continue use of antiquated and dangerous appliance a law require of every railroad engage in interstate commerce the equipment each year of a give per cent of its freight car with automatic coupler and air brake would compel an agreement between the road as to the kind of brake and coupler to be use and would very soon and very greatly reduce the present fearful death rate among railroad employee
 the method of appointment by the states of elector of president and vice president have recently attract renew interest by reason of a departure by the state of michigan from the method which have become uniform in all the states prior to 1832 various method have be use by the different states and even by the same state in some the choice be make by the legislature in other elector be choose by district but more generally by the voter of the whole state upon a general ticket the movement toward the adoption of the last name method have an early beginning and go steadily forward among the states until in 1832 there remain but a single state south carolina that have not adopt it that state until the civil war continue to choose its elector by a vote of the legislature but after the war change its method and conform to the practice of the other states for nearly sixty year all the states save one have appoint their elector by a popular vote upon a general ticket and for nearly thirty year this method be universal
 after a full test of other method without important division or dissent in any state and without any purpose of party advantage as we must believe but solely upon the consideration that uniformity be desirable and that a general election in territorial division not subject to change be most consistent with the popular character of our institution well preserve the equality of the voter and perfectly remove the choice of president from the baneful influence of the gerrymander the practice of all the states be bring into harmony that this concurrence should now be break be i think an unfortunate and even a threatening episode and one that may well suggest whether the states that still give their approval to the old and prevailing method ought not to secure by a constitutional amendment a practice which have have the approval of all the recent michigan legislation provide for choose what be popularly know as the congressional elector for president by congressional district and the two senatorial elector by district create for that purpose this legislation be of course accompany by a new congressional apportionment and the two statute bring the electoral vote of the state under the influence of the gerrymander
 these gerrymander for congressional purpose be in most case buttress by a gerrymander of the legislative district thus make it impossible for a majority of the legal voter of the state to correct the apportionment and equalize the congressional district a minority rule be establish that only a political convulsion can overthrow i have recently be advise that in one county of a certain state three district for the election of member of the legislature be constitute as follow one have 65,000 population one 15,000 and one 10,000 while in another county detach noncontiguous section have be unite to make a legislative district these method have already find effective application to the choice of senator and representatives in congress and now an evil start have be make in the direction of apply they to the choice by the states of elector of president and vice president if this be accomplish we shall then have the three great department of the government in the grasp of the gerrymander the legislative and executive directly and the judiciary indirectly through the power of appointment
 an election imply a body of elector have prescribe qualification each one of whom have an equal value and influence in determine the result so when the constitution provide that each state shall appoint elect in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of elector etc an unrestricted power be not give to the legislature in the selection of the method to be use a republican form of government be guarantee by the constitution to each state and the power give by the same instrument to the legislature of the states to prescribe method for the choice by the state of elector must be exercise under that limitation the essential feature of such a government be the right of the people to choose their own officer and the near practicable equality of value in the suffrage give in determine that choice
 it will not be claim that the power give to the legislature would support a law provide that the person receive the small vote should be the elector or a law that all the elector should be choose by the voter of a single congressional district the state be to choose and finder the pretense of regulating method the legislature can neither vest the right of choice elsewhere nor adopt method not conformable to republican institution it be not my purpose here to discuss the question whether a choice by the legislature or by the voter of equal single district be a choice by the state but only to recommend such regulation of this matter by constitutional amendment as will secure uniformity and prevent that disgraceful partisan jugglery to which such a liberty of choice if it exist offer a temptation
 nothing just now be more important than to provide every guaranty for the absolutely fair and free choice by an equal suffrage within the respective states of all the officer of the national government whether that suffrage be apply directly as in the choice of member of the house of representatives or indirectly as in the choice of senator and elector of president respect for public officer and obedience to law will not cease to be the characteristic of our people until our election cease to declare the will of majority fairly ascertain without fraud suppression or gerrymander if i be call upon to declare wherein our chief national danger lie i should say without hesitation in the overthrow of majority control by the suppression or perversion of the popular suffrage that there be a real danger here all must agree but the energy of those who see it have be chiefly expend in try to fix responsibility upon the opposite party rather than in effort to make such practice impossible by either party
 be it not possible now to adjourn that interminable and inconclusive debate while we take by consent one step in the direction of reform by eliminate the gerrymander which have be denounce by all party as an influence in the selection of elector of president and member of congress all the states have act freely and separately determine that the choice of elector by a general ticket be the wise and safe method and it would seem there could be no objection to a constitutional amendment make that method permanent if a legislature choose in one year upon purely local question should pende a presidential contest meet rescind the law for a choice upon a general ticket and provide for the choice of elector by the legislature and this trick should determine the result it be not too much to say that the public peace might be seriously and widely endanger
 i have allude to the gerrymander as affect the method of select elector of president by congressional district but the primary intent and effect of this form of political robbery have relation to the selection of member of the house of representatives the power of congress be ample to deal with this threatening and intolerable abuse the unfailing test of sincerity in election reform will be find in a willingness to confer as to remedy and to put into force such measure as will most effectually preserve the right of the people to free and equal representation
 an attempt be make in the last congress to bring to bear the constitutional power of the general government for the correction of fraud against the suffrage it be important to know whether the opposition to such measure be really rest in particular feature suppose to be objectionable or include any proposition to give to the election law of the united states adequacy to the correction of grave and acknowledge evil i must yet entertain the hope that it be possible to secure a calm patriotic consideration of such constitutional or statutory change as may be necessary to secure the choice of the officer of the government to the people by fair apportionment and free election
 i believe it would be possible to constitute a commission nonpartisan in its membership and compose of patriotic wise and impartial man to whom a consideration of the question of the evil connect with our election system and method might be commit with a good prospect of secure unanimity in some plan for remove or mitigate those evil the constitution would permit the selection of the commission to be vest in the supreme court if that method would give the good guaranty of impartiality this commission should be charge with the duty of inquire into the whole subject of the law of election as relate to the choice of officer of the national government with a view to secure to every elector a free and unmolested exercise of the suffrage and as near an approach to an equality of value in each ballot cast as be attainable
 while the policy of the general government upon the tariff upon the restoration of our merchant marine upon river and harbor improvement and other such matter of grave and general concern be liable to be turn this way or that by the result of congressional election and administrative policy sometimes involve issue that tend to peace or war to be turn this way or that by the result of a presidential election there be a rightful interest in all the states and in every congressional district that will not be deceive or silence by the audacious pretense that the question of the right of any body of legal voter in any state or in any congressional district to give their suffrage freely upon these general question be a matter only of local concern or control the demand that the limitation of suffrage shall be find in the law and only there be a just demand and no just man should resent or resist it my appeal be and must continue to be for a consultation that shall proceed with candor calmness and patience upon the line of justice and humanity not of prejudice and cruelty
 to the consideration of these very grave question i invite not only the attention of congress but that of all patriotic citizen we must not entertain the delusion that our people have cease to regard a free ballot and equal representation as the price of their allegiance to law and to civil magistrate
 i have be greatly rejoice to notice many evidence of the increase unification of our people and of a revive national spirit the vista that now open to we be wide and more glorious than ever before gratification and amazement struggle for supremacy as we contemplate the population wealth and moral strength of our country a trust momentous in its influence upon our people and upon the world be for a brief time commit to we and we must not be faithless to its first condition the defense of the free and equal influence of the people in the choice of public officer and in the control of public affair

to the senate and house of representatives the report of the head of the several executive departments require by law to be submit to i which be herewith transmit and the report of the secretary of the treasury and the attorney general make directly to congress furnish a comprehensive view of the administrative work of the last fiscal year relate to internal affair it would be of great advantage if these report could have an alternative perusal by every member of congress and by all who take an interest in public affair such a perusal could not fail to excite a high appreciation of the vast labor and conscientious effort which be give to the conduct of our civil administration the report will i believe show that every question have be approach consider and decide from the standpoint of public duty upon consideration affect the public interest alone again i invite to every branch of the service the attention and scrutiny of congress the work of the state department during the last year have be characterize by an unusual number of important negotiation and by diplomatic result of a notable and highly beneficial character among these be the reciprocal trade arrangement which have be conclude in the exercise of the power confer by section 3 of the tariff law with the republic of brazil with spain for its west india possession and with santo domingo like negotiation with other country have be much advanced and it be hope that before the close of the year far definitive trade arrangement of great value will be conclude in view of the report which have be receive as to the diminution of the seal herd in the bering sea i deem it wise to propose to her majesty 's government in february last that an agreement for a closed season should be make pende the negotiation for arbitration which then seem to be approach a favorable conclusion after much correspondence and delay for which this government be not responsible an agreement be reach and sign on the 15th of june by which great britain undertake from that date and until may 1 1892 to prohibit the killing by her subject of seal in the bering sea and the government of the united states during the same period to enforce its exist prohibition against pelagic sealing and to limit the catch by the fur seal company upon the island to 7,500 skin if this agreement could have be reach early in response to the strenuous endeavor of this government it would have be more effective but come even as late as it do it unquestionably result in greatly diminish the destruction of the seal by the canadian sealer in my last annual message i state that the basis of arbitration propose by her majesty 's government for the adjustment of the long pende controversy as to the seal fishery be not acceptable i be glad now to be able to announce that term satisfactory to this government have be agree upon and that an agreement as to the arbitrator be all that be necessary to the completion of the convention in view of the advanced position which this government have take upon the subject of international arbitration this renew expression of our adherence to this method for the settlement of dispute such as have arise in the bering sea will i doubt not meet with the concurrence of congress provision should be make for a joint demarcation of the frontier line between canada and the united states wherever require by the increase border settlement and especially for the exact location of the water boundary in the strait and river i should have be glad to announce some favorable disposition of the boundary dispute between great britain and venezuela touch the western frontier of british guiana but the friendly effort of the united states in that direction have thus far be unavaile this government will continue to express its concern at any appearance of foreign encroachment on territory long under the administrative control of american states the determination of a dispute boundary be easily attainable by amicable arbitration where the right of the respective party rest as here on historic fact readily ascertainable the law of the last congress provide a system of inspection for our meat intend for export and clothe the president with power to exclude foreign product from our market in case the country send they should perpetuate unjust discrimination against any product of the united states place this government in a position to effectively urge the removal of such discrimination against our meat it be gratify to be able to state that germany denmark italy austria and france in the order name have open their port to inspect american pork product the removal of these restriction in every instance be ask for and give solely upon the ground that we have now provide a meat inspection that should be accept as adequate to the complete removal of the danger real or fancy which have be previously urge the state department our minister abroad and the secretary of agriculture have cooperate with unflagge and intelligent zeal for the accomplishment of this great result the outline of an agreement have be reach with germany look to equitable trade concession in consideration of the continue free importation of her sugar but the time have not yet arrive when this correspondence can be submit to congress the recent political disturbance in the republic of brazil have excite regret and solicitude the information we possess be too meager to enable we to form a satisfactory judgment of the cause lead to the temporary assumption of supreme power by president fonseca but this government do not fail to express to he its anxious solicitude for the peace of brazil and for the maintenance of the free political institution which have recently be establish there nor to offer our advice that great moderation should be observe in the clash of party and the contest for leadership these counsel be receive in the most friendly spirit and the late information be that constitutional government have be reestablish without bloodshed the lynching at new orleans in march last of eleven man of italian nativity by a mob of citizen be a most deplorable and discreditable incident it do not however have its origin in any general animosity to the italian people nor in any disrespect to the government of italy with which our relation be of the most friendly character the fury of the mob be direct against these man as the suppose participant or accessory in the murder of a city officer i do not allude to this as mitigate in any degree this offense against law and humanity but only as affect the international question which grow out of it it be at once represent by the italian minister that several of those whose life have be take by the mob be italian subject and a demand be make for the punishment of the participant and for an indemnity to the family of those who be kill it be to be regret that the manner in which these claim be present be not such as to promote a calm discussion of the question involve but this may well be attribute to the excitement and indignation which the crime naturally evoke the view of this government as to its obligation to foreigner domicile here be fully state in the correspondence as well as its purpose to make an investigation of the affair with a view to determine whether there be present any circumstance that could under such rule of duty as we have indicate create an obligation upon the united states the temporary absence of a minister plenipotentiary of italy at this capital have retard the further correspondence but it be not doubt that a friendly conclusion be attainable some suggestion grow out of this unhappy incident be worthy the attention of congress it would i believe be entirely competent for congress to make offense against the treaty right of foreigner domicile in the united states cognizable in the federal court this have not however be do and the federal officer and court have no power in such case to intervene either for the protection of a foreign citizen or for the punishment of his slayer it seem to i to follow in this state of the law that the officer of the state charge with police and judicial power in such case must in the consideration of international question grow out of such incident be regard in such sense as federal agent as to make this government answerable for their act in case where it would be answerable if the united states have use its constitutional power to define and punish crime against treaty right the civil war in chile which begin in january last be continue but fortunately with infrequent and not important armed collision until august 28 when the congressional force land near valparaiso and after a bloody engagement capture that city president balmaceda at once recognize that his cause be lose and a provisional government be speedily establish by the victorious party our minister be promptly direct to recognize and put himself in communication with this government so soon as it should have establish its de facto character which be do during the pendency of this civil contest frequent indirect appeal be make to this government to extend belligerent right to the insurgent and to give audience to their representative this be decline and that policy be pursue throughout which this government when wrench by civil war so strenuously insist upon on the part of european nation the itata an armed vessel command by a naval officer of the insurgent fleet man by its sailor and with soldier on board be seize under process of the united states court at san diego cal for a violation of our neutrality law while in the custody of an officer of the court the vessel be forcibly wrest from his control and put to sea it would have be inconsistent with the dignity and self respect of this government not to have insist that the itala should be return to san diego to abide the judgment of the court this be so clear to the junta of the congressional party establish at iquique that before the arrival of the itata at that port the secretary of foreign relation of the provisional government address to rear admiral brown command the united states naval force a communication from which the following be an extract the provisional government have learn by the cablegram of the associated press that the transport itata detain in san diego by order of the united states for take on board munition of war and in possession of the marshal leave the port carry on board this official who be land at a point near the coast and then continue her voyage if this news be correct this government would deplore the conduct of the itata and as an evidence that it be not dispose to support or agree to the infraction of the law of the united states the undersigned take advantage of the personal relation you have be good enough to maintain with he since your arrival in this port to declare to you that as soon as she be within reach of our order his government will put the itata with the arm and munition she take on board in sail diego at the disposition of the united states a trial in the district court of the united states for the southern district of california have recently result in a decision holding among other thing that inasmuch as the congressional party have not be recognize as a belligerent the act do in its interest could not be a violation of our neutrality law from this judgment the united states have appeal not that the condemnation of the vessel be a matter of importance but that we may know what the present state of our law be for if this construction of the statute be correct there be obvious necessity for revision and amendment during the progress of the war in chile this government tender its good office to bring about a peaceful adjustment and it be at one time hope that a good result might be reach but in this we be disappoint the instruction to our naval officer and to our minister at santiago from the first to the last of this struggle enjoin upon they the most impartial treatment and absolute noninterference i be satisfied that these instruction be observe and that our representative be always watchful to use their influence impartially in the interest of humanity and on more than one occasion do so effectively we could not forget however that this government be in diplomatic relation with the then established government of chile as it be now in such relation with the successor of that government i be quite sure that president montt who have under circumstance of promise for the peace of chile be instal as president of that republic will not desire that in the unfortunate event of any revolt against his authority the policy of this government should be other than that which we have recently observe no official complaint of the conduct of our minister or of our naval officer during the struggle have be present to this government and it be a matter of regret that so many of our own people should have give ear to unofficial charge and complaint that manifestly have their origin in rival interest and in a wish to pervert the relation of the united states with chile the collapse of the government of balmaceda bring about a condition which be unfortunately too familiar in the history of the central and south american states with the overthrow of the balmaceda government he and many of his councilor and officer become at once fugitive for their life and appeal to the command officer of the foreign naval vessel in the harbor of valparaiso and to the resident foreign minister at santiago for asylum this asylum be freely give accord to my information by the naval vessel of several foreign power and by several of the legation at santiago the american minister as well as his colleague act upon the impulse of humanity extend asylum to political refugee whose life be in peril i have not be willing to direct the surrender of such of these person as be still in the american legation without suitable condition it be believe that the government of chile be not in a position in view of the precedent with which it have be connect to broadly deny the right of asylum and the correspondence have not thus far present any such denial the treatment of our minister for a time be such as to call for a decided protest and it be very gratifying to observe that unfriendly measure which be undoubtedly the result of the prevail excitement be at once rescind or suitably relaxed on the 16th of october an event occur in valparaiso so serious and tragic in its circumstance and result as to very justly excite the indignation of our people and to call for prompt and decide action on the part of this government a considerable number of the sailor of the united states steamship baltimore then in the harbor at valparaiso be upon shore leave and unarmed be assault by armed man nearly simultaneously in different locality in the city one petty officer be kill outright and seven or eight seaman be seriously wound one of whom have since die so savage and brutal be the assault that several of our sailor receive more than two and one as many as eighteen stab wound an investigation of the affair be promptly make by a board of officer of the baltimore and their report show that these assault be unprovoked that our man be conduct themselves in a peaceable and orderly manner and that some of the police of the city take part in the assault and use their weapon with fatal effect while a few other with some well dispose citizen endeavor to protect our man thirty six of our sailor be arrest and some of they while be take to prison be cruelly beat and maltreat the fact that they be all discharge no criminal charge be lodge against any one of they show very clearly that they be innocent of any breach of the peace so far as i have yet be able to learn no other explanation of this bloody work have be suggest than that it have its origin in hostility to those man as sailor of the united states wear the uniform of their government and not in any individual act or personal animosity the attention of the chilean government be at once call to this affair and a statement of the fact obtain by the investigation we have conduct be submit accompany by a request to be advise of any other or qualifying fact in the possession of the chilean government that might tend to relieve this affair of the appearance of an insult to this government the chilean government be also advise that if such qualifying fact do not exist this government would confidently expect full and prompt reparation it be to be regret that the reply of the secretary for foreign affair of the provisional government be couch in an offensive tone to this no response have be make this government be now await the result of an investigation which have be conduct by the criminal court at valparaiso it be report unofficially that the investigation be about complete and it be expect that the result will soon be communicate to this government together with some adequate and satisfactory response to the note by which the attention of chile be call to this incident if these just expectation should be disappoint or further needless delay intervene i will by a special message bring this matter again to the attention of congress for such action as may be necessary the entire correspondence with the government of chile will at an early day be submit to congress i renew the recommendation of my special message date january 16 1890 for the adoption of the necessary legislation to enable this government to apply in the case of sweden and norway the same rule in respect to the levying of tonnage due as be claim and secure to the shipping of the united states in 1828 under article viii of the treaty of 1827.the adjournment of the senate without action on the pende act for the suppression of the slave traffic in africa and for the reform of the revenue tariff of the independent state of the kongo leave this government unable to exchange those act on the date fix july 2 1891 a modus vivendi have be conclude by which the power of the kongo state to levy duty on import be leave unimpaired and by agreement of all the signatory to the general slave trade act the time for the exchange of ratification on the part of the united states have be extend to february 2 1892.the late outbreak against foreigner in various part of the chinese empire have be a cause of deep concern in view of the numerous establishment of our citizen in the interior of that country this government can do no less than insist upon a continuance of the protective and punitory measure which the chinese government have heretofore apply no effort will be omit to protect our citizen peaceably sojourn in china but recent unofficial information indicate that what be at first regard as an outbreak of mob violence against foreigner have assume the large form of an insurrection against public order the chinese government have decline to receive mr. blair as the minister of the united states on the ground that as a participant while a senator in the enactment of the exist legislation against the introduction of chinese laborer he have become unfriendly and objectionable to china i have feel constrain to point out to the chinese government the untenableness of this position which seem to rest as much on the unacceptability of our legislation as on that of the person choose and which if admit would practically debar the selection of any representative so long as the exist law remain in force you will be call upon to consider the expediency of make special provision by law for the temporary admission of some chinese artisan and laborer in connection with the exhibit of chinese industry at the approach columbian exposition i regard it as desirable that the chinese exhibit be facilitate in every proper way a question have arise with the government of spain touch the right of american citizen in the caroline islands our citizen there long prior to the confirmation of spain 's claim to the island have secure by settlement and purchase certain right to the recognition and maintenance of which the faith of spain be pledge i have have reason within the past year very strongly to protest against the failure to carry out this pledge on the part of his majesty 's minister which have result in great injustice and injury to the american resident the government and people of spain propose to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of america by hold an exposition at madrid which will open on the 12th of september and continue until the 31st of december 1892 a cordial invitation have be extend to the united states to take part in this commemoration and as spain be one of the first nation to express the intention to participate in the world 's columbian exposition at chicago it would be very appropriate for this government to give this invitation its friendly promotion survey for the connect link of the project intercontinental railway be in progress not only in mexico but at various point along the course map out three survey party be now in the field under the direction of the commission nearly 1,000 mile of the propose road have be survey include the most difficult part that through ecuador and the southern part of colombia the report of the engineer be very satisfactory and show that no insurmountable obstacle have be meet with on november 12 1884 a treaty be conclude with mexico reaffirm the boundary between the two country as describe in the treaty of february 2 1848 and december 30 1853 march 1 1889 a further treaty be negotiate to facilitate the carrying out of the principle of the treaty of 1884 and to avoid the difficulty occasion by reason of the change and alteration that take place from natural cause in the rio grande and colorado river in the portion thereof constitute the boundary line between the two republics the international boundary commission provide for by the treaty of 1889 to have exclusive jurisdiction of any question that may arise have be name by the mexican government an appropriation be necessary to enable the united states to fulfill its treaty obligation in this respect the death of king kalakaua in the united states afford occasion to testify our friendship for hawaii by convey the king 's body to his own land in a naval vessel with all due honor the government of his successor queen liliuokolani be seek to promote close commercial relation with the united states survey for the much need submarine cable from our pacific coast to honolulu be in progress and this enterprise should have the suitable promotion of the two government i strongly recommend that provision be make for improve the harbor of pearl river and equip it as a naval station the arbitration treaty formulate by the international american conference lapse by reason of the failure to exchange ratification fully within the limit of time provide but several of the government concern have express a desire to save this important result of the conference by an extension of the period it be in my judgment incumbent upon the united states to conserve the influential initiative it have take in this measure by ratify the instrument and by advocate the propose extension of the time for exchange these view have be make known to the other signatory this government have find occasion to express in a friendly spirit but with much earnestness to the government of the czar its serious concern because of the harsh measure now be enforce against the hebrews in russia by the revival of antisemitic law long in abeyance great number of those unfortunate people have be constrain to abandon their home and leave the empire by reason of the impossibility of find subsistence within the pale to which it be seek to confine they the immigration of these people to the united states many other country be close to they be largely increase and be likely to assume proportion which may make it difficult to find home and employment for they here and to seriously affect the labor market be estimate that over 1,000,000 will be force from russia within a few year the hebrew be never a beggar he have always keep the law life by toil often under severe and oppressive civil restriction it be also true that no race sect or class have more fully care for its own than the hebrew race but the sudden transfer of such a multitude under condition that tend to strip they of their small accumulation and to depress their energy and courage be neither good for they nor for we the banishment whether by direct decree or by not less certain indirect method of so large a number of man and woman be not a local question a decree to leave one country be in the nature of thing an order to enter another some other this consideration as well as the suggestion of humanity furnish ample ground for the remonstrance which we have present to russia while our historic friendship for that government can not fail to give the assurance that our representation be those of a sincere wellwisher the annual report of the maritime canal company of nicaragua show that much costly and necessary preparatory work have be do during the year in the construction of shop railroad track and harbor pier and breakwater and that the work of canal construction have make some progress i deem it to be a matter of the high concern to the united states that this canal connect the water of the atlantic and pacific ocean and give to we a short water communication between our port upon those two great sea should be speedily construct and at the small practicable limit of cost the gain in freight to the people and the direct saving to the government of the united states in the use of its naval vessel would pay the entire cost of this work within a short series of year the report of the secretary of the navy show the saving in our naval expenditure which would result the senator from alabama mr. morgan in his argument upon this subject before the senate at the last session do not overestimate the importance of this work when he say that the canal be the most important subject now connect with the commercial growth and progress of the united states "if this work be to be promote by the usual financial method and without the aid of this government the expenditure in its interest bear security and stock will probably be twice the actual cost this will necessitate high toll and constitute a heavy and altogether needless burden upon our commerce and that of the world every dollar of the bond and stock of the company should represent a dollar expend in the legitimate and economical prosecution of the work this be only possible by give to the bond the guaranty of the united states government such a guaranty would secure the ready sale at par of a 3 per cent bond from time to time as the money be need i do not doubt that build upon these business method the canal would when fully inaugurate earn its fix charge and operating expense but if its bond be to be market at heavy discount and every bond sell be to be accompany by a gift of stock as have come to be expect by investor in such enterprise the traffic will be seriously burden to pay interest and dividend i be quite willing to recommend government promotion in the prosecution of a work which if no other mean offer for secure its completion be of such transcendent interest that the government should in my opinion secure it by direct appropriation from its treasury a guaranty of the bond of the canal company to an amount necessary to the completion of the canal could i think be so give as not to involve any serious risk of ultimate loss the thing to be carefully guard be the completion of the work within the limit of the guaranty the subrogation of the united states to the right of the first mortgage bondholder for any amount it may have to pay and in the meantime a control of the stock of the company as a security against mismanagement and loss i most sincerely hope that neither party nor sectional line will be draw upon this great american project so full of interest to the people of all our states and so influential in its effect upon the prestige and prosperity of our common country the island of navassa in the west indian group have under the provision of title vii of the revised statutes be recognize by the president as appertain to the united states it contain guano deposit be own by the navassa phosphate company and be occupy solely its employee in september 1889 a revolt take place among these laborer result in the killing of some of the agent of the company cause as the laborer claim by cruel treatment these man be arrest and try in the united states court at baltimore under section 5576 of the statute refer to as if the offense have be commit on board a merchant vessel of the united states on the high sea there appear on the trial and otherwise come to i such evidence of the bad treatment of the man that in consideration of this and of the fact that the man have no access to any public officer or tribunal for protection or the redress of their wrong i commute the death sentence that have be pass by the court upon three of they in april last my attention be again call to this island and to the unregulated condition of thing there by a letter from a colored laborer who complain that he be wrongfully detain upon the island by the phosphate company after the expiration of his contract of service a naval vessel be send to examine into the case of this man and generally into the condition of thing on the island it be find that the laborer refer to have be detain beyond the contract limit and that a condition of revolt again exist among the laborer a board of naval officer report among other thing as follow we would desire to state far that the discipline maintain on the island seem to be that of a convict establishment without its comfort and cleanliness and that until more attention be pay to the shipping of laborer by place it under government supervision to prevent misunderstanding and misrepresentation and until some amelioration be show in the treatment of the laborer these disorder will be of constant occurrence i recommend legislation that shall place labor contract upon this and other island have the relation that navassa have to the united states under the supervision of a court commissioner and that shall provide at the expense of the owner an officer to reside upon the island with power to judge and adjust dispute and to enforce a just and humane treatment of the employee it be inexcusable that american laborer should be leave within our own jurisdiction without access to any government officer or tribunal for their protection and the redress of their wrong international copyright have be secure in accordance with the condition of the act of march 3 1891 with belgium france great britain and the british possession and switzerland the law of those country permit to our citizen the benefit of copyright on substantially the same basis as to their own citizen or subject with germany a special convention have be negotiate upon this subject which will bring that country within the reciprocal benefit of our legislation the general interest in the operation of the treasury department have be much augment during the last year by reason of the conflict prediction which accompany and follow the tariff and other legislation of the last congress affect the revenue as to the result of this legislation upon the treasury and upon the country on the one hand it be contend that import would so fall off as to leave the treasury bankrupt and that the price of article enter into the living of the people would be so enhanced as to disastrously affect their comfort and happiness while on the other it be argue that the loss to the revenue largely the result of place sugar on the free list would be a direct gain to the people that the price of the necessary of life include those most highly protect would not be enhance that labor would have a large market and the product of the farm advanced price while the treasury surplus and receipt would be adequate to meet the appropriation include the large exceptional expenditure for the refunding to the states of the direct tax and the redemption of the 4 1/2 per cent bond it be not my purpose to enter at any length into a discussion of the effect of the legislation to which i have refer but a brief examination of the statistic of the treasury and a general glance at the state of business throughout the country will i think satisfy any impartial inquirer that its result have disappoint the evil prophecy of its opponent and in a large measure realize the hopeful prediction of its friend rarely if ever before in the history of the country have there be a time when the proceed of one day s labor or the product of one farm acre would purchase so large an amount of those thing that enter into the living of the masse of the people i believe that a full test will develop the fact that the tariff act of the fifty first congress be very favorable in its average effect upon the price of article enter into common use during the twelve month from october 1 1890 to september 30 1891 the total value of our foreign commerce import and export combine be $ 1,747,806,406 which be the large of any year in the history of the united states the large in any previous year be in 1890 when our commerce amount to $ 1,647,139,093 and the last year exceed this enormous aggregate by over one hundred million it be interesting and to some will be surprising to know that during the year end september 30 1891 our import of merchandise amount to $ 824,715,270 which be an increase of more than $ 11,000,000 over the value of the import of the corresponding month of the precede year when the import of merchandise be unusually large in anticipation of the tariff legislation then pende the average annual value of the import of merchandise for the ten year from 1881 to 1890 be $ 692,186,522 and during the year end september 30 1891 this annual average be exceed by $ 132,528,469.the value of free import during the twelve month end september 30 1891 be $ 118,092,387 more than the value of free import during the corresponding twelve month of the precede year and there be during the same period a decrease of $ 106,846,508 in the value of import of dutiable merchandise the percentage of merchandise admit free of duty during the year to which i have refer the first under the new tariff be 48.18 while during the precede twelve month under the old tariff the percentage be 34.27 an increase of 13.91 per cent if we take the six month end september 30 last which cover the time during which sugar have be admit free of duty the per cent of value of merchandise import free of duty be find to be 55.37 which be a large percentage of free import than during any prior fiscal year in the history of the government if we turn to export of merchandise the statistic be full of gratification the value of such export of merchandise for the twelve month end september 30 1891 be $ 923,091,136 while for the correspond previous twelve month it be $ 860,177,115 an increase of $ 62,914,021 which be nearly three time the average annual increase of export of merchandise for the precede twenty year this exceed in amount and value the export of merchandise during any year in the history of the government the increase in the value of export of agricultural product during the year refer to over the corresponding twelve month of the prior year be $ 45,846,197 while the increase in the value of export of manufacture product be $ 16,838,240.there be certainly nothing in the condition of trade foreign or domestic there be certainly nothing in the condition of our people of any class to suggest that the exist tariff and revenue legislation bear oppressively upon the people or retard the commercial development of the nation it may be argue that our condition would be well if tariff legislation be upon a free trade basis but it can not be deny that all the condition of prosperity and of general contentment be present in a large degree than ever before in our history and that too just when it be prophesy they would be in the bad state agitation for radical change in tariff and financial legislation can not help but may seriously impede business to the prosperity of which some degree of stability in legislation be essential i think there be conclusive evidence that the new tariff have create several great industry which will within a few year give employment to several hundred thousand american work man and woman in view of the somewhat overcrowded condition of the labor market of the united states every patriotic citizen should rejoice at such a result the report of the secretary of the treasury show that the total receipt of the government from all source for the fiscal year end june 30 1891 be $ 458,544,233.03 while the expenditure for the same period be $ 421,304,470.46 leave a surplus of $ 37,239,762.57.the receipt of the fiscal year end june 30 1892 actual and estimate be $ 433,000,000 and the expenditure $ 409,000,000 for the fiscal year end june 30 1893 the estimate receipt be $ 455,336,350 and the expenditure $ 441,300,093.under the law of july 14 1890 the secretary of the treasury have purchase since august 13 during the fiscal year 48,393,113 ounce of silver bullion at an average cost of $ 1.045 per ounce the high price pay during the year be $ 1.2025 and the low $ 0.9636 in exchange for this silver bullion there have be issue $ 50,577,498 of the treasury note authorize by the act the low price of silver reach during the fiscal year be $ 0.9636 on april 22 1891 but on november 1 the market price be only $ 0.96 which would give to the silver dollar a bullion value of 74 1/4 cent before the influence of the prospective silver legislation be feel in the market silver be worth in new york about $ 0.955 per ounce the able advocate of free coinage in the last congress be most confident in their prediction that the purchase by the government require by the law would at once bring the price of silver to $ 1.2929 per ounce which would make the bullion value of a dollar 100 cent and hold it there the prophecy of the antisilver man of disaster to result from the coinage of $ 2,000,000 per month be not wide of the mark the friend of free silver be not agree i think as to the cause that bring their hopeful prediction to naught some fact be know the export of silver from london to india during the first nine month of this calendar year fall off over 50 per cent or $ 17,202,730 compare with the same month of the precede year the export of domestic silver bullion from this country which have average for the last ten year over $ 17,000,000 fall in the last fiscal year to $ 13,797,391 while for the first time in recent year the import of silver into this country exceed the export by the sum of $ 2,745,365 in the previous year the net export of silver from the united states amount to $ 8,545,455 the production of the united states increase from 50,000,000 ounce in 1889 to 54,500,000 in 1890 the government be now buy and put aside annually 54,000,000 ounce which allow for 7,140,000 ounce of new bullion use in the art be 6,640,000 more than our domestic product available for coinage i hope the depression in the price of silver be temporary and that a further trial of this legislation will more favorably affect it that the increase volume of currency thus supply for the use of the people be need and that beneficial result upon trade and price have follow this legislation i think must be very clear to everyone nor should it be forget that for every dollar of these note issue a full dollar 's worth of silver bullion be at the time deposit in the treasury as a security for its redemption upon this subject as upon the tariff my recommendation be that the exist law be give a full trial and that our business interest be spare the distressing influence which threat of radical change always impart under exist legislation it be in the power of the treasury department to maintain that essential condition of national finance as well as of commercial prosperity the parity in use of the coin dollar and their paper representative the assurance that these power would be freely and unhesitatingly use have do much to produce and sustain the present favorable business condition i be still of the opinion that the free coinage of silver under exist condition would disastrously affect our business interest at home and abroad we could not hope to maintain an equality in the purchasing power of the gold and silver dollar in our own market and in foreign trade the stamp give no add value to the bullion contain in coin the producer of the country its farmer and laborer have the high interest that every dollar paper or coin issue by the government shall be as good as any other if there be one less valuable than another its sure and constant errand will be to pay they for their toil and for their crop the money lender will protect himself by stipulate for payment in gold but the laborer have never be able to do that to place business upon a silver basis would mean a sudden and severe contraction of the currency by the withdrawal of gold and gold note and such an unsettling of all value as would produce a commercial panic i can not believe that a people so strong and prosperous as ours will promote such a policy the producer of silver be entitle to just consideration but they should not forget that the government be now buy and put out of the market what be the equivalent of the entire product of our silver mine this be more than they themselves think of ask two year ago i believe it be the earnest desire of a great majority of the people as it be mine that a full coin use shall be make of silver just as soon as the cooperation of other nation can be secure and a ratio fix that will give circulation equally to gold and silver the business of the world require the use of both metal but i do not see any prospect of gain but much of loss by give up the present system in which a full use be make of gold and a large use of silver for one in which silver alone will circulate such an event would be at once fatal to the further progress of the silver movement bimetallism be the desire end and the true friend of silver will be careful not to overrun the goal and bring in silver monometallism with its necessary attendant the loss of our gold to europe and the relief of the pressure there for a large currency i have endeavor by the use of official and unofficial agency to keep a close observation of the state of public sentiment in europe upon this question and have not find it to be such as to justify i in propose an international conference there be however i be sure a grow sentiment in europe in favor of a large use of silver and i know of no more effectual way of promote this sentiment than by accumulate gold here a scarcity of gold in the european reserve will be the most persuasive argument for the use of silver the export of gold to europe which begin in february last and continue until the close of july aggregate over $ 70,000,000 the net loss of gold during the fiscal year be nearly $ 68,000,000 that no serious monetary disturbance result be most gratifying and give to europe fresh evidence of the strength and stability of our financial institution with the movement of crop the outflow of gold be speedily stop and a return set in up to december 1 we have recover of our gold lose at the port of new york $ 27,854,000 and it be confidently believe that during the winter and spring this aggregate will be steadily and largely increase the presence of a large cash surplus in the treasury have for many year be the subject of much unfavorable criticism and have furnish an argument to those who have desire to place the tariff upon a purely revenue basis it be agree by all that the withdrawal from circulation of so large an amount of money be an embarrassment to the business of the country and make necessary the intervention of the department at frequent interval to relieve threaten monetary panic the surplus on march 1 1889 be $ 183,827,190.29 the policy of apply this surplus to the redemption of the interest bear security of the united states be think to be preferable to that of deposit it without interest in select national bank there have be redeem since the date last mention of interest bear security $ 259,079,350 result in a reduction of the annual interest charge of $ 11,684,675 the money which have be deposit in bank without interest have be gradually withdraw and use in the redemption of bond the result of this policy of the silver legislation and of the refunding of the 4 1/2 per cent bond have be a large increase of the money in circulation at the date last name the circulation be $ 1,404,205,896 or $ 23.03 per capita while on the 1st day of december 1891 it have increase to $ 1,577,262,070 or $ 24.38 per capita the offer of the secretary of the treasury to the holder of the 4 1/2 per cent bond to extend the time of redemption at the option of the government at an interest of 2 per cent be accept by the holder of about one half the amount and the unextended bond be be redeem on presentation the report of the secretary of war exhibit the result of an intelligent progressive and businesslike administration of a department which have be too much regard as one of mere routine the separation of secretary proctor from the department by reason of his appointment as a senator from the state of vermont be a source of great regret to i and to his colleague in the cabinet as i be sure it will be to all those who have have business with the department while under his charge in the administration of army affair some especially good work have be accomplish the effort of the secretary to reduce the percentage of desertion by remove the cause that promote it have be so successful as to enable he to report for the last year a low percentage of desertion than have be before reach in the history of the army the result money saving be considerable but the improvement in the morale of the enlisted man be the most valuable incident of the reform which have bring about this result the work of secure site for shore battery for harbor defense and the manufacture of mortar and gun of high power to equip they have make good progress during the year the preliminary work of test and plan which so long delay a start be now out of the way some gun have be complete and with an enlarged shop and a more complete equipment at watervliet the army will soon be abreast of the navy in gun construction whatever unavoidable cause of delay may arise there should be none from delayed or insufficient appropriation we shall be greatly embarrassed in the proper distribution and use of naval vessel until adequate shore defense be provide for our harbor i concur in the recommendation of the secretary that the three battalion organization be adopt for the infantry the adoption of a smokeless powder and of a modern rifle equal in range precision and rapidity of fire to the good now in use will i hope not be long delay the project of enlist indians and organize they into separate company upon the same basis as other soldier be make the subject of very careful study by the secretary and receive my approval seven company have be completely organize and seven more be in process of organization the result of six month training have more than realize the high anticipation the man be readily bring under discipline acquire the drill with facility and show great pride in the right discharge of their duty and perfect loyalty to their officer who declare that they would take they into action with confidence the discipline order and cleanliness of the military post will have a wholesome and elevate influence upon the man enlist and through they upon their tribe while a friendly feeling for the white and a great respect for the government will certainly be promote the great work do in the record and pension division of the war department by major ainsworth of the medical corps and the clerk under he be entitle to honorable mention take up the work with nearly 41,000 case behind he close the last fiscal year without a single case leave over though the new case have increase 52 per cent in number over the previous year by reason of the pension legislation of the last congress i concur in the recommendation of the attorney general that the right in felony case to a review by the supreme court be limit it would seem that personal liberty would have a safe guaranty if the right of review in case involve only fine and imprisonment be limit to the circuit court of appeal unless a constitutional question should in some way be involve the judge of the court of private land claims provide for by the act of march 3 1891 have be appoint and the court organize it be now possible to give early relief to community long repress in their development by unsettled land title and to establish the possession and right of settler whose land have be render valueless by adverse and unfounded claim the act of july 9 1888 provide for the incorporation and management of a reform school for girl in the district of columbia but it have remain inoperative for the reason that no appropriation have be make for construction or maintenance the need of such an institution be very urgent many girl could be save from depraved life by the wholesome influence and restraint of such a school i recommend that the necessary appropriation be make for a site and for construction the enforcement by the treasury department of the law prohibit the coming of chinese to the united states have be effective as to such as seek to land from vessel enter our port the result have be to divert the travel to vessel enter the port of british columbia whence passage into the united states at obscure point along the dominion boundary be easy a very considerable number of chinese laborer have during the past year enter the united states from canada and mexico the officer of the treasury department and of the department of justice have use every mean at their command to intercept this immigration but the impossibility of perfectly guard our extended frontier be apparent the dominion government collect a head tax of $ 50 from every chinaman enter canada and thus derive a considerable revenue from those who only use its port to reach a position of advantage to evade our exclusion law there seem to be satisfactory evidence that the business of pass chinamen through canada to the united states be organize and quite active the department of justice have construe the law to require the return of any chinaman find to be unlawfully in this country to china as the country from which he come notwithstanding the fact that he come by way of canada but several of the district court have in case bring before they overrule this view of the law and decide that such person must be return to canada this construction rob the law of all effectiveness even if the decree could be execute for the man return can the next day recross our border but the only appropriation make be for send they back to china and the canadian official refuse to allow they to reenter canada without the payment of the fifty dollar head tax i recommend such legislation as will remedy these defect in the law in previous message i have call the attention of congress to the necessity of so extend the jurisdiction of the united states court as to make triable therein any felony commit while in the act of violate a law of the united states these court can not have that independence and effectiveness which the constitution contemplate so long as the felonious killing of court officer juror and witness in the discharge of their duty or by reason of their act as such be only cognizable in the state court the work do by the attorney general and the officer of his department even under the present inadequate legislation have produce some notable result in the interest of law and order the attorney general and also the commissioners of the district of columbia call attention to the defectiveness and inadequacy of the law relate to crime against chastity in the district of columbia a stringent code upon this subject have be provide by congress for utah and it be a matter of surprise that the need of this district should have be so long overlook in the report of the postmaster general some very gratifying result be exhibit and many betterment of the service suggest a perusal of the report give abundant evidence that the supervision and direction of the postal system have be characterize by an intelligent and conscientious desire to improve the service the revenue of the department show an increase of over $ 5,000,000 with a deficiency for the year 1892 of less than $ 4,000,000 while the estimate for the year 1893 show a surplus of receipt over expenditure ocean mail post office have be establish upon the steamer of the north german lloyd and hamburg line save by the distribution on shipboard from two to fourteen hour time in the delivery of mail at the port of entry and often much more than this in the delivery at interior place so thoroughly have this system initiate by germany and the united states evidence its usefulness that it can not be long before it be instal upon all the great ocean mail carry steamship eight thousand mile of new postal service have be establish upon railroad the car distribution to substation in the great city have be increase about 12 per cent while the percentage of error in distribution have during the past year be reduce over one half an appropriation be give by the last congress for the purpose of make some experiment in free delivery in the small city and town the result of these experiment have be so satisfactory that the postmaster general recommend and i concur in the recommendation that the free delivery system be at once extend to town of 5,000 population his discussion of the inadequate facility extend under our present system to rural community and his suggestion with a view to give these community a full participation in the benefit of the postal service be worthy of your careful consideration it be not just that the farmer who receive his mail at a neighboring town should not only be compel to send to the post office for it but to pay a considerable rent for a box in which to place it or to wait his turn at a general delivery window while the city resident have his mail bring to his door it be state that over 54,000 neighborhood be under the present system receive mail at post office where money order and postal note be not issue the extension of this system to these community be especially desirable as the patron of such office be not possess of the other facility offer in more populous community for the transmission of small sum of money i have in a message to the precede congress express my view as to a modify use of the telegraph in connection with the postal service in pursuance of the ocean mail law of march 3 1891 and after a most careful study of the whole subject and frequent conference with ship owner board of trade and other advertisement be issue by the postmaster general for 53 line of ocean mail service--10 to great britain and the continent 27 to south america 3 to china and japan 4 to australia and the pacific island 7 to the west indies and 2 to mexico it be not of course expect that bid for all these line would be receive or that service upon they all would be contract for it be intend in furtherance of the act to secure as many new line as possible while include in the list most or all of the foreign line now occupy by american ship it be hope that a line to england and perhaps one to the continent would be secure but the outlay require to equip such line wholly with new ship of the first class and the difficulty of establish new line in competition with those already establish deter bidder whose interest have be enlist it be hope that a way may yet be find of overcome these difficulty the brazil steamship company by reason of a miscalculation as to the speed of its vessel be not able to bid under the term of the advertisement the policy of the department be to secure from the establish line an improved service as a condition of give to they the benefit of the law this in all instance have be attain the postmaster general estimate that an expenditure in american shipyard of about $ 10,000,000 will be necessary to enable the bidder to construct the ship call for by the service which they have accept i do not think there be any reason for discouragement or for any turning back from the policy of this legislation indeed a good beginning have be make and as the subject be far consider and understand by capitalist and ship people new line will be ready to meet future proposal and we may date from the passage of this law the revival of american shipping interest and the recovery of a fair share of the carry trade of the world we be receive for foreign postage nearly $ 2,000,000 under the old system and the outlay for ocean mail service do not exceed $ 600,000 per annum it be estimate by the postmaster general that if all the contract propose be complete it will require $ 247,354 for this year in addition to the appropriation for sea and inland postage already in the estimate and that for the next fiscal year end june 30 1893 there would probably be need about $ 560,000.the report of the secretary of the navy show a gratifying increase of new naval vessel in commission the newark concord bennington and miantonomoh have be add during the year with an aggregate of something more than 11,000 ton twenty four warship of all class be now under construction in the navy yard and private shop but while the work upon they be go forward satisfactorily the completion of the more important vessel will yet require about a year s time some of the vessel now under construction it be believe will be triumph of naval engineering when it be recollect that the work of build a modern navy be only initiate in the year 1883 that our naval constructor and shipbuilder be practically without experience in the construction of large iron or steel ship that our engine shop be unfamiliar with great marine engine and that the manufacture of steel forging for gun and plate be almost wholly a foreign industry the progress that have be make be not only highly satisfactory but furnish the assurance that the united states will before long attain in the construction of such vessel with their engine and armament the same preeminence which it attain when the good instrument of ocean commerce be the clipper ship and the most impressive exhibit of naval power the old wooden three decker man of war the officer of the navy and the proprietor and engineer of our great private shop have respond with wonderful intelligence and professional zeal to the confidence express by congress in its liberal legislation we have now at washington a gun shop organize and conduct by naval officer that in its system economy and product be unexcelle experiment with armor plate have be conduct during the year with most important result it be now believe that a plate of high resisting power than any in use have be find and that the test have demonstrate that cheap method of manufacture than those heretofore thought necessary can be use i commend to your favorable consideration the recommendation of the secretary who have i be sure give to they the most conscientious study there should be no hesitation in promptly complete a navy of the good modern type large enough to enable this country to display its flag in all sea for the protection of its citizen and of its extend commerce the world need no assurance of the peaceful purpose of the united states but we shall probably be in the future more largely a competitor in the commerce of the world and it be essential to the dignity of this nation and to that peaceful influence which it should exercise on this hemisphere that its navy should be adequate both upon the shore of the atlantic and of the pacific the report of the secretary of the interior show that a very gratifying progress have be make in all of the bureaus which make up that complex and difficult department the work in the bureau of indian affairs be perhaps never so large as now by reason of the numerous negotiation which have be proceed with the tribe for a reduction of the reservation with the incident labor of make allotment and be never more carefully conduct the provision of adequate school facility for indian child and the locating of adult indians upon farm involve the solution of the indian question everything else ration annuity and tribal negotiation with the agent inspector and commissioner who distribute and conduct they must pass away when the indian have become a citizen secure in the individual ownership of a farm from which he derive his subsistence by his own labor protect by and subordinate to the law which govern the white man and provide by the general government or by the local community in which he live with the mean of educate his child when an indian become a citizen in an organized state or territory his relation to the general government cease in great measure to be that of a ward but the general government ought not at once to put upon the state or territory the burden of the education of his child it have be my thought that the government school and school building upon the reservation would be absorb by the school system of the states and territories but as it have be find necessary to protect the indian against the compulsory alienation of his land by exempt he from taxation for a period of twenty five year it would seem to be right that the general government certainly where there be tribal fund in its possession should pay to the school fund of the state what would be equivalent to the local school tax upon the property of the indian it will be notice from the report of the commissioner of indian affairs that already some contract have be make with district school for the education of indian child there be great advantage i think in bring the indian child into mixed school this process will be gradual and in the meantime the present educational provision and arrangement the result of the good experience of those who have be charge with this work should be continue this will enable those religious body that have undertake the work of indian education with so much zeal and with result so restrain and beneficent to place their institution in new and useful relation to the indian and to his white neighbor the outbreak among the sioux which occur in december last be as to its cause and incident fully report upon by the war department and the department of the interior that these indians have some just complaint especially in the matter of the reduction of the appropriation for ration and in the delay attend the enactment of law to enable the department to perform the engagement enter into with they be probably true but the sioux tribe be naturally warlike and turbulent and their warrior be excite by their medicine man and chief who preach the coming of an indian messiah who be to give they power to destroy their enemy in view of the alarm that prevail among the white settler near the reservation and of the fatal consequence that would have result from an indian incursion i place at the disposal of general miles command the division of the missouri all such force as be think by he to be require he be entitle to the credit of having give thorough protection to the settler and of bring the hostile into subjection with the least possible loss of life the appropriation of $ 2,991,450 for the choctaws and chickasaws contain in the general indian appropriation bill of march 3 1891 have not be expend for the reason that i have not yet approve a release to the government of the indian claim to the land mention this matter will be make the subject of a special message place before congress all the fact which have come to my knowledge the relation of the five civilized tribes now occupy the indian territory to the united states be not i believe that well calculate to promote the high advancement of these indians that there should be within our border five independent state have no relation except those grow out of treaty with the government of the united states no representation in the national legislature its people not citizen be a startling anomaly it seem to i to be inevitable that there shall be before long some organic change in the relation of these people to the united states what form these change should take i do not think it desirable now to suggest even if they be well define in my own mind they should certainly involve the acceptance of citizenship by the indians and a representation in congress these indians should have opportunity to present their claim and grievance upon the floor rather than as now in the lobby if a commission could be appoint to visit these tribe to confer with they in a friendly spirit upon this whole subject even if no agreement be presently reach the feeling of the tribe upon this question would be develop and discussion would prepare the way for change which must come soon or later the good work of reduce the large indian reservation by allotment in severalty to the indians and the cession of the remain land to the united states for disposition under the homestead law have be prosecute during the year with energy and success in september last i be enable to open to settlement in the territory of oklahoma 900,000 acre of land all of which be take up by settler in a single day the rush for these land be accompany by a great deal of excitement but be happily free from incident of violence it be a source of great regret that i be not able to open at the same time the surplus land of the cheyenne and arapahoe reservation amount to about 3,000,000 acre by reason of the insufficiency of the appropriation for make the allotment deserving and impatient settler be wait to occupy these land and i urgently recommend that a special deficiency appropriation be promptly make of the small amount need so that the allotment may be complete and the surplus land open in time to permit the settler to get upon their homestead in the early spring during the past summer the cherokee commission have complete arrangement with the wichita kickapoo and tonkawa tribe whereby if the agreement be ratify by congress over 800,000 additional acre will be open to settlement in oklahoma the negotiation for the release by the cherokees of their claim to the cherokee strip have make no substantial progress so far as the department be officially advise but it be still hope that the cession of this large and valuable tract may be secure the price which the commission be authorize to offer--$1.25 per acre be in my judgment when all the circumstance as to title and the character of the land be consider a fair and adequate one and should have be accept by the indians since march 4 1889 about 23,000,000 acre have be separate from indian reservation and add to the public domain for the use of those who desire to secure free home under our beneficent law it be difficult to estimate the increase of wealth which will result from the conversion of these waste land into farm but it be more difficult to estimate the betterment which will result to the family that have find renew hope and courage in the ownership of a home and the assurance of a comfortable subsistence under free and healthful condition it be also gratify to be able to feel as we may that this work have proceed upon line of justice toward the indian and that he may now if he will secure to himself the good influence of a settle habitation the fruit of industry and the security of citizenship early in this administration a special effort be begin to bring up the work of the general land office by faithful work the arrearage have be rapidly reduce at the end of the last fiscal year only 84,172 final agricultural entry remain undisposed of and the commissioner report that with the present force the work can be fully bring up by the end of the next fiscal year your attention be call to the difficulty present by the secretary of the interior as to the administration of the law of march 3 1891 establish a court of private land claims the small holding intend to be protect by the law be estimate to be more than 15,000 in number the claimant be a most deserving class and their title be support by the strong equity the difficulty grow out of the fact that the land have largely be survey accord to our method while the holding many of which have be in the same family for generation be lay out in narrow strip a few rod wide upon a stream and run back to the hill for pasturage and timber provision should be make for number these tract as lot and for patent they by such number and without reference to section line the administration of the pension bureau have be characterize during the year by great diligence the total number of pensioner upon the roll on the 30th day of june 1891 be 676,160 there be allow during the fiscal year end at that time 250,565 case of this number 102,387 be allow under the law of june 27 1890 the issuing of certificate have be proceed at the rate of about 30,000 per month about 75 per cent of these be case under the new law the commissioner express the opinion that he will be able to carefully adjudicate and allow 350,000 claim during the present fiscal year the appropriation for the payment of pension for the fiscal year 1890 91 be $ 127,685,793.89 and the amount expend $ 118,530,649.25 leave an unexpended surplus of $ 9,155,144.64.the commissioner be quite confident that there will be no call this year for a deficiency appropriation notwithstanding the rapidity with which the work be be push the mistake which have be make by many in their exaggerated estimate of the cost of pension be in not take account of the diminish value of first payment under the recent legislation these payment under the general law have be for many year very large as the pension when allowed date from the time of file the claim and most of these claim have be pende for year the first payment under the law of june 1890 be relatively small and as the per cent of these case increase and that of the old case diminish the annual aggregate of first payment be largely reduce the commissioner under date of november 13 furnish i with the statement that during the last four month 113,175 certificate be issue 27,893 under the general law and 85,282 under the act of june 27 1890 the average first payment during these four month be $ 131.85 while the average first payment upon case allow during the year end june 30 1891 be $ 239.33 be a reduction in the average first payment during these four month of $ 107.48.the estimate for pension expenditure for the fiscal year end june 30 1893 be $ 144,956,000 which after a careful examination of the subject the commissioner be of the opinion will be sufficient while these disbursement to the disabled soldier of the great civil war be large they do not realize the exaggerated estimate of those who oppose this beneficent legislation the secretary of the interior show with great fullness the care that be take to exclude fraudulent claim and also the gratifying fact that the person to whom these pension be go be man who render not slight but substantial war service the report of the commissioner of railroads show that the total debt of the subsidize railroad to the united states be on december 31 1890 $ 112,512,613.06 a large part of this debt be now fast approach maturity with no adequate provision for its payment some policy for deal with this debt with a view to its ultimate collection should be at once adopt it be very difficult well nigh impossible for so large a body as the congress to conduct the necessary negotiation and investigation i therefore recommend that provision be make for the appointment of a commission to agree upon and report a plan for deal with this debt the work of the census bureau be now far in advance and the great bulk of the enormous labor involve complete it will be more strictly a statistical exhibit and less encumber by essay than its immediate predecessor the method pursue have be fair careful and intelligent and have secure the approval of the statistician who have follow they with a scientific and nonpartisan interest the appropriation necessary to the early completion and publication of the authorized volume should be give in time to secure against delay which increase the cost and at the same time diminish the value of the work the report of the secretary exhibit with interesting fullness the condition of the territories they have share with the states the great increase in farm product and be bring yearly large area into cultivation by extend their irrigating canal this work be be do by individual or local corporation and without that system which a full preliminary survey of the water supply and of the irrigable land would enable they to adopt the future of the territories of new mexico arizona and utah in their material growth and in the increase independence and happiness of their people be very largely dependent upon wise and timely legislation either by congress or their own legislature regulate the distribution of the water supply furnish by their stream if this matter be much long neglect private corporation will have unrestricted control of one of the element of life and the patentee of the arid land will be tenant at will of the water company the united states should part with its ownership of the water source and the site for reservoir whether to the states and territories or to individual or corporation only upon condition that will insure to the settler their proper water supply upon equal and reasonable term in the territories this whole subject be under the full control of congress and in the states it be practically so as long as the government hold the title to the reservoir site and water source and can grant they upon such condition as it choose to impose the improvident grant of franchise of enormous value without recompense to the state or municipality from which they proceed and without proper protection of the public interest be the most noticeable and flagrant evil of modern legislation this fault should not be commit in deal with a subject that will before many year affect so vitally thousand of our people the legislation of congress for the repression of polygamy have after year of resistance on the part of the mormons at last bring they to the conclusion that resistance be unprofitable and unavailing the power of congress over this subject should not be surrender until we have satisfactory evidence that the people of the state to be create would exercise the exclusive power of the state over this subject in the same way the question be not whether these people now obey the law of congress against polygamy but rather would they make enforce and maintain such law themselves if absolutely free to regulate the subject we can not afford to experiment with this subject for when a state be once constitute the act be final and any mistake irretrievable no compact in the enable act could in my opinion be bind or effective i recommend that provision be make for the organization of a simple form of town government in alaska with power to regulate such matter as be usually in the states under municipal control these local civil organization will give well protection in some matter than the present skeleton territorial organization proper restriction as to the power to levy taxis and to create debt should be impose if the establishment of the department of agriculture be regard by anyone as a mere concession to the unenlightened demand of a worthy class of people that impression have be most effectually remove by the great result already attain its home influence have be very great in disseminate agricultural and horticultural information in stimulate and direct a further diversification of crop in detect and eradicate disease of domestic animal and more than all in the close and informal contact which it have establish and maintain with the farmer and stock raiser of the whole country every request for information have have prompt attention and every suggestion merit consideration the scientific corps of the department be of a high order and be push its investigation with method and enthusiasm the inspection by this department of cattle and pork product intend for shipment abroad have be the basis of the success which have attend our effort to secure the removal of the restriction maintain by the european government for ten year protest and petition upon this subject from the packer and stock raiser of the united states have be direct against these restriction which so seriously limit our market and curtail the profit of the farm it be a source of general congratulation that success have at last be attain for the effect of an enlarged foreign market for these meat will be feel not only by the farmer but in our public finance and in every branch of trade it be particularly fortunate that the increase demand for food product result from the removal of the restriction upon our meat and from the reciprocal trade arrangement to which i have refer should have come at a time when the agricultural surplus be so large without the help thus derive low price would have prevail the secretary of agriculture estimate that the restriction upon the importation of our pork product into europe lose we a market for $ 20,000,000 worth of these product annually the grain crop of this year be the large in our history--50 per cent great than that of last year and yet the new market that have be open and the large demand result from short crop in europe have sustain price to such an extent that the enormous surplus of meat and breadstuff will be market at good price bring relief and prosperity to an industry that be much depressed the value of the grain crop of the united states be estimate by the secretary to be this year $ 500,000,000 more than last of meat $ 150,000,000 more and of all product of the farm $ 700,000,000 more it be not inappropriate i think here to suggest that our satisfaction in the contemplation of this marvelous addition to the national wealth be uncloude by any suspicion of the currency by which it be measure and in which the farmer be pay for the product of his field the report of the civil service commission should receive the careful attention of the opponent as well as the friend of this reform the commission invite a personal inspection by senator and representatives of its record and method and every fair critic will feel that such an examination should precede a judgment of condemnation either of the system or its administration it be not claim that either be perfect but i believe that the law be be execute with impartiality and that the system be incomparably well and fair than that of appointment upon favor i have during the year extend the classified service to include superintendent teacher matron and physician in the indian service this branch of the service be largely related to educational and philanthropic work and will obviously be the well for the change the head of the several executive departments have be direct to establish at once an efficiency record as the basis of a comparative rating of the clerk within the classified service with a view to place promotion therein upon the basis of merit i be confident that such a record fairly keep and open to the inspection of those interested will powerfully stimulate the work of the departments and will be accept by all as place the troublesome matter of promotion upon a just basis i recommend that the appropriation for the civil service commission be make adequate to the increase work of the next fiscal year i have twice before urgently call the attention of congress to the necessity of legislation for the protection of the life of railroad employee but nothing have yet be do during the year end june 30 1890 369 brakeman be kill and 7,841 maim while engage in couple car the total number of railroad employee kill during the year be 2,451 and the number injure 22,390 this be a cruel and largely needless sacrifice the government be spend nearly $ 1,000,000 annually to save the life of shipwreck seaman every steam vessel be rigidly inspect and require to adopt the most approve safety appliance all this be good but how shall we excuse the lack of interest and effort in behalf of this army of brave young man who in our land commerce be be sacrifice every year by the continue use of antiquated and dangerous appliance a law require of every railroad engage in interstate commerce the equipment each year of a give per cent of its freight car with automatic coupler and air brake would compel an agreement between the road as to the kind of brake and coupler to be use and would very soon and very greatly reduce the present fearful death rate among railroad employee the method of appointment by the states of elector of president and vice president have recently attract renew interest by reason of a departure by the state of michigan from the method which have become uniform in all the states prior to 1832 various method have be use by the different states and even by the same state in some the choice be make by the legislature in other elector be choose by district but more generally by the voter of the whole state upon a general ticket the movement toward the adoption of the last name method have an early beginning and go steadily forward among the states until in 1832 there remain but a single state south carolina that have not adopt it that state until the civil war continue to choose its elector by a vote of the legislature but after the war change its method and conform to the practice of the other states for nearly sixty year all the states save one have appoint their elector by a popular vote upon a general ticket and for nearly thirty year this method be universal after a full test of other method without important division or dissent in any state and without any purpose of party advantage as we must believe but solely upon the consideration that uniformity be desirable and that a general election in territorial division not subject to change be most consistent with the popular character of our institution well preserve the equality of the voter and perfectly remove the choice of president from the baneful influence of the gerrymander the practice of all the states be bring into harmony that this concurrence should now be break be i think an unfortunate and even a threatening episode and one that may well suggest whether the states that still give their approval to the old and prevailing method ought not to secure by a constitutional amendment a practice which have have the approval of all the recent michigan legislation provide for choose what be popularly know as the congressional elector for president by congressional district and the two senatorial elector by district create for that purpose this legislation be of course accompany by a new congressional apportionment and the two statute bring the electoral vote of the state under the influence of the gerrymander "these gerrymander for congressional purpose be in most case buttress by a gerrymander of the legislative district thus make it impossible for a majority of the legal voter of the state to correct the apportionment and equalize the congressional district a minority rule be establish that only a political convulsion can overthrow i have recently be advise that in one county of a certain state three district for the election of member of the legislature be constitute as follow one have 65,000 population one 15,000 and one 10,000 while in another county detach noncontiguous section have be unite to make a legislative district these method have already find effective application to the choice of senator and representatives in congress and now an evil start have be make in the direction of apply they to the choice by the states of elector of president and vice president if this be accomplish we shall then have the three great department of the government in the grasp of the gerrymander the legislative and executive directly and the judiciary indirectly through the power of appointment an election imply a body of elector have prescribe qualification each one of whom have an equal value and influence in determine the result so when the constitution provide that each state shall appoint elect in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of elector etc an unrestricted power be not give to the legislature in the selection of the method to be use a republican form of government be guarantee by the constitution to each state and the power give by the same instrument to the legislature of the states to prescribe method for the choice by the state of elector must be exercise under that limitation the essential feature of such a government be the right of the people to choose their own officer and the near practicable equality of value in the suffrage give in determine that choice it will not be claim that the power give to the legislature would support a law provide that the person receive the small vote should be the elector or a law that all the elector should be choose by the voter of a single congressional district the state be to choose and finder the pretense of regulating method the legislature can neither vest the right of choice elsewhere nor adopt method not conformable to republican institution it be not my purpose here to discuss the question whether a choice by the legislature or by the voter of equal single district be a choice by the state but only to recommend such regulation of this matter by constitutional amendment as will secure uniformity and prevent that disgraceful partisan jugglery to which such a liberty of choice if it exist offer a temptation nothing just now be more important than to provide every guaranty for the absolutely fair and free choice by an equal suffrage within the respective states of all the officer of the national government whether that suffrage be apply directly as in the choice of member of the house of representatives or indirectly as in the choice of senator and elector of president respect for public officer and obedience to law will not cease to be the characteristic of our people until our election cease to declare the will of majority fairly ascertain without fraud suppression or gerrymander if i be call upon to declare wherein our chief national danger lie i should say without hesitation in the overthrow of majority control by the suppression or perversion of the popular suffrage that there be a real danger here all must agree but the energy of those who see it have be chiefly expend in try to fix responsibility upon the opposite party rather than in effort to make such practice impossible by either party be it not possible now to adjourn that interminable and inconclusive debate while we take by consent one step in the direction of reform by eliminate the gerrymander which have be denounce by all party as an influence in the selection of elector of president and member of congress all the states have act freely and separately determine that the choice of elector by a general ticket be the wise and safe method and it would seem there could be no objection to a constitutional amendment make that method permanent if a legislature choose in one year upon purely local question should pende a presidential contest meet rescind the law for a choice upon a general ticket and provide for the choice of elector by the legislature and this trick should determine the result it be not too much to say that the public peace might be seriously and widely endanger i have allude to the gerrymander as affect the method of select elector of president by congressional district but the primary intent and effect of this form of political robbery have relation to the selection of member of the house of representatives the power of congress be ample to deal with this threatening and intolerable abuse the unfailing test of sincerity in election reform will be find in a willingness to confer as to remedy and to put into force such measure as will most effectually preserve the right of the people to free and equal representation an attempt be make in the last congress to bring to bear the constitutional power of the general government for the correction of fraud against the suffrage it be important to know whether the opposition to such measure be really rest in particular feature suppose to be objectionable or include any proposition to give to the election law of the united states adequacy to the correction of grave and acknowledge evil i must yet entertain the hope that it be possible to secure a calm patriotic consideration of such constitutional or statutory change as may be necessary to secure the choice of the officer of the government to the people by fair apportionment and free election i believe it would be possible to constitute a commission nonpartisan in its membership and compose of patriotic wise and impartial man to whom a consideration of the question of the evil connect with our election system and method might be commit with a good prospect of secure unanimity in some plan for remove or mitigate those evil the constitution would permit the selection of the commission to be vest in the supreme court if that method would give the good guaranty of impartiality this commission should be charge with the duty of inquire into the whole subject of the law of election as relate to the choice of officer of the national government with a view to secure to every elector a free and unmolested exercise of the suffrage and as near an approach to an equality of value in each ballot cast as be attainable while the policy of the general government upon the tariff upon the restoration of our merchant marine upon river and harbor improvement and other such matter of grave and general concern be liable to be turn this way or that by the result of congressional election and administrative policy sometimes involve issue that tend to peace or war to be turn this way or that by the result of a presidential election there be a rightful interest in all the states and in every congressional district that will not be deceive or silence by the audacious pretense that the question of the right of any body of legal voter in any state or in any congressional district to give their suffrage freely upon these general question be a matter only of local concern or control the demand that the limitation of suffrage shall be find in the law and only there be a just demand and no just man should resent or resist it my appeal be and must continue to be for a consultation that shall proceed with candor calmness and patience upon the line of justice and humanity not of prejudice and cruelty "to the consideration of these very grave question i invite not only the attention of congress but that of all patriotic citizen we must not entertain the delusion that our people have cease to regard a free ballot and equal representation as the price of their allegiance to law and to civil magistrate i have be greatly rejoice to notice many evidence of the increase unification of our people and of a revive national spirit the vista that now open to we be wide and more glorious than ever before gratification and amazement struggle for supremacy as we contemplate the population wealth and moral strength of our country a trust momentous in its influence upon our people and upon the world be for a brief time commit to we and we must not be faithless to its first condition the defense of the free and equal influence of the people in the choice of public officer and in the control of public affair
to the senate and house of representatives
 in my annual message deliver to congress at the beginning of the present session after a brief statement of the fact then in the possession of this government touch the assault in the street of valparaiso chile upon the sailor of the united states steamship baltimore on the evening of the 16th of october last i say
 this government be now await the result of an investigation which have be conduct by the criminal court at valparaiso it be report unofficially that the investigation be about complete and it be expect that the result will soon be communicate to this government together with some adequate and satisfactory response to the note by which the attention of chile be call to this incident if these just expectation should be disappoint or further needless delay intervene i will by a special message bring this matter again to the attention of congress for such action as may be necessary
 in my opinion the time have now come when i should lay before the congress and the country the correspondence between this government and the government of chile from the time of the breaking out of the revolution against balmaceda together with all other fact in the possession of the executive department relate to this matter the diplomatic correspondence be herewith transmit together with some correspondence between the naval officer for the time in command in chilean water and the secretary of the navy and also the evidence take at the mare island navy yard since the arrival of the baltimore at san francisco i do not deem it necessary in this communication to attempt any full analysis of the correspondence or of the evidence a brief restatement of the international question involve and of the reason why the response of the chilean government be unsatisfactory be all that i deem necessary
 it may be well at the outset to say that whatever may have be say in this country or in chile in criticism of mr. egan our minister at santiago the true history of this exciting period in chilean affair from the outbreak of the revolution until this time disclose no act on the part of mr. egan unworthy of his position or that could justly be the occasion of serious animadversion or criticism he have i think on the whole bear himself in very try circumstance with dignity discretion and courage and have conduct the correspondence with ability courtesy and fairness
 it be worth while also at the beginning to say that the right of mr. egan to give shelter in the legation to certain adherent of the balmaceda government who apply to he for asylum have not be deny by the chilean authority nor have any demand be make for the surrender of these refugee that there be urgent need of asylum be show by mr. egan&#39;s note of august 24 1891 describe the disorder that prevail in santiago and by the evidence of captain schley as to the pillage and violence that prevail at valparaiso the correspondence disclose however that the request of mr. egan for a safe conduct from the country in behalf of these refugee be deny the precedent cite by he in the correspondence particularly the case of the revolution in peru in 1865 do not leave the chilean government in a position to deny the right of asylum to political refugee and seem very clearly to support mr. egan&#39;s contention that a safe conduct to neutral territory be a necessary and acknowledge incident of the asylum these refugee have very recently without formal safe conduct but by the acquiescence of the chilean authority be place on board the yorktown and be now be convey to callao peru this incident might be consider wholly closed but for the disrespect manifest toward this government by the close and offensive police surveillance of the legation premise which be maintain during most of the period of the stay of the refugee therein after the date of my annual message and up to the time of the transfer of the refugee to the yorktown the legation premise seem to have be surround by police in uniform and police agent or detective in citizen&#39;s dress who offensively scrutinize person enter or leave the legation and on one or more occasion arrest member of the minister&#39;s family commander evans who by my direction recently visit mr. egan at santiago in his telegram to the navy department describe the legation as a veritable prison and state that the police agent or detective be after his arrival withdraw during his stay it appear far from the note of mr. egan of november 20 1891 that on one occasion at least these police agent whom he declare to be know to he invade the legation premise pound upon its window and use insulting and threaten language toward person therein this breach of the right of a minister to freedom from police espionage and restraint seem to have be so flagrant that the argentine minister who be dean of the diplomatic corps having observe it felt call upon to protest against it to the chilean minister of foreign affair the chilean authority have as will be observe from the correspondence charge the refugee and the inmate of the legation with insult the police but it seem to i incredible that man whose life be in jeopardy and whose safety could only be secure by retirement and quietness should have seek to provoke a collision which could only end in their destruction or to aggravate their condition by intensify a popular feeling that at one time so threaten the legation as to require mr. egan to appeal to the minister of foreign affair
 but the most serious incident disclose by the correspondence be that of the attack upon the sailor of the baltimore in the street of valparaiso on the 16th of october last in my annual message speak upon the information then in my possession i say
 so far as i have yet be able to learn no other explanation of this bloody work have be suggest than that it have its origin in hostility to those man as sailor of the united states wear the uniform of their government and not in any individual act or personal animosity
 we have now receive from the chilean government an abstract of the conclusion of the fiscal general upon the testimony take by the judge of crime in an investigation which be make to extend over nearly three month i very much regret to be compel to say that this report do not enable i to modify the conclusion announce in my annual message i be still of the opinion that our sailor be assault beat stab and kill not for anything they or any one of they have do but for what the government of the united states have do or be charge with having do by its civil officer and naval commander if that be the true aspect of the case the injury be to the government of the united states not to these poor sailor who be assault in a manner so brutal and so cowardly
 before attempt to give an outline of the fact upon which this conclusion rest i think it right to say a word or two upon the legal aspect of the case the baltimore be in the harbor of valparaiso by virtue of that general invitation which nation be hold to extend to the war vessel of other power with which they have friendly relation this invitation i think must be hold ordinarily to embrace the privilege of such communication with the shore as be reasonable necessary and proper for the comfort and convenience of the officer and man of such vessel captain schley testify that when his vessel return to valparaiso on september 14 the city officer as be customary extend the hospitality of the city to his officer and crew it be not claim that every personal collision or injury in which a sailor or officer of such naval vessel visit the shore may be involve raise an international question but i be clearly of the opinion that where such sailor or officer be assault by a resident populace animate by hostility to the government whose uniform these sailor and officer wear and in resentment of act do by their government not by they their nation must take notice of the event as one involve an infraction of its right and dignity not in a secondary way as where a citizen be injure and present his claim through his own government but in a primary way precisely as if its minister or consul or the flag itself have be the object of the same character of assault
 the officer and sailor of the baltimore be in the harbor of valparaiso under the order of their government not by their own choice they be upon the shore by the imply invitation of the government of chile and with the approval of their commanding officer and it do not distinguish their case from that of a consul that his stay be more permanent or that he hold the express invitation of the local government to justify his long residence nor do it affect the question that the injury be the act of a mob if there have be no participation by the police or military in this cruel work and no neglect on their part to extend protection the case would still be one in my opinion when its extent and character be consider involve international right the incident of the affair be briefly as follow
 on the 16th of october last captain schley command the united states steamship baltimore give shore leave to 117 petty officer and sailor of his ship these man leave the ship about 1.30 p.m. no incident of violence occur none of our man be arrest no complaint be lodge against they nor do any collision or outbreak occur until about 6 o&#39;clock p.m. captain schley state that he be himself on shore and about the street of the city until 5.30 p.m. that he meet very many of his man who be upon leave that they be sober and be conduct themselves with propriety salute chilean and other officer as they meet they other officer of the ship and captain jenkins of the merchant ship keweenaw corroborate captain schley as to the general sobriety and good behavior of our man the sisters of charity at the hospital to which our wounded man be take when inquire of state that they be sober when receive if the situation have be otherwise we must believe that the chilean police authority would have make arrest about 6 p.m. the assault begin and it be remarkable that the investigation by the judge of crime though so protract do not enable he to give any more satisfactory account of its origin than be find in the statement that it begin between drunken sailor repeatedly in the correspondence it be assert that it be impossible to learn the precise cause of the riot the minister of foreign affair matta in his telegram to mr. montt under date december 31 state that the quarrel begin between two sailor in a tavern and be continue in the street person who be pass join in it
 the testimony of talbot an apprentice who be with riggin be that the outbreak in which they be involve begin by a chilean sailor&#39;s spit in the face of talbot which be resent by a knockdown it appear that riggin and talbot be at the time unaccompanie by other of their shipmate these two man be immediately beset by a crowd of chilean citizen and sailor through which they break their way to a street car and enter it for safety they be pursue drive from the car and riggin be so seriously beat that he fall in the street apparently dead there be nothing in the report of the chilean investigation make to we that seriously impeach this testimony it appear from chilean source that almost instantly with a suddenness that strongly imply meditation and preparation a mob state by the police authority at one time to number 2,000 and at another 1,000 be engage in the assault upon our sailor who be represent as resist with stone club and bright arm the report of the intendente of october 30 state that the fight begin at 6 p.m. in three street which be name that information be receive at the intendencia at 6.15 and that the police arrive on the scene at 6.30 a full half hour after the assault begin at that time he say that a mob of 2,000 man have collect and that for several square there be the appearance of a real battlefield
 the scene at this point be very graphically set before we by the chilean testimony the american sailor who after so long an examination have not be find guilty of any breach of the peace so far as the chilean authority be able to discover unarmed and defenseless be flee for their life pursue by overwhelming number and fight only to aid their own escape from death or to succor some mate whose life be in great peril eighteen of they be brutally stab and beat while one chilean seem from the report to have suffer some injury but how serious or with what character of weapon or whether by a missile throw by our man or by some of his fellow rioter be unascertaine
 the pretense that our man be fight with stone club and bright arm be in view of these fact incredible it be far refute by the fact that our prisoner when search be absolutely without arm only seven penknife be find in the possession of the man arrest while there be receive by our man more than thirty stab wound every one of which be inflict in the back and almost every confused wound be in the back or back of the head the evidence of the ship&#39;s officer of the day be that even the jackknife of the man be take from they before leave the ship
 as to the brutal nature of the treatment receive by our man the following extract from the account give of the affair by the la patria newspaper of valparaiso of october 17 can not be regard as too friendly
 the yankees as soon as their pursuer give chase go by way of the calle del arsenal toward the city car station in the presence of an ordinary number of citizen among whom be some sailor the north americans take seat in the street car to escape from the stone which the chileans throw at they it be believe for an instant that the north americans have save themselves from popular fury but such be not the case scarcely have the car begin to move when a crowd gather around and stop its progress under these circumstance and without any cessation of the howling and throwing of stone at the north americans the conductor enter the car and see the risk of the situation to the vehicle order they to get out at the instant the sailor leave the car in the midst of a hail of stone the say conductor receive a stone blow on the head one of the yankee sailor manage to escape in the direction of the plaza wheelright but the other be fell to the ground by a stone manage to raise himself from the ground where he lay he stagger in an opposite direction from the station in front of the house of senor mazzini he be again wound fall then senseless and breathless
 no amount of evasion or subterfuge be able to cloud our clear vision of this brutal work it should be notice in this connection that the american sailor arrest after an examination be during the four day follow the arrest every one discharge no charge of any breach of the peace or other criminal conduct having be sustain against a single one of they the judge of crime foster in a note to the intendente under date of october 22 before the dispatch from this government of the following day which arouse the authority of chile to a well sense of the gravity of the affair say
 having preside temporarily over this court in regard to the seaman of the united states cruiser baltimore who have be try on account of the deplorable conduct which take place etc
 the noticeable point here be that our sailor have be try before the 22d of october and that the trial result in their acquittal and return to their vessel it be quite remarkable and quite characteristic of the management of this affair by the chilean police authority that we should now be advise that seaman davidson of the baltimore have be include in the indictment his offense be so far as i have be able to ascertain that he attempt to defend a shipmate against an assailant who be strike at he with a knife the perfect vindication of our man be furnish by this report one only be find to have be guilty of criminal fault and that for an act clearly justifiable
 as to the part take by the police in the affair the case make by chile be also far from satisfactory the point where riggin be kill be only three minutes&#39 walk from the police station and not more than twice that distance from the intendencia and yet accord to their official report a full half hour elapse after the assault begin before the police be upon the ground it have be state that all but two of our man have say that the police do their duty the evidence take at mare island show that if such a statement be procure from our man it be accomplish by require they to sign a writing in a language they do not understand and by the representation that it be a mere declaration that they have take no part in the disturbance lieutenant mccrea who act as interpreter say in his evidence that when our sailor be examine before the court the subject of the conduct of the police be so carefully avoid that he report the fact to captain schley on his return to the vessel
 the evidence of the existence of animosity toward our sailor in the mind of the sailor of the chilean navy and of the populace of valparaiso be so abundant and various as to leave no doubt in the mind of anyone who will examine the paper submit it manifest itself in threaten and insult gesture toward our man as they pass the chilean man of war in their boat and in the derisive and abusive epithet with which they greet every appearance of an american sailor on the evening of the riot captain schley report that boat from the chilean war ship several time go out of their course to cross the bow of his boat compel they to back water he complain of the discourtesy and it be correct that this feeling be share by man of high rank be show by an incident relate by surgeon stitt of the baltimore after the battle of placilla he with other medical officer of the war vessel in the harbor be give voluntary assistance to the wound in the hospital the son of a chilean army officer of high rank be under his care and when the father discover it he fly into a passion and say he would rather have his son die than have americans touch he and at once have he remove from the ward this feeling be not well conceal in the dispatch of the foreign office and have quite open expression in the disrespectful treatment of the american legation the chilean boatman in the bay refuse even for large offer of money to return our sailor who crowd the mole to their ship when they be endeavor to escape from the city on the night of the assault the market boat of the baltimore be threaten and even quite recently the gig of commander evans of the yorktown be stone while wait for he at the mole
 the evidence of our sailor clearly show that the attack be expect by the chilean people that threat have be make against our man and that in one case somewhat early in the afternoon the keeper of one house into which some of our man have go close his establishment in anticipation of the attack which he advise they would be make upon they as darkness come on
 in a report of captain schley to the navy department he say
 in the only interview that i have with judge foster who be investigate the case relative to the disturbance before he be aware of the entire gravity of the matter he inform i that the assault upon my man be the outcome of hatred for our people among the low class because they think we have sympathize with the balmaceda government on account of the itata matter whether with reason or without he could of course not admit but such he think be the explanation of the assault at that time
 several of our man seek security from the mob by such complete or partial change in their dress as would conceal the fact of their be seaman of the baltimore and find it then possible to walk the street without molestation these incident conclusively establish that the attack be upon the uniform the nationality and not upon the man
 the origin of this feeling be probably find in the refusal of this government to give recognition to the congressional party before it have establish itself in the seizure of the itala for an alleged violation of the neutrality law in the cable incident and in the charge that admiral brown convey information to valparaiso of the landing at quinteros it be not my purpose to enter here any defense of the action of this government in these matter it be enough for the present purpose to say that if there be any breach of international comity or duty on our part it should have be make the subject of official complaint through diplomatic channel or for reprisal for which a full responsibility be assume we can not consent that these incident and these perversion of the truth shall be use to excite a murderous attack upon our unoffending sailor and the government of chile go acquit of responsibility in fact the conduct of this government during the war in chile pursue those line of international duty which we have so strongly insist upon on the part of other nation when this country be in the throe of a civil conflict we continue the establish diplomatic relation with the government in power until it be overthrow and promptly and cordially recognize the new government when it be establish the good office of this government be offer to bring about a peaceful adjustment and the interposition of mr. egan to mitigate severity and to shelter adherent of the congressional party be effective and frequent the charge against admiral brown be too base to gain credence with anyone who know his high personal and professional character
 recur to the evidence of our sailor i think it be show that there be several distinct assault and so nearly simultaneous as to show that they do not spread from one point a press summary of the report of the fiscal show that the evidence of the chilean official and other be in conflict as to the place of origin several place be name by different witness as the locality where the first outbreak occur this if correctly report show that there be several distinct outbreak and so nearly at the same time as to cause this confusion the la patria in the same issue from which i have already quote after describe the killing of riggin and the fight which from that point extend to the mole say
 at the same time in other street of the port the yankee sailor fight fiercely with the people of the town who believe to see in they incarnate enemy of the chilean navy
 the testimony of captain jenkins of the american merchant ship keweenaw which have go to valparaiso for repair and who be a witness of some part of the assault upon the crew of the baltimore be strongly corroborative of the testimony of our own sailor when he say that he see chilean sentry drive back a seaman seek shelter upon a mob that be pursue he the officer and man of captain jenkins&#39;s ship furnish the most conclusive testimony as to the indignity which be practice toward americans in valparaiso when american sailor even of merchant ship can only secure their safety by deny their nationality it must be time to readjust our relation with a government that permit such demonstration
 as to the participation of the police the evidence of our sailor show that our man be strike and beat by police officer before and after arrest and that one at least be drag with a lasso about his neck by a mount policeman that the death of riggin be the result of a rifle shot fire by a policeman or soldier on duty be show directly by the testimony of johnson in whose arm he be at the time and by the evidence of charles langen an american sailor not then a member of the baltimore&#39;s crew who stand close by and see the transaction the chilean authority do not pretend to fix the responsibility of this shot upon any particular person but avow their inability to ascertain who fire it far than that it be fire from a crowd the character of the wound as describe by one of the surgeon of the baltimore clearly support his opinion that it be make by a rifle ball the orifice of exit be as much as an inch or an inch and a quarter in width when shoot the poor fellow be unconscious and in the arm of a comrade who be endeavor to carry he to a neighboring drug store for treatment the story of the police that in come up the street they pass these man and leave they behind they be inconsistent with their own statement as to the direction of their approach and with their duty to protect they and be clearly disprove in fact riggin be not behind but in front of the advance force and be not stand in the crowd but be unconscious and support in the arm of johnson when he be shoot
 the communication of the chilean government in relation to this cruel and disastrous attack upon our man as will appear from the correspondence have not in any degree take the form of a manly and satisfactory expression of regret much less of apology the event be of so serious a character that if the injury suffer by our man have be wholly the result of an accident in a chilean port the incident be grave enough to have call for some public expression of sympathy and regret from the local authority it be not enough to say that the affair be lamentable for humanity would require that expression even if the beating and killing of our man have be justifiable it be not enough to say that the incident be regret couple with the statement that the affair be not of an unusual character in port where foreign sailor be accustom to meet it be not for a generous and sincere government to seek for word of small or equivocal meaning in which to convey to a friendly power an apology for an offense so atrocious as this in the case of the assault by a mob in new orleans upon the spanish consulate in 1851 mr. webster write to the spanish minister mr. calderon that the act complain of be a disgraceful and flagrant breach of duty and propriety and that his government regret they as deeply as minister calderon or his government could possibly do that these act have cause the president great pain and he think a proper acknowledgment be due to her majesty&#39;s government he invite the spanish consul to return to his post guarantee protection and offer to salute the spanish flag if the consul should come in a spanish vessel such a treatment by the government of chile of this assault would have be more creditable to the chilean authority and much less can hardly be satisfactory to a government that value its dignity and honor
 in our note of october 23 last which appear in the correspondence after receive the report of the board of officer appoint by captain schley to investigate the affair the chilean government be advise of the aspect which it then assume and call upon for any fact in its possession that might tend to modify the unfavorable impression which our report have create it be very clear from the correspondence that before the receipt of this note the examination be regard by the police authority as practically closed it be however reopen and protract through a period of nearly three month we might justly have complain of this unreasonable delay but in view of the fact that the government of chile be still provisional and with a disposition to be forbear and hopeful of a friendly termination i have await the report which have but recently be make
 on the 21st instant i cause to be communicate to the government of chile by the american minister at santiago the conclusion of this government after a full consideration of all the evidence and of every suggestion affect this matter and to these conclusion i adhere they be state as follow
 first that the assault be not relieve of the aspect which the early information of the event give to it viz that of an attack upon the uniform of the united states navy have its origin and motive in a feeling of hostility to this government and not in any act of the sailor or of any of they
 second that the public authority of valparaiso flagrantly fail in their duty to protect our man and that some of the police and of the chilean soldier and sailor be themselves guilty of unprovoked assault upon our sailor before and after arrest he the president think the preponderance of the evidence and the inherent probability lead to the conclusion that riggin be kill by the police or soldier
 third that he the president be therefore compel to bring the case back to the position take by this government in the note of mr. wharton of october 23 last and to ask for a suitable apology and for some adequate reparation for the injury do to this government
 in the same note the attention of the chilean government be call to the offensive character of a note address by mr. matta its minister of foreign affair to mr. montt its minister at this capital on the 11th ultimo this dispatch be not officially communicate to this government but as mr. montt be direct to translate it and to give it to the press of the country it seem to i that it could not pass without official notice it be not only undiplomatic but grossly insult to our naval officer and to the executive department as it directly impute untruth and insincerity to the report of the naval officer and to the official communication make by the executive department to congress it will be observe that i have notify the chilean government that unless this note be at once withdraw and an apology as public as the offense make i will terminate diplomatic relation
 the request for the recall of mr. egan upon the ground that he be not persona grata be unaccompanie by any suggestion that could properly be use in support of it and i infer that the request be base upon official act of mr. egan which have receive the approval of this government but however that may be i could not consent to consider such a question until it have first be settle whether our correspondence with chile could be conduct upon a basis of mutual respect
 in submit these paper to congress for that grave and patriotic consideration which the question involve demand i desire to say that i be of the opinion that the demand make of chile by this government should be adhere to and enforce if the dignity as well as the prestige and influence of the united states be not to be wholly sacrifice we must protect those who in foreign port display the flag or wear the color of this government against insult brutality and death inflict in resentment of the act of their government and not for any fault of their own it have be my desire in every way to cultivate friendly and intimate relation with all the government of this hemisphere we do not covet their territory we desire their peace and prosperity we look for no advantage in our relation with they except the increase exchange of commerce upon a basis of mutual benefit we regret every civil contest that disturb their peace and paralyze their development and be always ready to give our good office for the restoration of peace it must however be understand that this government while exercise the utmost forbearance toward weak power will extend its strong and adequate protection to its citizen to its officer and to its humblest sailor when make the victim of wantonness and cruelty in resentment not of their personal misconduct but of the official act of their government
 upon information receive that patrick shields an irishman and probably a british subject but at the time a fireman of the american steamer keweenaw in the harbor of valparaiso for repair have be subject to personal injury in that city largely by the police i direct the attorney general to cause the evidence of the officer and crew of that vessel to be take upon its arrival in san francisco and that testimony be also herewith transmit the brutality and even savagery of the treatment of this poor man by the chilean police would be incredible if the evidence of shields be not support by other direct testimony and by the distressing condition of the man himself when he be finally able to reach his vessel the captain of the vessel say
 he come back a wreck black from his neck to his hip from beat weak and stupid and be still in a kind of paralyzed condition and have never be able to do duty since
 a claim for reparation have be make in behalf of this man for while he be not a citizen of the united states the doctrine long hold by we as express in the consular regulation be
 the principle which be maintain by this government in regard to the protection as distinguish from the relief of seaman be well settle it be hold that the circumstance that the vessel be american be evidence that the seaman on board be such and in every regularly document merchant vessel the crew will find their protection in the flag that cover they
 i have as yet receive no reply to our note of the 21st instant but in my opinion i ought not to delay long to bring these matter to the attention of congress for such action as may be deem appropriate

to the senate and house of representatives
 i transmit herewith additional correspondence between this government and the government of chile consist of a note of mr. montt the chilean minister at this capital to mr. blaine date january 23 a reply of mr. blaine thereto of date january 27 and a dispatch from mr. egan our minister at santiago transmit the response of mr. peteira the chilean minister of foreign affair to the note of mr. blaine of january 21 which be receive by i on the 26th instant the note of mr. montt to mr. blaine though date january 23 be not deliver at the state department until after 12 o&#39;clock m. of the 25th and be not translate and its receipt notify to i until late in the afternoon of that day
 the response of mr. pereira to our note of the 21st withdraw with acceptable expression of regret the offensive note of mr. matta of the 11th ultimo and also the request for the recall of mr. egan the treatment of the incident of the assault upon the sailor of the baltimore be so conciliatory and friendly that i be of the opinion that there be a good prospect that the difference grow out of that serious affair can now be adjust upon term satisfactory to this government by the usual method and without special power from congress this turn in the affair be very gratifying to i as i be sure it will be to the congress and to our people the general support of the effort of the executive to enforce the just right of the nation in this matter have give an instructive and useful illustration of the unity and patriotism of our people
 should it be necessary i will again communicate with congress upon the subject

hon william mckinley jr. and other
 committee etc
 gentlemen
 i now avail myself of the first period of relief from public duty to respond to the notification which you bring to i on june 20 of my nomination for the office of president of the united states by the republican national convention recently hold at minneapolis i accept the nomination and be grateful for the approval express by the convention of the act of the administration
 i have endeavor without waver or weariness so far as the direction of public affair be commit to i to carry out the pledge make to the people in 1888 if the policy of the administration have not be distinctively and progressively american and republican policy the fault have not be in the purpose but in the execution i shall speak frankly of the legislation of congress and of the work of the executive department for the credit of any success that have be attain be in such measure due to other mdash senators and representatives and to the efficient head of the several executive department mdash that i may do so without impropriety
 a vote of want of confidence be ask by our adversary and this challenge to a review of what have be do we promptly and gladly accept
 the great work of the fifty first congress have be subject to the revision of a democratic house of representatives and the act of the executive department to its scrutiny and investigation a democratic national administration be succeed by a republican administration and the freshness of the event give unusual facility for fair comparison and judgment there have seldom be a time i think when a change from the declare policy of the republican party to the declare policy of the democratic party involve such serious result to the business interest of the country a brief review of what have be do and of what the democratic party propose to undo will justify this opinion
 the republican party during the civil war devise a national currency consist of united states note issue and redeemable by the government and of national bank note base upon the security of united states bond a tax be levy upon the issue of state bank and the intend result that all such issue should be withdraw be realize there be man among we now who never see a state bank note
 the note furnish directly or indirectly by the united states have be the only and the safe and acceptable paper currency of the people bank failure have bring no fright delay or loss to the bill holder the note of an insolvent bank be as good and as current as a treasury note for the credit of the united states be behind it our money be all national money mdash i might almost say international for these bill be not only equally and indiscriminately accept at par in all the states but in some foreign country
 the democratic party if intrust with the control of the government be now pledge to repeal the tax on state bank issue with a view to put into circulation again under such diverse legislation as the states may adopt a flood of local bank issue only those who in the year before the war experience the inconvenience and loss attendant upon the use of such money can appreciate what a return to that system involve
 the denomination of a bill be then often no indication of its value the bank detector of yesterday be not a safe guide to day as to credit or value merchant deposit several time during the day lest the hour of bank closing should show a depreciation of the money take in the morning the traveler could not use in a journey to the east the issue of the most solvent bank of the west and in consequence a money changer&#39;s office be the familiar neighbor of the ticket office and the lunch counter the farmer and the laborer find the money receive for their product or their labor depreciate when they come to make their purchase and the whole business of the country be hinder and burden
 change may become necessary but a national system of currency safe and acceptable throughout the whole country be the good fruit of bitter experience and i be sure our people will not consent to the reactionary proposal make by the democratic party
 few subject have elicit more discussion or excite more general interest than that of a recovery by the united states of its appropriate share of the ocean carry trade this subject touch not only our pocket but our national pride practically all the freight for transport to europe the enormous annual supply of provision furnish by this country and for the large return of manufacture product have for many year be pay to foreign owner
 thousand of immigrant annually seek home under our flag have be deny the sight of it until they enter sandy hook while increase thousand of american citizen bent on european travel have each year step into a foreign jurisdiction at the new york dock the merchandise balance of trade which the treasury book show be largely reduce by the annual tribute which we pay for freight and passage money
 the great ship mdash the fast upon the sea mdash which be now in peace profit by our trade be in a secondary sense warship of their respective government and in time of war would under exist contract with those government speedily take on the gun for which their deck be already prepared and enter with terrible efficiency upon the work of destroy our commerce the undisputed fact be that the great steamship line of europe be build up and be now in part sustain by direct or indirect government aid the latter take the form of liberal pay for carry the mail or of an annual bonus give in consideration of agreement to construct the ship so as to adapt they for carry an armament and to turn they over to the government on demand upon specific term
 it be plain to every intelligent american that if the united states would have such line a similar policy must be enter upon the fifty first congress enact such a law and under its beneficent influence sixteen american steamship of an aggregate tonnage of 57,400 ton and cost $ 7,400,000 have be build or contract to be build in american shipyard
 in addition to this it be now practically certain that we shall soon have under the american flag one of the fine steamship line sail out of new york for any european port this contract will result in the construction in american yard of four new passenger steamship of 10,000 ton each cost about $ 8,000,000 and will add to our naval reserve six steamship the fast upon the sea
 a special interest have be take by i in the establishment of line from our south atlantic and gulf port and though my expectation have not yet be realize attention have be call to the advantage possess by these port and when their people be more fully alive to their interest i do not doubt that they will be able to secure the capital need to enable they to profit by their great natural advantage
 the democratic party have find no place in its platform for any reference to this subject and have show its hostility to the general policy by refuse to expend an appropriation make during the last administration for ocean mail contract with american line
 the patriotic people the workman in our shop the capitalist seek new enterprise must decide whether the great ship own by americans which have seek american registry shall again humbly ask a place in the english naval reserve the great ship now on the designers&#39 table go to foreign shop for construction and the united states lose the now brighten opportunity of recover a place commensurate with its wealth the skill of its constructor and the courage of its sailor in the carry trade of all the sea
 another related measure as furnish an increase ocean traffic for our ship and of great and permanent benefit to the farmer and manufacturer as well be the reciprocity policy declare by section 3 of the tariff act of 1890 and now in practical operation with five of the nation of central and south america san domingo the spanish and british west india islands and with germany and austria under special trade arrangement with each
 the removal of the duty upon sugar and the continuance of coffee and tea upon the free list while give great relief to our people by cheapen article use increasingly in every household be also of such enormous advantage to the country export these article as to suggest that in consideration thereof reciprocal favor should be show in their tariff to article export by we to their market
 great credit be due to mr. elaine for the vigor with which he press this view upon the country we have only begin to realize the benefit of these trade arrangement the work of create new agency and of adapt our good to new market have necessarily take time but the result already attain be such i be sure as to establish in popular favor the policy of reciprocal trade base upon the free importation of such article as do not injuriously compete with the product of our own farm mine or factory in exchange for the free or favor introduction of our product into other country
 the obvious efficacy of this policy in increase the foreign trade of the united states at once attract the alarmed attention of european trade journal and board of trade the british board of trade have present to that government a memorial asking for the appointment of a commission to consider the good mean of counteract what be call the commercial crusade of the united states
 at a meeting hold in march last of the associated chambers of commerce of great britain the president report that the export from great britain to the latin american country during the last year have decrease $ 23,750,000 and that this be not due to temporary cause but directly to the reciprocity policy of the united states
 germany and france have also show their startled appreciation of the fact that a new and vigorous contestant have appear in the battle of the market and have already secure important advantage
 the most convincing evidence of the tremendous commercial strength of our position be find in the fact that great britain and spain have find it necessary to make reciprocal trade agreement with ns for their west india colony and that germany and austria have give we important concession in exchange for the continue free importation of their beet sugar
 a few detail only as to the increase of our trade can be give here take all the country with which such arrangement have be make our trade to june 30 1892 have increase 23.78 per cent with brazil the increase be nearly 11 per cent with cuba during the first ten month our export increase $ 5,702,193 or 54.86 per cent and with porto rico $ 590,959 or 34 per cent the liberal participation of our farmer in the benefit of this policy be show by the following report from our consul general at havana under date of july 26 last
 during the first half year of 1891 havana receive 140,056 bag of flour from spain and other port of the island about an equal amount or approximately 280,112 bag
 during the same period havana receive 13,9/6 bag of american flour and other port approximately an equal amount make about 28,000 bag
 but for the first half of this year spain have send less than 1,000 bag to the whole island and the united states have send to havana alone 168,487 bag and about an equal amount to other port of the island make approximately 337,000 for the first half of 1892
 partly by reason of the reciprocal trade agreement but more largely by reason of the removal of the sanitary restriction upon american pork our export of pork product to germany increase during the ten month end june 30 last $ 2,025,074 or about 32 per cent
 the british trade journal of london in a recent issue speak of the increase of american coal export and of the fall off of the english coal export to cuba say
 it be another case of american competition the united states now supply cuba with about 150,000 ton of coal annually and there be every prospect of this trade increase as the forest of the island become exhausted and the use of steam machinery on the sugar estate be develop alabama coal especially be secure a reputation in the spanish west indies and the river and rail improvement of the southern states will undoubtedly create an important gulf trade
 the new reciprocity policy by which the united states be enable to import cuban sugar will of course assist the american coal exporter even more effectively than the new line of railway
 the democratic platform promise a repeal of the tariff law contain this provision and especially denounce as a sham reciprocity that section of the law under which these trade arrangement have be make if no other issue be involve in the campaign this alone would give it momentous importance
 be the farmer of the great grain grow states willing to surrender these new large and increase market for their surplus be we to have nothing in exchange for the free importation of sugar and coffee and at the same time to destroy the sugar planter of the south and the beet sugar industry of the northwest and of the pacific coast or be we to have the tax sugar and coffee which a tariff for revenue only necessarily involve with the add loss of the new market which have be open
 as i have show our own commercial rival in europe do not regard this reciprocity policy as a sham but as a serious threat to a trade supremacy they have long enjoy they would rejoice mdash and if prudence do not restrain would illuminate their depressed manufacturing cities&mdash;over the news that the united states have abandon its system of protection and reciprocity they see very clearly that restriction of american production and trade and a corresponding increase of european production and trade would follow and i will not believe that what be so plain to they can be hide from our own people
 the declaration of the platform in favor of the american doctrine of protection meet my most hearty approval the convention do not adopt a schedule but a principle that be to control all tariff schedule there may be difference of opinion among protectionist as to the rate upon particular article necessary to effect an equalization between wage abroad and at home in some not remote national campaign the issue have be or more correctly have be make to appear to be between a high and a low protective tariff both party express some solicitous regard for the wage of our work people and for the prosperity of our domestic industry
 but under a more courageous leadership the democratic party have now practically declare that if give power it will enact a tariff law without any regard to its effect upon wage or upon the capital invest in our great industry the majority report of the committee on platform to the democratic national convention at chicago contain this clause
 that when custom house taxation be levy upon article of any kind produce in this country the difference between the cost of labor here and labor abroad when such a difference exist fully measure any possible benefit to labor and the enormous additional imposition of the exist tariff fall with crush force upon our farmer and work man
 here we have a distinct admission of the republican contention that american workman be advantage by a tariff rate equal to the difference between home and foreign wage and a declaration only against the alleged additional imposition of the exist tariff law again this majority report far declare but in make a reduction in taxis it be not propose to injure any domestic industry but rather to promote their healthy growth moreover many industry have come to rely upon legislation for successful continuance so that any change of law must be at every step regardful of the labor and the capital thus involve
 here we have an admission that many of our industry depend upon protective duty for their successful continuance and a declaration that tariff change should be regardful of the workman in such industry and of the invest capital
 the overwhelming rejection of these proposition which have before receive the sanction of democratic national convention be not more indicative of the new and more courageous leadership to which the party have now commit itself than the substitute which be adopt this substitute declare that protective duty be unconstitutional mdash high protection low protection&mdash;all unconstitutional
 a democratic congress hold this view can not enact nor a democratic president approve any tariff schedule the purpose or effect of which be to limit importation or to give any advantage to an american workman or producer a bounty might i judge be give to the importer under this view of the constitution in order to increase importation and so the revenue for revenue only be the limitation reciprocity of course fall under this denunciation for its object and effect be not revenue but the promotion of commercial exchange the profit of which go wholly to our producer
 this destructive un american doctrine be not hold or teach by the historic democratic statesman whose fame as american patriot have reach this generation mdash certainly not by jefferson or jackson this mad crusade against american shop the bitter epithet apply to american manufacturer the persistent disbelief of every report of the opening of a tin plate mill or of an increase of our foreign trade by reciprocity be as surprising as they be discreditable
 there be not a thoughtful business man in the country who do not know that the enactment into law of the declaration of the chicago convention upon the subject of the tariff would at once plunge the country into a business convulsion such as it have never see and there be not a thoughtful workingman who do not know that it would at once enormously reduce the amount of work to be do in this country by the increase of importation that would follow and necessitate a reduction of his wage to the european standard
 if any one suggest that this radical policy will not be execute if the democratic party attain power what shall be think of a party that be capable of thus trifle with great interest the threat of such legislation would be only less hurtful than the fact
 a distinguished democrat rightly describe this movement as a challenge to the protect industry to a fight of extermination and another such rightly express the logic of the situation when he interpret the chicago platform to be an invitation to all democrats hold even the most moderate protection view to go into the republican party
 and now a few word in regard to the exist tariff law we be fortunately able to judge of its influence upon production and price by the market report the day of the prophet of calamity have be succeed by that of the trade reporter
 an examination into the effect of the law upon the price of protect product and of the cost of such article as enter into the living of people of small mean have be make by a senate committee compose of lead senators of both party with the aid of the good statistician and the report sign by all the member of the committee have be give to the public no such wide and careful inquiry have ever before be make these fact appear from the report
 first the cost of article enter into the use of those earn less than $ 1,000 per annum have decrease up to may 1892 3.4 per cent while in farm product there have be an increase in price owe in part to an increase foreign demand and the opening of new market
 in england during the same period the cost of living increase 1 9 per cent test by their power to purchase article of necessity the earning of our work people have never be as great as they be now
 second there have be an average advance in the rate of wage of .75 of 1 per cent
 third there have be an advance in the price of all farm product of 18.67 per cent and of all cereal 33.59 per cent
 the ninth annual report of the chief of the bureau of labor statistic of the state of new york a democratic officer very recently issue strongly corroborate as to that state the fact find by the senate committee his extended inquiry show that in the year immediately follow the passage of the tariff act of 1890 the aggregate sum pay in wage in that state be $ 6,377,925 in excess and the aggregate production $ 31,315,130111 excess of the precede year
 in view of this showing of an increase in wage of a reduction in the cost of article of common necessity and of a marked advance in the price of agricultural product it be plain that this tariff law have not impose burden but have confer benefit upon the farmer and the workingman
 some special effect of the act should be notice it be a courageous attempt to rid our people of a long maintain foreign monopoly in the production of tin plate pearl button silk plush linen lace etc once or twice in our history the production of tin plate have be attempt and the price obtain by the welsh maker would have enable our maker to produce it at a profit but the welsh maker at once cut price to a point that drive the american beginner out of the business and when this be accomplish again make their own price
 a correspondent of the industrial world the official organ of the welsh tin plate worker publish at swansea in the issue of june 10 1892 advise a new trial of these method he say
 do not be deceive the victory of the republicans at the poll mean the retention of the mckinley bill and mean the rapidly accruing loss of the 80 per cent of the export american trade have there be no democratic victory in 1890 the spread of the tin plate manufacture in the united states would have be both rapid and bona fide it be not yet too late to do something to reduce the price of plate put they down to 11 shilling per box of 100,14 by 20 full weight basis let the workman lake half pay for a few month and turn out more then let the master forego profit for the same time
 and again that paper say
 it be clearly the interest of both employer and workman to produce tin plate tariff or no tariff at a price that will drive all competitor from the field
 but in spite of the doubt raise by the election of 1890 and of the machination of foreign producer to maintain their monopoly the tin plate industry have be establish in the united states and the alliance between the welsh producer and the democratic party for its destruction will not succeed
 the official return to the treasury department of the production of tin and terne plate in the united states during the last fiscal year show a total production of 13,240,830 pound and a comparison of the first quarter 826,922 pound with the last 8,000,000 pound show the rapid development of the industry over 5,000,000 pound during the last quarter be make from american black plate the remainder from foreign plate
 mr. ayer the treasury agent in charge estimate as the result of careful inquiry that the production of the current year will be 100,000,000 pound and that by the end of the year our production will be at the rate of 200,000,000 pound per annum
 another industry that have be practically create by the mckinley bill be the making of pearl button few article come to we from abroad be so distinctly the product of starvation wage
 but without unduly extend this letter i can not follow in detail the influence of the tariff law of 1890 it have transplant several important industry and establish they here and have revive or enlarge all other the act give to the miner protection against foreign silver bear lead ore the free introduction of which threaten the great mining industry of the rocky mountain states and to the wool grower protection for their fleece and flock which have save they from a further and disastrous decline the house of representatives at its last session pass bill place these ore and wool upon the free list the people of the west will know how destructive to their prosperity these measure would be
 this tariff law have give employment to many thousand of american man and woman and will each year give employment to increase thousand its repeal would throw thousand out of employment and give work to other only at reduce wage the appeal of the free trader to the workingman be largely address to his prejudice or to his passion and not infrequently be pronouncedly communistic the new democratic leadership rage at the employer and seek to communicate his rage to the employee i greatly regret that all employer of labor be not just and considerate and that capital sometimes take too large a share of the profit but i do not see that these evil will be ameliorate by a tariff policy the first necessary effect of which be a severe wage cut and the second a large diminution of the aggregate amount of work to be do in this country
 if the injustice of his employer tempt the workman to strike back he should be very sure that his blow do not fall upon his own head or upon his wife and child the workman in our great industry be as a body remarkably intelligent and be lover of home and country they may be rouse by injustice or what seem to they to be such or be lead for the moment by other into act of passion but they will settle the tariff contest in the calm light of their november fireside and with sole reference to the prosperity of the country of which they be citizen and of the home they have found for their wife and child
 no intelligent advocate of a protective tariff claim that it be able of itself to maintain a uniform rate of wage without regard to fluctuation in the supply of and demand for the product of labor but it be confidently claim that protective duty strongly tend to hold up wage and be the only barrier against a reduction to the european scale
 the southern states have have a liberal participation in the benefit of the tariff law and though their representative have generally oppose the protection policy i rejoice that their sugar rice coal ore iron fruit cotton cloth and other product have not be leave to the fate which the vote of their representative would have bring upon they
 in the construction of the nicaragua canal in the new trade with south and central america in the establishment of american steamship line these states have also special interest and all these interest will not always consent to be without representation at washington
 shrewdly but not quite fairly our adversary speak only of the increase duty impose upon tin pearl button and other article by the mckinley bill and omit altogether any reference to the great and beneficial enlargement of the free list during the last fiscal year $ 458,000,772 worth of merchandise or 55.35 per cent of our total importation come in free the large per centage in our history while in 1889 the per cent of free importation be only 34.42
 the placing of sugar upon the free list have save to the consumer in duty in fifteen month after pay the bounty provide for $ 87,000,000 this relief have be substantially feel in even&#39 household upon every saturday&#39;s purchase of the workingman per cent
 one of the favorite argument against a protective tariff be that it shut we out from a participation in what be call with swell emphasis the market of the world if this view be not a false one how do it happen that our commercial competitor be not able to bear with more serenity our suppose surrender to they of the market of the world and how do it happen that the partial loss of our market close foreign tin plate mill and plush factory that still have all other market
 our natural advantage our protective tariff and the reciprocity policy make it possible for we to have a large participation in the market of the world without open our own to a competition that would destroy the comfort and independence of our people
 the resolution of the convention in favor of bimetalism declare i think the true and necessary condition of a movement that have upon these line my cordial adherence and support i be thoroughly convinced that the free coinage of silver at such a ratio to gold as will maintain the equality in their commercial use of the two coin dollar would conduce to the prosperity of all the great producing and commercial nation of the world
 the one essential condition be that these dollar shall have and retain an equal acceptability and value in all commercial transaction they be not only a medium of exchange but a measure of value and when two unequal measure be call in law by the same name commerce be unsettled and confused and the unwary and ignorant be cheat dollar of unequal commercial value will not circulate together the well dollar be withdraw and become merchandise
 the true interest of all our people and especially of the farmer and work people who can not closely observe the money market be that every dollar paper or coin issue or authorize by the government shall at all time and in all its use be the exact equivalent not only in debt pay but in purchase power of any other dollar
 i be quite sure that if we should now act upon this subject independently of other nation we would greatly promote their interest and injure our own the monetary condition in europe within the last two year have i think tend very much to develop a sentiment in favor of a large use of silver and i be much pleased and encourage by the cordiality promptness and unanimity with which the invitation of this government for an international conference upon this subject be accept by all the power we may not only hope for but expect highly beneficial result from this conference which will now soon assemble when the result of the conference be know we shall then be able intelligently to readjust our financial legislation to any new condition
 in my last annual message to congress i say
 i must yet entertain the hope that it be possible to secure a calm patriotic consideration of such constitutional or statutory change as may be necessary to secure the choice of the officer of the government to the people by fair apportionment and free election i believe it would be possible to constitute a commission nonpartisan in its membership and compose of patriotic wise and impartial man to whom a consideration of the question of the evil connect with our election system and method might be commit with a good prospect of secure unanimity in some plan for remove or mitigate those evil
 the constitution would permit the selection of the commission to be vest in the supreme court if that method would give the good guaranty of impartiality this commission should be charge with the duty of inquire into the whole subject of the law of election as relate to the choice of officer of the national government with a view to secure to every elector a free and unmolested exercise of the suffrage and as near an approach to an equality of value in each ballot cast as be attainable the demand that the limitation of suffrage shall be find in the law and only there be a just demand and no just man should resent or resist it
 it seem to i that an appeal to our people to consider the question of readjust our legislation upon absolutely fair non- partisan line might find some effective response many time i have have occasion to say that law and election method design to give unfair advantage to the party make they would some time be use to perpetuate in power a faction of a party against the will of a majority of the people
 of this we seem to have an illustration in the recent state election in alabama there be no republican ticket in the field the contest be between white democrats the kolb party say they be refuse the representation guarantee by law upon the election board and that when the court by mandamus attempt to right this wrong an appeal that could not be hear until after the election make the writ ineffectual ballot box be throw out for alleged irregularity or destroy and it be assert on behalf of one half at least of the white voter of alabama that the officer to whom certificate have be give be not honestly elect
 there be no security for the personal or political right of any man in a community where any other man be deprive of his personal or political right the power of the states over the question of the qualification of elector be ample to protect they against the danger of an ignorant or depraved suffrage and the demand that every man find to be qualified under the law shall be make secure in the right to cast a free ballot and to have that ballot honestly count can not be abate
 our old republican battle cry a free ballot and a fair count come back to we not only from alabama but from other states and from man who differ with we widely in opinion have come to see that party and political debate be but a mockery if when the debate be end the judgment of honest majority be to be reverse by ballot box fraud and tally sheet manipulation in the interest of the party or party faction in power
 these new political movement in the states and the recent decision of some of the state court against unfair apportionment law encourage the hope that the arbitrary and partisan election law and practice which have prevail may be correct by the states the law make equal and nonpartisan and the election free and honest the republican party would rejoice at such a solution as a healthy and patriotic local sentiment be the good assurance of free and honest election
 i shall again urge upon congress that provision be make for the appointment of a nonpartisan commission to consider the subject of apportionment and election in their relation to the choice of federal officer
 the civil service system have be extend and law enforce with vigor and impartiality there have be no partisan juggling with the law in any of the department or bureau as have before happen but appointment to the classified service have be make impartially from the eligible list the system now in force in all the department have for the first time place promotion strictly upon the basis of merit as ascertain by a daily record and the efficiency of the force thereby greatly increase
 the approval so heartily give by the convention to all those agency which contribute to the education of the child of the land be worthily bestow and meet my hearty approval as do also the declaration as to liberty of thought and conscience and the separation of church and state
 the safety of the republic be an intelligent citizenship and the increase interest manifest in the states in education the cheerfulness with which the necessary taxis be pay by all class and the renew interest manifest by the child in the national flag be hopeful indication that the come generation will direct public affair with increase prudence and patriotism
 our interest in free public school open to all child of suitable age be supreme and our care for they will be jealous and constant the public school system however be not intend to restrain the natural right of the parent after contribute to the public school fund to choose other educational agency for his child
 i favor aid by the general government to the public school with a special view to the necessity of some of the southern states but it be gratify to notice that many of these state be with commendable liberality develop their school system and increase their school revenue to the great advantage of the child of both race
 the considerate attention of the farmer of the whole country be invite to the work do through the state and agricultural departments in the interest of agriculture our pork product have for ten year be not only exclude by the great continental nation of europe but their value discredit by the reason give for this exclusion all previous effort to secure the removal of these restriction have fail but the wise legislation of the fifty first congress provide for the inspection and official certification of our meat and give to the president power to forbid the introduction into this country of select product of such country as should continue to refuse our inspect meat enable we to open all the market of europe to our pork product the result have be not only to sustain price by provide new market for our surplus but to add fifty cent per one hundred pound to the market value of the inspect meat
 under the reciprocity agreement special favor have be secure for agricultural product and our export of such product have be greatly increase with a sure prospect of a further and rapid increase the agricultural department have maintain in europe an agent whose special duty it be to introduce there the various preparation of corn as article of food and his work have be very successful
 the department have also send skilled veterinarian to liverpool to examine in connection with the british veterinarian the live cattle from the united states land at that port and the result in connection with the sanitary method adopt at home have be that we hear no more about our cattle be infect with pleuro pneumonia a judicious system of quarantine line have prevent the infection of northern cattle with the texas fever
 the tariff bill of 1890 give well protection to farm product subject to foreign competition than they ever have before and the home market for such product have be enlarge by the establishment of new industry and the development of other
 we may confidently submit to the intelligent and candid judgment of the american farmer whether in any corresponding period so much have be do to promote his interest and whether in a continuance and extension of these method there be not a well prospect offer to he than in the invitation of the democratic party to give our home market to foreign manufacturer and to abandon the reciprocity policy and well also than the radical and untried method of relief propose by other party which be solicit his support
 i have often express my strong conviction of the value of the nicaragua ship canal to our commerce and to our navy the project be not one of convenience but of necessity it be quite possible i believe if the united states will support the enterprise to secure the speedy completion of the canal without tax the treasury for any direct contribution and at the same time to secure to the united states that influence in its management which be imperative
 it have be the purpose of the administration to make its foreign policy not a matter of partisan politic but of patriotism and national honor and i have very great gratification in be able to state that the democratic member of the committees of foreign affairs respond in a true american spirit i have not hesitate to consult freely with they about the most confidential and delicate affair and here frankly confess my obligation for needed cooperation they do not regard a patient but firm insistence upon american right and upon immunity from insult and injury for our citizen and sailor in foreign port as a policy of irritation and bluster they do not believe as some other seem to believe that to be a democrat one must take the foreign side of every international question if a republican administration be conduct the american side i do not believe that a tame submission to insult and outrage by any nation at the hand of another can ever form the basis of a last friendship the necessary element of mutual respect will be want
 the chilean incident now so happily and honorably adjust will i do not doubt place our relation with that brave people upon a more friendly basis than ever before this already appear in the agreement since negotiate by mr. egan for the settlement by a commission of the long unsettled claim between the two government the work of mr. egan have be highly advantageous to the united states the confidence which i refuse to withdraw from he have be abundantly justify
 in our relation with the great european power the right of the united states and of our citizen have be insist upon with firmness the strength of our cause and not the strength of our adversary have give tone to our correspondence
 the samoan question and the bering sea question which come over from the precede administration have be the one settle and the other submit to arbitration upon a fair basis
 never before i think in a like period have so many important treaty and commercial agreement be conclude and never before i be sure have the honor and influence national and commercial of the united states be hold in high estimation in both hemisphere
 the union soldier and sailor be now veteran of time as well as of war the parallel of age have approach close to the citadel of life and the end for each of a brave and honorable struggle be not remote increase infirmity and year give the minor tone of sadness and pathos to the mighty appeal of service and suffering the ear that do not listen with sympathy and the heart that do not respond with generosity be the ear and heart of an alien and not of an american now soon again the survive veteran be to parade upon the great avenue of the national capital and every tribute of honor and love should attend the march a comrade in the column of the victors&#39 parade in 1865 i be not less a comrade now
 i have use every suitable occasion to urge upon the people of all section the consideration that no good cause can 1&gt;e promote upon the line of lawlessness mob do not discriminate and the punishment inflict by they have no repressive or salutary influence on the contrary they beget revenge and perpetuate feud it be especially the duty of the educate and influential to see that the weak and ignorant when accuse of crime be fairly try before lawful tribunal the moral sentiment of the country should be arouse and bring to bear for the suppression of these offense against the law and social order
 the necessity for a careful discrimination among the emigrant seek our shore become every day more apparent we do not want and should not receive those who by reason of bad character or habit be not want at home the industrious and self respecting the lover of law and liberty should be discriminate from the pauper the criminal and the anarchist who come only to burden and disturb our community every effort have be make to enforce the law and some conviction have be secure under the contract labor law
 the general condition of our country be one of great prosperity the blessing of god have rest upon our field and upon our people the annual value of our foreign commerce have increase more than $ 400,000,000 over the average for the precede ten year and more than $ 210,000,000 over 1890 the last year unaffected by the new tariff our export in 1892 exceed those of 1890 by more than $ 172,000,000 and the annual average for ten year by $ 265,000,000 our export of breadstuff increase over those of 1890 more than $ 144,000,000 of provision over $ 4,000,000 and of manufacture over $ 8,000,000 the merchandise balance of trade in our favor in 1892 be $ 202,944,342
 no other nation can match the commercial progress which these figure disclose our compassion may well go out to those whose party necessity and habit still compel they to declare that our people be oppress and our trade restrict by a protective tariff
 it be not possible for i to refer even in the brief way to many of the topic present in the resolution adopt by the convention upon all that have not be discuss i have before publicly express my view
 a change in the personnel of a national administration be of comparatively little moment if those exercise public function be able honest diligent and faithful other possess all these quality may be find to take their place but change in the law and administrative policy be of great moment when public affair have be give a direction and business have adjust itself to these line any sudden change involve a stoppage and new business adjustment if the change of direction be so radical as to bring the commercial turn table into use the business change involve be not readjustment but reconstruction
 the democratic party offer a programme of demolition the protective policy mdash to which all business even that of the importer be now adjust mdash the reciprocity policy the new merchant marine be all to be demolish not gradually not take down but blow up to this programme of destruction it have add one constructive feature the reestablishment of state bank of issue
 the policy of the republican party be on the other hand distinctively a policy of safe progression and development&mdash;of new factory new market and new ship it will subject business to no perilous change but offer attractive opportunity for expansion upon familiar line

to the senate and house of representatives in submit my annual message to congress i have great satisfaction in be able to say that the general condition affect the commercial and industrial interest of the united states be in the high degree favorable a comparison of the exist condition with those of the most favor period in the history of the country will i believe show that so high a degree of prosperity and so general a diffusion of the comfort of life be never before enjoy by our people the total wealth of the country in 1860 be $ 16,159,616,068 in 1890 it amount to $ 62,610,000,000 an increase of 287 per cent the total mileage of railway in the united states in 1860 be 30,626 in 1890 it be 167,741 an increase of 448 per cent and it be estimate that there will be about 4,000 mile of track add by the close of the year 1892.the official return of the eleventh census and those of the tenth census for seventy five lead city furnish the basis for the following comparison in 1880 the

be as high whether measure by the currency in which they be pay or by their power to supply the necessary and comfort of life it be true that the market price of cotton and wheat have be low it be one of the unfavorable incident of agriculture that the farmer can not produce upon order he must sow and reap in ignorance of the aggregate production of the year and be peculiarly subject to the depreciation which follow overproduction but while the fact i have state be true as to the crop mention the general average of price have be such as to give to agriculture a fair participation in the

they should not fail to remember that there be no other country in the world where the condition that seem to they hard would not be accept as highly prosperous the english agriculturist would be glad to exchange the return of his labor for those of the american farmer and the manchester workmen their wage for those of their fellow at fall river i believe that the protective system which have now for something more than thirty year continuously prevail in our legislation have be a mighty instrument for the development of our national wealth and a most powerful agency in protect the home of our workingman from the invasion of want i have feel a most solicitous interest to preserve to our work people rate of wage that would not only give daily bread but supply a comfortable margin for those home attraction and family comfort and enjoyment without which life be neither hopeful nor sweet they be american citizen a part of the great people for whom our constitution and government be frame and institute and it can not be a perversion of that constitution to so legislate as to preserve in their home the comfort independence loyalty and sense of interest in the government which be essential to good citizenship in peace and which will bring this stalwart throng as in 1861 to the defense of the flag when it be assail it be not my purpose to renew here the argument in favor of a protective tariff the result of the recent election must be accept as having introduce a new policy we must assume that the present tariff construct upon the line of protection be to be repeal and that there be to be substitute for it a tariff law construct solely with reference to revenue that no duty be to be high because the increase will keep open an american mill or keep up the wage of an american workman but that in every case such a rate of duty be to be impose as will bring to the treasury of the united states the large return of revenue the contention have not be between schedule but between principle and it would be offensive to suggest that the prevail party will not carry into legislation the principle advocate by it and the pledge give to the people the tariff bill pass by the house of representatives at the last session be as i suppose even in the opinion of their promoter inadequate and justify only by the fact that the senate and house of representatives be not in accord and that a general revision could not therefore be undertake i recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be leave to the incoming congress it be matter of regret that this work must be delay for at least three month for the threat of great tariff change introduce so much uncertainty that an amount not easily estimate of business inaction and of diminished production will necessarily result it be possible also that this uncertainty may result in decrease revenue from custom duty for our merchant will make cautious order for foreign good in view of the prospect of tariff reduction and the uncertainty as to when they will take effect those who have advocate a protective tariff can well afford to have their disastrous forecast of a change of policy disappoint if a system of custom duty can be frame that will set the idle wheel and loom of europe in motion and crowd our warehouse with foreign make good and at the same time keep our own mill busy that will give we an increase participation in the market of the world of great value than the home market we surrender that will give increase work to foreign workman upon product to be consume by our people without diminish the amount of work to be do here that will enable the american manufacturer to pay to his workman from 50 to 100 per cent more in wage than be pay in the foreign mill and yet to compete in our market and in foreign market with the foreign producer that will far reduce the cost of article of wear and food without reduce the wage of those who produce they that can be celebrate after its effect have be realize as its expectation have be in european as well as in american city the author and promoter of it will be entitle to the high praise we have have in our history several experience of the contrast effect of a revenue and of a protective tariff but this generation have not feel they and the experience of one generation be not highly instructive to the next the friend of the protective system with undiminished confidence in the principle they have advocate will await the result of the new experiment the strained and too often disturb relation exist between the employee and the employer in our great manufacturing establishment have not be favorable to a calm consideration by the wage earner of the effect upon wage of the protective system the fact that his wage be the highest pay in like calling in the world and that a maintenance of this rate of wage in the absence of protective duty upon the product of his labor be impossible be obscure by the passion evoke by these contest he may now be able to review the question in the light of his personal experience under the operation of a tariff for revenue only if that experience shall demonstrate that present rate of wage be thereby maintain or increase either absolutely or in their purchasing power and that the aggregate volume of work to be do in this country be increase or even maintain so that there be more or as many day work in a year at as good or well wage for the american workman as have be the case under the protective system everyone will rejoice a general process of wage reduction can not be contemplate by any patriotic citizen without the grave apprehension it may be indeed i believe be possible for the american manufacturer to compete successfully with his foreign rival in many branch of production without the defense of protective duty if the pay roll be equalize but the conflict that stand between the producer and that result and the distress of our work people when it be attain be not pleasant to contemplate the society of the unemployed now hold its frequent and threatening parade in the street of foreign city should not be allow to acquire an american domicile the report of the head of the several executive departments which be herewith submit have very naturally include a resume of the whole work of the administration with the transaction of the last fiscal year the attention not only of congress but of the country be again invite to the method of administration which have be pursue and to the result which have be attain public revenue amount to $ 1,414,079,292.28 have be collect and disburse without loss from misappropriation without a single defalcation of such importance as to attract the public attention and at a diminished per cent of cost for collection the public business have be transact not only with fidelity but progressively and with a view to give to the people in the full possible degree the benefit of a service establish and maintain for their protection and comfort our relation with other nation be now undisturbe by any serious controversy the complicated and threaten difference with germany and england relate to samoan affair with england in relation to the seal fishery in the bering sea and with chile grow out of the baltimore affair have be adjust there have be negotiate and conclude under section 3 of the tariff law commercial agreement relate to reciprocal trade with the following country brazil dominican republic spain for cuba and puerto rico guatemala salvador the german empire great britain for certain west indian colony and british guiana nicaragua honduras and austria hungary of these those with guatemala salvador the german empire great britain nicaragua honduras and austria hungary have be conclude since my last annual message under these trade arrangement a free or favor admission have be secure in every case for an important list of american product especial care have be take to secure market for farm product in order to relieve that great underlie industry of the depression which the lack of an adequate foreign market for our surplus often bring an opening have also be make for manufacture product that will undoubtedly if this policy be maintain greatly augment our export trade the full benefit of these arrangement can not be realize instantly new line of trade be to be open the commercial traveler must survey the field the manufacturer must adapt his good to the new market and facility for exchange must be establish this work have be well begin our merchant and manufacturer having enter the new field with courage and enterprise in the case of food product and especially with cuba the trade do not need to wait and the immediate result have be most gratifying if this policy and these trade arrangement can be continue in force and aid by the establishment of american steamship line i do not doubt that we shall within a short period secure fully one third of the total trade of the country of central and south america which now amount to about $ 600,000,000 annually in 1885 we have only 8 per cent of this trade the following statistic show the increase in our trade with the country with which we have reciprocal trade agreement from the date when such agreement go into effect up to september 30 1892 the increase be in some almost wholly and in other in an important degree the result of these agreement the domestic export to germany and austria hungary have increase in value from $ 47,673,756 to $ 57,993,064 an increase of $ 10,319,308 or 21.63 per cent with american country the value of our export have increase from $ 44,160,285 to $ 54,613,598 an increase of $ 10,453,313 or 23.67 per cent the total increase in the value of export to all the country with which we have reciprocity agreement have be $ 20,772,621 this increase be chiefly in wheat flour meat and dairy product and in manufacture of iron and steel and lumber there have be a large increase in the value of import from all these country since the commercial agreement go into effect amount to $ 74,294,525 but it have be entirely in import from the american country consist mostly of sugar coffee india rubber and crude drug the alarmed attention of our european competitor for the south american market have be attract to this new american policy and to our acquisition and their loss of south american trade a treaty provide for the arbitration of the dispute between great britain and the united states as to the killing of seal in the bering sea be conclude on the 29th of february last this treaty be accompany by an agreement prohibit pelagic sealing pende the arbitration and a vigorous effort be make during this season to drive out all poach sealer from the bering sea six naval vessel three revenue cutter and one vessel from the fish commission all under the command of commander evans of the navy be send into the sea which be systematically patrol some seizure be make and it be believe that the catch in the bering sea by poacher amount to less than 500 seal it be true however that in the north pacific while the seal herd be on their way to the pass between the aleutian islands a very large number probably 35,000 be take the exist statute of the united states do not restrain our citizen from take seal in the pacific ocean and perhaps should not unless the prohibition can be extend to the citizen of other nation i recommend that power be give to the president by proclamation to prohibit the taking of seal in the north pacific by american vessel in case either as the result of the finding of the tribunal of arbitration or otherwise the restraint can be apply to the vessel of all country the case of the united states for the tribunal of arbitration have be prepare with great care and industry by the hon john w. foster and the counsel who represent this government express confidence that a result substantially establish our claim and preserve this great industry for the benefit of all nation will be attain during the past year a suggestion be receive through the british minister that the canadian government would like to confer as to the possibility of enlarge upon term of mutual advantage the commercial exchange of canada and of the united states and a conference be hold at washington with mr. blaine act for this government and the british minister at this capital and three member of the dominion cabinet act as commissioner on the part of great britain the conference develop the fact that the canadian government be only prepared to offer to the united states in exchange for the concession ask the admission of natural product the statement be frankly make that favor rate could not be give to the united states as against the mother country this admission which be foresee necessarily terminate the conference upon this question the benefit of an exchange of natural product would be almost wholly with the people of canada some other topic of interest be consider in the conference and have result in the making of a convention for examine the alaskan boundary and the water of passamaquoddy bay adjacent to eastport me and in the initiation of an arrangement for the protection of fish life in the coterminous and neighboring water of our northern border the controversy as to toll upon the welland canal which be present to congress at the last session by special message having fail of adjustment i feel constrain to exercise the authority confer by the act of july 26 1892 and to proclaim a suspension of the free use of st. marys falls canal to cargoe in transit to port in canada the secretary of the treasury establish such toll as be think to be equivalent to the exaction unjustly levy upon our commerce in the canadian canal if as we must suppose the political relation of canada and the disposition of the canadian government be to remain unchanged a somewhat radical revision of our trade relation should i think be make our relation must continue to be intimate and they should be friendly i regret to say however that in many of the controversy notably those as to the fishery on the atlantic the sealing interest on the pacific and the canal toll our negotiation with great britain have continuously be thwart or retard by unreasonable and unfriendly objection and protest from canada in the matter of the canal toll our treaty right be flagrantly disregarded it be hardly too much to say that the canadian pacific and other railway line which parallel our northern boundary be sustain by commerce have either its origin or terminus or both in the united states canadian railroad compete with those of the united states for our traffic and without the restraint of our interstate commerce act their car pass almost without detention into and out of our territory the canadian pacific railway bring into the united states from china and japan via british columbia during the year end june 30 1892 23,239,689 pound of freight and it carry from the united states to be ship to china and japan via british columbia 24,068,346 pound of freight there be also ship from the united states over this road from eastern port of the united states to our pacific port during the same year 13,912,073 pound of freight and there be receive over this road at the united states eastern port from port on the pacific coast 13,293,315 pound of freight mr. joseph nimmo jr former chief of the bureau of statistics when before the senate select committee on relations with canada april 26 1890 say that the value of good thus transport between different point in the united states across canadian territory probably amount to $ 100,000,000 a year "there be no disposition on the part of the people or government of the united states to interfere in the small degree with the political relation of canada that question be wholly with her own people it be time for we however to consider whether if the present state of thing and trend of thing be to continue our interchange upon line of land transportation should not be put upon a different basis and our entire independence of canadian canal and of the st. lawrence as an outlet to the sea secure by the construction of an american canal around the falls of niagara and the opening of ship communication between the great lakes and one of our own seaport we should not hesitate to avail ourselves of our great natural trade advantage we should withdraw the support which be give to the railroad and steamship line of canada by a traffic that properly belong to we and no long furnish the earning which lighten the otherwise crush weight of the enormous public subsidy that have be give to they the subject of the power of the treasury to deal with this matter without further legislation have be under consideration but circumstance have postpone a conclusion it be probable that a consideration of the propriety of a modification or abrogation of the article of the treaty of washington relate to the transit of good in bond be involve in any complete solution of the question congress at the last session be keep advise of the progress of the serious and for a time threaten difference between the united states and chile it give i now great gratification to report that the chilean government in a most friendly and honorable spirit have tender and pay as an indemnity to the family of the sailor of the baltimore who be kill and to those who be injure in the outbreak in the city of valparaiso the sum of $ 75,000 this have be accept not only as an indemnity for a wrong do but as a most gratifying evidence that the government of chile rightly appreciate the disposition of this government to act in a spirit of the most absolute fairness and friendliness in our intercourse with that brave people a further and conclusive evidence of the mutual respect and confidence now exist be furnish by the fact that a convention submit to arbitration the mutual claim of the citizen of the respective government have be agree upon some of these claim have be pende for many year and have be the occasion of much unsatisfactory diplomatic correspondence i have endeavor in every way to assure our sister republics of central and south america that the united states government and its people have only the most friendly disposition toward they all we do not covet their territory we have no disposition to be oppressive or exact in our dealing with any of they even the weak our interest and our hope for they all lie in the direction of stable government by their people and of the large development of their great commercial resource the mutual benefit of enlarge commercial exchange and of a more familiar and friendly intercourse between our people we do desire and in this have seek their friendly cooperation i have believe however while hold these sentiment in the great sincerity that we must insist upon a just responsibility for any injury inflict upon our official representative or upon our citizen this insistence kindly and justly but firmly make will i believe promote peace and mutual respect our relation with hawaii have be such as to attract an increase interest and must continue to do so i deem it of great importance that the project submarine cable a survey for which have be make should be promote both for naval and commercial use we should have quick communication with honolulu we should before this have avail ourselves of the concession make many year ago to this government for a harbor and naval station at pearl river many evidence of the friendliness of the hawaiian government have be give in the past and it be gratify to believe that the advantage and necessity of a continuance of very close relation be appreciate the friendly act of this government in express to the government of italy its reprobation and abhorrence of the lynching of italian subject in new orleans by the payment of 125,000 franc or $ 24,330.90 be accept by the king of italy with every manifestation of gracious appreciation and the incident have be highly promotive of mutual respect and good will in consequence of the action of the french government in proclaim a protectorate over certain tribal district of the west coast of africa eastward of the san pedro river which have long be regard as the southeastern boundary of liberia i have feel constrain to make protest against this encroachment upon the territory of a republic which be round by citizen of the united states and toward which this country have for many year hold the intimate relation of a friendly counselor the recent disturbance of the public peace by lawless foreign marauder on the mexican frontier have afford this government an opportunity to testify its good will for mexico and its earnest purpose to fulfill the obligation of international friendship by pursue and disperse the evil doer the work of relocate the boundary of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo westward from el paso be progress favorably our intercourse with spain continue on a friendly footing i regret however not to be able to report as yet the adjustment of the claim of the american missionary arise from the disorder at ponape in the caroline islands but i anticipate a satisfactory adjustment in view of renewed and urgent representation to the government at madrid the treatment of the religious and educational establishment of american citizen in turkey have of late call for a more than usual share of attention a tendency to curtail the toleration which have so beneficially prevail be discernible and have call forth the earnest remonstrance of this government harass regulation in regard to school and church have be attempt in certain locality but not without due protest and the assertion of the inherent and conventional right of our countryman violation of domicile and search of the person and effect of citizen of the united states by apparently irresponsible official in the asiatic vilayet have from time to time be report an aggravated instance of injury to the property of an american missionary at bourdour in the province of konia cal1ed forth an urgent claim for reparation which i be pleased to say be promptly heed by the government of the porte interference with the trading venture of our citizen in asia minor be also report and the lack of consular representation in that region be a serious drawback to instant and effective protection i can not believe that these incident represent a settle policy and shall not cease to urge the adoption of proper remedy international copyright have be extend to italy by proclamation in conformity with the act of march 3 1891 upon assurance be give that italian law permit to citizen of the united states the benefit of copyright on substantially the same basis as to subject of italy by a special convention proclaim january 15 1892 reciprocal provision of copyright have be apply between the united states and germany negotiation be in progress with other country to the same end i repeat with great earnestness the recommendation which i have make in several previous message that prompt and adequate support be give to the american company engage in the construction of the nicaragua ship canal it be impossible to overstate the value from every standpoint of this great enterprise and i hope that there may be time even in this congress to give to it an impetus that will insure the early completion of the canal and secure to the united states its proper relation to it when complete the congress have be already advise that the invitation of this government for the assembling of an international monetary conference to consider the question of an enlarged use of silver be accept by the nation to which they be address the conference assemble at brussels on the 22d of november and have enter upon the consideration of this great question i have not doubt and have take occasion to express that belief as well in the invitation issue for this conference as in my public message that the free coinage of silver upon an agree international ratio would greatly promote the interest of our people and equally those of other nation it be too early to predict what result may be accomplish by the conference if any temporary check or delay intervene i believe that very soon commercial condition will compel the now reluctant government to unite with we in this movement to secure the enlargement of the volume of coin money need for the transaction of the business of the world the report of the secretary of the treasury will attract especial interest in view of the many misleading statement that have be make as to the state of the public revenue three preliminary fact should not only be state but emphasize before look into detail first that the public debt have be reduce since march 4 1889 $ 259,074,200 and the annual interest charge $ 11,684,469 second that there have be pay out for pension during this administration up to november 1 1892 $ 432,564,178.70 an excess of $ 114,466,386.09 over the sum expend during the period from march 1 1885 to march 1 1889 and third that under the exist tariff up to december 1 about $ 93,000,000 of revenue which would have be collect upon import sugar if the duty have be maintain have go into the pocket of the people and not into the public treasury as before if there be any who still think that the surplus should have be keep out of circulation by hoard it in the treasury or deposit in favor bank without interest while the government continue to pay to these very bank interest upon the bond deposit as security for the deposit or who think that the extended pension legislation be a public robbery or that the duty upon sugar should have be maintain i be content to leave the argument where it now rest while we wait to see whether these criticism will take the form of legislation the revenue for the fiscal year end june 30 1892 from all source be $ 425,868,260.22 and the expenditure for all purpose be $ 415,953,806.56 leave a balance of $ 9,914,453.66 there be pay during the year upon the public debt $ 40,570,467.98 the surplus in the treasury and the bank redemption fund pass by the act of july 14 1890 to the general fund furnish in large part the cash available and use for the payment make upon the public debt compare with the year 1891 our receipt from custom duty fall off $ 42,069,241.08 while our receipt from internal revenue increase $ 8,284,823.13 leave the net loss of revenue from these principal source $ 33,784,417.95 the net loss of revenue from all source be $ 32,675,972.81.the revenue estimate and actual for the fiscal year end june 30 1893 be place by the secretary at $ 463,336,350.44 and the expenditure at $ 461,336,350.44 show a surplus of receipt over expenditure of $ 2,000,000 the cash balance in the treasury at the end of the fiscal year it be estimate will be $ 20,992,377.03 so far as these figure be base upon estimate of receipt and expenditure for the remain month of the current fiscal year there be not only the usual element of uncertainty but some add element new revenue legislation or even the expectation of it may seriously reduce the public revenue during the period of uncertainty and during the process of business adjustment to the new condition when they become know but the secretary have very wisely refrain from guess as to the effect of possible change in our revenue law since the scope of those change and the time of their taking effect can not in any degree be forecast or foretell by he his estimate must be base upon exist law and upon a continuance of exist business condition except so far as these condition may be affect by cause other than new legislation the estimate receipt for the fiscal year end june 30 1894 be $ 490,121,365.38 and the estimate appropriation $ 457,261,335.33 leave an estimate surplus of receipt over expenditure of $ 32,860,030.05 this do not include any payment to the sink fund in the recommendation of the secretary that the sink fund law be repeal i concur the redemption of bond since the passage of the law to june 30 1892 have already exceed the requirement by the sum of $ 990,510,681.49 the retirement of bond in the future before maturity should be a matter of convenience not of compulsion we should not collect revenue for that purpose but only use any casual surplus to the balance of $ 32,860,030.05 of receipt over expenditure for the year 1894 should be add the estimate surplus at the beginning of the year $ 20,992,377.03 and from this aggregate there must be deduct as state by the secretary about $ 44,000,000 of estimate unexpended appropriation the public confidence in the purpose and ability of the government to maintain the parity of all of our money issue whether coin or paper must remain unshaken the demand for gold in europe and the consequent call upon we be in a considerable degree the result of the effort of some of the european governments to increase their gold reserve and these effort should be meet by appropriate legislation on our part the condition that have create this drain of the treasury gold be in an important degree political and not commercial in view of the fact that a general revision of our revenue law in the near future seem to be probable it would be well that any change should be a part of that revision rather than of a temporary nature during the last fiscal year the secretary purchase under the act of july 14 1890 54,355,748 ounce of silver and issue in payment therefor $ 51,106,608 in note the total purchase since the passage of the act have be 120,479,981 ounce and the aggregate of note issue $ 116,783,590 the average price pay for silver during the year be 94 cent per ounce the high price be $ 1.02 3/4 july 1 1891 and the low 83 cent march 21 1892 in view of the fact that the monetary conference be now sit and that no conclusion have yet be reach i withhold any recommendation as to legislation upon this subject the report of the secretary of war bring again to the attention of congress some important suggestion as to the reorganization of the infantry and artillery arm of the service which his predecessor have before urgently present our army be small but its organization should all the more be put upon the most approve modern basis the condition upon what we have call the frontier have heretofore require the maintenance of many small post but now the policy of concentration be obviously the right one the new post should have the proper strategic relation to the only frontier we now have those of the seacoast and of our northern and part of our southern boundary i do not think that any question of advantage to locality or to states should determine the location of the new post the reorganization and enlargement of the bureau of military information which the secretary have effect be a work the usefulness of which will become every year more apparent the work of build heavy gun and the construction of coast defense have be well begin and should be carry on without check the report of the attorney general be by law submit directly to congress but i can not refrain from say that he have conduct the increase work of the department of justice with great professional skill he have in several direction secure from the court decision give increase protection to the officer of the united states and bring some class of crime that escape local cognizance and punishment into the tribunal of the united states where they could be try with impartiality the numerous application for executive clemency present in behalf of person convict in united states court and give penitentiary sentence have call my attention to a fact refer to by the attorney general in his report namely that a time allowance for good behavior for such prisoner be prescribe by the federal statute only where the state in which the penitentiary be locate have make no such provision prisoner be give the benefit of the provision of the state law regulate the penitentiary to which they may be send these be various some perhaps too liberal and some perhaps too illiberal the result be that a sentence for five year mean one thing if the prisoner be send to one state for confinement and quite a different thing if he be send to another i recommend that a uniform credit for good behavior be prescribe by congress i have before express my concurrence in the recommendation of the attorney general that degree of murder should be recognize in the federal statute as they be i believe in all the states these grade be round on correct distinction in crime the recognition of they would enable the court to exercise some discretion in apportion punishment and would greatly relieve the executive of what be come to be a very heavy burden the examination of these case on application for commutation the aggregate of claim pende against the government in the court of claims be enormous claim to the amount of nearly $ 400,000,000 for the taking of or injury to the property of person claim to be loyal during the war be now before that court for examination when to these be add the indian depredation claim and the french spoliation claim an aggregate be reach that be indeed startle in the defense of all these case the government be at great disadvantage the claimant have preserve their evidence whereas the agent of the government be send into the field to rummage for what they can find this difficulty be peculiarly great where the fact to be establish be the disloyalty of the claimant during the war if this great threat against our revenue be to have no other check certainly congress should supply the department of justice with appropriation sufficiently liberal to secure the good legal talent in the defense of these claim and to pursue its vague search for evidence effectively the report of the postmaster general show a most gratifying increase and a most efficient and progressive management of the great business of that department the remarkable increase in revenue in the number of post office and in the mile of mail carriage furnish further evidence of the high state of prosperity which our people be enjoy new office mean new hamlet and town new route mean the extension of our border settlement and increase revenue mean an active commerce the postmaster general review the whole period of his administration of the office and bring some of his statistic down to the month of november last the postal revenue have increase during the last year nearly $ 5,000,000 the deficit for the year end june 30 1892 be $ 848,341 less than the deficiency of the precede year the deficiency of the present fiscal year it be estimate will be reduce to $ 1,552,423 which will not only be extinguish during the next fiscal year but a surplus of nearly $ 1,000,000 should then be show in these calculation the payment to be make under the contract for ocean mail service have not be include there have be add 1,590 new mail route during the year with a mileage of 8,563 mile and the total number of new mile of mail trip add during the year be nearly 17,000,000 the number of mile of mail journey add during the last four year be about 76,000,000 this addition be 21,000,000 mile more than be in operation in the whole country in 1861.the number of post office have be increase by 2,790 during the year and during the past four year and up to october 29 last the total increase in the number of office have be nearly 9,000 the number of free delivery office have be nearly double in the last four year and the number of money order office more than double within that time for the three year end june 30 1892 the postal revenue amount to $ 197,744,359 which be an increase of $ 52,263,150 over the revenue for the three year end june 30 1888 the increase during the last three year be more than three and a half time as great as the increase during the three year end june 30 1888 no such increase as that show for these three year have ever previously appear in the revenue of the department the postmaster general have extend to the post office in the large city the merit system of promotion introduce by my direction into the departments here and it have result there as in the departments in a large volume of work and that well do ever since our merchant marine be drive from the sea by the rebel cruiser during the war of the rebellion the united states have be pay an enormous annual tribute to foreign country in the shape of freight and passage money our grain and meat have be take at our own dock and our large import there lay down by foreign shipmaster an increase torrent of american travel to europe have contribute a vast sum annually to the dividend of foreign shipowner the balance of trade show by the book of our custom house have be very largely reduced and in many year altogether extinguish by this constant drain in the year 1892 only 12.3 per cent of our import be bring in american vessel these great foreign steamship maintain by our traffic be many of they under contract with their respective government by which in time of war they will become a part of their armed naval establishment profit by our commerce in peace they will become the most formidable destroyer of our commerce in time of war i have feel and have before express the feeling that this condition of thing be both intolerable and disgraceful a wholesome change of policy and one have in it much promise as it seem to i be begin by the law of march 3 1891 under this law contract have be make by the postmaster general for eleven mail route the expenditure involve by these contract for the next fiscal year approximate $ 954,123.33 as one of the result already reach sixteen american steamship of an aggregate tonnage of 57,400 ton cost $ 7,400,000 have be build or contract to be build in american shipyard the estimate tonnage of all steamship require under exist contract be 165,802 and when the full service require by these contract be establish there will be forty one mail steamer under the american flag with the probability of further necessary addition in the brazilian and argentine service the contract recently let for transatlantic service will result in the construction of five ship of 10,000 ton each cost $ 9,000,000 to $ 10,000,000 and will add with the city of new york and city of paris to which the treasury department be authorize by legislation at the last session to give american registry seven of the swift vessel upon the sea to our naval reserve the contract make with the line sail to central and south american port have increase the frequency and shorten the time of the trip add new port of call and sustain some line that otherwise would almost certainly have be withdraw the service to buenos ayres be the first to the argentine republic under the american flag the service to southampton boulogne and antwerp be also new and be to be begin with the steamship city of new york and city of paris in february next i earnestly urge the continuance of the policy inaugurate by this legislation and that the appropriation require to meet the obligation of the government under the contract may be make promptly so that the line that have enter into these engagement may not be embarrassed we have have by reason of connection with the transcontinental railway line construct through our own territory some advantage in the ocean trade of the pacific that we do not possess on the atlantic the construction of the canadian pacific railway and the establishment under large subvention from canada and england of fast steamship service from vancouver with japan and china seriously threaten our shipping interest in the pacific this line of english steamer receive as be state by the commissioner of navigation a direct subsidy of $ 400,000 annually or $ 30,767 per trip for thirteen voyage in addition to some further aid from the admiralty in connection with contract under which the vessel may be use for naval purpose the compete american pacific mail line under the act of march 3 1891 receive only $ 6,389 per round trip effort have be make within the last year as i be inform to establish under similar condition a line between vancouver and some australian port with a view of seize there a trade in which we have have a large interest the commissioner of navigation state that a very large per cent of our import from asia be now bring to we by english steamship and their connect railway in canada with a view of promote this trade especially in tea canada have impose a discriminating duty of 10 per cent upon tea and coffee bring into the dominion from the united states if this unequal contest between american line without subsidy or with diminished subsidy and the english canadian line to which i have refer be to continue i think we should at least see that the facility for custom entry and transportation across our territory be not such as to make the canadian route a favor one and that the discrimination as to duty to which i have refer be meet by a like discrimination as to the importation of these article from canada no subject i think more nearly touch the pride the power and the prosperity of our country than this of the development of our merchant marine upon the sea if we could enter into conference with other competitor and all would agree to withhold government aid we could perhaps take our chance with the rest but our great competitor have establish and maintain their line by government subsidy until they now have practically exclude we from participation in my opinion no choice be leave to we but to pursue moderately at least the same line the report of the secretary of the navy exhibit great progress in the construction of our new navy when the present secretary enter upon his duty only 3 modern steel vessel be in commission the vessel since put in commission and to be put in commission during the winter will make a total of 19 during his administration of the department during the current year 10 war vessel and 3 navy tug have be launch and during the four year 25 vessel will have be launch two other large ship and a torpedo boat be under contract and the work upon they well advanced and the 4 monitor be await only the arrival of their armor which have be unexpectedly delay or they would have be before this in commission contract have be let during this administration under the appropriation for the increase of the navy include new vessel and their appurtenance to the amount of $ 35,000,000 and there have be expend during the same period for labor at navy yard upon similar work $ 8,000,000 without the small scandal or charge of fraud or partiality the enthusiasm and interest of our naval officer both of the staff and line have be greatly kindle they have respond magnificently to the confidence of congress and have demonstrate to the world an unexcelled capacity in construction in ordnance and in everything involve in the building equipping and sailing of great war ship at the beginning of secretary tracy 's administration several difficult problem remain to be grapple with and solve before the efficiency in action of our ship could be secure it be believe that as the result of new process in the construction of armor plate our later ship will be clothe with defensive plate of high resist power than be find on any war vessel afloat we be without torpedo test have be make to ascertain the relative efficiency of different construction a torpedo have be adopt and the work of construction be now be carry on successfully we be without armor pierce shell and without a shop instruct and equip for the construction of they we be now make what be believe to be a projectile superior to any before in use a smokeless powder have be develop and a slow burn powder for gun of large caliber a high explosive capable of use in shell fire from service gun have be find and the manufacture of gun cotton have be develop so that the question of supply be no long in doubt the development of a naval militia which have be organize in eight state and bring into cordial and cooperative relation with the navy be another important achievement there be now enlist in these organization 1,800 man and they be likely to be greatly extend i recommend such legislation and appropriation as will encourage and develop this movement the recommendation of the secretary will i do not doubt receive the friendly consideration of congress for he have enjoy as he have deserve the confidence of all those interested in the development of our navy without any division upon partisan line i earnestly express the hope that a work which have make such noble progress may not now be stay the wholesome influence for peace and the increase sense of security which our citizen domicile in other land feel when these magnificent ship under the american flag appear be already most gratefully apparent the ship from our navy which will appear in the great naval parade next april in the harbor of new york will be a convincing demonstration to the world that the united states be again a naval power the work of the interior department always very burdensome have be large than ever before during the administration of secretary noble the disability pension law the taking of the eleventh census the opening of vast area of indian land to settlement the organization of oklahoma and the negotiation for the cession of indian land furnish some of the particular of the increase work and the result achieve testify to the ability fidelity and industry of the head of the department and his efficient assistant several important agreement for the cession of indian land negotiate by the commission appoint under the act of march 2 1889 be await the action of congress perhaps the most important of these be that for the cession of the cherokee strip this region have be the source of great vexation to the executive department and of great friction and unrest between the settler who desire to occupy it and the indians who assert title the agreement which have be make by the commission be perhaps the most satisfactory that could have be reach it will be notice that it be condition upon its ratification by congress before march 4 1893 the secretary of the interior who have give the subject very careful thought recommend the ratification of the agreement and i be inclined to follow his recommendation certain it be that some action by which this controversy shall be bring to an end and these land open to settlement be urgent the form of government provide by congress on may 17 1884 for alaska be in its frame and purpose temporary the increase of population and the development of some important mining and commercial interest make it imperative that the law should be revise and well provision make for the arrest and punishment of criminal the report of the secretary show a very gratifying state of fact as to the condition of the general land office the work of issue agricultural patent which seem to be hopelessly in arrear when the present secretary undertake the duty of his office have be so expedite that the bureau be now upon current business the relief thus afford to honest and worthy settler upon the public land by give to they an assured title to their entry have be of incalculable benefit in develop the new states and the territories the court of private land claims establish by congress for the promotion of this policy of speedily settle contest land title be make satisfactory progress in its work and when the work be complete a great impetus will be give to the development of those region where unsettled claim under mexican grant have so long exercise their repressive influence when to these result be add the enormous cession of indian land which have be open to settlement aggregate during this administration nearly 26,000,000 acre and the agreement negotiate and now pende in congress for ratification by which about 10,000,000 additional acre will be open to settlement it will be see how much have be accomplish the work in the indian bureau in the execution of the policy of recent legislation have be largely direct to two chief purpose first the allotment of land in severalty to the indians and the cession to the united states of the surplus land and secondly to the work of educate the indian for his own protection in his close contact with the white man and for the intelligent exercise of his new citizenship allotment have be make and patent issue to 5,900 indians under the present secretary and commissioner and 7,600 additional allotment have be make for which patent be now in process of preparation the school attendance of indian child have be increase during that time over 13 per cent the enrollment for 1892 be nearly 20,000 a uniform system of school text book and of study have be adopt and the work in these national school bring as near as may be to the basis of the free common school of the states these school can be transfer and merge into the common school system of the states when the indian have fully assume his new relation to the organize civil community in which he reside and the new states be able to assume the burden i have several time be call upon to remove indian agent appoint by i and have do so promptly upon every sustained complaint of unfitness or misconduct i believe however that the indian service at the agency have be improve and be now administer on the whole with a good degree of efficiency if any legislation be possible by which the selection of indian agent can be wholly remove from all partisan suggestion or consideration i be sure it would be a great relief to the executive and a great benefit to the service the appropriation for the subsistence of the cheyenne and arapahoe indians make at the last session of congress be inadequate this small appropriation be estimate for by the commissioner upon the theory that the large fund belong to the tribe in the public treasury could be and ought to be use for their support in view however of the pende depredation claim against this fund and other consideration the secretary of the interior on the 12th of april last submit a supplemental estimate for $ 50,000 this appropriation be not make as it should have be and the oversight ought to be remedie at the early possible date in a special message to this congress at the last session i state the reason why i have not approve the deed for the release to the united states by the choctaws and chickasaws of the land formerly embrace in the cheyenne and arapahoe reservation and remain after allotment to that tribe a resolution of the senate express the opinion of that body that notwithstanding the fact state in my special message the deed should be approve and the money $ 2,991,450 pay over be present to i may 10 1892 my special message be intend to call the attention of congress to the subject and in view of the fact that it be concede that the appropriation proceed upon a false basis as to the amount of land to be pay for and be by $ 50,000 in excess of the amount they be entitle to even if their claim to the land be give full recognition at the rate agree upon i have not feel willing to approve the deed and shall not do so at least until both houses of congress have act upon the subject it have be informally propose by the claimant to release this sum of $ 50,000 but i have no power to demand or accept such a release and such an agreement would be without consideration and void i desire far to call the attention of congress to the fact that the recent agreement conclude with the kiowas and comanches relate to land which be a part of the lease district and to which the claim of the choctaws and chickasaws be precisely that recognize by congress in the legislation i have refer to the surplus land to which this claim would attach in the kiowa and comanche reservation be 2,500,000 acre and at the same rate the government will be call upon to pay to the choctaws and chickasaws for these land $ 3,125,000 this sum will be far augment especially if the title of the indians to the tract now greet county tex be establish the duty devolve upon i in this connection be simply to pass upon the form of the deed but as in my opinion the fact mention in my special message be not adequately bring to the attention of congress in connection with the legislation i have feel that i would not be justify in act without some new expression of the legislative will the report of the commissioner of pensions to which extend notice be give by the secretary of the interior in his report will attract great attention judge by the aggregate amount of work do the last year have be the great in the history of the office i believe that the organization of the office be efficient and that the work have be do with fidelity the passage of what be know as the disability bill have as be foresee very largely increase the annual disbursement to the disabled veteran of the civil war the estimate for this fiscal year be $ 144,956,000 and that amount be appropriate a deficiency amount to $ 10,508,621 must be provide for at this session the estimate for pension for the fiscal year end june 30 1894 be $ 165,000,000 the commissioner of pensions believe that if the present legislation and method be maintain and further addition to the pension law be not make the maximum expenditure for pension will be reach june 30 1894 and will be at the high point $ 188,000,000 per annum i adhere to the view express in previous message that the care of the disabled soldier of the war of the rebellion be a matter of national concern and duty perhaps no emotion cool soon than that of gratitude but i can not believe that this process have yet reach a point with our people that would sustain the policy of remit the care of these disabled veteran to the inadequate agency provide by local law the parade on the 20th of september last upon the street of this capital of 60,000 of the survive union veteran of the war of the rebellion be a most touching and thrill episode and the rich and gracious welcome extend to they by the district of columbia and the applause that greet their progress from ten of thousand of people from all the states do much to revive the glorious recollection of the grand review when these man and many thousand other now in their grave be welcome with grateful joy as victor in a struggle in which the national unity honor and wealth be all at issue in my last annual message i call attention to the fact that some legislative action be necessary in order to protect the interest of the government in its relation with the union pacific railway the commissioner of railroads have submit a very full report give exact information as to the debt the lien upon the company 's property and its resource we must deal with the question as we find it and take that course which will under existing condition well secure the interest of the united states i recommend in my last annual message that a commission be appoint to deal with this question and i renew that recommendation and suggest that the commission be give full power the report of the secretary of agriculture contain not only a most interesting statement of the progressive and valuable work do under the administration of secretary rusk but many suggestion for the enlarged usefulness of this important department in the successful effort to break down the restriction to the free introduction of our meat product in the country of europe the secretary have be untire from the first stimulate and aid all other government officer at home and abroad whose official duty enable they to participate in the work the total trade in hog product with europe in may 1892 amount to 82,000,000 pound against 46,900,000 in the same month of 1891 in june 1892 the export aggregate 85,700,000 pound against 46,500,000 pound in the same month of the previous year in july there be an increase of 41 per cent and in august of 55 per cent over the corresponding month of 1891 over 40,000,000 pound of inspect pork have be export since the law be put into operation and a comparison of the four month of may june july and august 1892 with the same month of 1891 show an increase in the number of pound of our export of pork product of 62 per cent and an increase in value of 66 1/2 per cent the export of dress beef increase from 137,900,000 pound in 1889 to 220,500,000 pound in 1892 or about 60 per cent during the past year there have be export 394,607 head of live cattle as against 205,786 export in 1889 this increase exportation have be largely promote by the inspection authorize by law and the faithful effort of the secretary and his efficient subordinate to make that inspection thorough and to carefully exclude from all cargo disease or suspect cattle the requirement of the english regulation that live cattle arrive from the united states must be slaughter at the dock have its origin in the claim that pleuro pneumonia exist among american cattle and that the existence of the disease could only certainly be determine by a post mortem inspection the department of agriculture have labor with great energy and faithfulness to extirpate this disease and on the 26th day of september last a public announcement be make by the secretary that the disease no long exist anywhere within the united states he be entirely satisfied after the most search inquiry that this statement be justify and that by a continuance of the inspection and quarantine now require of cattle bring into this country the disease can be prevent from again get any foothold the value to the cattle industry of the united states of this achievement can hardly be estimate we can not perhaps at once insist that this evidence shall be accept as satisfactory by other country but if the present exemption from the disease be maintain and the inspection of our cattle arrive at foreign port in which our own veterinarian participate confirm it we may justly expect that the requirement that our cattle shall be slaughter at the dock will be revoke as the sanitary restriction upon our pork product have be if our cattle can be take alive to the interior the trade will be enormously increase agricultural product constitute 78.1 per cent of our unprecedented export for the fiscal year which close june 30 1892 the total export be $ 1,030,278,030 and the value of the agricultural product $ 793,717,676 which exceed by more than $ 150,000,000 the shipment of agricultural product in any previous year an interesting and a promising work for the benefit of the american farmer have be begin through agent of the agricultural department in europe and consist in effort to introduce the various product of indian corn as article of human food the high price of rye offer a favorable opportunity for the experiment in germany of combine corn meal with rye to produce a cheap bread a fair degree of success have be attain and some mill for grind corn for food have be introduce the secretary be of the opinion that this new use of the product of corn have already stimulate exportation and that if diligently prosecute large and important market can presently be open for this great american product the suggestion of the secretary for an enlargement of the work of the department be commend to your favorable consideration it may i think be say without challenge that in no corresponding period have so much be do as during the last four year for the benefit of american agriculture the subject of quarantine regulation inspection and control be bring suddenly to my attention by the arrival at our port in august last of vessel infect with cholera quarantine regulation should be uniform at all our port under the constitution they be plainly within the exclusive federal jurisdiction when and so far as congress shall legislate in my opinion the whole subject should be take into national control and adequate power give to the executive to protect our people against plague invasion on the 1st of september last i approve regulation establish a twenty day quarantine for all vessel bring immigrant from foreign port this order will be continue in force some loss and suffering have result to passenger but a due care for the home of our people justifie in such case the utmost precaution there be danger that with the coming of spring cholera will again appear and a liberal appropriation should be make at this session to enable our quarantine and port officer to exclude the deadly plague but the most careful and stringent quarantine regulation may not be sufficient absolutely to exclude the disease the progress of medical and sanitary science have be such however that if approve precaution be take at once to put all of our city and town in the good sanitary condition and provision be make for isolate any sporadic case and for a thorough disinfection an epidemic can i be sure be avoid this work appertain to the local authority and the responsibility and the penalty will be appal if it be neglect or unduly delay we be peculiarly subject in our great port to the spread of infectious disease by reason of the fact that unrestricted immigration bring to we out of european city in the overcrowded steerage of great steamship a large number of person whose surrounding make they the easy victim of the plague this consideration as well as those affect the political moral and industrial interest of our country lead i to renew the suggestion that admission to our country and to the high privilege of its citizenship should be more restricted and more careful we have i think a right and owe a duty to our own people and especially to our work people not only to keep out the vicious the ignorant the civil disturber the pauper and the contract laborer but to check the too great flow of immigration now come by further limitation the report of the world 's columbian exposition have not yet be submit that of the board of management of the government exhibit have be receive and be herewith transmit the work of construction and of preparation for the opening of the exposition in may next have progress most satisfactorily and upon a scale of liberality and magnificence that will worthily sustain the honor of the united states the district of columbia be leave by a decision of the supreme court of the district without any law regulate the liquor traffic an old statute of the legislature of the district relate to the licensing of various vocation have hitherto be treat by the commissioners as give they power to grant or refuse license to sell intoxicate liquor and as subject those who sell without license to penalty but in may last the supreme court of the district hold against this view of the power of the commissioners it be of urgent importance therefore that congress should supply either by direct enactment or by confer discretionary power upon the commissioners proper limitation and restraint upon the liquor traffic in the district the district have suffer in its reputation by many crime of violence a large per cent of they result from drunkenness and the liquor traffic the capital of the nation should be free from this reproach by the enactment of stringent restriction and limitation upon the traffic in renew the recommendation which i have make in three precede annual message that congress should legislate for the protection of railroad employee against the danger incident to the old and inadequate method of brake and coupling which be still in use upon freight train i do so with the hope that this congress may take action upon the subject statistic furnish by the interstate commerce commission show that during the year end june 30 1891 there be forty seven different style of car coupler report to be in use and that during the same period there be 2,660

 there never have be a time in our history when work be so abundant or when wage be as high whether measure by the currency in which they be pay or by their power to supply the necessary and comfort of life it be true that the market price of cotton and wheat have be low it be one of the unfavorable incident of agriculture that the farmer can not produce upon order he must sow and reap in ignorance of the aggregate production of the year and be peculiarly subject to the depreciation which follow overproduction but while the fact i have state be true as to the crop mention the general average of price have be such as to give to agriculture a fair participation in the general prosperity the value of our total farm product have increase from $ 1,363,646,866 in 1860 to $ 4,500,000,000 in 1891 as estimate by statistician an increase of 230 per cent the number of hog january 1 1891 be 50,625,106 and their value $ 210,193,925 on january 1 1892 the number be 52,398,019 and the value $ 241,031,415 on january 1 1891 the number of cattle be 36,875,648 and the value $ 544,127,908 on january 1 1892 the number be 37,651,239 and the value $ 570,749,155

 i believe that the protective system which have now for something more than thirty year continuously prevail in our legislation have be a mighty instrument for the development of our national wealth and a most powerful agency in protect the home of our workingman from the invasion of want i have feel a most solicitous interest to preserve to our work people rate of wage that would not only give daily bread but supply a comfortable margin for those home attraction and family comfort and enjoyment without which life be neither hopeful nor sweet they be american citizen a part of the great people for whom our constitution and government be frame and institute and it can not be a perversion of that constitution to so legislate as to preserve in their home the comfort independence loyalty and sense of interest in the government which be essential to good citizenship in peace and which will bring this stalwart throng as in 1861 to the defense of the flag when it be assail
 it be not my purpose to renew here the argument in favor of a protective tariff the result of the recent election must be accept as having introduce a new policy we must assume that the present tariff construct upon the line of protection be to be repeal and that there be to be substitute for it a tariff law construct solely with reference to revenue that no duty be to be high because the increase will keep open an american mill or keep up the wage of an american workman but that in every case such a rate of duty be to be impose as will bring to the treasury of the united states the large return of revenue the contention have not be between schedule but between principle and it would be offensive to suggest that the prevail party will not carry into legislation the principle advocate by it and the pledge give to the people the tariff bill pass by the house of representatives at the last session be as i suppose even in the opinion of their promoter inadequate and justify only by the fact that the senate and house of representatives be not in accord and that a general revision could not therefore be undertake
 i recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be leave to the incoming congress it be matter of regret that this work must be delay for at least three month for the threat of great tariff change introduce so much uncertainty that an amount not easily estimate of business inaction and of diminished production will necessarily result it be possible also that this uncertainty may result in decrease revenue from custom duty for our merchant will make cautious order for foreign good in view of the prospect of tariff reduction and the uncertainty as to when they will take effect those who have advocate a protective tariff can well afford to have their disastrous forecast of a change of policy disappoint if a system of custom duty can be frame that will set the idle wheel and loom of europe in motion and crowd our warehouse with foreign make good and at the same time keep our own mill busy that will give we an increase participation in the market of the world of great value than the home market we surrender that will give increase work to foreign workman upon product to be consume by our people without diminish the amount of work to be do here that will enable the american manufacturer to pay to his workman from 50 to 100 per cent more in wage than be pay in the foreign mill and yet to compete in our market and in foreign market with the foreign producer that will far reduce the cost of article of wear and food without reduce the wage of those who produce they that can be celebrate after its effect have be realize as its expectation have be in european as well as in american city the author and promoter of it will be entitle to the high praise we have have in our history several experience of the contrast effect of a revenue and of a protective tariff but this generation have not feel they and the experience of one generation be not highly instructive to the next the friend of the protective system with undiminished confidence in the principle they have advocate will await the result of the new experiment
 the strained and too often disturb relation exist between the employee and the employer in our great manufacturing establishment have not be favorable to a calm consideration by the wage earner of the effect upon wage of the protective system the fact that his wage be the highest pay in like calling in the world and that a maintenance of this rate of wage in the absence of protective duty upon the product of his labor be impossible be obscure by the passion evoke by these contest he may now be able to review the question in the light of his personal experience under the operation of a tariff for revenue only if that experience shall demonstrate that present rate of wage be thereby maintain or increase either absolutely or in their purchasing power and that the aggregate volume of work to be do in this country be increase or even maintain so that there be more or as many days&#39 work in a year at as good or well wage for the american workman as have be the case under the protective system everyone will rejoice a general process of wage reduction can not be contemplate by any patriotic citizen without the grave apprehension it may be indeed i believe be possible for the american manufacturer to compete successfully with his foreign rival in many branch of production without the defense of protective duty if the pay roll be equalize but the conflict that stand between the producer and that result and the distress of our work people when it be attain be not pleasant to contemplate the society of the unemployed now hold its frequent and threatening parade in the street of foreign city should not be allow to acquire an american domicile

 but the most careful and stringent quarantine regulation may not be sufficient absolutely to exclude the disease the progress of medical and sanitary science have be such however that if approve precaution be take at once to put all of our city and town in the good sanitary condition and provision be make for isolate any sporadic case and for a thorough disinfection an epidemic can i be sure be avoid this work appertain to the local authority and the responsibility and the penalty will be appal if it be neglect or unduly delay

 it be time that mutual charge of unfairness and fraud between the great party should cease and that the sincerity of those who profess a desire for pure and honest election should be bring to the test of their willingness to free our legislation and our election method from everything that tend to impair the public confidence in the announce result the necessity for an inquiry and for legislation by congress upon this subject be emphasize by the fact that the tendency of the legislation in some states in recent year have in some important particular be away from and not toward free and fair election and equal apportionment be it not time that we should come together upon the high plane of patriotism while we devise method that shall secure the right of every man qualify by law to cast a free ballot and give to every such ballot an equal value in choose our public officer and in direct the policy of the government

to the senate
 i transmit herewith with a view to its ratification a treaty of annexation conclude on the 14th day of february 1893 between john w. foster secretary of state who be duly empower to act in that behalf on the part of the united states and lorin a. thurston w. r. castle w. c. wilder c. l. carlet and joseph marsden the commissioner on the part of the government of the hawaiian islands the provisional treaty it will be observe do not attempt to deal in detail with the question that grow out of the annexation of the hawaiian islands to the united states the commissioner represent the hawaiian government have consent to leave to the future and to the just and benevolent purpose of the united states the adjustment of all such question
 i do not deem it necessary to discuss at any length the condition which have result in this decisive action it have be the policy of the administration not only to respect but to encourage the continuance of an independent government in the hawaiian islands so long as it afford suitable guaranty for the protection of life and property and maintain a stability and strength that give adequate security against the domination of any other power the moral support of this government have continually manifest itself in the most friendly diplomatic relation and in many act of courtesy to the hawaiian ruler
 the overthrow of the monarchy be not in any way promote by this government but have its origin in what seem to have be a reactionary and revolutionary policy on the part of queen liliuokalani which put in serious peril not only the large and preponderate interest of the united states in the island but all foreign interest and indeed the decent administration of civil affair and the peace of the island it be quite evident that the monarchy have become effete and the queen&#39;s government so weak and inadequate as to be the prey of design and unscrupulous person the restoration of queen liliuokalani to her throne be undesirable if not impossible and unless actively support by the united states would be accompany by serious disaster and the disorganization of all business interest the influence and interest of the united states in the island must be increase and not diminish
 only two course be now open one the establishment of a protectorate by the united states and the other annexation full and complete i think the latter course which have be adopt in the treaty will be highly promotive of the good interest of the hawaiian people and be the only one that will adequately secure the interest of the united states these interest be not wholly selfish it be essential that none of the other great power shall secure these island such a possession would not consist with our safety and with the peace of the world this view of the situation be so apparent and conclusive that no protest have be hear from any government against proceeding look to annexation every foreign representative at honolulu promptly acknowledge the provisional government and i think there be a general concurrence in the opinion that the deposed queen ought not to be restore
 prompt action upon this treaty be very desirable if it meet the approval of the senate peace and good order will be secure in the island under exist law until such time as congress can provide by legislation a permanent from of government for the island this legislation should be and i do not doubt will be not only just to the native and all other resident and citizen of the island but should be characterize by great liberality and a high regard to the right of all people and of all foreigner domicile there the correspondence which accompany the treaty will put the senate in possession of all the fact know to the executive

my fellow citizens in obedience of the mandate of my countryman i be about to dedicatemyself to their service under the sanction of a solemn oath deeply movedby the expression of confidence and personal attachment which have calledme to this service i be sure my gratitude can make no well return thanthe pledge i now give before god and these witness of unreserved andcomplete devotion to the interest and welfare of those who have honoredme i deem it fitting on this occasion while indicate the opinion i holdconcerne public question of present importance to also briefly referto the existence of certain condition and tendency among our peoplewhich seem to menace the integrity and usefulness of their government while every american citizen must contemplate with the utmost prideand enthusiasm the growth and expansion of our country the sufficiencyof our institution to stand against the rude shock of violence thewonderful thrift and enterprise of our people and the demonstrate superiorityof our free government it behoove we to constantly watch for every symptomof insidious infirmity that threaten our national vigor the strong man who in the confidence of sturdy health court the sternestactivitie of life and rejoice in the hardihood of constant labor maystill have lurk near his vital the unheeded disease that doom himto sudden collapse it can not be doubt that our stupendous achievement as a people andour country 's robust strength have give rise to heedlessness of thoselaw govern our national health which we can no more evade than humanlife can escape the law of god and nature manifestly nothing be more vital to our supremacy as a nation and tothe beneficent purpose of our government than a sound and stable currency its exposure to degradation should at once arouse to activity the mostenlightened statesmanship and the danger of depreciation in the purchasingpower of the wage pay to toil should furnish the strong incentiveto prompt and conservative precaution in deal with our present embarrassing situation as relate to thissubject we will be wise if we temper our confidence and faith in our nationalstrength and resource with the frank concession that even these will notpermit we to defy with impunity the inexorable law of finance and trade at the same time in our effort to adjust difference of opinion we shouldbe free from intolerance or passion and our judgment should be unmovedby alluring phrase and unvexed by selfish interest i be confident that such an approach to the subject will result in prudentand effective remedial legislation in the meantime so far as the executivebranch of the government can intervene none of the power with which itis invest will be withhold when their exercise be deem necessary tomaintain our national credit or avert financial disaster closely related to the exaggerated confidence in our country 's greatnesswhich tend to a disregard of the rule of national safety another dangerconfront we not less serious i refer to the prevalence of a popular dispositionto expect from the operation of the government especial and direct individualadvantage the verdict of our voter which condemn the injustice of maintainingprotection for protection 's sake enjoin upon the people 's servant theduty of expose and destroy the brood of kindre evil which be theunwholesome progeny of paternalism this be the bane of republican institutionsand the constant peril of our government by the people it degrade tothe purpose of wily craft the plan of rule our father establish andbequeathe to we as an object of our love and veneration it pervert thepatriotic sentiment of our countryman and tempt they to pitiful calculationof the sordid gain to be derive from their government 's maintenance itundermines the self reliance of our people and substitute in its placedependence upon governmental favoritism it stifle the spirit of trueamericanism and stupefie every ennoble trait of american citizenship the lesson of paternalism ought to be unlearn and the well lessontaught that while the people should patriotically and cheerfully supporttheir government its function do not include the support of the people the acceptance of this principle lead to a refusal of bounty andsubsidie which burden the labor and thrift of a portion of our citizensto aid ill advise or languish enterprise in which they have no concern it lead also to a challenge of wild and reckless pension expenditure which overleap the bound of grateful recognition of patriotic serviceand prostitute to vicious use the people 's prompt and generous impulseto aid those disabled in their country 's defense every thoughtful american must realize the importance of checking atit begin any tendency in public or private station to regard frugalityand economy as virtue which we may safely outgrow the toleration of thisidea result in the waste of the people 's money by their choose servantsand encourage prodigality and extravagance in the home life of our countryman under our scheme of government the waste of public money be a crimeagainst the citizen and the contempt of our people for economy and frugalityin their personal affair deplorably sap the strength and sturdiness ofour national character it be a plain dictate of honesty and good government that public expendituresshould be limit by public necessity and that this should be measuredby the rule of strict economy and it be equally clear that frugalityamong the people be the good guaranty of a contented and strong supportof free institution one mode of the misappropriation of public fund be avoid when appointmentsto office instead of be the reward of partisan activity be awardedto those whose efficiency promise a fair return of work for the compensationpaid to they to secure the fitness and competency of appointee to officeand remove from political action the demoralize madness for spoil civil service reform have find a place in our public policy and law the benefitsalready gain through this instrumentality and the further usefulnessit promise entitle it to the hearty support and encouragement of all whodesire to see our public service well perform or who hope for the elevationof political sentiment and the purification of political method the existence of immense aggregation of kindre enterprise and combinationsof business interest form for the purpose of limit production andfixe price be inconsistent with the fair field which ought to be opento every independent activity legitimate strife in business should notbe supersede by an enforce concession to the demand of combinationsthat have the power to destroy nor should the people to be serve losethe benefit of cheapness which usually result from wholesome competition these aggregation and combination frequently constitute conspiraciesagainst the interest of the people and in all their phase they be unnaturaland oppose to our american sense of fairness to the extent that theycan be reach and restrain by federal power the general government shouldrelieve our citizen from their interference and exaction loyalty to the principle upon which our

uponus responsibility we can not escape humanity and consistency requireus to treat they with forbearance and in our dealing with they to honestlyand considerately regard their right and interest every effort shouldbe make to lead they through the path of civilization and education to self- support and independent citizenship in the meantime as thenation 's ward they should be promptly defend against the cupidity ofdesigne man and shield from every influence or temptation that retardstheir advancement the people of the united states have decree that on this day the controlof their government in its legislative and executive branch shall begiven to a political party pledge in the most positive term to the accomplishmentof tariff reform they have thus determine in favor of a more just andequitable system of federal taxation the agent they have choose to carryout their purpose be bind by their promise not less than by the commandof their master to devote themselves unremittingly to this service while there should be no surrender of principle our task must be undertakenwisely and without heedless vindictiveness our mission be not punishment but the rectification of wrong if in lift burden from the daily lifeof our people we reduce inordinate and unequal advantage too long enjoy this be but a necessary incident of our return to right and justice ifwe exact from unwilling mind acquiescence in the theory of an honest distributionof the fund of the governmental beneficence treasure up for all we butinsist upon a principle which underlie our free institution when wetear aside the delusion and misconception which have blind our countrymento their condition under vicious tariff law we but show they how farthey have be lead away from the path of contentment and prosperity whenwe proclaim that the necessity for revenue to support the government furnishesthe only justification for tax the people we announce a truth so plainthat its denial would seem to indicate the extent to which judgment maybe influence by familiarity with perversion of the tax power andwhen we seek to reinstate the self confidence and business enterprise ofour citizen by discredit an abject dependence upon governmental favor we strive to stimulate those element of american character which supportthe hope of american achievement anxiety for the redemption of the pledge which my party have make andsolicitude for the complete justification of the trust the people haverepose in we constrain i to remind those with whom i be to cooperatethat we can succeed in do the work which have be especially set beforeus only by the most sincere harmonious and disinterested effort evenif insuperable obstacle and opposition prevent the consummation of ourtask we shall hardly be excuse and if failure can be trace to our faultor neglect we may be sure the people will hold we to a swift and exactingaccountability the oath i now take to preserve protect and defend the

shall to the good of myability and within my sphere of duty preserve the constitution by loyallyprotecte every grant of federal power it contain by defend all itsrestraint when attack by impatience and restlessness and by enforcingit limitation and reservation in favor of the states and the people fully impress with the gravity of the duty that confront i andmindful of my weakness i should be appal if it be my lot to bearunaided the responsibility which await i i be however save fromdiscouragement when i remember that i shall have the support and the counseland cooperation of wise and patriotic man who will stand at my side incabinet place or will represent the people in their legislative hall i find also much comfort in remember that my countryman be justand generous and in the assurance that they will not condemn those whoby sincere devotion to their service deserve their forbearance and approval above all i know there be a supreme being who rule the affair ofman and whose goodness and mercy have always follow the american people and i know he will not turn from we now if we humbly and reverently seekhis powerful aid
to the congress of the united states the existence of an alarming and extraordinary business situation involve the welfare and prosperity of all our people have constrain i to call together in extra session the people 's representative in congress to the end that through a wise and patriotic exercise of the legislative duty with which they solely be charge present evil may be mitigate and danger threaten the future may be avert our unfortunate financial plight be not the result of untoward event nor of condition relate to our natural resource nor be it traceable to any of the affliction which frequently check national growth and prosperity with plenteous crop with abundant promise of remunerative production and manufacture with unusual invitation to safe investment and with satisfactory assurance to business enterprise suddenly financial distrust and fear have spring up on every side numerous moneyed institution have suspend because abundant asset be not immediately available to meet the demand of frightened depositor survive corporation and individual be content to keep in hand the money they be usually anxious to loan and those engage in legitimate business be surprised to find that the security they offer for loan though heretofore satisfactory be no long accept value suppose to be fix be fast become conjectural and loss and failure have invade every branch of business i believe these thing be principally chargeable to congressional legislation touch the purchase and coinage of silver by the general government this legislation be embody in a statute pass on the 14th day of july 1890 which be the culmination of much agitation on the subject involve and which may be consider a truce after a long struggle between the advocate of free silver coinage and those intend to be more conservative undoubtedly the monthly purchase by the government of 4,500,000 ounce of silver enforce under that statute be regard by those interested in silver production as a certain guaranty of its increase in price the result however have be entirely different for immediately follow a spasmodic and slight rise the price of silver begin to fall after the passage of the act and have since reach the low point ever know this disappointing result have lead to renew and persistent effort in the direction of free silver coinage meanwhile not only be the evil effect of the operation of the present law constantly accumulate but the result to which its execution must inevitably lead be become palpable to all who give the least heed to financial subject this law provide that in payment for the 4,500,000 ounce of silver bullion which the secretary of the treasury be command to purchase monthly there shall be issue treasury note redeemable on demand in gold or silver coin at the discretion of the secretary of the treasury and that say note may be reissue it be however declare in the act to be the establish policy of the united states to maintain the two metal on a parity with each other upon the present legal ratio or such ratio as may be provide by law this declaration so control the action of the secretary of the treasury as to prevent his exercise the discretion nominally vest in he if by such action the parity between gold and silver may be disturb manifestly a refusal by the secretary to pay these treasury note in gold if demand would necessarily result in their discredit and depreciation as obligation payable only in silver and would destroy the parity between the two metal by establish a discrimination in favor of gold up to the 15th day of july 1893 these note have be issue in payment of silver bullion purchase to the amount of more than $ 147,000,000 while all but a very small quantity of this bullion remain uncoined and without usefulness in the treasury many of the note give in its purchase have be pay in gold this be illustrate by the statement that between the 1st day of may 1892 and the 15th day of july 1893 the note of this kind issue in payment for silver bullion amount to a little more than $ 54,000,000 and that during the same period about $ 49,000,000 be pay by the treasury in gold for the redemption of such note the policy necessarily adopt of pay these note in gold have not spare the gold reserve of $ 100,000,000 long ago set aside by the government for the redemption of other note for this fund have already be subject to the payment of new obligation amount to about $ 150,000,000 on account of silver purchase and have as a consequence for the first time since its creation be encroach upon we have thus make the depletion of our gold easy and have tempt other and more appreciative nation to add it to their stock that the opportunity we have offer have not be neglect be show by the large amount of gold which have be recently draw from our treasury and export to increase the financial strength of foreign nation the excess of export of gold over its import for the year end june 30 1893 amount to more than $ 87,500,000.between the 1st day of july 1890 and the 15th day of july 1893 the gold coin and bullion in our treasury decrease more than $ 132,000,000 while during the same period the silver coin and bullion in the treasury increase more than $ 147,000,000 unless government bond be to be constantly issue and sell to replenish our exhausted gold only to be again exhaust it be apparent that the operation of the silver purchase law now in force lead in the direction of the entire substitution of silver for the gold in the government treasury and that this must be follow by the payment of all government obligation in depreciate silver at this stage gold and silver must part company and the government must fail in its establish policy to maintain the two metal on a parity with each other give over to the exclusive use of a currency greatly depreciate accord to the standard of the commercial world we could no long claim a place among nation of the first class nor could our government claim a performance of its obligation so far as such an obligation have be impose upon it to provide for the use of the people the good and safest money if as many of its friend claim silver ought to occupy a large place in our currency and the currency of the world through general international cooperation and agreement it be obvious that the united states will not be in a position to gain a hearing in favor of such an arrangement so long as we be willing to continue our attempt to accomplish the result single handed the knowledge in business circle among our own people that our government can not make its fiat equivalent to intrinsic value nor keep inferior money on a parity with superior money by its own independent effort have result in such a lack of confidence at home in the stability of currency value that capital refuse its aid to new enterprise while million be actually withdraw from the channel of trade and commerce to become idle and unproductive in the hand of timid owner foreign investor equally alert not only decline to purchase american security but make haste to sacrifice those which they already have it do not meet the situation to say that apprehension in regard to the future of our finance be groundless and that there be no reason for lack of confidence in the purpose or power of the government in the premise the very existence of this apprehension and lack of confidence however cause be a menace which ought not for a moment to be disregard possibly if the undertaking we have in hand be the maintenance of a specific know quantity of silver at a parity with gold our ability to do so might be estimate and gauge and perhaps in view of our unparalleled growth and resource might be favorably pass upon but when our avowed endeavor be to maintain such parity in regard to an amount of silver increase at the rate of $ 50,000,000 yearly with no fixed termination to such increase it can hardly be say that a problem be present whose solution be free from doubt the people of the united states be entitle to a sound and stable currency and to money recognize as such on every exchange and in every market of the world their government have no right to injure they by financial experiment oppose to the policy and practice of other civilized state nor be it justify in permit an exaggerated and unreasonable reliance on our national strength and ability to jeopardize the soundness of the people 's money this matter rise above the plane of party politic it vitally concern every business and calling and enter every household in the land there be one important aspect of the subject which especially should never be overlook at time like the present when the evil of unsound finance threaten we the speculator may anticipate a harvest gather from the misfortune of other the capitalist may protect himself by hoarding or may even find profit in the fluctuation of value but the wage earner the first to be injure by a depreciate currency and the last to receive the benefit of its correction be practically defenseless he rely for work upon the venture of confident and contented capital this fail he his condition be without alleviation for he can neither prey on the misfortune of other nor hoard his labor one of the great statesman our country have know speak more than fifty year ago when a derangement of the currency have cause commercial distress say the very man of all other who have the deep interest in a sound currency and who suffer most by mischievous legislation in money matter be the man who earn his daily bread by his daily toil these word be as pertinent now as on the day they be utter and ought to impressively remind we that a failure in the discharge of our duty at this time must especially injure those of our countryman who labor and who because of their number and condition be entitle to the most watchful care of their government it be of the utmost importance that such relief as congress can afford in the exist situation be afford at once the maxim he give twice who give quickly be directly applicable it may be true that the embarrassment from which the business of the country be suffer arise as much from evil apprehend as from those actually exist we may hope too that calm counsel will prevail and that neither the capitalist nor the wage earner will give way to unreasone panic and sacrifice their property or their interest under the influence of exaggerated fear nevertheless every day 's delay in remove one of the plain and principal cause of the present state of thing enlarge the mischief already do and increase the responsibility of the government for its existence whatever else the people have a right to expect from congress they may certainly demand that legislation condemn by the ordeal of three year disastrous experience shall be remove from the statute book as soon as their representative can legitimately deal with it it be my purpose to summon congress in special session early in the come september that we might enter promptly upon the work of tariff reform which the true interest of the country clearly demand which so large a majority of the people as show by their suffrage desire and expect and to the accomplishment of which every effort of the present administration be pledge but while tariff reform have lose nothing of its immediate and permanent importance and must in the near future engage the attention of congress it have seem to i that the financial condition of the country should at once and before all other subject be consider by your honorable body i earnestly recommend the prompt repeal of the provision of the act pass july 14 1890 authorize the purchase of silver bullion and that other legislative action may put beyond all doubt or mistake the intention and the ability of the government to fulfill its pecuniary obligation in money universally recognize by all civilized country
to the congress of the united states

 we have thus make the depletion of our gold easy and have tempt other and more appreciative nation to add it to their stock that the opportunity we have offer have not be neglect be show by the large amount of gold which have be recently draw from our treasury and export to increase the financial strength of foreign nation the excess of export of gold over its import for the year end june 30 1893 amount to more than $ 87,500,000
 between the 1st day of july 1890 and the 15th day of july 1893 the gold coin and bullion in our treasury decrease more than $ 132,000,000 while during the same period the silver coin and bullion in the treasury increase more than $ 147,000,000 unless government bond be to be constantly issue and sell to replenish our exhausted gold only to be again exhaust it be apparent that the operation of the silver purchase law now in force lead in the direction of the entire substitution of silver for the gold in the government treasury and that this must be follow by the payment of all government obligation in depreciate silver
 at this stage gold and silver must part company and the government must fail in its establish policy to maintain the two metal on a parity with each other give over to the exclusive use of a currency greatly depreciate accord to the standard of the commercial world we could no long claim a place among nation of the first class nor could our government claim a performance of its obligation so far as such an obligation have be impose upon it to provide for the use of the people the good and safest money
 if as many of its friend claim silver ought to occupy a large place in our currency and the currency of the world through general international cooperation and agreement it be obvious that the united states will not be in a position to gain a hearing in favor of such an arrangement so long as we be willing to continue our attempt to accomplish the result single handed
 the knowledge in business circle among our own people that our government can not make its fiat equivalent to intrinsic value nor keep inferior money on a parity with superior money by its own independent effort have result in such a lack of confidence at home in the stability of currency value that capital refuse its aid to new enterprise while million be actually withdraw from the channel of trade and commerce to become idle and unproductive in the hand of timid owner foreign investor equally alert not only decline to purchase american security but make haste to sacrifice those which they already have
 it do not meet the situation to say that apprehension in regard to the future of our finance be groundless and that there be no reason for lack of confidence in the purpose or power of the government in the premise the very existence of this apprehension and lack of confidence however cause be a menace which ought not for a moment to be disregard possibly if the undertaking we have in hand be the maintenance of a specific know quantity of silver at a parity with gold our ability to do so might be estimate and gauge and perhaps in view of our unparalleled growth and resource might be favorably pass upon but when our avowed endeavor be to maintain such parity in regard to an amount of silver increase at the rate of $ 50,000,000 yearly with no fixed termination to such increase it can hardly be say that a problem be present whose solution be free from doubt
 the people of the united states be entitle to a sound and stable currency and to money recognize as such on every exchange and in every market of the world their government have no right to injure they by financial experiment oppose to the policy and practice of other civilized state nor be it justify in permit an exaggerated and unreasonable reliance on our national strength and ability to jeopardize the soundness of the people&#39; money
 this matter rise above the plane of party politic it vitally concern every business and calling and enter every household in the land there be one important aspect of the subject which especially should never be overlook at time like the present when the evil of unsound finance threaten we the speculator may anticipate a harvest gather from the misfortune of other the capitalist may protect himself by hoarding or may even find profit in the fluctuation of value but the wage earner the first to be injure by a depreciate currency and the last to receive the benefit of its correction be practically defenseless he rely for work upon the venture of confident and contented capital this fail he his condition be without alleviation for he can neither prey on the misfortune of other nor hoard his labor one of the great statesman our country have know speak more than fifty year ago when a derangement of the currency have cause commercial distress say
 the very man of all other who have the deep interest in a sound currency and who suffer most by mischievous legislation in money matter be the man who earn his daily bread by his daily toil
 these word be as pertinent now as on the day they be utter and ought to impressively remind we that a failure in the discharge of our duty at this time must especially injure those of our countryman who labor and who because of their number and condition be entitle to the most watchful care of their government
 it be of the utmost importance that such relief as congress can afford in the exist situation be afford at once the maxim he give twice who give quickly be directly applicable it may be true that the embarrassment from which the business of the country be suffer arise as much from evil apprehend as from those actually exist we may hope too that calm counsel will prevail and that neither the capitalist nor the wage earner will give way to unreasone panic and sacrifice their property or their interest under the influence of exaggerated fear nevertheless every day&#39;s delay in remove one of the plain and principal cause of the present state of thing enlarge the mischief already do and increase the responsibility of the government for its existence whatever else the people have a right to expect from congress they may certainly demand that legislation condemn by the ordeal of three years&#39 disastrous experience shall be remove from the statute book as soon as their representative can legitimately deal with it
 it be my purpose to summon congress in special session early in the come september that we might enter promptly upon the work of tariff reform which the true interest of the country clearly demand which so large a majority of the people as show by their suffrage desire and expect and to the accomplishment of which every effort of the present administration be pledge but while tariff reform have lose nothing of its immediate and permanent importance and must in the near future engage the attention of congress it have seem to i that the financial condition of the country should at once and before all other subject be consider by your honorable body
 i earnestly recommend the prompt repeal of the provision of the act pass july 14 1890 authorize the purchase of silver bullion and that other legislative action may put beyond all doubt or mistake the intention and the ability of the government to fulfill its pecuniary obligation in money universally recognize by all civilized country

to the congress of the united states the constitutional duty which require the president from time to time to give to the congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient be fittingly enter upon by commend to the congress a careful examination of the detailed statement and well support recommendation

in behalf of their respective government the outbreak of domestic hostility in the republic of brazil find the united states alert to watch the interest of our citizen in that country with which we carry on important commerce several vessel of our new navy be now and for some time have be station at rio de janeiro the struggle be between the established government which control the machinery of administration and with which we maintain friendly relation and certain officer of the navy employ the vessel of their command in an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport and lack as it do the element of divided administration i have fail to see that the insurgent can reasonably claim recognition as belligerent thus far the position of our government have be that of an attentive but impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict emphasize our fix policy of impartial neutrality in such a condition of affair as now exist i deem it necessary to disavow in a manner not to be misunderstood the unauthorized action of our late naval commander in those water in salute the revolted brazilian admiral be indispose to countenance an act calculate to give gratuitous sanction to the local insurrection the convention between our government and chile have for its object the settlement and adjustment of the demand of the two country against each other have be make effective by

habeas corpus be bring before the supreme court and on may 15 1893 a decision be make by that tribunal sustain the law it be believe that under the recent amendment of the act extend the time for registration the chinese laborer thereto entitled who desire to reside in this country will now avail themselves of the renew privilege thus afford of establish by lawful procedure their right to remain and that thereby the necessity of enforce deportation may to a great degree be avoid it have devolve upon the united states minister at peking as dean of the diplomatic body and in the absence

sell arm and ammunition to the native and for the confiscation of the inhibited article it be the plain duty of this government to aid in suppress the nefarious traffic impair as it do the

lately testify its friendliness by surrender to the united states in the absence of a convention of extradition but upon duly submit evidence of criminality a note fugitive from justice it be trust that the negotiation of a treaty with that country to meet recur case of this kind will soon be accomplish in my opinion treaty for reciprocal extradition should be conclude with all those country with which the united states have not already conventional arrangement of that character i have deem it fitting to express to the government of costa rica and colombia the kindly desire of the united

make an entire change in the complexion of our currency affair i do not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching in the nature of thing however it be impossible to know at this time precisely what condition will be bring about by the change or what if any supplementary legislation may in the light of such condition appear to be essential or expedient of course after the recent financial perturbation time be necessary for the reestablishment of business confidence when however through this restore confidence the money which have be frighten into hoarding place be return to trade and enterprise a survey of the situation will probably disclose a safe path lead to a permanently sound currency abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our increase population and business in the pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedient determine to be content with nothing less than a

everywhere and constantly operate by preventive mean to shield our country from the invasion of disease and at the same time have due regard to the right and duty of local agency would i believe add greatly to the safety of our people the secretary of war report that the strength of the army on the 30th day of september last be 25,778 enlisted man and 2,144 officer the total expenditure of the department for the year end june 30 1893 amount to $ 51,966,074.89 of this sum $ 1,992,581.95 be for salary and contingent expense $ 23,377,828.35 for the support of the military establishment $ 6,077,033.18 for miscellaneous object and 518,631.41 for public work this latter sum include $ 15,296,876.46 for river and harbor improvement and $ 3,266,141.20 for fortification and other work of

instruction of this reserve of our military force report that increase interest and mark progress be apparent in the discipline and efficiency of the organization neither indian outbreak nor domestic violence have call the army into service during the year and the only active military duty require of it have be in the department of texas where violation of the neutrality law of the united states and mexico be promptly and efficiently deal with by the troop elicit the warm approval of the civil and military authority of both country the operation of wise law and the influence of civilization constantly tend to relieve the country from the danger of indian hostility together with the increase ability of the states through the efficiency of the national guard organization to protect their citizen from domestic violence lead to the suggestion that the time be fast approach when there should be a reorganization of our army on the line of the present necessity of the country this change contemplate neither increase in number nor add expense but a redistribution of the force and an encouragement of measure tend to great efficiency among the man and improvement of the service the adoption of battalion formation for infantry regiment the strengthening of the artillery force the abandonment of small and unnecessary post and the massing of the troop at important and accessible station all promise to promote the usefulness of the army in the judgment of army officer with but few exception the operation of the law forbid the reenlistment of man after ten year service have not prove its wisdom and while the argument that lead to its adoption be not without merit the experience of the year constrain i to join in the recommendation for its repeal it be gratify to note that we have begin to attain complete result in the comprehensive scheme of seacoast defense and fortification enter upon eight year ago a large sum have be already expend but the cost of maintenance will be inconsiderable as compare with the expense of construction and ordnance at the end of the current calendar year the war department will have nine 12 inch gun twenty 10 inch and thirty four 8 inch gun ready to be mount on gun lift and carriage and seventy five 12 inch mortar in addition to the product of the army gun factory now complete at watervliet the government have contract with private party for the purchase of one hundred gun of these caliber the first of which should be deliver to the department for test before july 1 1894.the manufacture of heavy ordnance keep pace with current need but to render these gun available for the purpose they be design to meet emplacement must be prepare for they progress have be make in this direction and it be desirable that congress by adequate appropriation should provide for the uninterrupted prosecution of this necessary work after much preliminary work and exhaustive examination in accordance with the requirement of the law the board appoint to select a magazine rifle of modern type with which to replace the obsolete springfield rifle of the infantry service complete its labor during the last year and the work of manufacture be now in progress at the national armory at springfield it be confidently expect that by the end of the current year our infantry will be supply with a weapon equal to that of the most progressive army of the world the work on the project chickamauga and chattanooga national military park have be prosecute with zeal and judgment and its opening will be celebrate during the come year over 9 square mile of the chickamauga battlefield have be acquire 25 mile of roadway have be construct and permanent tablet have be place at many historical point while the invitation to the states to mark the position of their troop participate in the battle have be very generally accept the work of locate and preserve the line of battle at the gettysburg battlefield be make satisfactory progress on the plan direct by the last congress the report of the military academy at west point and the several school for special instruction of officer show mark advance in the education of the army and a commendable ambition among its officer to excel in the military profession and to fit themselves for the high service to the country under the supervision of adjutant general robert williams lately retire the bureau of military information have become well establish and be perform a service that will put in possession of the government in time of war most valuable information and at all time serve a purpose of great utility in keep the army advise of the world 's progress in all matter pertain to the art of war the report of the attorney general contain the usual summary of the affair and proceeding of the department of justice for the past year together with certain recommendation as to need legislation on various subject i can not too heartily indorse the proposition that the fee system as applicable to the compensation of united states attorney marshal clerk of federal court and united states commissioner should be abolish with as little delay as possible it be clearly in the interest of the community that the business of the court both civil and criminal shall be as small and as inexpensively transact as the end of justice will allow the system be therefore thoroughly vicious which make the compensation of court official depend upon the volume of such business and thus create a conflict between a proper execution of the law and private gain which can not fail to be dangerous to the right and freedom of the citizen and an irresistible temptation to the unjustifiable expenditure of public fund if in addition to this reform another be inaugurate which would give to united states commissioner the final disposition of petty offense within the grade of misdemeanor especially those come under the internal revenue law a great advance would be make toward a more decent administration of the criminal law in my first message to congress date december 8 1885 i strongly recommend these change and refer somewhat at length to the evil of the present system since that time the criminal business of the federal court and the expense attend it have enormously increase the number of criminal prosecution pende in the circuit and district court of the united states on the 1st day of july 1885 be 3,808 of which 1,884 be for violation of the internal revenue law while the number of such prosecution pende on the 1st day of july 1893 be 9,500 of which 4,200 be for violation of the internal revenue law the expense of the united states court exclusive of judge salary for the year end july 1 1885 be $ 2,874,733.11 and for the year end july 1 1893 $ 4,528,676.87.it be therefore apparent that the reason give in 1885 for a change in the manner of enforce the federal criminal law have gain cogency and strength by lapse of time i also heartily join the attorney general in recommend legislation fix degree of the crime of murder within federal jurisdiction as have be do in many of the states authorize writ of error on behalf of the government in case where final judgment be render against the sufficiency of an indictment or against the government upon any other question arise before actual trial limit the right of review in case of felony punishable only by fine and imprisonment to the circuit court of appeal and make speedy provision for the construction of such prison and reformatory as may be necessary for the confinement of united states convict the report of the postmaster general contain a detailed statement of the operation of the post office department during the last fiscal year and much interesting information touch this important branch of the public service the business of the mail indicate with absolute certainty the condition of the business of the country and depression in financial affair inevitably and quickly reduce the postal revenue therefore a large discrepancy than usual between the post office receipt and expenditure be the expected and unavoidable result of the distressing stringency which have prevail throughout the country during much of the time cover by the postmaster general 's report at a date when well time be anticipate it be estimate by his predecessor that the deficiency on the 30th day of june 1893 would be but a little over a million and a half dollar it amount however to more than five million at the same time and under the influence of like anticipation estimate be make for the current fiscal year end june 30 1894 which exhibit a surplus of revenue over expenditure of $ 872,245.71 but now in view of the actual receipt and expenditure during that part of the current fiscal year already expire the present postmaster general estimate that at its close instead of a surplus there will be a deficiency of nearly $ 8,000,000.the post office receipt for the last fiscal year amount to $ 75,896,933.16 and its expenditure to $ 81,074,104.90 this post office deficiency would disappear or be immensely decrease if less matter be carry free through the mail an item of which be upward of 300 ton of seed and grain from the agricultural department the total number of post office in the united states on the 30th day of june 1893 be 68,403 an increase of 1,284 over the precede year of these 3,360 be presidential an increase in that class of 204 over the precede year forty two free delivery office be add during the year to those already exist make a total of 610 city and town provide with free delivery on june 30 1893 ninety three other city and town be now entitle to this service under the law but it have not be accord they on account of insufficient fund to meet the expense of its establishment i be decidedly of the opinion that the provision of the present law permit as general an introduction of this feature of mail service as be necessary or justifiable and that it ought not to be extend to small community than be now designate the expense of free delivery for the fiscal year end june 30 1894 will be more than $ 11,000,000 and under legislation now exist there must be a constant increase in this item of expenditure there be 6,401 addition to the domestic money order office during the last fiscal year be the large increase in any year since the inauguration of the system the total number of these office at the close of the year be 18,434 there be 13,309,735 money order issue from these office be an increase over the precede year of 1,240,293 and the value of these order amount to $ 127,576,433.65 an increase of $ 7,509,632.58 there be also issue during the year postal note amount to $ 12,903,076.73.during the year 195 international money order office be add to those already provide make a total of 2,407 in operation on june 30 1893 the number of international money order issue during the year be 1,055,999 an increase over the precede year of 72,525 and their value be $ 16,341,837.86 an increase of $ 2,221,506.31 the number of order pay be 300,917 an increase over the precede year of 13,503 and their value be $ 5,283,375.70 an increase of $ 94,094.83.from the forego statement it appear that the total issue of money order and postal note for the year amount to $ 156,822,348.24.the number of letter and package mail during the year for special delivery be 3,375,693 an increase over the precede year of nearly 22 per cent the special delivery stamp use upon these letter and package amount to $ 337,569.30 and the messenger fee pay for their delivery amount to $ 256,592.71 leave a profit to the government of $ 80,976.59.the railway mail service not only add to the promptness of mail delivery at all office but it be the especial instrumentality which put the small and way place in the service on an equality in that regard with the large and terminal office this branch of the postal service have therefore receive much attention from the postmaster general and though it be gratify to know that it be in a condition of high efficiency and great usefulness i be lead to agree with the postmaster general that there be room for its further improvement there be now connect to the post office establishment 28,324 employee who be in the classified service the head of this great department give conclusive evidence of the value of civil service reform when after an experience that render his judgment on the subject absolutely reliable he express the opinion that without the benefit of this system it would be impossible to conduct the vast business intrust to he i desire to commend as especially worthy of prompt attention the suggestion of the postmaster general relate to a more sensible and business like organization and a well distribution of responsibility in his department the report of the secretary of the navy contain a history of the operation of his department during the past year and exhibit a most gratifying condition of the personnel of our navy he present a satisfactory account of the progress which have be make in the construction of vessel and make a number of recommendation to which attention be especially invite during the past six month the demand for cruising vessel have be many and urgent there have be revolution call for vessel to protect american interest in nicaragua guatemala costa rica honduras argentina and brazil while the condition of affair in honolulu have require the constant presence of one or more ship with all these call upon our navy it become necessary in order to make up a sufficient fleet to patrol the bering sea under the modus vivendi agree upon with great britain to detail to that service one vessel from the fish commission and three from the revenue marine progress in the construction of new vessel have not be as rapid as be anticipate there have be delay in the completion of unarmored vessel but for the most part they have be such as be constantly occur even in country have the large experience in naval shipbuilding the most serious delay however have be in the work upon armored ship the trouble have be the failure of contractor to deliver armor as agree the difficulty seem now however to have be all overcome and armor be be deliver with satisfactory promptness as a result of the experience acquire by shipbuilder and designer and material man it be believe that the date when vessel will be complete can now be estimate with reasonable accuracy great gun rapid fire gun torpedo and powder be be promptly supply the following vessel of the new navy have be complete and be now ready for service the double turrete coast defense monitor miantonomoh the double turrete coast defense monitor monterey the armored cruiser new york the protect cruiser baltimore chicago philadelphia newark san francisco charleston atlanta and boston the cruiser detroit the gunboat yorktown concord bennington machias castine and petrel the dispatch vessel dolphin the practice vessel bancroft and the dynamite gunboat vesuvius of these the bancroft machias detroit and castine have be place in commission during the current calendar year the following vessel be in process of construction the second class battle ship maine and texas the cruiser montgomery and marblehead and the coast defense monitor terror puritan amphitrite and monadnock all of which will be complete within one year the harbor defense ram katahdin and the protect cruiser columbia minneapolis olympia cincinnati and raleigh all of which will be complete prior to july 1 1895 the first class battle ship iowa indiana massachusetts and oregon which will be complete february 1 1896 and the armored cruiser brooklyn which will be complete by august 1 of that year it be also expect that the three gunboat authorize by the last congress will be complete in less than two year since 1886 congress have at each session authorize the building of one or more vessel and the secretary of the navy present an earnest plea for the continuance of this plan he recommend the authorization of at least one battle ship and six torpedo boat while i be distinctly in favor of consistently pursue the policy we have inaugurate of build up a thorough and efficient navy i can not refrain from the suggestion that the congress should carefully take into account the number of unfinished vessel on our hand and the deplete condition of our treasury in consider the propriety of an appropriation at this time to begin new work the method of employ mechanical labor at navy yard through board of labor and make efficiency the sole test by which laborer be employ and continue be produce the good result and the secretary be earnestly devote himself to its development attention be invite to the statement of his report in regard to the working of the system the secretary of the interior have the supervision of so many important subject that his report be of especial value and interest on the 30th day of june 1893 there be on the pension roll 966,012 name an increase of 89,944 over the number on the roll june 30 1892 of these there be 17 widow and daughter of revolutionary soldier 86 survivor of the war of 1812 5,425 widow of soldier of that war 21,518 survivor and widow of the mexican war 3,882 survivor and widow of indian war 284 army nurse and 475,645 survivor and widow and child of deceased soldier and sailor of the war of the rebellion the latter number represent those pension on account of disability or death result from army and navy service the number of person remain on the roll june 30 1893 who be pension under the act of june 27 1890 which allow pension on account of death and disability not chargeable to army service be 459,155.the number add to the roll during the year be 123,634 and the number drop be 33,690 the first payment on pension allow during the year amount to $ 33,756,549.98 this include arrear or the accumulation between the time from which the allowance of pension date and the time of actually grant the certificate although the law of 1890 permit pension for disability not relate to military service yet as a requisite to its benefit a disability must exist incapacitate applicant from the performance of manual labor to such a degree as to render they unable to earn a support the execution of this law in its early stage do not seem to have be in accord with its true intention but toward the close of the last administration an authoritative construction be give to the statute and since that time this construction have be follow this have have the effect of limit the operation of the law to its intended purpose the discovery having be make that many name have be put upon the pension roll by mean of wholesale and gigantic fraud the commissioner suspend payment upon a number of pension which seem to be fraudulent or unauthorized pende a complete examination give notice to the pensioner in order that they might have an opportunity to establish if possible the justice of their claim notwithstanding apparent invalidity this i understand be the practice which have for a long time prevail in the pension bureau but after enter upon these recent investigation the commissioner modify this rule so as not to allow until after a complete examination interference with the payment of a pension apparently not altogether void but which merely have be fix at a rate high than that authorize by law i be unable to understand why fraud in the pension roll should not be expose and correct with thoroughness and vigor every name fraudulently put upon these roll be a wicked imposition upon the kindly sentiment in which pension have their origin every fraudulent pensioner have become a bad citizen every false oath in support of a pension have make perjury more common and false and undeserving pensioner rob the people not only of their money but of the patriotic sentiment which the survivor of a war fight for the preservation of the union ought to inspire thousand of neighborhood have their well know fraudulent pensioner and recent development by the bureau establish appalling conspiracy to accomplish pension fraud by no means the least wrong do be to brave and deserving pensioner who certainly ought not to be condemn to such association those who attempt in the line of duty to rectify these wrong should not be accuse of enmity or indifference to the claim of honest veteran the sum expend on account of pension for the year end june 30 1893 be $ 156,740,467.14.the commissioner estimate that $ 165,000,000 will be require to pay pension during the year end june 30 1894.the condition of the indians and their ultimate fate be subject which be relate to a sacred duty of the government and which strongly appeal to the sense of justice and the sympathy of our people our indians number about 248,000 most of they be locate on 161 reservation contain 86,116,531 acre of land about 110,000 of these indians have to a large degree adopt civilized custom land in severalty have be allot to many of they such allotment have be make to 10,000 individual during the last fiscal year embrace about 1,000,000 acre the number of indian government school open during the year be 195 an increase of 12 over the precede year of this total 170 be on reservation of which 73 be boarding school and 97 be day school twenty boarding school and 5 day school support by the government be not locate on reservation the total number of indian child enrol during the year as attendant of all school be 21,138 an increase of 1,231 over the enrollment for the previous year i be sure that secular education and moral and religious teaching must be important factor in any effort to save the indian and lead he to civilization i believe too that the relinquishment of tribal relation and the holding of land in severalty may in favorable condition aid this consummation it seem to i however that allotment of land in severalty ought to be make with great care and circumspection if hastily do before the indian know its meaning while yet he have little or no idea of till a farm and no conception of thrift there be great danger that a reservation life in tribal relation may be exchange for the pauperism of civilization instead of its independence and elevation the solution of the indian problem depend very largely upon good administration the personal fitness of agent and their adaptability to the peculiar duty of care for their ward be of the utmost importance the law provide that except in special case army officer shall be detail as indian agent it be hope will prove a successful experiment there be danger of great abuse creep into the prosecution of claim for indian depredation and i recommend that every possible safeguard be provide against the enforcement of unjust and fictitious claim of this description the appropriation on account of the indian bureau for the year end june 30 1894 amount to $ 7,954,962.99 a decrease as compare with the year precede it of $ 387,131.95.the vast area of land which but a short time ago constitute the public domain be rapidly fall into private hand it be certain that in the transfer the beneficent intention of the government to supply from its domain home to the industrious and worthy home seeker be often frustrate though the speculator who stand with extortionate purpose between the land office and those who with their family be invite by the government to settle on the public land be a despicable character who ought not to be tolerate yet it be difficult to thwart his scheme the recent opening to settlement of the land in the cherokee outlet embrace an area of 6,500,000 acre notwithstanding the utmost care in frame the regulation govern the selection of location and notwithstanding the presence of united states troop furnish an exhibition though perhaps in a modify degree of the mad scramble the violence and the fraudulent occupation which have accompany previous opening of public land i concur with the secretary in the belief that these outrageous incident can not be entirely prevent without a change in the law on the subject and i hope his recommendation in that direction will be favorably consider i especially commend to the attention of the congress the statement contain in the secretary 's report concern forestry the time have come when efficient measure should be take for the preservation of our forest from indiscriminate and remediless destruction the report of the secretary of agriculture will be find exceedingly interesting especially to that large part of our citizen intimately concerned in agricultural occupation on the 7th day of march 1893 there be upon its pay roll 2,430 employee this number have be reduce to 1,850 person in view of a deplete public treasury and the imperative demand of the people for economy in the administration of their government the secretary have enter upon the task of rationally reduce expenditure by the elimination from the pay roll of all person not need for an efficient conduct of the affair of the department during the first quarter of the present year the expense of the department aggregate $ 345,876.76 as against $ 402,012.42 for the corresponding period of the fiscal year end june 30 1893 the secretary make apparent his intention to continue this rate of reduction by submit estimate for the next fiscal year less by $ 994,280 than those for the present year among the head of division in this department the change have be exceedingly few three vacancy occur from death and resignation have be fill by the promotion of assistant in the same division these promotion of experienced and faithful assistant have not only be in the interest of efficient work but have suggest to those in the department who look for retention and promotion that merit and devotion to duty be their good reliance the amount appropriate for the bureau of animal industry for the current fiscal year be $ 850,000 the estimate for the ensue year be $ 700,000.the regulation of 1892 concern texas fever have be enforce during the last year and the large stock yard of the country have be keep free from infection occasional local outbreak have be largely such as could have be effectually guard against by the owner of the affected cattle while contagious pleuro pneumonia in cattle have be eradicate animal tuberculosis a disease widespread and more dangerous to human life than pleuro pneumonia be still prevalent investigation have be make during the past year as to the mean of its communication and the method of its correct diagnosis much progress have be make in this direction by the study of the division of animal pathology but work ought to be extend in cooperation with local authority until the danger to human life arise from this cause be reduce to a minimum the number of animal arrive from canada during the year and inspect by bureau officer be 462,092 and the number from transatlantic country be 1,297 no contagious disease be find among the import animal the total number of inspection of cattle for export during the past fiscal year be 611,542 the export show a fall off of about 25 per cent from the precede year the decrease occur entirely in the last half of the year this suggest that the fall off may have be largely due to an increase in the price of american export cattle during the year end june 30 1893 export of inspect pork aggregate 10,677,410 pound as against 38,152,874 pound for the precede year the fall off in this export be not confine however to inspect pork the total quantity export for 1892 be 665,490,616 pound while in 1893 it be only 527,308,695 pound i join the secretary in recommend that hereafter each applicant for the position of inspector or assistant inspector in the bureau of animal industry be require as a condition precedent to his appointment to exhibit to the united states civil service commission his diploma from an establish regular and reputable veterinary college and that this be supplement by such an examination in veterinary science as the commission may prescribe the export of agricultural product from the united states for the fiscal year end june 30 1892 attain the enormous figure of $ 800,000,000 in round number be 78.7 per cent of our total export in the last fiscal year this aggregate be greatly reduce but nevertheless reach 615,000,000 be 75.1 per cent of all american commodity export a review of our agricultural export with special reference to their destination will show that in almost every line the united kingdom of great britain and ireland absorb by far the large proportion of cattle the total export aggregate in value for the fiscal year end june 30 1893 $ 26,000,000 of which great britain take considerably over $ 25,000,000 of beef product of all kind our total export be $ 28,000,000 of which great britain take $ 24,000,000 of pork product the total export be $ 84,000,000 of which great britain take $ 53,000,000 in breadstuff cotton and minor product like proportion send to the same destination be show the work of the statistical division of the department of agriculture deal with all that relate to the economic of farming the main purpose of its monthly report be to keep the farmer inform as fully as possible of all matter have any influence upon the world 's market in which their product find sale its publication relate especially to the commercial side of farming it be therefore of profound importance and vital concern to the farmer of the united states who represent nearly one half of our population and also of direct interest to the whole country that the work of this division be efficiently perform and that the information it have gather be promptly diffuse it be a matter for congratulation to know that the secretary will not spare any effort to make this part of his work thoroughly useful in the year 1839 the congress appropriate $ 1,000 to be take from the patent office fund for the purpose of collect and distribute rare and improved variety of seed and for prosecute agricultural investigation and procure agricultural statistic from this small begin the seed division of the department of agriculture have grow to its present unwieldy and unjustifiably extravagant proportion during the last fiscal year the cost of seed purchase be $ 66,548.61 the remainder of an appropriation of $ 135,000 be expend in put they up and distribute they it surely never could have enter the mind of those who first sanction appropriation of public money for the purchase of new and improved variety of seed for gratuitous distribution that from this would grow large appropriation for the purchase and distribution by member of congress of ordinary seed bulb and cutting which be common in all the states and territories and everywhere easily obtainable at low price in each state and territory an agricultural experiment station have be establish these station by their very character and name be the proper agency to experiment with and test new variety of seed and yet this indiscriminate and wasteful distribution by legislation and legislator continue answer no purpose unless it be to remind constituent that their representative be willing to remember they with gratuity at public cost under the sanction of exist legislation there be send out from the agricultural department during the last fiscal year enough of cabbage seed to plant 19,200 acre of land a sufficient quantity of bean to plant 4,000 acre beet seed enough to plant 2,500 acre sweet corn enough to plant 7,800 acre sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,025 acre with vine and enough muskmelon and watermelon seed to plant 2,675 acre the total quantity of flower and vegetable seed thus distribute be contain in more than 9,000,000 package and they be sufficient if plant to cover 89,596 acre of land in view of these fact this enormous expenditure without legitimate return of benefit ought to be abolish anticipate a consummation so manifestly in the interest of good administration more than $ 100,000 have be stricken from the estimate make to cover this object for the year end june 30 1895 and the secretary recommend that the remain $ 35,000 of the estimate be confine strictly to the purchase of new and improved variety of seed and that these be distribute through experiment station thus the seed will be test and after the test have be complete by the experiment station the propagation of the useful variety and the rejection of the valueless may safely be leave to the common sense of the people the continued intelligent execution of the civil service law and the increase approval by the people of its operation be most gratifying the recent extension of its limitation and regulation to the employee at free delivery post office which have be honestly and promptly accomplish by the commission with the hearty cooperation of the postmaster general be an immensely important advance in the usefulness of the system i be if possible more than ever convinced of the incalculable benefit confer by the civil service law not only in its effect upon the public service but also what be even more important in its effect in elevate the tone of political life generally the course of civil service reform in this country instructively and interestingly illustrate how strong a hold a movement gain upon our people which have underlie it a sentiment of justice and right and which at the same time promise well administration of their government the law embody this reform find its way to our statute book more from fear of the popular sentiment exist in its favor than from any love for the reform itself on the part of legislator and it have live and grow and flourish in spite of the covert as well as open hostility of spoilsman and notwithstanding the querulous impracticability of many self constitute guardian beneath all the vagary and sublimated theory which be attract to it there underlie this reform a sturdy common sense principle not only suit to this mundane sphere but whose application our people be more and more recognize to be absolutely essential to the most successful operation of their government if not to its perpetuity it seem to i to be entirely inconsistent with the character of this reform as well as with its good enforcement to oblige the commission to rely for clerical assistance upon clerk detail from other department there ought not to be such a condition in any department that clerk hire to do work there can be spare to habitually work at another place and it do not accord with a sensible view of civil service reform that person should be employ on the theory that their labor be necessary in one department when in point of fact their service be devoted to entirely different work in another department i earnestly urge that the clerk necessary to carry on the work of the commission be regularly put upon its roster and that the system of oblige the commissioners to rely upon the service of clerk belong to other departments be discontinue this ought not to increase the expense to the government while it would certainly be more consistent and add greatly to the efficiency of the commission economy in public expenditure be a duty that can not innocently be neglect by those intrust with the control of money draw from the people for public use it must be confess that our apparently endless resource the familiarity of our people with immense accumulation of wealth the grow sentiment among they that the expenditure of public money should in some manner be to their immediate and personal advantage the indirect and almost stealthy manner in which a large part of our taxis be exact and a degenerated sense of official accountability have lead to grow extravagance in governmental appropriation at this time when a deplete public treasury confront we when many of our people be engage in a hard struggle for the necessary of life and when enforce economy be press upon the great mass of our countryman i desire to urge with all the earnestness at my command that congressional legislation be so limited by strict economy as to exhibit an appreciation of the condition of the treasury and a sympathy with the straiten circumstance of our fellow citizen the duty of public economy be also of immense importance in its intimate and necessary relation to the task now in hand of provide revenue to meet government expenditure and yet reduce the people 's burden of federal taxation after a hard struggle tariff reform be directly before we nothing so important claim our attention and nothing so clearly present itself as both an opportunity and a duty an opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow citizen and a duty impose upon we by our oft repeat profession and by the emphatic mandate of the people after full discussion our countryman have speak in favor of this reform and they have confide the work of its accomplishment to the hand of those who be solemnly pledge to it if there be anything in the theory of a representation in public place of the people and their desire if public officer be really the servant of the people and if political promise and profession have any bind force our failure to give the relief so long await will be sheer recreancy nothing should intervene to distract our attention or disturb our effort until this reform be accomplish by wise and careful legislation while we should stanchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of revenue justify the imposition of tariff duty and other federal taxation and that they should be limit by strict economy we can not close our eye to the fact that condition have grow up among we which in justice and fairness call for discriminating care in the distribution of such duty and taxation as the emergency of our government actually demand manifestly if we be to aid the people directly through tariff reform one of its most obvious feature should be a reduction in present tariff charge upon the necessary of life the benefit of such a reduction would be palpable and substantial see and feel by thousand who would be well feed and well clothe and well shelter these gift should be the willing benefaction of a government whose high function be the promotion of the welfare of the people not less closely related to our people 's prosperity and well being be the removal of restriction upon the importation of the raw material necessary to our manufacture the world should be open to our national ingenuity and enterprise this can not be while federal legislation through the imposition of high tariff forbid to american manufacturer as cheap material as those use by their competitor it be quite obvious that the .enhancement of the price of our manufacture product result from this policy not only confine the market for these product within our own border to the direct disadvantage of our manufacturer but also increase their cost to our citizen the interest of labor be certainly though indirectly involve in this feature of our tariff system the sharp competition and active struggle among our manufacturer to supply the limited demand for their good soon fill the narrow market to which they be confine then follow a suspension of work in mill and factory a discharge of employee and distress in the home of our workingman even if the often disprove assertion could be make good that a low rate of wage would result from free raw material and low tariff duty the intelligence of our workman lead they quickly to discover that their steady employment permit by free raw material be the most important factor in their relation to tariff legislation a measure have be prepare by the appropriate congressional committee embody tariff reform on the line herein suggest which will be promptly submit for legislative action it be the result of much patriotic and unselfish work and i believe it deal with its subject consistently and as thoroughly as existing condition permit i be satisfied that the reduced tariff duty provide for in the propose legislation add to exist internal revenue taxation will in the near future though perhaps not immediately produce sufficient revenue to meet the need of the government the committee after full consideration and to provide against a temporary deficiency which may exist before the business of the country adjust itself to the new tariff schedule have wisely embrace in their plan a few additional internal revenue taxis include a small tax upon income derive from certain corporate investment these new adjustment be not only absolutely just and easily bear but they have the further merit of be such as can be remit without unfavorable business disturbance whenever the necessity of their imposition no long exist in my great desire for the success of this measure i can not restrain the suggestion that its success can only be attain by mean of unselfish counsel on the part of the friend of tariff reform and as a result of their willingness to subordinate personal desire and ambition to the general good the local interest affect by the propose reform be so numerous and so varied that if all be insist upon the legislation embody the reform must inevitably fail in conclusion my intense feeling of responsibility impel i to invoke for the manifold interest of a generous and confide people the most scrupulous care and to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort for the advancement of the greatness and prosperity of our beloved country
to the senate and house of representatives
 in my recent annual message to the congress i briefly refer to our relation with hawaii and express the intention of transmit further information on the subject when additional advice permit
 though i be not able now to report a definite change in the actual situation i be convinced that the difficulty lately create both here and in hawaii and now stand in the way of a solution through executive action of the problem present render it proper and expedient that the matter should be refer to the broad authority and discretion of congress with a full explanation of the endeavor thus far make to deal with the emergency and a statement of the consideration which have govern my action i suppose that right and justice should determine the path to be follow in treat this subject if national honesty be to be disregard and a desire for territorial extension or dissatisfaction with a form of government not our own ought to regulate our conduct i have entirely misapprehend the mission and character of our government and the behavior which the conscience of our people demand of their public servant
 when the present administration enter upon its duty the senate have under consideration a treaty provide for the annexation of the hawaiian islands to the territory of the united states surely under our constitution and law the enlargement of our limit be a manifestation of the high attribute of sovereignty and if enter upon as an executive act all thing relate to the transaction should be clear and free from suspicion additional importance attach to this particular treaty of annexation because it contemplate a departure from unbroken american tradition in provide for the addition to our territory of island of the sea more than 2,000 mile remove from our near coast
 these consideration might not of themselves call for interference with the completion of a treaty enter upon by a previous administration but it appear from the document accompany the treaty when submit to the senate that the ownership of hawaii be tender to we by a provisional government set up to succeed the constitutional ruler of the island who have be dethrone and it do not appear that such provisional government have the sanction of either popular revolution or suffrage two other remarkable feature of the transaction naturally attract attention one be the extraordinary haste not to say precipitancy characterize all the transaction connect with the treaty it appear that a so call committee of safety ostensibly the source of the revolt against the constitutional government of hawaii be organize on saturday the 14th day of january that on monday the 16th the united states force be land at honolulu from a naval vessel lie in its harbor that on the 17th the scheme of a provisional government be perfect and a proclamation name its officer be on the same day prepare and read at the government building that immediately thereupon the united states minister recognize the provisional government thus create that two day afterwards on the 19th day of january commissioner represent such government sail for this country in a steamer especially charter for the occasion arrive in san francisco on the 28th day of january and in washington on the 3d day of february that on the next day they have their first interview with the secretary of state and another on the 11th when the treaty of annexation be practically agree upon and that on the 14th it be formally conclude and on the 15th transmit to the senate thus between the initiation of the scheme for a provisional government in hawaii on the 14th day of january and the submission to the senate of the treaty of annexation conclude with such government the entire interval be thirty two day fifteen of which be spend by the hawaiian commissioner in their journey to washington
 in the next place upon the face of the paper submit with the treaty it clearly appear that there be open and undetermine an issue of fact of the most vital importance the message of the president accompany the treaty declare that the overthrow of the monarchy be not in any way promote by this government and in a letter to the president from the secretary of state also submit to the senate with the treaty the follow passage occur
 at the time the provisional government take possession of the government building no troop or officer of the united states be present or take any part whatever in the proceeding no public recognition be accord to the provisional government by the united states minister until after the queen&#39;s abdication and when they be in effective possession of the government building the archive the treasury the barrack the police station and all the potential machinery of the government
 but a protest also accompany say treaty sign by the queen and her minister at the time she make way for the provisional government which explicitly state that she yield to the superior force of the united states whose minister have cause united states troop to be land at honolulu and declare that he would support such provisional government
 the truth or falsity of this protest be surely of the first importance if true nothing but the concealment of its truth could induce our government to negotiate with the semblance of a government thus create nor could a treaty result from the act state in the protest have be knowingly deem worthy of consideration by the senate yet the truth or falsity of the protest have not be investigate
 i conceive it to be my duty therefore to withdraw the treaty from the senate for examination and meanwhile to cause an accurate full and impartial investigation to be make of the fact attend the subversion of the constitutional government of hawaii and the installment in its place of the provisional government i select for the work of investigation the hon james h. blount of georgia whose service of eighteen year as a member of the house of representatives and whose experience as chairman of the committee of foreign affairs in that body and his consequent familiarity with international topic join with his high character and honorable reputation seem to render he peculiarly fit for the duty intrust to he his report detail his action under the instruction give to he and the conclusion derive from his investigation accompany this message
 these conclusion do not rest for their acceptance entirely upon mr. blount&#39;s honesty and ability as a man nor upon his acuman and impartiality as an investigator they be accompany by the evidence upon which they be base which evidence be also herewith transmit and from which it seem to i no other deduction could possibly be reach than those arrive at by the commissioner
 the report with its accompany proof and such other evidence as be now before the congress or be herewith submit justifie in my opinion the statement that when the president be lead to submit the treaty to the senate with the declaration that the overthrow of the monarchy be not in any way promote by this government and when the senate be induce to receive and discuss it on that basis both president and senate be mislead
 the attempt will not be make in this communication to touch upon all the fact which throw light upon the progress and consummation of this scheme of annexation a very brief and imperfect reference to the fact and evidence at hand will exhibit its character and the incident in which it have its birth
 it be unnecessary to set forth the reason which in january 1893 lead a considerable proportion of american and other foreign merchant and trader reside at honolulu to favor the annexation of hawaii to the united states it be sufficient to note the fact and to observe that the project be one which be zealously promote by the minister represent the united states in that country he evidently have an ardent desire that it should become a fact accomplish by his agency and during his ministry and be not inconveniently scrupulous as to the mean employ to that end on the 19th day of november 1892 nearly two month before the first overt act tend toward the subversion of the hawaiian government and the attempt transfer of hawaiian territory to the united states he address a long letter to the secretary of state in which the case for annexation be elaborately argue on moral political and economical ground he refer to the loss to the hawaiian sugar interest from the operation of the mckinley bill and the tendency to still further depreciation of sugar property unless some positive measure of relief be grant he strongly inveigh against the exist hawaiian government and emphatically declare for annexation he say
 in truth the monarchy here be an absurd anachronism it have nothing on which it logically or legitimately stand the feudal basis on which it once stand no long exist the monarchy now be only an impediment to good government an obstruction to the prosperity and progress of the island
 he far say
 as a crown colony of great britain or a territory of the united states the government modification could be make readily and good administration of the law secure destiny and the vast future interest of the united states in the pacific clearly indicate who at no distant day must be responsible for the government of these island under a territorial government they could be as easily govern as any of the exist territory of the united states hawaii have reach the parting of the way she must now take the road which lead to asia or the other which outlet she in america give she an american civilization and bind she to the care of american destiny
 he also declare
 one of two course seem to i absolutely necessary to be follow either bold and vigorous measure for annexation or a custom union an ocean cable from the californian coast to honolulu pearl harbor perpetually cede to the united states with an imply but not expressly stipulate american protectorate over the island i believe the former to be the well that which will prove much the more advantageous to the island and the cheap and least embarrassing in the end to the united states if it be wise for the united states through secretary marcy thirty eight year ago to offer to expend $ 100,000 to secure a treaty of annexation it certainly can not be chimerical or unwise to expend $ 100,000 to secure annexation in the near future to day the united states have five time the wealth she possess in 1854 and the reason now exist for annexation be much strong than they be then i can not refrain from express the opinion with emphasis that the golden hour be near at hand
 these declaration certainly show a disposition and condition of mind which may be usefully recall when interpret the significance of the minister&#39; concede act or when consider the probability of such conduct on his part as may not be admit
 in this view it seem proper to also quote from a letter write by the minister to the secretary of state on the 8th day of march 1892 nearly a year prior to the first step take toward annexation after state the possibility that the exist government of hawaii might be overturn by an orderly and peaceful revolution minister stevens write as follow
 ordinarily in like circumstance the rule seem to be to limit the landing and movement of united states force in foreign water and dominion exclusively to the protection of the united states legation and of the life and property of american citizen but as the relation of the united states to hawaii be exceptional and in former year the united states official here take somewhat exceptional action in circumstance of disorder i desire to know how far the present minister and naval commander may deviate from established international rule and precedent in the contingency indicate in the first part of this dispatch
 to a minister of this temper full of zeal for annexation there seem to arise in january 1893 the precise opportunity for which he be watchfully wait an opportunity which by timely deviation from established international rule and precedent might be improve to successfully accomplish the great object in view and we be quite prepared for the exultant enthusiasm with which in a letter to the state department date february 1 1893 he declare
 the hawaiian pear be now fully ripe and this be the golden hour for the united states to pluck it
 as a further illustration of the activity of this diplomatic representative attention be call to the fact that on the day the above letter be write apparently unable long to restrain his ardor he issue a proclamation whereby in the name of the united states he assume the protection of the hawaiian islands and declare that say action be take pende and subject to negotiation at washington of course this assumption of a protectorate be promptly disavow by our government but the american flag remain over the government building at honolulu and the force remain on guard until april and after mr. blount&#39;s arrival on the scene when both be remove
 a brief statement of the occurrence that lead to the subversion of the constitutional government of hawaii in the interest of annexation to the united states will exhibit the true complexion of that transaction
 on saturday january 14 1893 the queen of hawaii who have be contemplate the proclamation of a new constitution have in deference to the wish and remonstrance of her cabinet renounce the project for the present at least take this relinquished purpose as a basis of action citizen of honolulu number from fifty to one hundred mostly resident alien meet in a private office and select a so call committee of safety compose of thirteen person seven of whom be foreign subject and consist of five americans one englishman and one german this committee though its design be not reveal have in view nothing less than annexation to the united states and between saturday the 14th and the follow monday the 16th of january though exactly what action be take may not be clearly disclose they be certainly in communication with the united states minister on monday morning the queen and her cabinet make public proclamation with a notice which be specially serve upon the representative of all foreign government that any change in the constitution would be seek only in the method provide by that instrument nevertheless at the call and under the auspex of the committee of safety a mass meeting of citizen be hold on that day to protest against the queen&#39;s allege illegal and unlawful proceeding and purpose even at this meeting the committee of safety continue to disguise their real purpose and content themselves with procure the passage of a resolution denounce the queen and empower the committee to devise way and mean to secure the permanent maintenance of law and order and the protection of life liberty and property in hawaii this meeting adjourn between 3 and 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon on the same day and immediately after such adjournment the committee unwilling to take further step without the cooperation of the united states minister address he a note represent that the public safety be menace and that life and property be in danger and conclude as follow
 we be unable to protect ourselves without aid and therefore pray for the protection of the united states force
 whatever may be think of the other content of this note the absolute truth of this latter statement be incontestable when the note be write and deliver the committee so far as it appear have neither a man nor a gun at their command and after its delivery they become so panic stricken at their position that they send some of their number to interview the minister and request he not to land the united states force till the next morning but he reply that the troop have be order and whether the committee be ready or not the landing should take place and so it happen that on the 16th day of january 1893 between 4 and 5 o&#39;clock in the afternoon a detachment of marine from the united states steamer boston with two piece of artillery land at honolulu the man upward of 160 in all be supply with double cartridge belt fill with ammunition and with haversack and canteen and be accompany by a hospital corps with stretcher and medical supply
 this military demonstration upon the soil of honolulu be of itself an act of war unless make either with the consent of the government of hawaii or for the bona fide purpose of protect the imperil life and property of citizen of the united states but there be no pretense of any such consent on the part of the government of the queen which at that time be undisputed and be both the de facto and the de jure government in point of fact the exist government instead of request the presence of an armed force protest against it there be as little basis for the pretense that such force be land for the security of american life and property if so they would have be station in the vicinity of such property and so as to protect it instead of at a distance and so as to command the hawaiian government building and palace admiral skerrett the officer in command of our naval force on the pacific station have frankly state that in his opinion the location of the troop be inadvisable if they be land for the protection of american citizen whose residence and place of business as well as the legation and consulate be in a distant part of the city but the location select be a wise one if the force be land for the purpose of support the provisional government if any peril to life and property call for any such martial array have exist great britain and other foreign power interested would not have be behind the united states in activity to protect their citizen but they make no sign in that direction when these armed man be land the city of honolulu be in its customary orderly and peaceful condition there be no symptom of riot or disturbance in any quarter man woman and child be about the street as usual and nothing vary the ordinary routine or disturb the ordinary tranquillity except the landing of the boston&#39;s marines and their march through the town to the quarter assign they indeed the fact that after having call for the landing of the united states force on the plea of danger to life and property the committee of safety themselves request the minister to postpone action expose the untruthfulness of their representation of present peril to life and property the peril they see be an anticipation grow out of guilty intention on their part and something which though not then exist they know would certainly follow their attempt to overthrow the government of the queen without the aid of the united states force
 thus it appear that hawaii be take possession of by the united states force without the consent or wish of the government of the island or of anybody else so far as show except the united states minister therefore the military occupation of honolulu by the united states on the day mention be wholly without justification either as an occupation by consent or as an occupation necessitate by danger threaten american life and property it must be account for in some other way and on some other ground and its real motive and purpose be neither obscure nor far to seek
 the united states force be now on the scene and favorably station the committee proceed to carry out their original scheme they meet the next morning tuesday the 17th perfect the plan of temporary government and fix upon its principal officer ten of whom be draw from the thirteen member of the committee of safety between 1 and 2 o&#39;clock by squad and by different route to avoid notice and having first take the precaution of ascertain whether there be anyone there to oppose they they proceed to the government building to proclaim the new government no sign of opposition be manifest and thereupon an american citizen begin to read the proclamation from the step of the government building almost entirely without auditor it be say that before the reading be finish quite a concourse of person variously estimate at from 50 to 100 some armed and some unarmed gather about the committee to give they aid and confidence this statement be not important since the one control factor in the whole affair be unquestionably the united states marine who draw up under arm and with artillery in readiness only 76 yard distant dominate the situation
 the provisional government thus proclaim be by the term of the proclamation to exist until term of union with the united states have be negotiate and agree upon the united states minister pursuant to prior agreement recognize this government within an hour after the reading of the proclamation and before 5 o&#39;clock in answer to an inquiry on behalf of the queen and her cabinet announce that he have do so
 when our minister recognize the provisional government the only basis upon which it rest be the fact that the committee of safety have in the manner above state declare it to exist it be neither a government de fato nor de jure that it be not in such possession of the government property and agency as entitle it to recognition be conclusively prove by a note find in the file of the legation at honolulu address by the declare head of the provisional government to minister stevens date january 17 1893 in which he acknowledge with expression of appreciation the minister&#39; recognition of the provisional government and state that it be not yet in the possession of the station house the place where a large number of the queen&#39;s troop be quarter though the same have be demand of the queen&#39;s officer in charge nevertheless this wrongful recognition by our minister place the government of the queen in a position of most perilous perplexity on the one hand she have possession of the palace of the barrack and of the police station and have at her command at least 500 fully armed man and several piece of artillery indeed the whole military force of her kingdom be on her side and at her disposal while the committee of safety by actual search have discover that there be but very few arm in honolulu that be not in the service of the government
 in this state of thing if the queen could have deal with the insurgent alone her course would have be plain and the result unmistakable but the united states have ally itself with her enemy have recognize they as the true government of hawaii and have put she and her adherent in the position of opposition against lawful authority she know that she could not withstand the power of the united states but she believe that she might safely trust to its justice accordingly some hour after the recognition of the provisional government by the united states minister the palace the barrack and the police station with all the military resource of the country be deliver up by the queen upon the representation make to she that her cause would thereafter be review at washington and while protest that she surrender to the superior force of the united states whose minister have cause united states troop to be land at honolulu and declare that he would support the provisional government and that she yield her authority to prevent collision of armed force and loss of life and only until such time as the united states upon the fact be present to it should undo the action of its representative and reinstate she in the authority she claim as the constitutional sovereign of the hawaiian islands
 this protest be deliver to the chief of the provisional government who indorse thereon his acknowledgment of its receipt the term of the protest be read without dissent by those assume to constitute the provisional government who be certainly charge with the knowledge that the queen instead of finally abandon her power have appeal to the justice of the united states for reinstatement in her authority and yet the provisional government with this unanswered protest in its hand hasten to negotiate with the united states for the permanent banishment of the queen from power and for a sale of her kingdom
 our country be in danger of occupy the position of having actually set up a temporary government on foreign soil for the purpose of acquire through that agency territory which we have wrongfully put in its possession the control of both side of a bargain acquire in such a manner be call by a familiar and unpleasant name when find in private transaction we be not without a precedent show how scrupulously we avoid such accusation in former day after the people of texas have declare their independence of mexico they resolve that on the acknowledgment of their independence by the united states they would seek admission into the union several month after the battle of san jacinto by which texan independence be practically assure and establish president jackson decline to recognize it allege as one of his reason that in the circumstance it become we to beware of a too early movement as it might subject we however unjustly to the imputation of seek to establish the claim of our neighbor to a territory with a view to its subsequent acquisition by ourselves this be in marked contrast with the hasty recognition of a government openly and concededly set up for the purpose of tender to us territorial annexation
 i believe that a candid and thorough examination of the fact will force the conviction that the provisional government owe its existence to an armed invasion by the united states fair minded people with the evidence before they will hardly claim that the hawaiian government be overthrow by the people of the island or that the provisional government have ever exist with their consent i do not understand that any member of this government claim that the people would uphold it by their suffrage if they be allow to vote on the question
 while naturally sympathize with every effort to establish a republican form of government it have be the settle policy of the united states to concede to people of foreign country the same freedom and independence in the management of their domestic affair that we have always claim for ourselves and it have be our practice to recognize revolutionary government as soon as it become apparent that they be support by the people for illustration of this rule i need only to refer to the revolution in brazil in 1889 when our minister be instruct to recognize the republic so soon as a majority of the people of brazil should have signify their assent to its establishment and maintenance to the revolution in chile in 1891 when our minister be direct to recognize the new government if it be accept by the people and to the revolution in venezuela in 1892 when our recognition be accord on condition that the new government be fully establish in possession of the power of the nation and accept by the people
 as i apprehend the situation we be bring face to face with the following condition
 the lawful government of hawaii be overthrow without the drawing of a sword or the firing of a shot by a process every step of which it may safely be assert be directly traceable to and dependent for its success upon the agency of the united states act through its diplomatic and naval representative
 but for the notorious predilection of the united states minister for annexation the committee of safety which should be call the committee of annexation would never have exist
 but for the landing of the united states force upon false pretext respect the danger to life and property the committee would never have expose themselves to the pain and penalty of treason by undertake the subversion of the queen&#39;s government
 but for the presence of the united states force in the immediate vicinity and in position to afford all need protection and support the committee would not have proclaim the provisional government from the step of the government building
 and finally but for the lawless occupation of honolulu under false pretext by the united states force and but for minister stevens&#39;s recognition of the provisional government when the united states force be its sole support and constitute its only military strength the queen and her government would never have yield to the provisional government even for a time and for the sole purpose of submit her case to the enlightened justice of the united states
 believe therefore that the united states could not under the circumstance disclose annex the island without justly incur the imputation of acquire they by unjustifiable method i shall not again submit the treaty of annexation to the senate for its consideration and in the instruction to minister willis a copy of which accompany this message i have direct he to so inform the provisional government
 but in the present instance our duty do not in my opinion end with refuse to consummate this questionable transaction it have be the boast of our government that it seek to do justice in all thing without regard to the strength or weakness of those with whom it deal i mistake the american people if they favor the odious doctrine that there be no such thing as international morality that there be one law for a strong nation and another for a weak one and that even by indirection a strong power may with impunity despoil a weak one of its territory
 by an act of war commit with the participation of a diplomatic representative of the united states and without authority of congress the government of a feeble but friendly and confide people have be overthrow a substantial wrong have thus be do which a due regard for our national character as well as the right of the injured people require we should endeavor to repair the provisional government have not assume a republican or other constitutional form but have remain a mere executive council or oligarchy set up without the assent of the people it have not seek to find a permanent basis of popular support and have give no evidence of an intention to do so indeed the representative of that government assert that the people of hawaii be unfit for popular government and frankly avow that they can be well rule by arbitrary or despotic power
 the law of nation be round upon reason and justice and the rule of conduct govern individual relation between citizen or subject of a civilized state be equally applicable as between enlightened nation the consideration that international law be without a court for its enforcement and that obedience to its command practically depend upon good faith instead of upon the mandate of a superior tribunal only give additional sanction to the law itself and brand any deliberate infraction of it not merely as a wrong but as a disgrace a man of true honor protect the unwritten word which bind his conscience more scrupulously if possible than he do the bond a breach of which subject he to legal liability and the united states in aim to maintain itself as one of the most enlightened nation would do its citizen gross injustice if it apply to its international relation any other than a high standard of honor and morality on that ground the united states can not properly be put in the position of countenance a wrong after its commission any more than in that of consent to it in advance on that ground it can not allow itself to refuse to redress an injury inflict through an abuse of power by officer clothe with its authority and wear its uniform and on the same ground if a feeble but friendly state be in danger of be rob of its independence and its sovereignty by a misuse of the name and power of the united states the united states can not fail to vindicate its honor and its sense of justice by an earnest effort to make all possible reparation
 these principle apply to the present case with irresistible force when the special condition of the queen&#39;s surrender of her sovereignty be recall she surrender not to the provisional government but to the united states she surrender not absolutely and permanently but temporarily and conditionally until such time as the fact could be consider by the united states furthermore the provisional government acquiesce in her surrender in that manner and on those term not only by tacit consent but through the positive act of some member of that government who urge her peaceable submission not merely to avoid bloodshed but because she could place implicit reliance upon the justice of the united states and that the whole subject would be finally consider at washington
 i have not however overlook an incident of this unfortunate affair which remain to be mention the member of the provisional government and their supporter though not entitle to extreme sympathy have be lead to their present predicament of revolt against the government of the queen by the indefensible encouragement and assistance of our diplomatic representative this fact may entitle they to claim that in our effort to rectify the wrong commit some regard should be have for their safety this sentiment be strongly second by my anxiety to do nothing which would invite either harsh retaliation on the part of the queen or violence and bloodshed in any quarter in the belief that the queen as well as her enemy would be willing to adopt such a course as would meet these condition and in view of the fact that both the queen and the provisional government have at one time apparently acquiesce in a reference of the entire case to the united states government and consider the further fact that in any event the provisional government by its own declare limitation be only to exist until term of union with the united states of america have be negotiate and agree upon i hope that after the assurance to the member of that government that such union could not be consummate i might compass a peaceful adjustment of the difficulty
 actuate by these desire and purpose and not unmindful of the inherent perplexity of the situation nor of the limitation upon my power i instruct minister willis to advise the queen and her supporter of my desire to aid in the restoration of the status exist before the lawless landing of the united states force at honolulu on the 16th of january last if such restoration could be effect upon term provide for clemency as well as justice to all party concern the condition suggest as the instruction show contemplate a general amnesty to those concern in set up the provisional government and a recognition of all its bona fide act and obligation in short they require that the past should be bury and that the restore government should reassume its authority as if its continuity have not be interrupt these condition have not prove acceptable to the queen and though she have be inform that they will be insist upon and that unless accede to the effort of the president to aid in the restoration of her government will cease i have not thus far learn that she be willing to yield they her acquiescence the check which my plan have thus encounter have prevent their presentation to the member of the provisional government while unfortunate public misrepresentation of the situation and exaggerated statement of the sentiment of our people have obviously injure the prospect of successful executive mediation
 i therefore submit this communication with its accompany exhibit embrace mr. blount&#39;s report the evidence and statement take by he at honolulu the instruction give to both mr. blount and minister willis and correspondence connect with the affair in hand
 in commend this subject to the extended power and wide discretion of the congress i desire to add the assurance that i shall be much gratified to cooperate in any legislative plan which may be devise for the solution of the problem before we which be consistent with american honor integrity and morality

house of representatives
 i return without my approval house bill no 4956 entitle an act direct the coinage of the silver bullion hold in the treasury and for other purposes.&#39;&#39
 my strong desire to avoid disagreement with those in both houses of congress who have support this bill would lead i to approve it if i could believe that the public good would not be thereby endanger and that such action on my part would be a proper discharge of official duty inasmuch however as i be unable to satisfy myself that the propose legislation be either wise or opportune my conception of the obligation and responsibility attach to the great office i hold forbid the indulgence of my personal desire and inexorably confine i to that course which be dictate by my reason and judgment and point out by a sincere purpose to protect and promote the general interest of our people
 the financial disturbance which sweep over the country during the last year be unparalleled in its severity and disastrous consequence there seem to be almost an entire displacement of faith in our financial ability and a loss of confidence in our fiscal policy among those who attempt to assign cause for our distress it be very generally concede that the operation of a provision of law then in force which require the government to purchase monthly a large amount of silver bullion and issue its note in payment therefor be either entirely or to a large extent responsible for our condition this lead to the repeal on the 1st day of november 1893 of this statutory provision
 we have however fall so low in the depth of depression and timidity and apprehension have so completely gain control in financial circle that our rapid recuperation could not be reasonably expect our recovery have nevertheless steadily progress and though less than five month have elapse since the repeal of the mischievous silver purchase requirement a wholesome improvement be unmistakably apparent confidence in our absolute solvency be to such an extent reinstate and faith in our disposition to adhere to sound financial method be so far restore as to produce the most encouraging result both at home and abroad the wheel of domestic industry have be slowly set in motion and the tide of foreign investment have again start in our direction
 our recovery be so well under way nothing should be do to check our convalescence nor should we forget that a relapse at this time would almost surely reduce we to a low stage of financial distress than that from which we be just emerge
 i believe that if the bill under consideration should become a law it would be regard as a retrogression from the financial intention indicate by our recent repeal of the provision force silver bullion purchase that it would weaken if it do not destroy return faith and confidence in our sound financial tendency and that as a consequence our progress to renew business health would be unfortunately check and a return to our recent distressing plight seriously threaten
 this propose legislation be so related to the currency condition grow out of the law compel the purchase of silver by the government that a glance at such condition and a partial review of the law refer to may not be unprofitable
 between the 14th day of august 1890 when the law become operative and the 1st day of november 1893 when the clause it contain direct the purchase of silver be repeal there be purchase by the secretary of the treasury more than 168,000,000 ounce of silver bullion in payment for this bullion the government issue its treasury note of various denomination amount to nearly $ 156,000,000 which note be immediately add to the currency in circulation among our people such note be by the law make legal tender in payment of all debt public and private except when otherwise expressly stipulate and be make receivable for custom taxis and all public due and when so received might be reissue they be also permit to be hold by banking association as a part of their lawful reserve
 on the demand of the holder these treasury note be to be redeem in gold or silver coin in the discretion of the secretary of the treasury but it be declare as a part of this redemption provision that it be the establish policy of the united states to maintain the two metal on a parity with each other upon the present legal ratio or such ratio as may be provide by law the money coin from such bullion be to be standard silver dollar and after direct the immediate coinage of a little less than 28,000,000 ounce the law provide that as much of the remain bullion should be thereafter coin as might be necessary to provide for the redemption of the treasury note issue on its purchase and that any gain or seigniorage arise from such coinage shall be account for and pay into the treasury
 this gain or seigniorage evidently indicate so much of the bullion own by the government as should remain after use a sufficient amount to coin as many standard silver dollar as should equal in number the dollar represent by the treasury note issue in payment of the entire quantity of bullion these treasury note now outstanding and in circulation amount to $ 152,951,280 and although there have be thus far but a comparatively small amount of this bullion coin yet the so call gain or seigniorage as above define which would arise from the coinage of the entire mass have be easily ascertain to be a quantity of bullion sufficient to make when coin 55,156,681 standard silver dollar
 consider the present intrinsic relation between gold and silver the maintenance of the parity between the two metal as mention in this law can mean nothing less than the maintenance of such a parity in the estimation and confidence of the people who use our money in their daily transaction manifestly the maintenance of this parity can only be accomplish so far as it be affect by these treasury note and in the estimation of the holder of the same by give to such holder on their redemption the coin whether it be gold or silver which they prefer it follow that while in term the law leave the choice of coin to be pay on such redemption to the discretion of the secretary of the treasury the exercise of this discretion if oppose to the demand of the holder be entirely inconsistent with the effective and beneficial maintenance of the parity between the two metal
 if both gold and silver be to serve we as money and if they together be to supply to our people a safe and stable currency the necessity of preserve this parity be obvious such necessity have be repeatedly concede in the platform of both political party and in our federal statute it be nowhere more emphatically recognize than in the recent law which repeal the provision under which the bullion now on hand be purchase this law insist upon the maintenance of the parity in value of the coin of the two metal and the equal power of every dollar at all time in the market and in the payment of debt
 the secretary of the treasury have therefore for the good of reason not only promptly comply with every demand for the redemption of these treasury note in gold but the present situation as well as the letter and spirit of the law appear plainly to justify if they do not enjoin upon he a continuation of such redemption
 the condition i have endeavor to present may be thus summarize first the government have purchase and now have on hand sufficient silver bullion to permit the coinage of all the silver dollar necessary to redeem in such dollar the treasury note issue for the purchase of say silver bullion and enough besides to coin as gain or seigniorage 55,156,681 additional standard silver dollar
 second there be outstanding and now in circulation treasury note issue in payment of the bullion purchase amounting to $ 152,951,280 these note be legal tender in payment of all debt public and private except when otherwise expressly stipulate they be receivable for custom taxis and all public due when hold by banking association they may be count as part of their lawful reserve and they be redeem by the government in gold at the option of the holder these advantageous attribute be deliberately attach to these note at the time of their issue they be fully understand by our people to whom such note have be distribute as currency and have inspire confidence in their safety and value and have undoubtedly thus induce their continue and content use as money instead of anxiety for their redemption
 having refer to some incident which i deem relevant to the subject it remain for i to submit a specific statement of my objection to the bill now under consideration
 this bill consist of two section exclude one which merely appropriate a sum sufficient to carry the act into effect the first section provide for the immediate coinage of the silver bullion in the treasury which represent the so call gain or seigniorage or which would arise from the coinage of all the bullion on hand which gain or seigniorage this section declare to be $ 55,156,681 it direct that the money so coin or the certificate issue thereon shall be use in the payment of public expenditure and provide that if the need of the treasury demand it the secretary of the treasury may in his discretion issue silver certificate in excess of such coinage not exceed the amount of seigniorage in say section authorize to be coin
 the second section direct that as soon as possible after the coinage of this seigniorage the remainder of the bullion hold by the government shall be coin into legal tender standard silver dollar and that they shall be hold in the treasury for the redemption of the treasury note issue in the purchase of said bullion it provide that as fast as the bullion shall be coin for the redemption of say note they shall not be reissue but shall be cancel and destroy in amount equal to the coin hold at any time in the treasury derive from the coinage provide for and that silver certificate shall be issue on such coin in the manner now provide by law it be however especially declare in say section that the act shall not be construe to change exist law relate to the legal tender character or mode of redemption of the treasury note issue for the purchase of the silver bullion to be coin
 the entire bill be most unfortunately construct nearly every sentence present uncertainty and invite controversy as to its meaning and intent the first section be especially faulty in this respect and it be extremely doubtful whether its language will permit the consummation of its suppose purpose i be lead to believe that the promoter of the bill intend in this section to provide for the coinage of the bullion constitute the gain or seigniorage as it be call into standard silver dollar and yet there be positively nothing in the section to prevent its coinage into any description of silver coin now authorize under any exist law
 i suppose this section be also intend in case the need of the treasury call for money fast than the seigniorage bullion could actually be coin to permit the issue of silver certificate in advance of such coinage but its language would seem to permit the issuance of such certificate to double the amount of seigniorage as state one half of which would not represent an ounce of silver in the treasury the debate upon this section in the congress develop an earnest and positive difference of opinion as to its object and meaning in any event i be clear that the present perplexity and embarrassment of the secretary of the treasury ought not to be augment by devolve upon he the execution of a law so uncertain and confused
 i be not willing however to rest my objection to this section solely on these ground in my judgment sound finance do not commend a further infusion of silver into our currency at this time unaccompanie by further adequate provision for the maintenance in our treasury of a safe gold reserve
 doubt also arise as to the meaning and construction of the second section of the bill if the silver dollar therein direct to be coin be as the section provide to be hold in the treasury for the redemption of treasury note it be suggest that strictly speak certificate can not be issue on such coin in the manner now provide by law because these dollar be money hold in the treasury for the express purpose of redeem treasury note on demand which would ordinarily mean that they be set apart for the purpose of substitute they for these treasury note they be not therefore hold in such a way as to furnish a basis for certificate accord to any provision of exist law
 if however silver certificate can properly be issue upon these dollar there be nothing in the section to indicate the characteristic and function of these certificate if they be to be of the same character as silver certificate in circulation under exist law they would at well be receivable only for custom taxis and all public due and under the language of this section it be to say the least extremely doubtful whether the certificate it contemplate would be lawfully receive even for such purpose
 whatever else may be say of the uncertainty of expression in this bill they certainly ought not to be find in legislation affect subject so important and far reach as our finance and currency in state other and more important reason for my disapproval of this section i shall however assume that under its provision the treasury note issue in payment for silver bullion will continue to be redeem as heretofore in silver or gold at the option of the holder and that if when they be present for redemption or reach the treasury in any other manner there be in the treasury coin silver dollar equal in nominal value to such treasury note then and in that case the note will be destroy and silver certificate to an equal amount be substitute
 i be convinced that this scheme be ill advised and dangerous as an ultimate result of its operation treasury note which be legal tender for all debt public and private and which be redeemable in gold or silver at the option of the holder will be replace by silver certificate which whatever may be their character and description will have none of these quality in anticipation of this result and as an immediate effect the treasury note will naturally appreciate in value and desirability the fact that gold can be realize upon they and the further fact that their destruction have be decree when they reach the treasury must tend to their withdrawal from general circulation to be immediately present for gold redemption or to be hoard for presentation at a more convenient season the sequel of both operation will be a large addition to the silver currency in our circulation and a corresponding reduction of gold in the treasury the argument have be make that these thing will not occur at once because a long time must elapse before the coinage of anything but the seigniorage can be enter upon if the physical effect of the execution of the second section of this bill be not to be realize until far in the future this may furnish a strong reason why it should not be pass so much in advance but the postponement of its actual operation can not prevent the fear and loss of confidence and nervous precaution which would immediately follow its passage and bring about its bad consequence i regard this section of the bill as embody a plan by which the government will be oblige to pay out its scanty store of gold for no other purpose than to force an unnatural addition of silver money into the hand of our people this be an exact reversal of the policy which safe finance dictate if we be to preserve parity between gold and silver and maintain sensible bimetallism
 we have now outstanding more than $ 338,000,000 in silver certificate issue under exist law they be serve the purpose of money usefully and without question our gold reserve amount to only a little more than $ 100,000,000 be directly charge with the redemption of $ 346,000,000 of united states note when it be propose to inflate our silver currency it be a time for strengthen our gold reserve instead of deplete it i can not conceive of a long step toward silver monometallism than we take when we spend our gold to buy silver certificate for circulation especially in view of the practical difficulty surround the replenishment of our gold
 this lead i to earnestly present the desirability of grant to the secretary of the treasury a well power than now exist to issue bond to protect our gold reserve when for any reason it should be necessary our currency be in such a confused condition and our financial affair be apt to assume at any time so critical a position that it seem to i such a course be dictate by ordinary prudence
 i be not insensible to the argument in favor of coin the bullion seigniorage now in the treasury and i believe it could be do safely and with advantage if the secretary of the treasury have the power to issue bond at a low rate of interest under authority in substitution of that now exist and well suit to the protection of the treasury
 i hope a way will present itself in the near future for the adjustment of our monetary affair in such a comprehensive and conservative manner as will accord to silver its proper place in our currency but in the meantime i be extremely solicitous that whatever action we take on this subject may be such as to prevent loss and discouragement to our people at home and the destruction of confidence in our financial management abroad

to thousand of dollar have be levy upon cargo or the carry vessel when the good in question be entitle to free entry fine have be exact even when the error have be detect and the spanish authority notify before the arrival of the good in port this conduct be in strange contrast with the considerate and liberal treatment extend to spanish vessel and cargoe in our port in like case no satisfactory settlement of these vexatious question have yet be reach the mora case refer to in my last annual message remain unsettled from the diplomatic correspondence on this subject which have be lay before the senate it will be see that this government have offer to conclude a convention with spain for disposal by arbitration of outstanding claim between the two country except the mora claim which having be long ago adjust now only await payment as stipulate and of course it could not be include in the propose convention it be hope that this offer would remove parliamentary obstacle encounter by the spanish government in provide payment of the mora indemnity i regret to say that no definite reply to this offer have yet be make and all effort to secure payment of this settle claim have be unavaile in my last annual message i advert to the claim on the part of turkey of the right to expel as person undesirable and dangerous armenians naturalize in the united states and return to turkish jurisdiction numerous question in this relation have arise while this government acquiesce in the asserted right of expulsion it will not consent that armenians may be imprison or otherwise punish for no other reason than having acquire without imperial consent american citizenship three of the assailant of miss melton an american teacher in mosul have be convict by the ottoman court and i be advise that an appeal against the acquittal of the remain five have be take by the turkish prosecute officer a convention have be conclude with venezuela for the arbitration of a long dispute claim grow out of the seizure of certain vessel the property of citizen of the united states although sign the treaty of extradition with venezuela be not yet in force owe to the insistence of that

in 1889 having be concurrently incorporate in the statute of the united states and great britain have be announce to take effect march 1 1895 and invitation have be extend to all maritime nation to adhere to they favorable response have thus far be receive from austria france portugal spain and sweden in my last annual message i refer briefly to the unsatisfactory state of affair in samoa under the operation of the berlin treaty as signally illustrate the impolicy of entangle alliance with foreign power and on may 9 1894 in response to a resolution of the senate i send a special message and document to that body on the same subject which emphasize my previously express opinion later occurrence the correspondence in regard to which will be lay before the congress far demonstrate that the government which be devise by the three power and force upon the samoans against their inveterate hostility can be maintain only by the continued presence of foreign military force and at no small sacrifice of life and treasure the suppression of the mataafa insurrection by the power and the subsequent banishment of the leader and eleven other chief as recite in my last message do not bring last peace to the island formidable uprising continue and finally a rebellion break out in the capital island upolu head in aana the western district by the young tamasese and in atua the eastern district by other leader the insurgent ravage the country and fight the government 's troop up to the very door of apia the king again appeal to the power for help and the combine british and german naval force reduce the atuans to apparent subjection not however without considerable loss to the native a few day later tamasese and his adherent fear the ship and the marine profess submission report receive from our agent at apia do not justify the belief that the peace thus bring about will be of long duration it be their conviction that the native be at heart hostile to the present government that such of they as profess loyalty to it do so from fear of the power and that it would speedily go to piece if the war ship be withdraw in report to his government on the unsatisfactory situation since the suppression of the late revolt by foreign armed force the german consul at apia state that peace will be last be hardly to be presume the lesson give by fire on atua be not sufficiently sharp and incisive to leave a lasting impression on the forgetful samoan temperament in fact condition be exist which show that peace will not last and be not seriously intend malietoa the king and his chief be convince that the departure of the war ship will be a signal for a renewal of war the circumstance that the representative of the village of all the district which be oppose to the government have already withdraw to atua to hold meeting and that both atua and aana have forbid inhabitant of those district which fight on the side of the government to return to their village and have already partly burn down the latter indicate that a real conciliation of the party be still far off and in a note of the 10th ultimo inclose a copy of that report for the information of this government the german ambassador say the content of the report awaken the imperial government 's apprehension that under exist circumstance the peace conclude with the rebel will afford no

enlisted man although this be apparently a very slight decrease compare with the previous year the actual effective force have be increase to the equivalent of nearly two regiment through the reorganization of the system of recruiting and the consequent release to regimental duty of the large force of man hitherto serve at the recruiting depot the abolition of these depot it be predict will furthermore effect an annual reduction approximate $ 250,000 in the direct expenditure besides promote generally the health morale and discipline of the troop the execution of the policy of concentrate the army at important center of population and transportation foreshadow in the last annual report of the secretary have result in the abandonment of fifteen of the small post which be effect under a plan which assemble organization of the same regiment hitherto widely separate this render our small force more readily effective for any service which they may be call upon to perform increase the extent of the territory under protection without diminish the security heretofore afford to any locality improve the discipline training and esprit de corps of the army besides considerably decrease the cost of its maintenance though the force of the department of the east have be somewhat increase more than three fourth of the army be still station west of the mississippi this carefully mature policy which secure the good and great service in the interest of the general welfare from the small force comprise our regular army should not be thoughtlessly embarrassed by the creation of new and unnecessary post through act of congress to gratify the ambition or interest of locality while the maximum legal strength of the army be 25,000 man the effective strength through various cause be but little over 20,000 man the purpose of congress do not therefore seem to be fully attain by the exist condition while no considerable increase in the army be in my judgment demand by recent event the policy of seacoast fortification in the prosecution of which we have be steadily engage for some year have so far develop as to suggest that the effective strength of the army be now make at least equal to the legal strength measure take by the department during the year as indicate have already considerably augment the effective force and the secretary of war present a plan which i recommend to the consideration of congress to attain the desire end economy effect in the department in other line of its work will offset to a great extent the expenditure involve in the proposition submit among other thing this contemplate the adoption of the three battalion formation of regiment which for several year have be indorse by the secretaries of war and the general command the army compact in itself it provide a skeleton organization ready to be fill out in the event of war which be peculiarly adapt to our strength and requirement and the fact that every other nation with a single exception have adopt this formation to meet the condition of modern warfare should alone secure for the recommendation an early consideration it be hardly necessary to recall the fact that in obedience to the command of the constitution and the law and for the purpose of protect the property of the united states aid the process of federal court and remove lawless obstruction to the performance by the government of its legitimate function it become necessary in various locality during the year to employ a considerable portion of the regular troop the duty be discharge promptly courageously and with marked discretion by the officer and man and the most gratifying proof be thus afford that the army deserve that complete confidence in its efficiency and discipline which the country have at all time manifest the year have be free from disturbance by indians and the chance of further depredation on their part be constantly become more remote and improbable the total .expenditure for the war department for the year end june 30 1894 amount to $ 56,039,009.34 of this sum $ 2,000,614.99 be for salary and contingent expense $ 23,665,156.16 for the support of the

fortification and other work of defense the appropriation for the current year aggregate $ 52,429,112.78 and the estimate submit by the secretary of war for the next fiscal year call for appropriation amount to $ 52,318,629.55.the skill and industry of our ordnance officer and inventor have it be believe overcome the mechanical obstacle which have heretofore delay the armament of our coast and this great national undertaking upon which we have enter may now proceed as rapidly as congress shall determine with a supply of finished gun of large caliber already on hand to which addition should now rapidly follow the wisdom of provide carriage and emplacement for their mount can not be too strongly urge the total enrollment of the militia of the several states be 117,533 officer and enlisted man an increase of 5,343 over the number report at the close of the previous year the report of militia inspection by regular army officer show a marked increase in interest and efficiency among the state organization and i strongly recommend a continuance of the policy of afford every practical encouragement possible to this important auxiliary of our military establishment the condition of the apache indians hold as prisoner by the government for eight year at a cost of half a million dollar have be change during the year from captivity to one which give they an opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for self support and at least partial civilization legislation enact at the late session of congress give the war department authority to transfer the survivor number 346 from mount vernon barracks in alabama to any suitable reservation the department select as their future home the military land near fort sill ind. t. where under military surveillance the former prisoner have be establish in agriculture under condition favorable to their advancement in recognition of the long and distinguished military service and faithful discharge of delicate and responsible civil duty by major general john m. schofield now the general command the army it be suggest to congress that the temporary revival of the grade of lieutenant general in his behalf would be a just and gracious act and would permit his retirement now near at hand with rank befit his merit the report of the attorney general note the gratifying progress make by the supreme court in overcome the arrear of its business and in reach a condition in which it will be able to dispose of case as they arise without any unreasonable delay this result be of course very largely due to the successful working of the plan inaugurate circuit court of appeal in respect to these tribunal the suggestion be make in quarter entitle to the high consideration that an additional circuit judge for each circuit would greatly strengthen these court and the confidence repose in their adjudication and that such an addition would not create a great force of judge than the increase business of such court require i commend the suggestion to the careful consideration of the congress other important topic be advert to in the report accompany by recommendation many of which have be treat at large in previous message and at this time therefore need only be name i refer to the abolition of the fee system as a measure of compensation to federal officer the enlargement of the power of united states commissioner at least in the territories the allowance of writ of error in criminal case on behalf of the united states and the establishment of degree in the crime of murder a topic deal with by the attorney general of much importance be the condition of the administration of justice in the indian territory the permanent solution of what be call the indian problem be probably not to be expect at once but meanwhile such amelioration of present condition as the exist system will admit of ought not to be neglect i be satisfied there should be a federal court establish for the territory with sufficient judge and that this court should sit within the territory and have the same jurisdiction as to territorial affair as be now vest in the federal court sit in arkansas and texas another subject of press moment refer to by the attorney general be the reorganization of the union pacific railway company on a basis equitable as regard all private interest and as favorable to the government as exist condition will permit the operation of a railroad by a court through a receiver be an anomalous state of thing which should be terminate on all ground public and private at the early possible moment besides not to enact the need enable legislation at the present session postpone the whole matter until the assembling of a new congress and inevitably increase all the complication of the situation and could not but be regard as a signal failure to solve a problem which have practically be before the present congress ever since its organization eight year ago in my annual message i urge upon the congress as strongly as i could the location and construction of two prison for the confinement of united states prisoner a similar recommendation have be make from time to time since and a few year ago a law be pass provide for the selection of site for three such institution no appropriation have however be make to carry the act into effect and the old and discreditable condition still exist it be not my purpose at this time to repeat the consideration which make an impregnable case in favor of the ownership and management by the government of the penal institution in which federal prisoner be confine i simply desire to again urge former recommendation on the subject and to particularly call the attention of the congress to that part of the report of the secretary of war in which he state that the military prison at fort leavenworth kans. can be turn over to the government as a prison for federal convict without the least difficulty and with an actual saving of money from every point of view pende a more complete reform i hope that by the adoption of the suggestion of the secretary of war this easy step may be take in the direction of the proper care of its convict by the government of the united states the report of the postmaster general present a comprehensive statement of the operation of the post office department for the last fiscal year the receipt of the department during the year amount to $ 75,080,479.04 and the expenditure to $ 84,324,414.15.the transaction of the postal service indicate with barometric certainty the fluctuation in the business of the country inasmuch therefore as business complication continue to exist throughout the last year to an unforeseen extent it be not surprising that the deficiency of revenue to meet the expenditure of the post office department which be estimate in advance at about $ 8,000,000 should be exceed by nearly $ 1,225,000 the ascertained revenue of the last year which be the basis of calculation for the current year be less than estimate the deficiency for the current year will be correspondingly great though the postmaster general state that the late indication be so favorable that he confidently predict an increase of at least 8 per cent in the revenue of the current year over those of the last year the expenditure increase steadily and necessarily with the growth and need of the country so that the deficiency be great or less in any year depend upon the volume of receipt the postmaster general state that this deficiency be unnecessary and might be obviate at once if the law regulate rate upon mail matter of the second class be modify the rate receive for the transmission of this second class matter be 1 cent per pound while the cost of such transmission to the government be eight time that amount in the general term of the law this rate cover newspaper and periodical the extension of the meaning of these term from time to time have admit to the privilege intend for legitimate newspaper and periodical a surprising range of publication and create abuse the cost of which amount in the aggregate to the total deficiency of the post office department pretended newspaper be start by business house for the mere purpose of advertising good comply with the law in form only and discontinue the publication as soon as the period of advertising be over sample copy of pretended newspaper be issue in great number for a like purpose only the result be a great loss of revenue to the government besides its humiliating use as an agency to aid in carry out the scheme of a business house to advertise its good by mean of a trick upon both its rival house and the regular and legitimate newspaper paper cover literature consist mainly of trashy novel to the extent of many thousand of ton be send through the mail at 1 cent per pound while the publisher of standard work be require to pay eight time that amount in send their publication another abuse consist in the free carriage through the mail of hundred of ton of seed and grain uselessly distribute through the department of agriculture the postmaster general predict that if the law be so amend as to eradicate these abuse not only will the post office department show no deficiency but he believe that in the near future all legitimate newspaper and periodical magazine might be properly transmit through the mail to their subscriber free of cost i invite your prompt consideration of this subject and fully indorse the view of the postmaster general the total number of post office in the united states on the 30th day of june 1894 be 69,805 an increase of 1,403 over the precede year of these 3,428 be presidential an increase in that class of 68 over the precede year six hundred and ten city and town be provide with free delivery ninety three other city and town entitle to this service under the law have not be accord it on account of insufficient fund the expense of free delivery for the current fiscal year will be more than $ 12,300,000 and under exist legislation this item of expenditure be subject to constant increase the estimate cost of rural free delivery generally be so very large that it ought not to be consider in the present condition of affair during the year 830 additional domestic money order office be establish the total number of these office at the close of the year be 19,264 there be 14,304,041 money order issue during the year be an increase over the precede year of 994,306 the value of these order amount to $ 138,793,579.49 an increase of $ 11,217,145.84 there be also issue during the year postal note amount to $ 12,649,094.55.during the year 218 international money order office be add to those already establish make a total of 2,625 such office in operation june 30 1894 the number of international money order issue during the year be 917,823 a decrease in number of 138,176 and their value be $ 13,792,455.31 a decrease in amount of $ 2,549,382.55 the number of order pay be 361,180 an increase over the precede year of 60,263 and their value be $ 6,568,493.78 an increase of $ 1,285,118.08.from the foregoing statement it appear that the total issue of money order and postal note for the year amount to $ 165,235,129.35.the number of letter and package mail during the year for special delivery be 3,436,970 the special delivery stamp use upon these letter and package amount to $ 343,697 the messenger fee pay for their delivery amount to $ 261,209.70 leave a balance in favor of the government of $ 82,487.30.the report show most gratifying result in the way of economy work out without affect the efficiency of the postal service these consist in the abrogation of steamship subsidy contract relette of mail transportation contract and in the cost and amount of supply use in the service amount in all to $ 16,619,047.42.this report also contain a valuable contribution to the history of the universal postal union an arrangement which amount practically to the establishment of one postal system for the entire civilized world special attention be direct to this subject at this time in view of the fact that the next congress of the union will meet in washington in 1897 and it be hope that timely action will be take in the direction of perfect preparation for that event the postmaster general renew the suggestion make in a previous report that the department organization be increase to the extent of create a direct district supervision of all postal affair and in this suggestion i fully concur there be now connect with the post office establishment 32,661 employee who be in the classified service this include many who have be classify upon the suggestion of the postmaster general he state that another year 's experience at the head of the department serve only to strengthen the conviction as to the excellent working of the civil service law in this branch of the public service attention be call to the report of the secretary of the navy which show very gratifying progress in the construction of ship for our new navy all the vessel now build include the three torpedo boat authorize at the last session of congress and except the first class battle ship iowa will probably be complete during the come fiscal year the estimate for the increase of the navy for the year end june 30 1896 be large but they include practically the entire sum necessary to complete and equip all the new ship not now in commission so that unless new ship be authorize the appropriation for the naval service for the fiscal year end june 30 1897 should fall below the estimate for the come year by at least $ 12,000,000.the secretary present with much earnestness a plea for the authorization of three additional battle ship and ten or twelve torpedo boat while the unarmored vessel heretofore authorize include those now near completion will constitute a fleet which it be believe be sufficient for ordinary cruising purpose in time of peace we have now complete and in process of construction but four first class battle ship and but few torpedo boat if we be to have a navy for warlike operation offensive and defensive we certainly ought to increase both the number of battle ship and torpedo boat the manufacture of armor require expensive plant and the aggregation of many skilled workman all the armor necessary to complete the vessel now building will be deliver before the 1st of june next if no new contract be give out contractor must disband their workman and their plant must lie idle battle ship authorize at this time would not be well under way until late in the come fiscal year and at least three year and a half from the date of the contract would be require for their completion the secretary state that not more than 15 per cent of the cost of such ship need be include in the appropriation for the come year i recommend that provision be make for the construction of additional battle ship and torpedo boat the secretary recommend the manufacture not only of a reserve supply of ordnance and ordnance material for ship of the navy but also a supply for the auxiliary fleet gun and their appurtenance should be provide and keep on hand for both these purpose we have not to day a single gun that could be put upon the ship paris or new york of the international navigation company or any other ship of our reserve navy the manufacture of gun at the washington navy yard be proceed satisfactorily and none of our new ship will be require to wait for their gun or ordnance equipment an important order have be issue by the secretary of the navy coordinate the duty of the several bureaus concern in the construction of ship this order it be believe will secure to a great extent than have heretofore be possible the harmonious action of these several bureau and make the attainment of the good result more certain during the past fiscal year there have be an unusual and press demand in many quarter of the world for the presence of vessel to guard american interest in january last during the brazilian insurrection a large fleet be concentrate in the harbor of rio de janeiro the vigorous action of rear admiral benham in protect the personal and commercial right of our citizen during the disturb condition afford result which will it be believe have a far reach and wholesome influence whenever in like circumstance it may become necessary for our naval commander to interfere on behalf of our people in foreign port the war now in progress between china and japan have render it necessary or expedient to dispatch eight vessel to those water both the secretary of the navy and the secretary of the treasury recommend the transfer of the work of the coast survey proper to the navy department i heartily concur in this recommendation exclude alaska and a very small area besides all the work of mapping and chart our coast have be complete the hydrographic work which must be do over and over again by reason of the shifting and vary depth of water consequent upon the action of stream and tide have heretofore be do under the direction of naval officer in subordination to the superintendent of the coast survey there seem to be no good reason why the navy should not have entire charge hereafter of such work especially as the hydrographic office of the navy department be now and have be for many year engage in make efficient map entirely similar to those prepare by the coast survey i feel it my imperative duty to call attention to the recommendation of the secretary in regard to the personnel of the line of the navy the stagnation of promotion in this the vital branch of the service be so great as to seriously impair its efficiency i consider it of the utmost importance that the young and middle aged officer should before the eve of retirement be permit to reach a grade entitle they to active and important duty the system adopt a few year ago regulate the employment of labor at the navy yard be rigidly uphold and have fully demonstrate its usefulness and expediency it be within the domain of civil service reform inasmuch as workman be employ through a board of labor select at each navy yard and be give work without reference to politic and in the order of their application preference however be give to army and navy veteran and those have former navy yard experience amendment suggest by experience have be make to the rule regulate the system through its operation the work at our navy yard have be vastly improve in efficiency and the opportunity to work have be honestly and fairly award to willing and competent applicant it be hope that if this system continue to be strictly adhere to there will soon be as a natural consequence such an equalization of party benefit as will remove all temptation to relax or abandon it the report of the secretary of the interior exhibit the situation of the numerous and interesting branch of the public service connect with his department i commend this report and the valuable recommendation of the secretary to the careful attention of the congress the public land dispose of during the year amount to 10,406,100.77 acre include 28,876.05 of indian land it be estimate that the public domain still remain amount to a little more than 600,000,000 acre include however about 360,000,000 acre in alaska as well as military reservation and railroad and other selection of land yet unadjudicate the total cash receipt from sale of land amount to $ 2,674,285.79 include $ 91,981.03 receive for indian land thirty five thousand patent be issue for agricultural land and 3,100 patent be issue to indians on allotment of their holding in severalty the land so allotted be inalienable by the indian allottee for a period of twenty five year after patent there be certify and patent on account of railroad and wagon road grant during the year 865,556.45 acre of land and at the close of the year 29,000,000 acre be embrace in the list of selection make by railroad and wagon road company and await settlement the selection of swamp land and that take as indemnity therefor since the passage of the act provide for the same in 1849 amount to nearly or quite 80,500,000 acre of which 58,000,000 have be patent to states about 138,000 acre be patent during the last year nearly 820,000 acre of school and education grant be approve during the year and at its close 1,250,363.81 acre remain unadjusted it appear that the appropriation for the current year on account of special service for the protection of the public land and the timber thereon be much less than those for previous year and inadequate for an efficient performance of the work a large sum of money than have be appropriate during a number of year past on this account have be return to the government as a result of the labor of those employ in the particular service mention and i hope it will not be cripple by insufficient appropriation i fully indorse the recommendation of the secretary that adequate protection be provide for our forest reserve and that a comprehensive forestry system be inaugurate such keeper and superintendent as be necessary to protect the forest already reserve should be provide i be of the opinion that there should be an abandonment of the policy sanction by present law under which the government for a very small consideration be rapidly lose title to immense tract of land cover with timber which should be properly reserve as permanent source of timber supply the suggestion that a change be make in the manner of secure survey of the public land be especially worthy of consideration i be satisfied that these survey should be make by a corps of competent surveyor under the immediate control and direction of the commissioner of the general land office an exceedingly important recommendation of the secretary relate to the manner in which contest and litigate case grow out of effort to obtain government land be determine the entire testimony upon which these controversy depend in all their stage be take before the local register and receiver and yet these officer have no power to subpoena witness or to enforce their attendance to testify these case number three or four thousand annually be send by the local officer to the commissioner of the general land office for his action the exigency of his other duty oblige he to act upon the decision of the register and receiver without an opportunity of thorough personal examination nearly 2,000 of these case be appeal annually from the commissioner to the secretary of the interior burden with other important administrative duty his determination of these appeal must be almost perfunctory and base upon the examination of other though this determination of the secretary operate as a final adjudication upon right of very great importance i concur in the opinion that the commissioner of the general land office should be relieve from the duty of decide litigate land case that a nonpartisan court should be create to pass on such case and that the decision of this court should be final at least so far as the decision of the department be now final the propose court might be give authority to certify question of law in matter of especial importance to the supreme court of the united states or the court of appeal for the district of columbia for decision the creation of such a tribunal would expedite the disposal of case and insure decision of a more satisfactory character the register and receiver who originally hear and decide these dispute should be invest with authority to compel witness to attend and testify before they though the condition of the indians show a steady and healthy progress their situation be not satisfactory at all point some of they to whom allotment of land have be make be find to be unable or disinclined to follow agricultural pursuit or to otherwise beneficially manage their land this be especially true of the cheyennes and arapahoes who as it appear by report of their agent have in many instance never be locate upon their allotment and in some case do not even know where their allotment be their condition have deteriorate they be not self support and they live in camp and spend their time in idleness i have always believe that allotment of reservation land to indians in severalty should be make sparingly or at least slowly and with the utmost caution in these day when white agriculturist and stock raiser of experience and intelligence find their lot a hard one we ought not to expect indians unless far advance in civilization and habit of industry to support themselves on the small tract of land usually allot to they if the self support scheme by allotment fail the wretched pauperism of the allottee which result be bad than their original condition of regulated dependence it be evident that the evil consequence of ill advise allotment be intensify in case where the false step can not be retrace on account of the purchase by the government of reservation land remain after allotment be make and the disposition of such remain land to settler or purchaser from the government i be convinced that the proper solution of the indian problem and the success of every step take in that direction depend to a very large extent upon the intelligence and honesty of the reservation agent and the interest they have in their work an agent fit for his place can do much toward prepare the indians under his charge for citizenship and allotment of their land and his advice as to any matter concern their welfare will not mislead an unfit agent will make no effort to advance the indians on his reservation toward civilization or preparation for allotment of land in severalty and his opinion as to their condition in this and other regard be heedless and valueless the indication be that the detail of army officer as indian agent will result in improve management on the reservation whenever allotment be make and any indian on the reservation have previously settle upon a lot and cultivate it or show a disposition to improve it in any way such lot should certainly be allot to he and this should be make plainly obligatory by statute in the light of experience and consider the uncertainty of the indian situation and its exigency in the future i be not only disposed to be very cautious in make allotment but i incline to agree with the secretary of the interior in the opinion that when allotment be make the balance of reservation land remain after allotment instead of be buy by the government from the indians and open for settlement with such scandal and unfair practice as seem unavoidable should remain for a time at least as common land or be sell by the government on behalf of the indians in an orderly way and at fix price to be determine by its location and desirability and that the proceed less expense should be hold in trust for the benefit of the indian proprietor the intelligent indian school management of the past year have be follow by gratify result effort have be make to advance the work in a sound and practical manner five institute of indian teacher have be hold during the year and have prove very beneficial through the view exchange and method discuss particularly applicable to indian education effort be be make in the direction of a gradual reduction of the number of indian contract school so that in a comparatively short time they may give way altogether to government school and it be hope that the change may be so gradual as to be perfect without too great expense to the government or undue disregard of investment make by those who have establish and be maintain such contract school the appropriation for the current year end june 30 1895 applicable to the ordinary expense of the indian service amount to $ 6,733,003.18 be less by $ 663,240.64 than the sum appropriate on the same account for the previous year at the close of the last fiscal year on the 30th day of june 1894 there be 969,544 person on our pension roll be a net increase of 3,532 over the number report at the end of the previous year these pensioner may be classify as follow soldier and sailor survivor of all war 753,968 widow and relative of deceased soldier 215,162 army nurse in the war of the rebellion 414 of these pensioner 32,039 be survive soldier of indian and other war prior to the late civil war and the widow or relative of such soldier the remainder number 937,505 be receive pension on account of the rebellion and of these 469,344 be on the roll under the authority of the act of june 27 1890 sometimes call the dependent pension law the total amount expend for pension during the year be $ 139,804,461.05 leave an unexpended balance from the sum appropriate of $ 25,205,712.65.the sum necessary to meet pension expenditure for the year end june 30 1896 be estimate at $ 140,000,000.the commissioner of pensions be of the opinion that the year 1895 be the thirtieth after the close of the war of the rebellion must accord to all sensible human calculation see the high limit of the pension roll and that after that year it must begin to decline the claim pende in the bureau have decrease more than 90,000 during the year a large proportion of the new claim file be for increase of pension by those now on the roll the number of certificate issue be 80,213.the name drop from the roll for all cause during the year number 37,951.among our pensioner be 9 widow and 3 daughter of soldier of the revolution and 45 survivor of the war of 1812.the bareface and extensive pension fraud expose under the direction of the courageous and generous veteran soldier now at the head of the bureau leave no room for the claim that no purgation of our pension roll be need or that continue vigilance and prompt action be not necessary to the same end the accusation that an effort to detect pension fraud be evidence of unfriendliness toward our worthy veteran and a denial of their claim to the generosity of the government suggest an unfortunate indifference to the commission of any offense which have for its motive the securing of a pension and indicate a willingness to be blind to the existence of mean and treacherous crime which play upon demagogic fear and make sport of the patriotic impulse of a grateful people the completion of the eleventh census be now in charge of the commissioner of labor the total disbursement on account of the work for the fiscal year end june 30 1894 amount to $ 10,365,676.81 at the close of the year the number of person employ in the census office be 679 at present there be about 400 the whole number of volume necessary to comprehend the eleventh census will be 25 and they will contain 22,270 print page the assurance be confidently make that before the close of the present calendar year the material still incomplete will be practically in hand and the census can certainly be close by the 4th of march 1895 after that the revision and proof read necessary to bring out the volume will still be require the text of the census volume have be limit as far as possible to the analysis of the statistic present this method which be in accordance with law have cause more or less friction and in some instance individual disappointment for when the commissioner of labor take charge of the work he find much matter on hand which accord to this rule he be compel to discard the census be be prepare accord to the theory that it be design to collect fact and certify they to the public not to elaborate argument or to present personal view the secretary of agriculture in his report review the operation of his department for the last fiscal year and make recommendation for the further extension of its usefulness he report a saving in expenditure during the year of $ 600,000 which be cover back into the treasury this sum be 23 per cent of the entire appropriation a special study have be make of the demand for american farm product in all foreign market especially great britain that country receive from the united states during the nine month end september 30 1894 305,910 live beef cattle value at $ 26,500,000 as against 182,611 cattle value at $ 16,634,000 during the same period for 1893.dure the first six month of 1894 the united kingdom take also 112,000,000 pound of dress beef from the united states value at nearly $ 10,000,000.the report show that during the nine month immediately precede september 30 1894 the united states export to great britain 222,676,000 pound of pork of apple 1,900,000 bushel value at $ 2,500,000 and of horse 2,811 at an average value of $ 139 per head there be a fall off in american wheat export of 13,500,000 bushel and the secretary be inclined to believe that wheat may not in the future be the staple export cereal product of our country but that corn will continue to advance in importance as an export on account of the new use to which it be constantly be appropriate the export of agricultural product from the united states for the fiscal year end june 30 1894 amount to $ 628,363,038 be 72.28 per cent of american export of every description and the united kingdom of great britain take more than 54 per cent of all farm product find foreign market the department of agriculture have undertake during the year two new and important line of research the first relate to grass and forage plant with the purpose of instruct and familiarize the people as to the distinctive grass of the united states and teach they how to introduce valuable foreign forage plant which may be adapt to this country the second relate to agricultural soil and crop production involve the analysis of sample of soil from all section of the american union to demonstrate their adaptability to particular plant and crop mechanical analysis of soil may be of such inestimable utility that it be foremost in the new line of agricultural research and the secretary therefore recommend that a division have it in charge be permanently establish in the department the amount appropriate for the weather bureau be $ 951,100 of that sum $ 138,500 or 14 per cent have be save and be return to the treasury as illustrate the usefulness of this service it may be here state that the warning which be very generally give of two tropical storm occur in september and october of the present year result in detain safely in port 2,305 vessel value at $ 36,183,913 laden with cargo of probably still great value what be much more important and gratifying many human life on these ship be also undoubtedly save the appropriation to the bureau of animal industry be $ 850,000 and the expenditure for the year be only $ 495,429.24 thus leave unexpended $ 354,570.76 the inspection of beef animal for export and interstate trade have be continue and 12,944,056 head be inspect during the year at a cost of 1 3/4 cent per head against 4 3/4 cent for 1893 the amount of pork microscopically examine be 35,437,937 pound against 20,677,410 pound in the precede year the cost of this inspection have be diminish from 8 3/4 cent per head in 1893 to 6 1/2 cent in 1894.the expense of inspect the pork sell in 1894 to germany and france by the united states be $ 88,922.10 the quantity inspect be great by 15,000,000 pound than during the precede year when the cost of such inspection be $ 172,367.08 the secretary of agriculture recommend that the law provide for the microscopic inspection of export and interstate meat be so amend as to compel owner of the meat inspect to pay the cost of such inspection and i call attention to the argument present in his report in support of this recommendation the live beef cattle export and tag during the year number 353,535 this be an increase of 69,533 head over the previous year the sanitary inspection of cattle ship to europe have cost an average of 10 3/4 cent for each animal and the cost of inspect southern cattle and the disinfection of car and stock yard average 2.7 cent per animal the scientific inquiry of the bureau of animal industry have progress steadily during the year much tuberculin and mallein have be furnish to state authority for use in the agricultural college and experiment station for the treatment of tuberculosis and glander quite recently this department have publish the result of its investigation of bovine tuberculosis and its research will be vigorously continue certain herd in the district of columbia will be thoroughly inspect and will probably supply adequate scope for the department to intelligently prosecute its scientific work and furnish sufficient material for purpose of illustration description and definition the sterilization of milk suspect of contain the bacilli of tuberculosis have be during the year very thoroughly explain in a leaflet by dr. d. e. salmon the chief of the bureau and give general circulation throughout the country the office of experiment stations which be a part of the united states department of agriculture have during the past year engage itself almost wholly in prepare for publication work base upon the report of agricultural experiment station and other institution for agricultural inquiry in the united states and foreign country the secretary in his report for 1893 call attention to the fact that the appropriation make for the support of the experiment station throughout the union be the only money take out of the national treasury by act of congress for which no accounting to federal authority be require respond to this suggestion the fifty third congress in make the appropriation for the department for the present fiscal year provide that the secretary of agriculture shall prescribe the form of annual financial statement require by section 3 of say act of march 2 1887 shall ascertain whether the expenditure under the appropriation hereby make be in accordance with the provision of say act and shall make report thereon to congress in obedience to this law the department of agriculture immediately send out blank form of expense account to each station and propose in addition to make through trust expert systematic examination of the several station during each year for the purpose of acquire by personal investigation the detailed information necessary to enable the secretary of agriculture to make as the statute provide a satisfactory report to congress the board of management of the several station with great alacrity and cordiality have approve the amendment to the law provide this supervision of their expenditure anticipate that it will increase the efficiency of the station and protect their director and manager from loose charge concern their use of public fund besides bring the department of agriculture into close and more confidential relation with the experimental station and through their joint service largely increase their usefulness to the agriculture of the country act upon a recommendation contain in the report of 1893 congress appropriate $ 10,000 to enable the secretary of agriculture to investigate and report upon the nutritive value of the various article and commodity use for human food with special suggestion of full wholesome and edible ration less wasteful and more economical than those in common use "under this appropriation the department have prepare and now have nearly ready for distribution an elementary discussion of the nutritive value and pecuniary economy of food when we consider that fully one half of all the money earn by the wage earner of the civilized world be expend by they for food the importance and utility of such an investigation be apparent the department expend in the fiscal year 1893 $ 2,354,809.56 and out of that sum the total amount expend in scientific research be 45.6 per cent but in the year end june 30 1894 out of a total expenditure of $ 1,948,988.38 the department apply 51.8 per cent of that sum to scientific work and investigation it be therefore very plainly observable that the economy which have be practice in the administration of the department have not be at the expense of scientific research the recommendation contain in the report of the secretary for 1893 that the vicious system of promiscuous free distribution of its departmental document be abandon be again urge these publication may well be furnish without cost to public library educational institution and the officer and library of states and of the federal government but from all individual apply for they a price cover the cost of the document ask for should be require thus the publication and document would be secure by those who really desire they for proper purpose half a million of copy of the report of the secretary of agriculture be print for distribution at an annual cost of about $ 300,000 large number of they be cumber storeroom at the capitol and the shelf of secondhand book store throughout the country all this labor and waste might be avoid if the recommendation of the secretary be adopt the secretary also again recommend that the gratuitous distribution of seed cease and that no money be appropriate for that purpose except to experiment station he reiterate the reason give in his report for 1893 for discontinue this unjustifiable gratuity and i fully concur in the conclusion which he have reach the good service of the statistician of the department of agriculture be the ascertainment by diligence and care of the actual and real condition favorable or unfavorable of the farmer and farm of the country and to seek the cause which produce these condition to the end that the fact ascertain may guide their intelligent treatment a far important utility in agricultural statistic be find in their elucidation of the relation of the supply of farm product to the demand for they in the market of the united states and of the world it be deem possible that an agricultural census may be take each year through the agent of the statistical division of the department such a course be commend for trial by the chief of that division its scope would be:(1 the area under each of the more important crops.(2 the aggregate product of each of such crops.(3 the quantity of wheat and corn in the hand of farmer at a date after the spring sowing and planting and before the beginning of harvest and also the quantity of cotton and tobacco remain in the hand of planter either at the same date or at some other designate time the cost of the work be estimate at $ 500,000.owing to the peculiar quality of the statistician 's work and the natural and acquire fitness necessary to its successful prosecution the secretary of agriculture express the opinion that every person employ in gather statistic under the chief of that division should be admit to that service only after a thorough exhaustive and successful examination at the hand of the united states civil service commission this have lead he to call for such examination of candidate for the position of assistant statistician and also of candidate for chief of section in that division the work do by the department of agriculture be very superficially deal with in this communication and i commend the report of the secretary and the very important interest with which it deal to the careful attention of the congress the advantage to the public service of an adherence to the principle of civil service reform be constantly more apparent and nothing be so encouraging to those in official life who honestly desire good government as the increase appreciation by our people of these advantage a vast majority of the voter of the land be ready to insist that the time and attention of those they select to perform for they important public duty should not be distract by dole out minor office and they be grow to be unanimous in regard party organization as something that should be use in establish party principle instead of dictate the distribution of public place as reward of partisan activity numerous additional office and place have lately be bring within civil service rule and regulation and some other will probably soon be include the report of the commissioners will be submit to the congress and i invite careful attention to the recommendation it contain i be entirely convinced that we ought not to be long without a national board of health or national health officer charge with no other duty than such as pertain to the protection of our country from the invasion of pestilence and disease this would involve the establishment by such board or officer of proper quarantine precaution or the necessary aid and counsel to local authority on the subject prompt advice and assistance to local board of health or health officer in the suppression of contagious disease and in case where there be no such local board or officer the immediate direction by the national board or officer of measure of suppression constant and authentic information concern the health of foreign country and all part of our own country as relate to contagious disease and consideration of regulation to be enforce in foreign port to prevent the introduction of contagion into our city and the measure which should be adopt to secure their enforcement there seem to be at this time a decide inclination to discuss measure of protection against contagious disease in international conference with a view of adopt mean of mutual assistance the creation of such a national health establishment would greatly aid our standing in such conference and improve our opportunity to avail ourselves of their benefit i earnestly recommend the inauguration of a national board of health or similar national instrumentality believe the same to be a need precaution against contagious disease and in the interest of the safety and health of our people by virtue of a statute of the united states pass in 1888 i appoint in july last hon john d. kernan of the state of new york and hon nicholas e. worthington of the state of illinois to form with hon carroll d. wright commissioner of labor who be designate by said statute a commission for the purpose of make careful inquiry into the cause of the controversy between certain railroad and their employee which have result in an extensive and destructive strike accompany by much violence and dangerous disturbance with considerable loss of life and great destruction of property the report of the commissioner have be submit to i and will be transmit to the congress with the evidence take upon their investigation their work have be well do and their standing and intelligence give assurance that the report and suggestion they make be worthy of careful consideration the tariff act pass at the last session of the congress need important amendment if it be to be execute effectively and with certainty in addition to such necessary amendment as will not change rate of duty i be still very decidedly in favor of put coal and iron upon the free list so far as the sugar schedule be concern i would be glad under exist aggravation to see every particle of differential duty in favor of refined sugar stricken out of our tariff law if with all the favor now accord the sugar refining interest in our tariff law it still languish to the extent of closed refinery and thousand of discharged workman it would seem to present a hopeless case for reasonable legislative aid whatever else be do or omit i earnestly repeat here the recommendation i have make in another portion of this communication that the additional duty of one tenth of a cent per pound lay upon sugar import from country pay a bounty on its export be abrogate it seem to i that exceedingly important consideration point to the propriety of this amendment with the advent of a new tariff policy not only calculate to relieve the consumer of our land in the cost of their daily life but to invite a well development of american thrift and create for we close and more profitable commercial relation with the rest of the world it follow as a logical and imperative necessity that we should at once remove the chief if not the only obstacle which have so long prevent our participation in the foreign carrying trade of the sea a tariff build upon the theory that it be well to check import and that a home market should bind the industry and effort of american producer be fitly supplement by a refusal to allow american registry to vessel build abroad though own and navigate by our people thus exhibit a willingness to abandon all contest for the advantage of american transoceanic carriage our new tariff policy build upon the theory that it be well to encourage such importation as our people need and that our product and manufacture should find market in every part of the habitable globe be consistently supplement by the great possible liberty to our citizen in the ownership and navigation of ship in which our product and manufacture may be transport the million now pay to foreigner for carry american passenger and product across the sea should be turn into american hand shipbuilding which have be protect to strangulation should be revive by the prospect of profitable employment for ship when build and the american sailor should be resurrect and again take his place a sturdy and industrious citizen in time of peace and a patriotic and safe defender of american interest in the day of conflict the ancient provision of our law deny american registry to ship build abroad and own by americans appear in the light of present condition not only to be a failure for good at every point but to be near a relic of barbarism than anything that exist under the permission of a statute of the united states i earnestly recommend its prompt repeal during the last month the gold reserve in the treasury for the purpose of redeem the note of the government circulate as money in the hand of the people become so reduced and its further depletion in the near future seem so certain that in the exercise of proper care for the public welfare it become necessary to replenish this reserve and thus maintain popular faith in the ability and determination of the government to meet as agree its pecuniary obligation it would have be well if in this emergency authority have exist to issue the bond of the government bear a low rate of interest and mature within a short period but the congress having fail to confer such authority resort be necessarily have to the resumption act of 1875 and pursuant to its provision bond be issue draw interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum and mature ten year after their issue that be the short time authorize by the act i be glad to say however that on the sale of these bond the premium receive operate to reduce the rate of interest to be pay by the government to less than 3 per cent nothing could be bad or far remove from sensible finance than the relation exist between the currency the government have issue the gold hold for its redemption and the mean which must be resort to for the purpose of replenish such redemption fund when impair even if the claim upon this fund be confine to the obligation originally intend and if the redemption of these obligation mean their cancellation the fund would be very small but these obligation when receive and redeem in gold be not cancel but be reissue and may do duty many time by way of draw gold from the treasury thus we have an endless chain in operation constantly deplete the treasury 's gold and never near a final rest as if this be not bad enough we have by a statutory declaration that it be the policy of the government to maintain the parity between gold and silver aid the force and momentum of this exhausting process and add largely to the currency obligation claim this peculiar gold redemption our small gold reserve be thus subject to drain from every side the demand that increase our danger also increase the necessity of protect this reserve against depletion and it be most unsatisfactory to know that the protection afford be only a temporary palliation it be perfectly and palpably plain that the only way under present condition by which this reserve when dangerously deplete can be replenish be through the issue and sale of the bond of the government for gold and yet congress have not only thus far decline to authorize the issue of bond well suit to such a purpose but there seem a disposition in some quarter to deny both the necessity and power for the issue of bond at all i can not for a moment believe that any of our citizen be deliberately willing that their government should default in its pecuniary obligation or that its financial operation should be reduce to a silver basis at any rate i should not feel that my duty be do if i omit any effort i could make to avert such a calamity as long therefore as no provision be make for the final redemption or the putting aside of the currency obligation now use to repeatedly and constantly draw from the government its gold and as long as no well authority for bond issue be allow than at present exist such authority will be utilize whenever and as often as it become necessary to maintain a sufficient gold reserve and in abundant time to save the credit of our country and make good the financial declaration of our government question relate to our bank and currency be closely connect with the subject just refer to and they also present some unsatisfactory feature prominent among they be the lack of elasticity in our currency circulation and its frequent concentration in financial center when it be most need in other part of the country the absolute divorcement of the government from the business of banking be the ideal relationship of the government to the circulation of the currency of the country this condition can not be immediately reach but as a step in that direction and as a means of secure a more elastic currency and obviate other objection to the present arrangement of bank circulation the secretary of the treasury present in his report a scheme modifying present banking law and provide for the issue of circulate note by state bank free from taxation under certain limitation the secretary explain his plan so plainly and its advantage be develop by he with such remarkable clearness that any effort on my part to present argument in its support would be superfluous i shall therefore content myself with an unqualified indorsement of the secretary 's propose change in the law and a brief and imperfect statement of their prominent feature it be propose to repeal all law provide for the deposit of united states bond as security for circulation to permit national bank to issue circulate note not exceed in amount 75 per cent of their pay up and unimpaired capital provide they deposit with the government as a guaranty fund in united states legal tender note include treasury note of 1890 a sum equal in amount to 30 per cent of the note they desire to issue this deposit to be maintain at all time but whenever any bank retire any part of its circulation a proportional part of its guaranty fund shall be return to it to permit the secretary of the treasury to prepare and keep on hand ready for issue in case an increase in circulation be desire blank national bank note for each bank have circulation and to repeal the provision of the present law impose limitation and restriction upon bank desire to reduce or increase their circulation thus permit such increase or reduction within the limit of 75 per cent of capital to be quickly make as emergency arise in addition to the guaranty fund require it be propose to provide a safety fund for the immediate redemption of the circulate note of fail bank by impose a small annual tax say one half of 1 per cent upon the average circulation of each bank until the fund amount to 5 per cent of the total circulation outstanding when a bank fail its guaranty fund be to be pay into this safety fund and its note be to be redeem in the first instance from such safety fund thus augment any impairment of such fund cause thereby to be make good from the immediately available cash asset of say bank and if these should be insufficient such impairment to be make good by pro rata assessment among the other bank their contribution constitute a first lien upon the asset of the fail bank in favor of the contribute bank as a further security it be contemplate that the exist provision fix the individual liability of stockholder be to be retain and the bank 's indebtedness on account of its circulate note be to be make a first lien on all its asset for the purpose of meet the expense of printing note official supervision cancellation and other like charge there shall be impose a tax of say one half of 1 per cent per annum upon the average amount of note in circulation it be far provide that there shall be no national bank note issue of a less denomination than $ 10 that each national bank except in case of a fail bank shall redeem or retire its note in the first instance at its own office or at agency to be designate by it and that no fixed reserve need be maintain on account of deposit another very important feature of this plan be the exemption of state bank from taxation by the united states in case where it be show to the satisfaction of the secretary of the treasury and comptroller of the currency by bank claim such exemption that they have not have outstanding their circulate note exceed 75 per cent of their pay up and unimpaired capital that their stockholder be individually liable for the redemption of their circulate note to the full extent of their ownership of stock that the liability of say bank upon their circulate note constitute under their state law a first lien upon their asset that such bank have keep and maintain a guaranty fund in united states legal tender note include treasury note of 1890 equal to 30 per cent of their outstanding circulating note and that such bank have promptly redeem their circulate note when present at their principal or branch office it be quite likely that this scheme may be usefully amend in some of its detail but i be satisfied it furnish a basis for a very great improvement in our present banking and currency system i conclude this communication fully appreciate that the responsibility for all legislation affect the people of the united states rest upon their representative in the congress and assure they that whether in accordance with recommendation i have make or not i shall be glad to cooperate in perfect any legislation that tend to the prosperity and welfare of our country
to the senate and house of representatives



 in my last annual message i commend to the serious consideration of the congress the condition of our national finance and in connection with the subject indorse a plan of currency legislation which at that time seem to furnish protection against impend danger this plan have not be approve by the congress in the meantime the situation have so change and the emergency now appear so threaten that i deem it my duty to ask at the hand of the legislative branch of the government such prompt and effective action as will restore confidence in our financial soundness and avert business disaster and universal distress among our people
 whatever may be the merit of the plan outline in my annual message as a remedy for ill then exist and as a safeguard against the depletion of the gold reserve then in the treasury i be now convinced that its reception by the congress and our present advanced stage of financial perplexity necessitate additional or different legislation
 with natural resource unlimited in variety and productive strength and with a people whose activity and enterprise seek only a fair opportunity to achieve national success and greatness our progress should not be check by a false financial policy and a heedless disregard of sound monetary law nor should the timidity and fear which they engender stand in the way of our prosperity
 it be hardly dispute that this predicament confront we to day therefore no one in any degree responsible for the making and execution of our law should fail to see a patriotic duty in honestly and sincerely attempt to relieve the situation manifestly this effort will not succeed unless it be make untrammele by the prejudice of partisanship and with a steadfast determination to resist the temptation to accomplish party advantage we may well remember that if we be threaten with financial difficulty all our people in every station of life be concern and surely those who suffer will not receive the promotion of party interest as an excuse for permit our present trouble to advance to a disastrous conclusion it be also of the utmost importance that we approach the study of the problem present as free as possible from the tyranny of preconceived opinion to the end that in a common danger we may be able to seek with unclouded vision a safe and reasonable protection
 the real trouble which confront we consist in a lack of confidence widespread and constantly increase in the continue ability or disposition of the government to pay its obligation in gold this lack of confidence grow to some extent out of the palpable and apparent embarrassment attend the effort of the government under exist law to procure gold and to a great extent out of the impossibility of either keep it in the treasury or cancel obligation by its expenditure after it be obtain
 the only way leave open to the government for procure gold be by the issue and sale of its bond the only bond that can be so issue be authorize nearly twenty five year ago and be not well calculate to meet our present need among other disadvantage they be make payable in coin instead of specifically in gold which in exist condition detract largely and in an increase ratio from their desirability as investment it be by no mean certain that bond of this description can much long be dispose of at a price creditable to the financial character of our government
 the most dangerous and irritate feature of the situation however remain to be mention it be find in the mean by which the treasury be despoiled of the gold thus obtain without cancel a single government obligation and solely for the benefit of those who find profit in ship it abroad or whose fear induce they to hoard it at home we have outstanding about five hundred million of currency note of the government for which gold may be demand and curiously enough the law require that when present and in fact redeem and pay in gold they shall be reissue thus the same note may do duty many time in draw gold from the treasury nor can the process be arrest as long as private party for profit or otherwise see an advantage in repeat the operation more than $ 300,000,000 in these note have already be redeem in gold and notwithstanding such redemption they be all still outstanding
 since the 17th day of january 1894 our bond interest bear debt have be increase $ 100,000,000 for the purpose of obtain gold to replenish our coin reserve two issue be make amounting to fifty million each one in january and the other in november as a result of the first issue there be realize something more than $ 58,000,000 in gold between that issue and the succeed one in november comprise a period of about ten month nearly $ 103,000,000 in gold be draw from the treasury this make the second issue necessary and upon that more than fifty eight million in gold be again realize between the date of this second issue and the present time cover a period of only about two month more than $ 69,000,000 in gold have be draw from the treasury these large sum of gold be expend without any cancellation of government obligation or in any permanent way benefit our people or improve our pecuniary situation
 the financial event of the past year suggest fact and condition which should certainly arrest attention
 more than $ 172,000,000 in gold have be draw out of the treasury during the year for the purpose of shipment abroad or hoard at home
 while nearly $ 103,000,000 of this amount be draw out during the first ten month of the year a sum aggregate more than two third of that amount be about $ 69,000,000 be draw out during the follow two month thus indicate a marked acceleration of the depleting process with the lapse of time
 the obligation upon which this gold have be draw from the treasury be still outstanding and be available for use in repeat the exhausting operation with short interval as our perplexity accumulate
 condition be certainly supervene tend to make the bond which may be issue to replenish our gold less useful for that purpose
 an adequate gold reserve be in all circumstance absolutely essential to the upholding of our public credit and to the maintenance of our high national character
 our gold reserve have again reach such a stage of diminution as to require its speedy reenforcement
 the aggravation that must inevitably follow present condition and method will certainly lead to misfortune and loss not only to our national credit and prosperity and to financial enterprise but to those of our people who seek employment as a means of livelihood and to those whose only capital be their daily labor
 it will hardly do to say that a simple increase of revenue will cure our trouble the apprehension now exist and constantly increase as to our financial ability do not rest upon a calculation of our revenue the time have pass when the eye of investor abroad and our people at home be fix upon the revenue of the government change condition have attract their attention to the gold of the government there need be no fear that we can not pay our current expense with such money as we have there be now in the treasury a comfortable surplus of more than $ 63,000,000 but it be not in gold and therefore do not meet our difficulty
 i can not see that difference of opinion concern the extent to which silver ought to be coin or use in our currency should interfere with the counsel of those whose duty it be to rectify evil now apparent in our financial situation they have to consider the question of national credit and the consequence that will follow from its collapse whatever idea may be insist upon as to silver or bimetallism a proper solution of the question now press upon we only require a recognition of gold as well as silver and a concession of its importance rightfully or wrongfully acquire as a basis of national credit a necessity in the honorable discharge of our obligation payable in gold and a badge of solvency i do not understand that the real fiend of silver desire a condition that might follow inaction or neglect to appreciate the meaning of the present exigency if it should result in the entire banishment of gold from our financial and currency arrangement
 besides the treasury note which certainly should be pay in gold amount to nearly $ 500,000,000 there will fall due in 1904 one hundred million of bond issue during the last year for which we have receive gold and in 1907 nearly six hundred million of 4 per cent bond issue in 1877 shall the payment of these obligation in gold be repudiate if they be to be pay in such a manner as the preservation of our national honor and national solvency demand we should not destroy or even imperil our ability to supply ourselves with gold for that purpose
 while i be not unfriendly to silver and while i desire to see it recognize to such an extent as be consistent with financial safety and the preservation of national honor and credit i be not willing to see gold entirely banish from our currency and finance to avert such a consequence i believe thorough and radical remedial legislation should be promptly pass i therefore beg the congress to give the subject immediate attention
 in my opinion the secretary of the treasury should be authorize to issue bond of the government for the purpose of procure and maintain a sufficient gold reserve and the redemption and cancellation of the united states legal tender note and the treasury note issue for the purchase of silver under the law of july 14 1890 we should be relieve from the humiliating process of issue bond to procure gold to be immediately and repeatedly draw out on these obligation for purpose not relate to the benefit of our government or our people the principal and interest of these bond should be payable on their face in gold because they should be sell only for gold or its representative and because there would now probably be difficulty in favorably dispose of bond not contain this stipulation i suggest that the bond be issue in denomination of twenty and fifty dollar and their multiple and that they bear interest at a rate not exceed 3 per cent per annum i do not see why they should not be payable fifty year from their date we of the present generation have large amount to pay if we meet our obligation and long bond be most salable the secretary of the treasury might well be permit at his discretion to receive on the sale of bond the legal tender and treasury note to be retire and of course when they be thus retire or redeem in gold they should be cancel
 these bond under exist law could be deposit by national bank as security for circulation and such bank should be allow to issue circulation up to the face value of these or any other bond so deposit except bond outstanding bear only 2 per cent interest and which sell in the market at less than par national bank should not be allow to take out circulate note of a less denomination than $ 10 and when such as be now outstanding reach the treasury except for redemption and retirement they should be cancel and note of the denomination of $ 10 and upward issue in their stead silver certificate of the denomination of $ 10 and upward should be replace by certificate of the denomination under $ 10
 as a constant mean for the maintenance of a reasonable supply of gold in the treasury our duty on import should be pay in gold allow all other due to the government to be pay in any other form of money
 i believe all the provision i have suggest should be embody in our law if we be to enjoy a complete reinstatement of a sound financial condition they need not interfere with any currency scheme provide for the increase of the circulate medium through the agency of national or state bank that may commend itself to the congress since they can easily be adjust to such a scheme objection have be make to the issuance of interest bear obligation for the purpose of retire the noninterest bear legal tender note in point of fact however these note have burden we with a large load of interest and it be still accumulate the aggregate interest on the original issue of bond the proceed of which in gold constitute the reserve for the payment of these note amount to $ 70,326,250 on january 1 1895 and the annual charge for interest on these bond and those issue for the same purpose during the last year will be $ 9,145,000 date from january 1 1895
 while the cancellation of these note would not relieve we from the obligation already incur on their account these figure be give by way of suggest that their existence have not be free from interest charge and that the long they be outstanding judge from the experience of the last year the more expensive they will become
 in conclusion i desire to frankly confess my reluctance to issue more bond in present circumstance and with no well result than have lately follow that course i can not however refrain from add to an assurance of my anxiety to cooperate with the present congress in any reasonable measure of relief an expression of my determination to leave nothing undo which furnish a hope for improve the situation or check a suspicion of our disinclination or disability to meet with the strict honor every national obligation

to the congress of the united states
 since my recent communication to the congress call attention to our financial condition and suggest legislation which i deem essential to our national welfare and credit the anxiety and apprehension then exist in business circle have continue
 as a precaution therefore against the failure of timely legislative aid through congressional action cautious preparation have be pende to employ to the good possible advantage in default of well mean such executive authority as may without additional legislation be exercise for the purpose of reenforce and maintain in our treasury an adequate and safe gold reserve
 in the judgment of those especially charge with this responsibility the business situation be so critical and the legislative situation be so unpromising with the omission thus far on the part of congress to beneficially enlarge the power of the secretary of the treasury in the premise as to enjoin immediate executive action with the facility now at hand
 therefore in pursuance of section 3700 of the revised statutes the detail of an arrangement have this day be conclude with party abundantly able to fulfill their undertaking whereby bond of the united states authorize under the act of july 14 1875 payable in coin thirty year after their date with interest at the rate of 4 per cent per annum to the amount of a little less than $ 62,400,000 be to be issue for the purchase of gold coin amount to a sum slightly in excess of $ 65,000,000 to be deliver to the treasury of the united states which sum add to the gold now hold in our reserve will so restore such reserve as to make it amount to something more than $ 100,000,000 such a premium be to be allow to the government upon the bond as to fix the rate of interest upon the amount of gold realize at 3 3/4 per cent per annum at least one half of the gold to be obtain be to be supply from abroad which be a very important and favorable feature of the transaction
 the privilege be especially reserve to the government to substitute at par within ten day from this date in lieu of the 4 per cent coin bond other bond in term payable in gold and bear only 3 per cent interest if the issue of the same should in the meantime be authorize by the congress
 the arrangement thus complete which after careful inquiry appear in present circumstance and consider all the object desire to be the well attainable develop such a difference in the estimation of investor between bond make payable in coin and those specifically make payable in gold in favor of the latter as be represent by three fourth of a cent in annual interest in the agreement just conclude the annual saving in interest to the government if 3 per cent gold bond should be substitute for 4 per cent coin bond under the privilege reserve would be $ 539,159 amount in thirty year or at the maturity of the coin bond to $ 16,174,770
 of course there never should be a doubt in any quarter as to the redemption in gold of the bond of the government which be make payable in coin therefore the discrimination in the judgment of investor between our bond obligation payable in coin and those specifically make payable in gold be very significant it be hardly necessary to suggest that whatever may be our view on the subject the sentiment or preference of those with whom we must negotiate in dispose of our bond for gold be not subject to our dictation
 i have only to add that in my opinion the transaction herein detail for the information of the congress promise well result than the effort previously make in the direction of effectively add to our gold reserve through the sale of bond and i believe it will tend as far as such action can in present circumstance to meet the determination express in the law repeal the silver purchase clause of the act of july 14 1890 and that in the language of such repeal act the arrangement make will aid our effort to insure the maintenance of the parity in value of the coin of the two metal and the equal power of every dollar at all time in the market and in the payment of debt

to the congress of the united states the present assemblage of the legislative branch of our government occur at a time when the interest of our people and the need of the country give especial prominence to the condition of our foreign relation and the exigency of our national finance the report of the head of the several administrative departments of the government fully and plainly exhibit what have be accomplish within the scope of their respective duty and present such recommendation for the betterment of our country 's condition as patriotic and intelligent labor and observation suggest i therefore deem my executive duty adequately perform at this time by present to the congress the important phase of our situation as relate to our intercourse with foreign nation and a statement of the financial problem which confront we omitting except as they be relate to these topic any reference to departmental operation i earnestly invite however not only the careful consideration but the severely critical scrutiny of the congress and my fellow countryman to the report concern these departmental operation if justly and fairly examine they will furnish proof of assiduous and painstaking care for the public welfare i press the recommendation they contain upon the respectful attention of those charge with the duty of legislation because i believe their adoption would promote the people 's good by amendatory tariff legislation in january last the argentine republic recognize the value of the large market open to the free importation of its wool under our last tariff act have admit certain product of the united states to entry at reduce duty it be pleasing to note that the effort we have make to enlarge the exchange of trade on a sound basis of mutual benefit be in this instance appreciate by the country from which our woolen factory draw their needful supply of raw material the missions boundary dispute between the argentine republic and brazil refer to the president of the united states as arbitrator during the term of my predecessor and which be submit to i for determination result in an award in favor of brazil upon the historical and documentary evidence present thus end a long protract controversy and again demonstrate the wisdom and desirability of settle international boundary dispute by recourse to friendly arbitration negotiation be progress for a revival of the united states and chilean claims commission whose work be abruptly terminate last year by the expiration of the stipulate time within which award could be make the resumption of specie payment by chile be a step of great interest and importance both in its direct consequence upon her own welfare and as evince the ascendency of sound financial principle in one of the most influential of the south american republics the close of the momentous struggle between china and japan while relieve the diplomatic agent of this government from the delicate duty they undertake at the request of both country of render such service to the subject of either belligerent within the territorial limit of the other as our neutral position permit develop a domestic condition in the chinese empire which have cause much anxiety and call for prompt and careful attention either as a result of a weak control by the central government over the provincial administration follow a diminution of traditional governmental authority under the stress of an overwhelming national disaster or as a manifestation upon good opportunity of the aversion of the chinese population to all foreign way and undertaking there have occur in widely separate province of china serious outbreak of the old fanatical spirit against foreigner which unchecke by the local authority if not actually connive at by they have culminate in mob attack on foreign missionary station cause much destruction of property and attend with personal injury as well as loss of life although but one american citizen be report to have be actually wound and although the destruction of property may have fall more heavily upon the missionary of other nationality than our own it plainly behoove this government to take the most prompt and decide action to guard against similar or perhaps more dreadful calamity befall the hundred of american mission station which have grow up throughout the interior of china under the temperate rule of toleration custom and imperial edict the demand of the united states and other power for the degradation and punishment of the responsible official of the respective city and province who by neglect or otherwise have permit uprising and for the adoption of stern measure by the emperor 's government for the protection of the life and property of foreigner be follow by the disgrace and dismissal of certain provincial official find derelict in duty and the punishment by death of a number of those adjudge guilty of actual participation in the outrage this government also insist that a special american commission should visit the province where the first disturbance occur for the purpose of investigation the latter commission form after much opposition have go overland from tientsin accompany by a suitable chinese escort and by its demonstration of the readiness and ability of our government to protect its citizen will act it be believe as a most influential deterrent of any similar outbreak the energetic step we have thus take be all the more likely to result in future safety to our citizen in china because the imperial government be i be persuade entirely convinced that we desire only the liberty and protection of our own citizen and redress for any wrong they may have suffer and that we have no ulterior design or object political or otherwise china will not forget either our kindly service to her citizen during her late war nor the further fact that while furnish all the facility at our command to further the negotiation of a peace between she and japan we seek no advantage and interpose no counsel the government of both china and japan have in special dispatch transmit through their respective diplomatic representative express in a most pleasing manner their grateful appreciation of our assistance to their citizen during the unhappy struggle and of the value of our aid in pave the way to their resumption of peaceful relation the customary cordial relation between this country and france have be undisturbed with the exception that a full explanation of the treatment of john l. waller by the expeditionary military authority of france still remain to be give mr. waller formerly united states consul at tamatav remain in madagascar after his term of office expire and be apparently successful in procure business concession from the hovas of great or less value after the occupation of tamatav and the declaration of martial law by the french he be arrest upon various charge among they that of communicate military information to the enemy of france be try and convict by a military tribunal and sentence to twenty year imprisonment follow the course justify by abundant precedent this government request from that of france the record of the proceeding of the french tribunal which result in mr. waller 's condemnation this request have be comply with to the extent of supply a copy of the official record from which appear the constitution and organization of the court the charge as formulate and the general course and result of the trial and by which it be show that the accuse be try in open court and be defend by counsel but the evidence adduce in support of the charge which be not receive by the french minister for foreign affair till the first week in october have thus far be withhold the french government take the ground that its production in response to our demand would establish a bad precedent the effort of our ambassador to procure it however though impede by recent change in the french ministry have not be relax and it be confidently expect that some satisfactory solution of the matter will shortly be reach meanwhile it appear that mr. waller 's confinement have every alleviation which the state of his health and all the other circumstance of the case demand or permit in agreeable contrast to the difference above note respect a matter of common concern where nothing be seek except such a mutually satisfactory outcome as the true merit of the case require be the recent resolution of the french chambers favor the conclusion of a permanent treaty of arbitration between the two country an invitation have be extend by france to the government and people of the united states to participate in a great international exposition at paris in 1900 as a suitable commemoration of the close of this the world 's marvelous century of progress i heartily recommend its acceptance together with such legislation as will adequately provide for a due representation of this government and its people on the occasion our relation with the states of the german empire be in some aspect typical of a condition of thing elsewhere find in country whose production and trade be similar to our own the close rivalry of compete industry the influence of the delusive doctrine that the internal development of a nation be promote and its wealth increase by a policy which in undertaking to reserve its home market for the exclusive use of its own producer necessarily obstruct their sale in foreign market and prevent free access to the product of the world the desire to retain trade in time wear rut regardless of the inexorable law of new need and change condition of demand and supply and our own halting tardiness in invite a free exchange of commodity and by this mean imperil our footing in the external market naturally open to we have create a situation somewhat injurious to american export interest not only in germany where they be perhaps most noticeable but in adjacent country the export affect be largely american cattle and other food product the reason assign for unfavorable discrimination be that their consumption be deleterious to the public health this be all the more irritate in view of the fact that no european state be as jealous of the excellence and wholesomeness of its export food supply as the united states nor so easily able on account of inherent soundness to guarantee those quality nor be these difficulty confine to our food product design for exportation our great insurance company for example having build up a vast business abroad and invest a large share of their gain in foreign country in compliance with the local law and regulation then exist now find themselves within a narrowing circle of onerous and unforeseen condition and be confront by the necessity of retirement from a field thus make unprofitable if indeed they be not summarily expel as some of they have lately be from prussia it be not to be forget that international trade can not be one side its current be alternate and its movement should be honestly reciprocal without this it almost necessarily degenerate into a device to gain advantage or a contrivance to secure benefit with only the semblance of a return in our dealing with other nation we ought to be open handed and scrupulously fair this should be our policy as a produce nation and it plainly become we as a people who love generosity and the moral aspect of national good faith and reciprocal forbearance these consideration should not however constrain we to submit to unfair discrimination nor to silently acquiesce in vexatious hindrance to the enjoyment of our share of the legitimate advantage of proper trade relation if an examination of the situation suggest such measure on our part as would involve restriction similar to those from which we suffer the way to such a course be easy it should however by no mean be lightly enter upon since the necessity for the inauguration of such a policy would be regret by the good sentiment of our people and because it naturally and logically might lead to consequence of the grave character i take pleasure in call to your attention the encomium bestow on those vessel of our new navy which take part in the notable ceremony of the opening of the kiel canal it be fitting that this extraordinary achievement of the new german nationality should be celebrate in the presence of america 's exposition of the late development of the world s naval energy our relation with great britain always intimate and important have demand during the past year even a great share of consideration than be usual several vexatious question be leave undetermined by the decision of the bering sea arbitration tribunal the application of the principle lay down by that august body have not be follow by the result they be intend to accomplish either because the principle themselves lack in breadth and definiteness or because their execution have be more or less imperfect much correspondence have be exchange between the two government on the subject of prevent the exterminate slaughter of seal the insufficiency of the british patrol of bering sea under the regulation agree on by the two government have be point out and yet only two british ship have be on police duty during this season in those water the need of a more effective enforcement of exist regulation as well as the adoption of such additional regulation as experience have show to be absolutely necessary to carry out the intent of the award have be earnestly urge upon the british government but thus far without effective result in the meantime the depletion of the seal herd by mean of pelagic hunting have so alarmingly progress that unless their slaughter be at once effectively check their extinction within a few year seem to be a matter of absolute certainty the understanding by which the united states be to pay and great britain to receive a lump sum of $ 425,000 in full settlement of all british claim for damage arise from our seizure of british sealing vessel unauthorized under the award of the paris tribunal of arbitration be not confirm by the last congress which decline to make the necessary appropriation i be still of the opinion that this arrangement be a judicious and advantageous one for the government and i earnestly recommend that it be again consider and sanction if however this do not meet with the favor of congress it certainly will hardly dissent from the proposition that the government be bind by every consideration of honor and good faith to provide for the speedy adjustment of these claim by arbitration as the only other alternative a treaty of arbitration have therefore be agree upon and will be immediately lay before the senate so that in one of the mode suggest a final settlement may be reach notwithstanding that great britain originate the proposal to enforce international rule for the prevention of collision at sea base on the recommendation of the maritime conference of washington and concur in suggest march 11 1895 as the date to be set by proclamation for carry these rule into general effect her majesty 's government having encounter opposition on the part of british shipping interest announce its inability to accept that date which be consequently cancel the entire matter be still in abeyance without prospect of a well condition in the near future the commissioner appoint to mark the international boundary in passamaquoddy bay accord to the description of the treaty of ghent have not yet fully agree the completion of the preliminary survey of that alaskan boundary which follow the contour of the coast from the southernmost point of prince of wales island until it strike the one hundred and forty first meridian at or near the summit of mount st. elias await far necessary appropriation which be urgently recommend this survey be undertake under the provision of the convention enter into by this country and great britain july 22 1892 and the supplementary convention of february 3 1894.as to the remain section of the alaskan boundary which follow the one hundred and forty first meridian northwardly from mount st. elias to the frozen ocean the settlement of which involve the physical location of the meridian mention no conventional agreement have yet be make the ascertainment of a give meridian at a particular point be a work require much time and careful observation and survey such observation and survey be undertake by the united states coast and geodetic survey in 1890 and 1891 while similar work in the same quarter under british auspex be believe to give nearly coincident result but these survey have be independently conduct and no international agreement to mark those or any other part of the one hundred and forty first meridian by permanent monument have yet be make in the meantime the valley of the yukon be become a highway through the hitherto unexplored wild of alaska and abundant mineral wealth have be discover in that region especially at or near the junction of the boundary meridian with the yukon and its tributary in these circumstance it be expedient and indeed imperative that the jurisdictional limit of the respective government in this new region be speedily determine her britannic majesty 's government have propose a joint delimitation of the one hundred and forty first meridian by an international commission of expert which if congress will authorize it and make due provision therefor can be accomplish with no unreasonable delay it be impossible to overlook the vital importance of continue the work already enter upon and supplement it by further effective measure look to the exact location of this entire boundary line i call attention to the unsatisfactory delimitation of the respective jurisdiction of the united states and the dominion of canada in the great lakes at the approach to the narrow water that connect they the water in question be frequent by fisherman of both nationality and their net be there use owe to the uncertainty and ignorance as to the true boundary vexation dispute and injurious seizure of boat and net by canadian cruiser often occur while any positive settlement thereof by an accepted standard be not easily to be reach a joint commission to determine the line in those quarter on a practical basis by measured course follow range mark on shore be a necessity for which immediate provision should be make it be apparent that the boundary dispute between great britain and the republic of venezuela concern the limit of british guiana be approach an acute stage a definite statement of the interest and policy of the united states as regard the controversy seem to be require both on its own account and in view of its relation with the friendly power directly concern in july last therefore a dispatch be address to our ambassador at london for communication to the british government in which the attitude of the united states be fully and distinctly set forth the general conclusion therein reach and formulate be in substance that the traditional and established policy of this government be firmly opposed to a forcible increase by any european power of its territorial possession on this continent that this policy be as well rounded in principle as it be strongly support by numerous precedent that as a consequence the united states be bind to protest against the enlargement of the area of british guiana in derogation of the right and against the will of venezuela that consider the disparity in strength of great britain and venezuela the territorial dispute between they can be reasonably settle only by friendly and impartial arbitration and that the resort to such arbitration should include the whole controversy and be not satisfied if one of the power concern be permit to draw an arbitrary line through the territory in debate and to declare that it will submit to arbitration only the portion lie on one side of it in view of these conclusion the dispatch in question call upon the british government for a definite answer to the question whether it would or would not submit the territorial controversy between itself and venezuela in its entirety to impartial arbitration the answer of the british government have not yet be receive but be expect shortly when further communication on the subject will probably be make to the congress early in january last an uprising against the government of hawaii be promptly suppress martial law be forthwith proclaim and numerous arrest be make of person suspect of be in sympathy with the royalist party among these be several citizen of the united states who be either convict by a military court and sentence to death imprisonment or fine or be deport without trial the united states while deny protection to such as have take the hawaiian oath of allegiance insist that martial law though alter the form of justice could not supersede justice itself and demand stay of execution until the proceeding have be submit to this government and knowledge obtain therefrom that our citizen have receive fair trial the death sentence be subsequently commute or be remit on condition of leave the island the case of certain americans arrest and expel by arbitrary order without formal charge or trial have have attention and in some instance have be find to justify remonstrance and a claim for indemnity which hawaii have not thus far concede mr. thurston the hawaiian minister having furnish this government abundant reason for ask that he be recall that course be pursue and his successor have lately be receive the deplorable lynching of several italian laborer in colorado be naturally follow by international representation and i be happy to say that the good effort of the state in which the outrage occur have be put forth to discover and punish the author of this atrocious crime the dependent family of some of the unfortunate victim invite by their deplorable condition gracious provision for their need these manifestation against helpless alien may be trace through successive stage to the vicious padroni system which unchecke by our immigration and contract labor statute control these worker from the moment of land on our shore and farm they out in distant and often rude region where their cheapening competition in the field of bread win toil bring they into collision with other labor interest while welcome as we should those who seek our shore to merge themselves in our body politic and win personal competence by honest effort we can not regard such assemblage of distinctively alien laborer hire out in the mass to the profit of alien speculator and ship hither and thither as the prospect of gain may dictate as otherwise than repugnant to the spirit of our civilization deterrent to individual advancement and hindrance to the building up of stable community rest upon the wholesome ambition of the citizen and constitute the prime factor in the prosperity and progress of our nation if legislation can reach this grow evil it certainly should be attempt japan have furnish abundant evidence of her vast gain in every trait and characteristic that constitute a nation 's greatness we have reason for congratulation in the fact that the government of the united states by the exchange of liberal treaty stipulation with the new japan be the first to recognize her wonderful advance and to extend to she the consideration and confidence due to her national enlightenment and progressive character the boundary dispute which lately threaten to embroil guatemala and mexico have happily yield to pacific counsel and its determination have by the joint agreement of the party be submit to the sole arbitration of the united states minister to mexico the commission appoint under the convention of february 18 1889 to set new monument along the boundary between the united states and mexico have complete its task as a sequel to the failure of a scheme for the colonization in mexico of negro mostly immigrant from alabama under contract a great number of these helpless and suffer people starve and smitten with contagious disease make their way or be assist to the frontier where in wretched plight they be quarantine by the texas authority learn of their destitute condition i direct ration to be temporarily furnish they through the war department at the expiration of their quarantine they be convey by the railway company at comparatively nominal rate to their home in alabama upon my assurance in the absence of any fund available for the cost of their transportation that i would recommend to congress an appropriation for its payment i now strongly urge upon congress the propriety of make such an appropriation it should be remember that the measure take be dictate not only by sympathy and humanity but by a conviction that it be not compatible with the dignity of this government that so large a body of our dependent citizen should be throw for relief upon the charity of a neighboring state in last year 's message i narrate at some length the jurisdictional question then freshly arise in the mosquito indian strip of nicaragua since that time by the voluntary act of the mosquito nation the territory reserve to they have be incorporate with nicaragua the indians formally subject themselves to be govern by the general law and regulation of the republic instead of by their own custom and regulation and thus avail themselves of a privilege secure to they by the treaty between nicaragua and great britain of january 28 1860.after this extension of uniform nicaraguan administration to the mosquito strip the case of the british vice consul hatch and of several of his countryman who have be summarily expel from nicaragua and treat with considerable indignity provoke a claim by great britain upon nicaragua for pecuniary indemnity which upon nicaragua 's refusal to admit liability be enforce by great britain while the sovereignty and jurisdiction of nicaragua be in no way question by great britain the former 's arbitrary conduct in regard to british subject furnish the ground for this proceeding a

the united states be invoke and be employ in favor of as peaceful a settlement and as much consideration and indulgence toward nicaragua as be consistent with the nature of the case our effort have since be make the subject of appreciative and grateful recognition by nicaragua the coronation of the czar of russia at moscow in may next invite the ceremonial participation of the united states and in accordance with usage and diplomatic propriety our minister to the imperial court have be direct to represent our government on the occasion correspondence be on foot touch the practice of russian consul within the jurisdiction of the united states to interrogate citizen as to their race and religious faith and upon ascertainment thereof to deny to jews authentication of passport or legal document for use in russia inasmuch as such a proceeding impose a disability which in the case of succession to property in russia may be find to infringe the treaty right of our citizen and which be an obnoxious invasion of our territorial jurisdiction it have elicit fitting remonstrance the result of which it be hope will remove the cause of complaint the pende claim of seal vessel of the united states seize in russian water remain unadjusted our recent convention with russia establish a modus vivendi as to imperial jurisdiction in such case have prevent further difficulty of this nature the russian government have welcome in principle our suggestion for a modus vivendi to embrace great britain and japan look to the well preservation of seal life in the north pacific and bering sea and the extension of the protect area define by the paris tribunal to all pacific water north of the thirty fifth parallel it be especially noticeable that russia favor prohibition of the use of firearm in seal hunting throughout the propose area and a long closed season for pelagic sealing in my last two annual message i call the attention of the congress to the position we occupy as one of the party to a treaty or agreement by which we became jointly bind with england and germany to so interfere with the government and control of samoa as in effect to assume the management of its affair on the 9th day of may 1894 i transmit to the senate a special message with accompany document give information on the subject and emphasize the opinion i have at all time entertain that our situation in this matter be inconsistent with the mission and tradition of our government in violation of the principle we profess and in all its phase mischievous and vexatious i again press this subject upon the attention of the congress and ask for such legislative action or expression as will lead the way to our relief from obligation both irksome and unnatural cuba be again gravely disturb an insurrection in some respect more active than the last precede revolt which continue from 1868 to 1878 now exist in a large part of the eastern interior of the island menace even some population on the coast besides derange the commercial exchange of the island of which our country take the predominant share this flagrant condition of hostility by arouse sentimental sympathy and incite adventurous support among our people have entail earnest effort on the part of this government to enforce obedience to our neutrality law and to prevent the territory of the united states from be abuse as a vantage ground from which to aid those in arm against spanish sovereignty whatever may be the traditional sympathy of our countryman as individual with a people who seem to be struggle for large autonomy and great freedom deepen as such sympathy naturally must be in behalf of our neighbor yet the plain duty of their government be to observe in good faith the recognize obligation of international relationship the performance of this duty should not be make more difficult by a disregard on the part of our citizen of the obligation grow out of their allegiance to their country which should restrain they from violate as individual the neutrality which the nation of which they be member be bind to observe in its relation to friendly sovereign state though neither the warmth of our people 's sympathy with the cuban insurgent nor our loss and material damage consequent upon the futile endeavor thus far make to restore peace and order nor any shock our humane sensibility may have receive from the cruelty which appear to especially characterize this sanguinary and fiercely conduct war have in the least shake the determination of the government to honestly fulfill every international obligation yet it be to be earnestly hope on every ground that the devastation of armed conflict may speedily be stay and order and quiet restore to the distracted island bring in their train the activity and thrift of peaceful pursuit one notable instance of interference by spain with pass american ship have occur on march 8 last the allianca while bind from colon to new york and follow the customary track for vessel near the cuban shore but outside the 3 mile limit be fire upon by a spanish gunboat protest be promptly make by the united states against this act as not be justify by a state of war nor permissible in respect of vessel on the usual path of commerce nor tolerable in view of the wanton peril occasion to innocent life and property the act be disavow with full expression of regret and assurance of nonrecurrence of such just cause of complaint while the offend officer be relieve of his command military arrest of citizen of the united states in cuba have occasion frequent reclamation where hold on criminal charge their delivery to the ordinary civil jurisdiction for trial have be demand and obtain in conformity with treaty provision and where merely detain by way of military precaution under a proclaimed state of siege without formulated accusation their release or trial have be insist upon the right of american consular officer in the island to prefer protest and demand in such case having be question by the insular authority their enjoyment of the privilege stipulate by treaty for the consul of germany be claim under the most favor nation provision of our own convention and be promptly recognize the long stand demand of antonio maximo mora against spain have at last be settle by the payment on the 14th of september last of the sum originally agree upon in liquidation of the claim its distribution among the party entitle to receive it have proceed as rapidly as the right of those claim the fund could be safely determine the enforcement of differential duty against product of this country export to cuba and puerto rico prompt the immediate claim on our part to the benefit of the minimum tariff of spain in return for the most favorable treatment permit by our law as regard the production of spanish territory a commercial arrangement be conclude in january last secure the treatment so claim vigorous protest against excessive fine impose on our ship and merchandise by the custom officer of these island for trivial error have result in the remission of such fine in instance where the equity of the complaint be apparent though the vexatious practice have not be wholly discontinue occurrence in turkey have continue to excite concern the report massacre of christians in armenia and the development there and in other district of a spirit of fanatic hostility to christian influence naturally excite apprehension for the safety of the devoted man and woman who as dependent of the foreign missionary society in the united states reside in turkey under the guaranty of law and usage and in the legitimate performance of their educational and religious mission no effort have be spare in their behalf and their protection in person and property have be earnestly and vigorously enforce by every mean within our power i regret however that an attempt on our part to obtain well information concern the true condition of affair in the disturbed quarter of the ottoman empire by send thither the united states consul at sivas to make investigation and report be thwart by the objection of the turkish government this movement on our part be in no sense mean as a gratuitous entanglement of the united states in the so call eastern question nor as an officious interference with the right and duty which belong by treaty to certain great european power call for their intervention in political matter affect the good government and religious freedom of the non mussulman subject of the sultan but it arise solely from our desire to have an accurate knowledge of the condition in our effort to care for those entitle to our protection the presence of our naval vessel which be now in the vicinity of the disturb locality afford opportunity to acquire a measure of familiarity with the condition of affair and will enable we to take suitable step for the protection of any interest of our countryman within reach of our ship that might be find imperil the ottoman government have lately issue an imperial irade exempting forever from taxation an american college for girl at scutari repeat assurance have also be obtain by our envoy at constantinople that similar institution maintain and administer by our countryman shall be secure in the enjoyment of all right and that our citizen throughout the empire shall be protect the government however in view of exist fact be far from rely upon such assurance as the limit of its duty our minister have be vigilant and alert in afford all possible protection in individual case where danger threaten or safety be imperil we have send ship as far toward the point of actual disturbance as it be possible for they to go where they offer refuge to those oblige to flee and we have the promise of other power which have ship in the neighborhood that our citizen as well as theirs will be receive and protect on board those ship on the demand of our minister order have be issue by the sultan that turkish soldier shall guard and escort to the coast american refugee these order have be carry out and our late intelligence give assurance of the present personal safety of our citizen and missionary though thus far no life of american citizen have be sacrifice there can be no doubt that serious loss and destruction of mission property have result from riotous conflict and outrageous attack by treaty several of the most powerful european power have secure a right and have assume a duty not only in behalf of their own citizen and in furtherance of their own interest but as agent of the christian world their right be to enforce such conduct of turkish government as will restrain fanatical brutality and if this fail their duty be to so interfere as to insure against such dreadful occurrence in turkey as have lately shock civilization the power declare this right and this duty to be theirs alone and it be earnestly hope that prompt and effective action on their part will not be delay the new consulate at erzerum and harpoot for which appropriation be make last session have be provisionally fill by trust employee of the department of state these appointee though now in turkey have not yet receive their exequatur the arbitration of the claim of the venezuela steam transportation company under the treaty of january 19 1892 between the united states and venezuela result in an award in favor of the claimant the government have use its good office toward compose the difference between venezuela on the one hand and france and belgium on the other grow out of the dismissal of the representative of those power on the ground of a publication deem offensive to venezuela although that dismissal be couple with a cordial request that other more personally agreeable envoy be send in their stead a rupture of intercourse ensue and still continue in view of the growth of our interest in foreign country and the encouraging prospect for a general expansion of our commerce the question of an improvement in the consular service have increase in importance and urgency though there be no doubt that the great body of consular officer be render valuable service to the trade and industry of the country the need of some plan of appointment and control which would tend to secure a high average of efficiency can not be deny the importance of the subject have lead the executive to consider what step might properly be take without additional legislation to answer the need of a well system of consular appointment the matter having be commit to the consideration of the secretary of state in pursuance of his recommendation an executive order be issue on the 20th of september 1895 by the term of which it be provide that after that date any vacancy in a consulate or commercial agency with an annual salary or compensation from official fee of not more than $ 2,500 or less than $ 1,000 should be fill either by transfer or promotion from some other position under the department of state of a character tend to qualify the incumbent for the position to be fill or by the appointment of a person not under the department of state but having previously serve thereunder and show his capacity and fitness for consular duty or by the appointment of a person who having be select by the president and send to a board for examination be find upon such examination to be qualified for the position post which pay less than $ 1,000 be usually on account of their small compensation fill by selection from resident of the locality it be not deem practicable to put they under the new system the compensation of $ 2,500 be adopt as the maximum limit in the classification for the reason that consular officer receive more than that sum be often charge with function and duty scarcely inferior in dignity and importance to those of diplomatic agent and it be therefore think well to continue their selection in the discretion of the executive without subject they to examination before a board exclude 71 place with compensation at present less than $ 1,000 and 53 place above the maximum in compensation the number of position remain within the scope of the order be 196 this number will undoubtedly be increase by the inclusion of consular officer whose remuneration in fee now less than $ 1,000 will be augment with the growth of our foreign commerce and a return to more favorable business condition in execution of the executive order refer to the secretary of state have designate as a board to conduct the prescribed examination the third assistant secretary of state the solicitor of the department of state and the chief of the consular bureau and have specify the subject to which such examination shall relate it be not assume that this system will prove a full measure of consular reform it be quite probable that actual experience will show particular in which the order already issue may be amend and demonstrate that for the good result appropriate legislation by congress be imperatively require in any event these effort to improve the consular service ought to be immediately supplement by legislation provide for consular inspection this have frequently be a subject of executive recommendation and i again urge such action by congress as will permit the frequent and thorough inspection of consulate by officer appoint for that purpose or by person already in the diplomatic or consular service the expense attend such a plan would be insignificant compare with its usefulness and i hope the legislation necessary to set it on foot will be speedily forthcoming i be thoroughly convinced that in addition to their salary our ambassador and minister at foreign court should be provide by the government with official residence the salary of these officer be comparatively small and in most case insufficient to pay with other necessary expense the cost of maintain household establishment in keep with their important and delicate function the usefulness of a nation 's diplomatic representative undeniably depend much upon the appropriateness of his surrounding and a country like ours while avoid unnecessary glitter and show should be certain that it do not suffer in its relation with foreign nation through parsimony and shabbiness in its diplomatic outfit these consideration and the other advantage of having fix and somewhat permanent location for our embassy would abundantly justify the moderate expenditure necessary to carry out this suggestion as we turn from a review of our foreign relation to the contemplation of our national financial situation we be immediately aware that we approach a subject of domestic concern more important than any other that can engage our attention and one at present in such a perplexing and delicate predicament as to require prompt and wise treatment we may well be encourage to earnest effort in this direction when we recall the step already take toward improve our economic and financial situation and when we appreciate how well the way have be prepare for further progress by an aroused and intelligent popular interest in these subject by command of the people a custom revenue system design for the protection and benefit of favor class at the expense of the great mass of our countryman and which while inefficient for the purpose of revenue curtail our trade relation and impede our entrance to the market of the world have be supersede by a tariff policy which in principle be base upon a denial of the right of the government to obstruct the avenue to our people 's cheap living or lessen their comfort and contentment for the sake of accord especial advantage to favorite and which while encourage our intercourse and trade with other nation recognize the fact that american self reliance thrift and ingenuity can build up our country 's industry and develop its resource more surely than enervate paternalism the compulsory purchase and coinage of silver by the government unchecked and unregulate by business condition and heedless of our currency need which for more than fifteen year dilute our circulate medium undermined confidence abroad in our financial ability and at last culminate in distress and panic at home have be recently stop by the repeal of the law which force this reckless scheme upon the country the thing thus accomplish notwithstanding their extreme importance and beneficent effect fall far short of cure the monetary evil from which we suffer as a result of long indulgence in ill advise financial expedient the currency denominate united states note and commonly know as greenback be issue in large volume during the late civil war and be intend originally to meet the exigency of that period it will be see by a reference to the debate in congress at the time the law be pass authorize the issue of these note that their advocate declare they be intend for only temporary use and to meet the emergency of war in almost if not all the law relate to they some provision be make contemplate their voluntary or compulsory retirement a large quantity of they however be keep on foot and mingle with the currency of the country so that at the close of the year 1874 they amount to $ 381,999,073.immediately after that date and in january 1875 a law be pass provide for the resumption of specie payment by which the secretary of the treasury be require whenever additional circulation be issue to national bank to retire united states note equal in amount to 80 per cent of such additional national bank circulation until such note be reduce to $ 300,000,000 this law far provide that on and after the 1st day of january 1879 the united states note then outstanding should be redeem in coin and in order to provide and prepare for such redemption the secretary of the treasury be authorize not only to use any surplus revenue of the government but to issue bond of the united states and dispose of they for coin and to use the proceed for the purpose contemplate by the statute in may 1878 and before the date thus appoint for the redemption and retirement of these note another statute be pass forbid their further cancellation and retirement some of they have however be previously redeem and cancel upon the issue of additional national bank circulation as permit by the law of 1875 so that the amount outstanding at the time of the passage of the act forbid their further retirement be $ 346,681,016.the law of 1878 do not stop at distinct prohibition but contain in addition the follow express provision and when any of say note may be redeem or be receive into the treasury under any law from any source whatever and shall belong to the united states they shall not be retire cancel or destroy but they shall be reissue and pay out again and keep in circulation this be the condition of affair on the 1st day of january 1879 which have be fix upon four year before as the date for enter upon the redemption and retirement of all these note and for which such abundant mean have be provide the government be put in the anomalous situation of owe to the holder of its note debt payable in gold on demand which could neither be retire by receive such note in discharge of obligation due the government nor cancel by actual payment in gold it be force to redeem without redemption and to pay without acquittance there have be issue and sell $ 95,500,000 of the bond authorize by the resumption act of 1875 the proceed of which together with other gold in the treasury create a gold fund deem sufficient to meet the demand which might be make upon it for the redemption of the outstanding united states note this fund together with such other gold as might be from time to time in the treasury available for the same purpose have be since call our gold reserve and $ 100,000,000 have be regard as an adequate amount to accomplish its object this fund amount on the 1st day of january 1879 to $ 114,193,360 and though thereafter constantly fluctuate it do not fall below that sum until july 1892 in april 1893 for the first time since its establishment this reserve amount to less than $ 100,000,000 contain at that date only $ 97,011,330.in the meantime and in july 1890 an act have be pass direct large governmental monthly purchase of silver than have be require under previous law and provide that in payment for such silver treasury note of the united states should be issue payable on demand in gold or silver coin at the discretion of the secretary of the treasury it be however declare in the act to be the establish policy of the united states to maintain the two metal on a parity with each other upon the present legal ratio or such ratio as may be provide by law in view of this declaration it be not deem permissible for the secretary of the treasury to exercise the discretion in term confer on he by refuse to pay gold on these note when demand because by such discrimination in favor of the gold dollar the so call parity of the two metal would be destroy and grave and dangerous consequence would be precipitate by affirm or accentuate the constantly widen disparity between their actual value under the exist ratio it thus result that the treasury note issue in payment of silver purchase under the law of 1890 be necessarily treat as gold obligation at the option of the holder these note on the 1st day of november 1893 when the law compel the monthly purchase of silver be repeal amount to more than $ 155,000,000 the note of this description now outstanding add to the united states note still undiminishe by redemption or cancellation constitute a volume of gold obligation amount to nearly $ 500,000,000.these obligation be the instrument which ever since we have a gold reserve have be use to deplete it this reserve as have be state have fall in april 1893 to $ 97,111,330 it have from that time to the present with very few and unimportant upward movement steadily decrease except as it have be temporarily replenish by the sale of bond among the cause for this constant and uniform shrinkage in this fund may be mention the great fall off of export under the operation of the tariff law until recently in force which cripple our exchange of commodity with foreign nation and necessitate to some extent the payment of our balance in gold the unnatural infusion of silver into our currency and the increase agitation for its free and unlimited coinage which have create apprehension as to our disposition or ability to continue gold payment the consequent hoarding of gold at home and the stoppage of investment of foreign capital as well as the return of our security already sell abroad and the high rate of foreign exchange which induce the shipment of our gold to be draw against as a matter of speculation in consequence of these condition the gold reserve on the 1st day of february 1894 be reduce to $ 65,438,377 having lose more than $ 31,000,000 during the precede nine month or since april 1893 its replenishment be necessary and no other manner of accomplish it be possible resort be have to the issue and sale of bond provide for by the resumption act of 1875 fifty million of these bond be sell yield $ 58,633,295.71 which be add to the reserve fund of gold then on hand as a result of this operation this reserve which have suffer constant and large withdrawal in the meantime stand on the 6th day of march 1894 at the sum of $ 107,446,802 its depletion be however immediately thereafter so accelerate that on the 30th day of june 1894 it have fall to $ 64,873,025 thus lose by withdrawal more than $ 42,000,000 in five month and drop slightly below its situation when the sale of $ 50,000,000 in bond be effect for its replenishment this depressed condition grow bad and on the 24th day of november 1894 our gold reserve be reduce to $ 57,669,701 it become necessary to again strengthen it this be do by another sale of bond amount to $ 50,000,000 from which there be realize $ 58,538,500 with which the fund be increase to $ 111,142,021 on the 4th day of december 1894.again disappointment await the anxious hope for relief there be not even a lull in the exasperating withdrawal of gold on the contrary they grow large and more persistent than ever between the 4th day of december 1894 and early in february 1895 a period of scarcely more than two month after the second reenforcement of our gold reserve by the sale of bond it have lose by such withdrawal more than $ 69,000,000 and have fall to $ 41,340,181 nearly $ 43,000,000 have be withdraw within the month immediately precede this situation in anticipation of impend trouble i have on the 28th day of january 1895 address a communication to the congress fully set forth our difficulty and dangerous position and earnestly recommend that authority be give the secretary of the treasury to issue bond bear a low rate of interest payable by their term in gold for the purpose of maintain a sufficient gold reserve and also for the redemption and cancellation of outstanding united states note and the treasury note issue for the purchase of silver under the law of 1890 this recommendation do not however meet with legislative approval in february 1895 therefore the situation be exceedingly critical with a reserve perilously low and a refusal of congressional aid everything indicate that the end of gold payment by the government be imminent the result of prior bond issue have be exceedingly unsatisfactory and the large withdrawal of gold immediately succeed their public sale in open market give rise to a reasonable suspicion that a large part of the gold pay into the treasury upon such sale be promptly draw out again by the presentation of united states note or treasury note and find its way to the hand of those who have only temporarily part with it in the purchase of bond in this emergency and in view of its surround perplexity it become entirely apparent to those upon whom the struggle for safety be devolve not only that our gold reserve must for the third time in less than thirteen month be restore by another issue and sale of bond bear a high rate of interest and badly suit to the purpose but that a plan must be adopt for their disposition promise well result than those realize on previous sale an agreement be therefore make with a number of financier and banker whereby it be stipulate that bond describe in the resumption act of 1875 payable in coin thirty year after their date bear interest at the rate of 4 pet cent per annum and amount to about $ 62,000,000 should be exchange for gold receivable by weight amount to a little more than $ 65,000,000.this gold be to be deliver in such installment as would complete its delivery within about six month from the date of the contract and at least one half of the amount be to be furnish from abroad it be also agree by those supply this gold that during the continuance of the contract they would by every mean in their power protect the government against gold withdrawal the contract also provide that if congress would authorize their issue bond payable by their term in gold and bear interest at the rate of 3 per cent per annum might within ten day be substitute at par for the 4 per cent bond describe in the agreement on the day this contract be make its term be communicate to congress by a special executive message in which it be state that more than $ 16,000,000 would be save to the government if gold bond bear 3 per cent interest be authorize to be substitute for those mention in the contract the congress having decline to grant the necessary authority to secure this saving the contract unmodified be carry out result in a gold reserve amount to $ 107,571,230 on the 8th day of july 1895 the performance of this contract not only restore the reserve but check for a time the withdrawal of gold and bring on a period of restore confidence and such peace and quiet in business circle as be of the great possible value to every interest that affect our people i have never have the slight misgiving concern the wisdom or propriety of this arrangement and be quite willing to answer for my full share of responsibility for its promotion i believe it avert a disaster the imminence of which be fortunately not at the time generally understand by our people though the contract mention stay for a time the tide of gold withdrawal its good result could not be permanent recent withdrawal have reduce the reserve from $ 107,571,230 on the 8th day of july 1895 to $ 79,333,966 how long it will remain large enough to render its increase unnecessary be only matter of conjecture though quite large withdrawal for shipment in the immediate future be predict in well inform quarter about $ 16,000,000 have be withdraw during the month of november the foregoing statement of event and condition develop the fact that after increase our interest bearing bond indebtedness more than $ 162,000,000 to save our gold reserve we be nearly where we start have now in such reserve $ 79,333,966 as against $ 65,438,377 in february 1894 when the first bond be issue though the amount of gold draw from the treasury appear to be very large as gather from the fact and figure herein present it actually be much large considerable sum having be acquire by the treasury within the several period state without the issue of bond on the 28th of january 1895 it be report by the secretary of the treasury that more than $ 172,000,000 of gold have be withdraw for hoarding or shipment during the year precede he now report that from january 1 1879 to july 14 1890 a period of more than eleven year only a little over $ 28,000,000 be withdraw and that between july 14 1890 the date of the passage of the law for an increase purchase of silver and the 1st day of december 1895 or within less than five and a half year there be withdraw nearly $ 375,000,000 make a total of more than $ 403,000,000 draw from the treasury in gold since january 1 1879 the date fix in 1875 for the retirement of the united states note nearly $ 327,000,000 of the gold thus withdraw have be pay out on these united states note and yet every one of the $ 346,000,000 be still uncanceled and ready to do service in future gold depletion more than $ 76,000,000 in gold have since their creation in 1890 be pay out from the treasury upon the note give on the purchase of silver by the government and yet the whole amount to $ 155,000,000 except a little more than $ 16,000,000 which have be retire by exchange for silver at the request of the holder remain outstanding and prepare to join their old and more experienced ally in future raid upon the treasury 's gold reserve in other word the government have pay in gold more than nine tenth of its united states note and still owe they all it have pay in gold about one half of its note give for silver purchase without extinguish by such payment one dollar of these note when add to all this we be remind that to carry on this astound lug financial scheme the government have incur a bond indebtedness of $ 95,500,000 in establish a gold reserve and of $ 162,315,400 in effort to maintain it that the annual interest charge on such bond indebtedness be more than $ 11,000,000 that a continuance of our present course may result in further bond issue and that we have suffer or be threaten with all this for the sake of supply gold for foreign shipment or facilitate its hoarding at home a situation be exhibit which certainly ought to arrest attention and provoke immediate legislative relief i be convince the only thorough and practicable remedy for our trouble be find in the retirement and cancellation of our united states note commonly call greenback and the outstanding treasury note issue by the government in payment of silver purchase under the act of 1890.i believe this could be quite readily accomplish by the exchange of these note for united states bond of small as well as large denomination bear a low rate of interest they should be long term bond thus increase their desirability as investment and because their payment could be well postpone to a period far remove from present financial burden and perplexity when with increase prosperity and resource they would be more easily meet to far insure the cancellation of these note and also provide a way by which gold may be add to our currency in lieu of they a feature in the plan should be an authority give to the secretary of the treasury to dispose of the bond abroad for gold if necessary to complete the contemplated redemption and cancellation permit he to use the proceed of such bond to take up and cancel any of the note that may be in the treasury or that may be receive by the government on any account the increase of our bond debt involve in this plan would be amply compensate by renew activity and enterprise in all business circle the restore confidence at home the reinstate faith in our monetary strength abroad and the stimulation of every interest and industry that would follow the cancellation of the gold demand obligation now afflict we in any event the bond propose would stand for the extinguishment of a troublesome indebtedness while in the path we now follow there lurk the menace of unending bond with our indebtedness still undischarged and aggravate in every feature the obligation necessary to fund this indebtedness would not equal in amount those from which we have be relieve since 1884 by anticipation and payment beyond the requirement of the sink fund out of our surplus revenue the currency withdraw by the retirement of the united states note and treasury note amount to probably less than $ 486,000,000 might be supply by such gold as would be use on their retirement or by an increase in the circulation of our national bank though the aggregate capital of those now in existence amount to more than $ 664,000,000 their outstanding circulation base on bond security amount to only about $ 190,000,000 they be authorize to issue note amount to 90 per cent of the bond deposit to secure their circulation but in no event beyond the amount of their capital stock and they be oblige to pay 1 per cent tax on the circulation they issue i think they should be allow to issue circulation equal to the par value of the bond they deposit to secure it and that the tax on their circulation should be reduce to one fourth of 1 per cent which would undoubtedly meet all the expense the government incur on their account in addition they should be allow to substitute or deposit in lieu of the bond now require as security for their circulation those which would be issue for the purpose of retire the united states note and treasury note the bank already exist if they desire to avail themselves of the provision of law thus modify could issue circulation in addition to that already outstanding amount to $ 478,000,000 which would nearly or quite equal the currency propose to be cancel at any rate i should confidently expect to see the exist national bank or other to be organize avail themselves of the propose encouragement to issue circulation and promptly fill any vacuum and supply every currency need it have always seem to i that the provision of law regard the capital of national bank which operate as a limitation to their location fail to make proper compensation for the suppression of state bank which come near to the people in all section of the country and readily furnish they with banking accommodation and facility any inconvenience or embarrassment arise from these restriction on the location of national bank might well be remedie by well adapt the present system to the creation of bank in small community or by permit bank of large capital to establish branch in such locality as would serve the people so regulated and restrain as to secure their safe and conservative control and management but there might not be the necessity for such an addition to the currency by new issue of bank circulation as at first glance be indicate if we should be relieve from maintain a gold reserve under condition that constitute it the barometer of our solvency and if our treasury should no long be the foolish purveyor of gold for nation abroad or for speculation and hoarding by our citizen at home i should expect to see gold resume its natural and normal function in the business affair of the country and cease to be an object attract the timid watch of our people and excite their sensitive imagination i do not overlook the fact that the cancellation of the treasury note issue under the silver purchase act of 1890 would leave the treasury in the actual ownership of sufficient silver include seigniorage to coin nearly $ 178,000,000 in standard dollar it be worthy of consideration whether this might not from time to time be convert into dollar or fractional coin and slowly put into circulation as in the judgment of the secretary of the treasury the necessity of the country should require whatever be attempt should be enter upon fully appreciate the fact that by careless easy descent we have reach a dangerous depth and that our ascent will not be accomplish without laborious toil and struggle we shall be wise if we realize that we be financially ill and that our restoration to health may require heroic treatment and unpleasant remedy in the present stage of our difficulty it be not easy to understand how the amount of our revenue receipt directly affect it the important question be not the quantity of money receive in revenue payment but the kind of money we maintain and our ability to continue in sound financial condition we be consider the government 's holding of gold as relate to the soundness of our money and as affect our national credit and monetary strength if our gold reserve have never be impair if no bond have ever be issue to replenish it if there have be no fear and timidity concern our ability to continue gold payment if any part of our revenue be now pay in gold and if we could look to our gold receipt as a means of maintain a safe reserve the amount of our revenue would be an influential factor in the problem but unfortunately all the circumstance that might lend weight to this consideration be entirely lacking in our present predicament no gold be receive by the government in payment of revenue charge nor would there be if the revenue be increase the receipt of the treasury when not in silver certificate consist of united states note and treasury note issue for silver purchase these form of money be only useful to the government in pay its current ordinary expense and its quantity in government possession do not in the least contribute toward give we that kind of safe financial standing or condition which be build on gold alone if it be say that these note if hold by the government can be use to obtain gold for our reserve the answer be easy the people draw gold from the treasury on demand upon united states note and treasury note but the proposition that the treasury can on demand draw gold from the people upon they would be regard in these day with wonder and amusement and even if this could be do there be nothing to prevent those thus part with their gold from regain it the next day or the next hour by the presentation of the note they receive in exchange for it the secretary of the treasury might use such note take from a surplus revenue to buy gold in the market of course he could not do this without pay a premium private holder of gold unlike the government have no parity to maintain would not be restrain from make the good bargain possible when they furnish gold to the treasury but the moment the secretary of the treasury buy gold on any term above par he would establish a general and universal premium upon it thus break down the parity between gold and silver which the government be pledge to maintain and open the way to new and serious complication in the meantime the premium would not remain stationary and the absurd spectacle might be present of a dealer sell gold to the government and with united states note or treasury note in his hand immediately clamor for its return and a resale at a high premium it may be claim that a large revenue and redundant receipt might favorably affect the situation under discussion by afford an opportunity of retain these note in the treasury when receive and thus prevent their presentation for gold such retention to be useful ought to be at least measurably permanent and this be precisely what be prohibit so far as united states note be concern by the law of 1878 forbid their further retirement that statute in so many word provide that these note when receive into the treasury and belong to the united states shall be pay out again and keep in circulation "it will moreover be readily see that the government could not refuse to pay out united states note and treasury note in current transaction when demand and insist on pay out silver alone and still maintain the parity between that metal and the currency represent gold besides the accumulation in the treasury of currency of any kind exact from the people through taxation be justly regard as an evil and it can not proceed far without vigorous protest against an unjustifiable retention of money from the business of the country and a denunciation of a scheme of taxation which prove itself to be unjust when it take from the earning and income of the citizen money so much in excess of the need of government support that large sum can be gather and keep in the treasury such a condition have heretofore in time of surplus revenue lead the government to restore currency to the people by the purchase of its unmatured bond at a large premium and by a large increase of its deposit in national bank and we easily remember that the abuse of treasury accumulation have furnish a most persuasive argument in favor of legislation radically reduce our tariff taxation perhaps it be suppose that sufficient revenue receipt would in a sentimental way improve the situation by inspire confidence in our solvency and allay the fear of pecuniary exhaustion and yet through all our struggle to maintain our gold reserve there never have be any apprehension as to our ready ability to pay our way with such money as we have and the question whether or not our current receipt meet our current expense have not enter into the estimate of our solvency of course the general state of our fund exclusive of gold be entirely immaterial to the foreign creditor and investor his debt could only be pay in gold and his only concern be our ability to keep on hand that kind of money on july 1 1892 more than a year and a half before the first bond be issue to replenish the gold reserve there be a net balance in the treasury exclusive of such reserve of less than $ 13,000,000 but the gold reserve amount to more than $ 114,000,000 which be the quiet feature of the situation it be when the stock of gold begin rapidly to fall that fright supervene and our security hold abroad be return for sale and debt owe abroad be press for payment in the meantime extensive shipment of gold and other unfavorable indication cause restlessness and fright among our people at home thereupon the general state of our fund exclusive of gold become also immaterial to they and they too draw gold from the treasury for hoarding against all contingency this be plainly show by the large increase in the proportion of gold withdraw which be retain by our own people as time and threaten incident progress during the fiscal year end june 30 1894 nearly $ 85,000,000 in gold be withdraw from the treasury and about $ 77,000,000 be send abroad while during the fiscal year end june 30 1895 over $ 117,000,000 be draw out of which only about $ 66,000,000 be ship leave the large balance of such withdrawal to be account for by domestic hoarding inasmuch as the withdrawal of our gold have result largely from fright there be nothing apparent that will prevent its continuance or recurrence with its natural consequence except such a change in our financial method as will reassure the frightened and make the desire for gold less intense it be not clear how an increase fix revenue unless it be in gold can satisfy those whose only anxiety be to gain gold from the government 's store it can not therefore be safe to rely upon increase revenue as a cure for our present trouble it be possible that the suggestion of increase revenue as a remedy for the difficulty we be consider may have originate in an intimation or distinct allegation that the bond which have be issue ostensibly to replenish our gold reserve be really issue to supply insufficient revenue nothing can be far from the truth bond be issue to obtain gold for the maintenance of our national credit as have be show the gold thus obtain have be draw again from the treasury upon united states note and treasury note this operation would have be promptly prevent if possible but these note having thus be pass to the treasury they become the money of the government like any other ordinary government fund and there be nothing to do but to use they in pay government expense when need at no time when bond have be issue have there be any consideration of the question of pay the expense of government with their proceed there be no necessity to consider that question at the time of each bond issue we have a safe surplus in the treasury for ordinary operation exclusive of the gold in our reserve in february 1894 when the first issue of bond be make such surplus amount to over $ 18,000,000 in november when the second issue be make it amount to more than $ 42,000,000 and in february 1895 when bond for the third time be issue such surplus amount to more than $ 100,000,000 it now amount to $ 98,072,420.30.besides all this the secretary of the treasury have no authority whatever to issue bond to increase the ordinary revenue or pay current expense i can not but think there have be some confusion of idea regard the effect of the issue of bond and the result of the withdrawal of gold it be the latter process and not the former that by substitute in the treasury united states note and treasury note for gold increase by their amount the money which be in the first instance subject to ordinary government expenditure although the law compel an increase purchase of silver by the government be pass on the 14th day of july 1890 withdrawal of gold from the treasury upon the note give in payment on such purchase do not begin until october 1891 immediately follow that date the withdrawal upon both these note and united states note increase very largely and have continue to such an extent that since the passage of that law there have be more than thirteen time as much gold take out of the treasury upon united states note and treasury note issue for silver purchase as be thus withdraw during the eleven and a half year immediately prior thereto and after the 1st day of january 1879 when specie payment be resume it be neither unfair nor unjust to charge a large share of our present financial perplexity and danger to the operation of the law of 1878 and 1890 compel the purchase of silver by the government which not only furnish a new treasury obligation upon which its gold could be withdraw but so increase the fear of an overwhelming flood of silver and a force descent to silver payment that even the repeal of these law do not entirely cure the evil of their existence while i have endeavor to make a plain statement of the disorder condition of our currency and the present danger menace our prosperity and to suggest a way which lead to a safe financial system i have constantly have in mind the fact that many of my countryman whose sincerity i do not doubt insist that the cure for the ill now threaten we may be find in the single and simple remedy of the free coinage of silver they contend that our mint shall be at once throw open to the free unlimited and independent coinage of both gold and silver dollar of full legal tender quality regardless of the action of any other government and in full view of the fact that the ratio between the metal which they suggest call for 100 cent worth of gold in the gold dollar at the present standard and only 50 cent in intrinsic worth of silver in the silver dollar be there infinitely strong reason than can be adduce for hope that such action would secure for we a bimetallic currency move on line of parity an experiment so novel and hazardous as that propose might well stagger those who believe that stability be an imperative condition of sound money no government no human contrivance or act of legislation have ever be able to hold the two metal together in free coinage at a ratio appreciably different from that which be establish in the market of the world those who believe that our independent free coinage of silver at an artificial ratio with gold of 16 to 1 would restore the parity between the metal and consequently between the coin oppose an unsupported and improbable theory to the general belief and practice of other nation and to the teaching of the wise statesman and economist of the world both in the past and present and what be far more conclusive they run counter to our own actual experience twice in our early history our lawmaker in attempt to establish a bimetallic currency undertake free coinage upon a ratio which accidentally vary from the actual relative value of the two metal not more than 3 per cent in both case notwithstanding great difficulty and cost of transportation than now exist the coin whose intrinsic worth be undervalue in the ratio gradually and surely disappear from our circulation and go to other country where their real value be well recognize act of congress be impotent to create equality where natural cause decreed even a slight inequality twice in our recent history we have signally fail to raise by legislation the value of silver under an act of congress pass in 1878 the government be require for more than twelve year to expend annually at least $ 24,000,000 in the purchase of silver bullion for coinage the act of july 14 1890 in a still bold effort increase the amount of silver the government be compel to purchase and force it to become the buyer annually of 54,000,000 ounce or practically the entire product of our mine under both law silver rapidly and steadily decline in value the prophecy and the express hope and expectation of those in the congress who lead in the passage of the last mention act that it would reestablish and maintain the former parity between the two metal be still fresh in our memory in the light of these experience which accord with the experience of other nation there be certainly no secure ground for the belief that an act of congress could now bridge an inequality of 50 per cent between gold and silver at our present ratio nor be there the least possibility that our country which have less than one seventh of the silver money in the world could by its action alone raise not only our own but all silver to its lose ratio with gold our attempt to accomplish this by the free coinage of silver at a ratio differ widely from actual relative value would be the signal for the complete departure of gold from our circulation the immediate and large contraction of our circulate medium and a shrinkage in the real value and monetary efficiency of all other form of currency as they settle to the level of silver monometallism everyone who receive a fix salary and every worker for wage would find the dollar in his hand ruthlessly scale down to the point of bitter disappointment if not to pinch privation a change in our standard to silver monometallism would also bring on a collapse of the entire system of credit which when base on a standard which be recognize and adopt by the world of business be many time more potent and useful than the entire volume of currency and be safely capable of almost indefinite expansion to meet the growth of trade and enterprise in a self invite struggle through darkness and uncertainty our humiliation would be increase by the consciousness that we have part company with all the enlightened and progressive nation of the world and be desperately and hopelessly strive to meet the stress of modern commerce and competition with a debased and unsuitable currency and in association with the few weak and laggard nation which have silver alone as their standard of value all history warn we against rash experiment which threaten violent change in our monetary standard and the degradation of our currency the past be full of lesson teach not only the economic danger but the national immorality that follow in the train of such experiment i will not believe that the american people can be persuade after sober deliberation to jeopardize their nation 's prestige and proud standing by encourage financial nostrum nor that they will yield to the false allurement of cheap money when they realize that it must result in the weakening of that financial integrity and rectitude which thus far in our history have be so devotedly cherish as one of the trait of true americanism our country 's indebtedness whether owe by the government or exist between individual have be contract with reference to our present standard to decree by act of congress that these debt shall be payable in less valuable dollar than those within the contemplation and intention of the party when contract would operate to transfer by the fiat of law and without compensation an amount of property and a volume of right and interest almost incalculable those who advocate a blind and headlong plunge to free coinage in the name of bimetallism and profess the belief contrary to all experience that we could thus establish a double standard and a concurrent circulation of both metal in our coinage be certainly reckon from a cloudy standpoint our present standard of value be the standard of the civilized world and permit the only bimetallism now possible or at least that be within the independent reach of any single nation however powerful that nation may be while the value of gold as a standard be steady by almost universal commercial and business use it do not despise silver nor seek its banishment wherever this standard be maintain there be at its side in free and unquestioned circulation a volume of silver currency sometimes equal and sometimes even exceed it in amount both maintain at a parity notwithstanding a depreciation or fluctuation in the intrinsic value of silver there be a vast difference between a standard of value and a currency for monetary use the standard must necessarily be fix and certain the currency may be in diver form and of various kind no silver standard country have a gold currency in circulation but an enlightened and wise system of finance secure the benefit of both gold and silver as currency and circulate medium by keep the standard stable and all other currency at par with it such a system and such a standard also give free scope for the use and expansion of safe and conservative credit so indispensable to broad and grow commercial transaction and so well substitute for the actual use of money if a fixed and stable standard be maintain such as the magnitude and safety of our commercial transaction and business require the use of money itself be conveniently minimize every dollar of fixed and stable value have through the agency of confident credit an astonishing capacity of multiply itself in financial work every unstable and fluctuating dollar fail as a basis of credit and in its use beget gambling speculation and undermine the foundation of honest enterprise i have venture to express myself on this subject with earnestness and plainness of speech because i can not rid myself of the belief that there lurk in the proposition for the free coinage of silver so strongly approve and so enthusiastically advocate by a multitude of my countryman a serious menace to our prosperity and an insidious temptation of our people to wander from the allegiance they owe to public and private integrity it be because i do not distrust the good faith and sincerity of those who press this scheme that i have imperfectly but with zeal submit my thought upon this momentous subject i can not refrain from beg they to reexamine their view and belief in the light of patriotic reason and familiar experience and to weigh again and again the consequence of such legislation as their effort have invite even the continue agitation of the subject add greatly to the difficulty of a dangerous financial situation already force upon we in conclusion i especially entreat the people 's representative in the congress who be charge with the responsibility of inaugurate measure for the safety and prosperity of our common country to promptly and effectively consider the ill of our critical financial plight i have suggest a remedy which my judgment approve i desire however to assure the congress that i be prepared to cooperate with they in perfect any other measure promise thorough and practical relief and that i will gladly labor with they in every patriotic endeavor to further the interest and guard the welfare of our countryman whom in our respective place of duty we have undertake to serve
to the congress
 in my annual message address to the congress on the 3d instant i call attention to the pende boundary controversy between great britain and the republic of venezuela and recite the substance of a representation make by this government to her britannic majesty&#39 s government suggest reason why such dispute should be submit to arbitration for settlement and inquire whether it would be so submit
 the answer of the british government which be then await have since be receive and together with the dispatch to which it be a reply be hereto append
 such reply be embody in two communication address by the british prime minister to sir julian pauncefote the british ambassador at this capital it will be see that one of these communication be devote exclusively to observation upon the monroe doctrine and claim that in the present instance a new and strange extension and development of this doctrine be insist on by the united states that the reason justify an appeal to the doctrine enunciate by president monroe be generally inapplicable to the state of thing in which we live at the present day and especially inapplicable to a controversy involve the boundary line between great britain and venezuela
 without attempt extended argument in reply to these position it may not be amiss to suggest that the doctrine upon which we stand be strong and sound because its enforcement be important to our peace and safety as a nation and be essential to the integrity of our free institution and the tranquil maintenance of our distinctive form of government it be intend to apply to every stage of our national life and can not become obsolete while our republic endure if the balance of power be justly a cause for jealous anxiety among the government of the old world and a subject for our absolute noninterference none the less be an observance of the monroe doctrine of vital concern to our people and their government
 assuming therefore that we may properly insist upon this doctrine without regard to the state of thing in which we live or any change condition here or elsewhere it be not apparent why its application may not be invoke in the present controversy
 if a european power by an extension of its boundary take possession of the territory of one of our neighbor republic against its will and in derogation of its right it be difficult to see why to that extent such european power do not thereby attempt to extend its system of government to that portion of this continent which be thus take this be the precise action which president monroe declare to be dangerous to our peace and safety and it can make no difference whether the european system be extend by an advance of frontier or otherwise
 it be also suggest in the british reply that we should not seek to apply the monroe doctrine to the pende dispute because it do not embody any principle of international law which be round on the general consent of nation and that no statesman however eminent and no nation however powerful be competent to insert into the code of international law a novel principle which be never recognize before and which have not since be accept by the government of any other country
 practically the principle for which we contend have peculiar if not exclusive relation to the united states it may not have be admit in so many word to the code of international law but since in international council every nation be entitle to the right belong to it if the enforcement of the monroe doctrine be something we may justly claim it have its place in the code of international law as certainly and as securely as if it be specifically mention and when the united states be a suitor before the high tribunal that administer international law the question to be determine be whether or not we present claim which the justice of that code of law can find to be right and valid
 the monroe doctrine find its recognition in those principle of international law which be base upon the theory that every nation shall have its right protect and its just claim enforce
 of course this government be entirely confident that under the sanction of this doctrine we have clear right and undoubted claim nor be this ignore in the british reply the prime minister while not admit that the monroe doctrine be applicable to present condition state
 in declare that the united states would resist any such enterprise if it be contemplate president monroe adopt a policy which receive the entire sympathy of the english government of that date
 he far declare
 though the language of president monroe be direct to the attainment of object which most englishman would agree to be salutary it be impossible to admit that they have be inscribe by any adequate authority in the code of international law
 again he say
 they her majesty&#39;s government fully concur with the view which president monroe apparently entertain that any disturbance of the exist territorial distribution in that hemisphere by any fresh acquisition on the part of any european state would be a highly inexpedient change
 in the belief that the doctrine for which we contend be clear and definite that it be round upon substantial consideration and involve our safety and welfare that it be fully applicable to our present condition and to the state of the world&#39;s progress and that it be directly relate to the pende controversy and without any conviction as to the final merit of the dispute but anxious to learn in a satisfactory and conclusive manner whether great britain seek under a claim of boundary to extend her possession on this continent without right or whether she merely seek possession of territory fairly include within her line of ownership this government propose to the government of great britain a resort to arbitration as the proper mean of settle the question to the end that a vexatious boundary dispute between the two contestant might be determine and our exact standing and relation in respect to the controversy might be make clear
 it will be see from the correspondence herewith submit that this proposition have be decline by the british government upon ground which in the circumstance seem to i to be far from satisfactory it be deeply disappointing that such an appeal actuate by the most friendly feeling toward both nation directly concern address to the sense of justice and to the magnanimity of one of the great power of the world and touch its relation to one comparatively weak and small should have produce no well result
 the course to be pursue by this government in view of the present condition do not appear to admit of serious doubt having labor faithfully for many year to induce great britain to submit this dispute to impartial arbitration and having be now finally apprise of her refusal to do so nothing remain but to accept the situation to recognize its plain requirement and deal with it accordingly great britain&#39;s present proposition have never thus far be regard as admissible by venezuela though any adjustment of the boundary which that country may deem for her advantage and may enter into of her own free will can not of course be object to by the united states
 assuming however that the attitude of venezuela will remain unchanged the dispute have reach such a stage as to make it now incumbent upon the united states to take measure to determine with sufficient certainty for its justification what be the true divisional line between the republic of venezuela and british guiana the inquiry to that end should of course be conduct carefully and judicially and due weight should be give to all available evidence record and fact in support of the claim of both party
 in order that such an examination should be prosecute in a thorough and satisfactory manner i suggest that the congress make an adequate appropriation for the expense of a commission to be appoint by the executive who shall make the necessary investigation and report upon the matter with the least possible delay when such report be make and accept it will in my opinion be the duty of the united states to resist by every mean in its power as a willful aggression upon its right and interest the appropriation by great britain of any land or the exercise of governmental jurisdiction over any territory which after investigation we have determine of right belong to venezuela
 in make these recommendation i be fully alive to the responsibility incur and keenly realize all the consequence that may follow
 i be nevertheless firm in my conviction that while it be a grievous thing to contemplate the two great english speak people of the world as be otherwise than friendly competitor in the onward march of civilization and strenuous and worthy rival in all the art of peace there be no calamity which a great nation can invite which equal that which follow a supine submission to wrong and injustice and the consequent loss of national self respect and honor beneath which be shield and defend a people&#39; safety and greatness

to the congress
 in my last annual message the evil of our present financial system be plainly point out and the cause and mean of the depletion of government gold be explain it be therein state that after all the effort that have be make by the executive branch of the government to protect our gold reserve by the issuance of bond amount to more than $ 162,000,000 such reserve then amount to but little more than $ 79,000,000 that about $ 16,000,000 have be withdraw from such reserve during the month next previous to the date of that message and that quite large withdrawal for shipment in the immediate future be predict
 the contingency then fear have reach we and the withdrawal of gold since the communication refer to and other that appear inevitable threaten such a depletion in our government gold reserve as bring we face to face to the necessity of further action for its protection this condition be intensify by the prevalence in certain quarter of sudden and unusual apprehension and timidity in business circle
 we be in the midst of another season of perplexity cause by our dangerous and fatuous financial operation these may be expect to recur with certainty as long as there be no amendment in our financial system if in this particular instance our predicament be at all influence by a recent insistence upon the position we should occupy in our relation to certain question concern our foreign policy this furnish a signal and impressive warning that even the patriotic sentiment of our people be not an adequate substitute for a sound financial policy
 of course there can be no doubt in any thoughtful mind as to the complete solvency of our nation nor can there be any just apprehension that the american people will be satisfied with less than an honest payment of our public obligation in the recognize money of the world we should not overlook the fact however that arouse fear be unreasone and must be take into account in all effort to avert possible loss and the sacrifice of our people&#39; interest
 the real and sensible cure for our recur trouble can only be effect by a complete change in our financial scheme pende that the executive branch of the government will not relax its effort nor abandon its determination to use every mean within its reach to maintain before the world american credit nor will there be any hesitation in exhibit its confidence in the resource of our country and the constant patriotism of our people
 in view however of the peculiar situation now confront we i have venture to herein express the earnest hope that the congress in default of the inauguration of a well system of finance will not take a recess from its labor before it have by legislative enactment or declaration do something not only to remind those apprehensive among our own people that the resource of their government and a scrupulous regard for honest dealing afford a sure guaranty of unquestioned safety and soundness but to reassure the world that with these factor and the patriotism of our citizen the ability and determination of our nation to meet in any circumstance every obligation it incur do not admit of question
 i ask at the hand of the congress such prompt aid as it alone have the power to give to prevent in a time of fear and apprehension any sacrifice of the people&#39; interest and the public fund or the impairment of our public credit in an effort by executive action to relieve the danger of the present emergency

to the congress of the united states as representative of the people in the legislative branch of their government you have assemble at a time when the strength and excellence of our free institution and the fitness of our citizen to enjoy popular rule have be again make manifest a political contest involve momentous consequence fraught with feverish apprehension and create aggressiveness so intense as to approach bitterness and passion have be wage throughout our land and determine by the decree of free and independent suffrage without disturbance of our tranquillity or the least sign of weakness in our national structure when we consider these incident and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have succeed a heated clash of political opinion we discover abundant evidence of a determination on the part of our countryman to abide by every verdict of the popular will and to be control at all time by an abide faith in the agency establish for the direction of the affair of their government thus our people exhibit a patriotic disposition which entitle they to demand of those who undertake to make and execute their law such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompt by a serious appreciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty invite in obedience to a constitutional requirement i herein submit to the congress certain information concern national affair with the suggestion of such legislation as in my judgment be necessary and expedient to secure brevity and avoid tiresome narration i shall omit many detail concern matter within federal control which though by no mean unimportant be more profitably discuss in departmental report i shall also far curtail this communication by omit a minute recital of many minor incident connect with our foreign relation which have heretofore find a place in executive message but be now contain in a report of the secretary of state which be herewith submit at the outset of a reference to the more important matter affect our relation with foreign power it would afford i satisfaction if i could assure the congress that the disturbed condition in asiatic turkey have during the past year assume a less hideous and bloody aspect and that either as a consequence of the awakening of the turkish government to the demand of humane civilization or as the result of decisive action on the part of the great nation have the right by treaty to interfere for the protection of those expose to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanaticism the shocking feature of the situation have be mitigate instead however of welcome a soften disposition or protective intervention we have be afflict by continue and not unfrequent report of the wanton destruction of home and the bloody butchery of man woman and child make martyr to their profession of christian faith while none of our citizen in turkey have thus far be kill or wound though often in the midst of dreadful scene of danger their safety in the future be by no mean assure our government at home and our minister at constantinople have leave nothing undo to protect our missionary in ottoman territory who constitute nearly all the individual reside there who have a right to claim our protection on the score of american citizenship our effort in this direction will not be relax but the deep feeling and sympathy that have be arouse among our people ought not to so far blind their reason and judgment as to lead they to demand impossible thing the outbreak of the blind fury which lead to murder and pillage in turkey occur suddenly and without notice and an attempt on our part to force such a hostile presence there as might be effective for prevention or protection would not only be resist by the ottoman government but would be regard as an interruption of their plan by the great nation who assert their exclusive right to intervene in their own time and method for the security of life and property in turkey several naval vessel be station in the mediterranean as a measure of caution and to furnish all possible relief and refuge in case of emergency we have make claim against the turkish government for the pillage and destruction of missionary property at harpoot and marash during uprising at those place thus far the validity of these demand have not be admit though our minister prior to such outrage and in anticipation of danger demand protection for the person and property of our missionary citizen in the locality mention and notwithstanding that strong evidence exist of actual complicity of turkish soldier in the work of destruction and robbery the fact as they now appear do not permit we to doubt the justice of these claim and nothing will be omit to bring about their prompt settlement a number of armenian refugee having arrive at our port an order have lately be obtain from the turkish government permit the wife and child of such refugee to join they here it be hope that hereafter no obstacle will be interpose to prevent the escape of all those who seek to avoid the peril which threaten they in turkish dominion our recently appoint consul to erzerum be at his post and discharge the duty of his office though for some unaccountable reason his formal exequatur from the sultan have not be issue i do not believe that the present somber prospect in turkey will be long permit to offend the sight of christendom it so mar the humane and enlightened civilization that belong to the close of the nineteenth century that it seem hardly possible that the earnest demand of good people throughout the christian world for its corrective treatment will remain unanswered the insurrection in cuba still continue with all its perplexity it be difficult to perceive that any progress have thus far be make toward the pacification of the island or that the situation of affair as depict in my last annual message have in the least improve if spain still hold havana and the seaport and all the considerable town the insurgent still roam at will over at least two third of the inland country if the determination of spain to put down the insurrection seem but to strengthen with the lapse of time and be evince by she unhesitate devotion of largely increase military and naval force to the task there be much reason to believe that the insurgent have gain in point of number and character and resource and be none the less inflexible in their resolve not to succumb without practically secure the great object for which they take up arm if spain have not yet reestablish her authority neither have the insurgent yet make good their title to be regard as an independent state indeed as the contest have go on the pretense that civil government exist on the island except so far as spain be able to maintain it have be practically abandon spain do keep on foot such a government more or less imperfectly in the large town and their immediate suburb but that exception be make the entire country be either give over to anarchy or be subject to the military occupation of one or the other party it be report indeed on reliable authority that at the demand of the commander in chief of the insurgent army the putative cuban government have now give up all attempt to exercise its function leave that government confessedly what there be the good reason for suppose it always to have be in fact a government merely on paper be the spanish army able to meet their antagonist in the open or in pitch battle prompt and decisive result might be look for and the immense superiority of the spanish force in number discipline and equipment could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage but they be call upon to face a foe that shun general engagement that can choose and do choose its own ground that from the nature of the country be visible or invisible at pleasure and that fight only from ambuscade and when all the advantage of position and number be on its side in a country where all that be indispensable to life in the way of food clothing and shelter be so easily obtainable especially by those bear and breed on the soil it be obvious that there be hardly a limit to the time during which hostility of this sort may be prolong meanwhile as in all case of protract civil strife the passion of the combatant grow more and more inflame and excess on both side become more frequent and more deplorable they be also participate in by band of marauder who now in the name of one party and now in the name of the other as may well suit the occasion harry the country at will and plunder its wretched inhabitant for their own advantage such a condition of thing would inevitably entail immense destruction of property even if it be the policy of both party to prevent it as far as practicable but while such seem to be the original policy of the spanish government it have now apparently abandon it and be act upon the same theory as the insurgent namely that the exigency of the contest require the wholesale annihilation of property that it may not prove of use and advantage to the enemy it be to the same end that in pursuance of general order spanish garrison be now be withdraw from plantation and the rural population require to concentrate itself in the town the sure result would seem to be that the industrial value of the island be fast diminishing and that unless there be a speedy and radical change in exist condition it will soon disappear altogether that value consist very largely of course in its capacity to produce sugar a capacity already much reduce by the interruption to tillage which have take place during the last two year it be reliably assert that should these interruption continue during the current year and practically extend as be now threaten to the entire sugar produce territory of the island so much time and so much money will be require to restore the land to its normal productiveness that it be extremely doubtful if capital can be induce to even make the attempt the spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country by nature one of the most fertile and charming on the globe would engage the serious attention of the government and people of the united states in any circumstance in point of fact they have a concern with it which be by no mean of a wholly sentimental or philanthropic character it lie so near to we as to be hardly separate from our territory our actual pecuniary interest in it be second only to that of the people and government of spain it be reasonably estimate that at least from $ 30,000,000 to $ 50,000,000 of american capital be invest in plantation and in railroad mining and other business enterprise on the island the volume of trade between the united states and cuba which in 1889 amount to about $ 64,000,000 rise in 1893 to about $ 103,000,000 and in 1894 the year before the present insurrection break out amount to nearly $ 96,000,000 besides this large pecuniary stake in the fortune of cuba the united states find itself inextricably involve in the present contest in other way both vexatious and costly many cubans reside in this country and indirectly promote the insurrection through the press by public meeting by the purchase and shipment of arm by the raising of fund and by other mean which the spirit of our institution and the tenor of our law do not permit to be make the subject of criminal prosecution some of they though cubans at heart and in all their feeling and interest have take out paper as naturalized citizen of the united states a proceeding resort to with a view to possible protection by this government and not unnaturally regard with much indignation by the country of their origin the insurgent be undoubtedly encourage and support by the widespread sympathy the people of this country always and instinctively feel for every struggle for well and free government and which in the case of the more adventurous and restless element of our population lead in only too many instance to active and personal participation in the contest the result be that this government be constantly call upon to protect american citizen to claim damage for injury to person and property now estimate at many million of dollar and to ask explanation and apology for the act of spanish official whose zeal for the repression of rebellion sometimes blind they to the immunity belong to the unoffending citizen of a friendly power it follow from the same cause that the united states be compel to actively police a long line of seacoast against unlawful expedition the escape of which the utmost vigilance will not always suffice to prevent these inevitable entanglement of the united states with the rebellion in cuba the large american property interest affect and consideration of philanthropy and humanity in general have lead to a vehement demand in various quarter for some sort of positive intervention on the part of the united states it be at first propose that belligerent right should be accord to the insurgent a proposition no long urge because untimely and in practical operation dearly perilous and injurious to our own interest it have since be and be now sometimes contend that the independence of the insurgent should be recognize but imperfect and restrict as the spanish government of the island may be no other exist there unless the will of the military officer in temporary command of a particular district can be dignified as a species of government it be now also suggest that the united states should buy the island a suggestion possibly worthy of consideration if there be any evidence of a desire or willingness on the part of spain to entertain such a proposal it be urge finally that all other method fail the exist internecine strife in cuba should be terminate by our intervention even at the cost of a war between the united states and spain a war which its advocate confidently prophesy could neither be large in its proportion nor doubtful in its issue the correctness of this forecast need be neither affirm nor deny the united states have nevertheless a character to maintain as a nation which plainly dictate that right and not might should be the rule of its conduct far though the united states be not a nation to which peace be a necessity it be in truth the most pacific of power and desire nothing so much as to live in amity with all the world its own ample and diversified domain satisfy all possible longing for territory preclude all dream of conquest and prevent any casting of covetous eye upon neighboring region however attractive that our conduct toward spain and her dominion have constitute no exception to this national disposition be make manifest by the course of our government not only thus far during the present insurrection but during the ten year that follow the rise at yara in 1868 no other great power it may safely be say under circumstance of similar perplexity would have manifest the same restraint and the same patient endurance it may also be say that this persistent attitude of the united states toward spain in connection with cuba unquestionably evince no slight respect and regard for spain on the part of the american people they in truth do not forget her connection with the discovery of the western hemisphere nor do they underestimate the great quality of the spanish people nor fail to fully recognize their splendid patriotism and their chivalrous devotion to the national honor they view with wonder and admiration the cheerful resolution with which vast body of man be send across thousand of mile of ocean and an enormous debt accumulate that the costly possession of the gem of the antilles may still hold its place in the spanish crown and yet neither the government nor the people of the united states have shut their eye to the course of event in cuba or have fail to realize the existence of concede grievance which have lead to the present revolt from the authority of spain grievance recognize by the queen regent and by the cortes voice by the most patriotic and enlighten of spanish statesman without regard to party and demonstrate by reform propose by the executive and approve by the legislative branch of the spanish government it be in the assumed temper and disposition of the spanish government to remedy these grievance fortify by indication of influential public opinion in spain that this government have hope to discover the most promising and effective mean of compose the present strife with honor and advantage to spain and with the achievement of all the reasonable object of the insurrection it would seem that if spain should offer to cuba genuine autonomy a measure of home rule which while preserve the sovereignty of spain would satisfy all rational requirement of her spanish subject there should be no just reason why the pacification of the island might not be effect on that basis such a result would appear to be in the true interest of all concern it would at once stop the conflict which be now consume the resource of the island and make it worthless for whichever party may ultimately prevail it would keep intact the possession of spain without touch her honor which will be consult rather than impugn by the adequate redress of admitted grievance it would put the prosperity of the island and the fortune of its inhabitant within their own control without sever the natural and ancient tie which bind they to the mother country and would yet enable they to test their capacity for self government under the most favorable condition it have be object on the one side that spain should not promise autonomy until her insurgent subject lie down their arm on the other side that promise autonomy however liberal be insufficient because without assurance of the promise be fulfil but the reasonableness of a requirement by spain of unconditional surrender on the part of the insurgent cubans before their autonomy be concede be not altogether apparent it ignore important feature of the situation the stability two year duration have give to the insurrection the feasibility of its indefinite prolongation in the nature of thing and as show by past experience the utter and imminent ruin of the island unless the present strife be speedily compose above all the rank abuse which all party in spain all branch of her government and all her lead public man concede to exist and profess a desire to remove face such circumstance to withhold the proffer of need reform until the party demand they put themselves at mercy by throw down their arm have the appearance of neglect the gravest of peril and invite suspicion as to the sincerity of any profess willingness to grant reform the objection on behalf of the insurgent that promise reform can not be rely upon must of course be consider though we have no right to assume and no reason for assume that anything spain undertake to do for the relief of cuba will not be do accord to both the spirit and the letter of the undertaking nevertheless realize that suspicion and precaution on the part of the weak of two combatant be always natural and not always unjustifiable be sincerely desirous in the interest of both as well as on its own account that the cuban problem should be solve with the least possible delay it be intimate by this government to the government of spain some month ago that if a satisfactory measure of home rule be tender the cuban insurgent and would be accept by they upon a guaranty of its execution the united states would endeavor to find a way not objectionable to spain of furnish such graranty while no definite response to this intimation have yet be receive from the spanish government it be believe to be not altogether unwelcome while as already suggest no reason be perceive why it should not be approve by the insurgent neither party can fail to see the importance of early action and both must realize that to prolong the present state of thing for even a short period will add enormously to the time and labor and expenditure necessary to bring about the industrial recuperation of the island it be therefore fervently hope on all ground that earnest effort for heal the breach between spain and the insurgent cubans upon the line above indicate may be at once inaugurate and push to an immediate and successful issue the friendly office of the united states either in the manner above outline or in any other way consistent with our constitution and law will always be at the disposal of either party whatever circumstance may arise our policy and our interest would constrain we to object to the acquisition of the island or an interference with its control by any other power it should be add that it can not be reasonably assume that the hitherto expectant attitude of the united states will be indefinitely maintain while we be anxious to accord all due respect to the sovereignty of spain we can not view the pende conflict in all its feature and properly apprehend our inevitably close relation to it and its possible result without consider that by the course of event we may be draw into such an unusual and unprecedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient wait for spain to end the contest either alone and in her own way or with our friendly cooperation when the inability of spain to deal successfully with the insurrection have become manifest and it be demonstrate that her sovereignty be extinct in cuba for all purpose of its rightful existence and when a hopeless struggle for its reestablishment have degenerate into a strife which mean nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and the utter destruction of the very subject matter of the conflict a situation will be present in which our obligation to the sovereignty of spain will be supersede by high obligation which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge defer the choice of way and method until the time for action arrive we should make they depend upon the precise condition then exist and they should not be determine upon without give careful heed to every consideration involve our honor and interest or the international duty we owe to spain until we face the contingency suggest or the situation be by other incident imperatively change we should continue in the line of conduct heretofore pursue thus in all circumstance exhibit our obedience to the requirement of public law and our regard for the duty enjoin upon we by the position we occupy in the family of nation a contemplation of emergency that may arise should plainly lead we to avoid their creation either through a careless disregard of present duty or even an undue stimulation and ill timed expression of feeling but i have deem it not amiss to remind the congress that a time may arrive when a correct policy and care for our interest as well as a regard for the interest of other nation and their citizen join by consideration of humanity and a desire to see a rich and fertile country intimately relate to we save from complete devastation will constrain our government to such action as will subserve the interest thus involve and at the same time promise to cuba and its inhabitant an opportunity to enjoy the blessing of peace the venezuelan boundary question have cease to be a matter of difference between great britain and the united states their respective government having agree upon the substantial provision of a treaty between great britain and venezuela submit the whole controversy to arbitration the provision of the treaty be so eminently just and fair that the assent of venezuela thereto may confidently be anticipate negotiation for a treaty of general arbitration for all difference between great britain and the united states be far advanced and promise to reach a successful consummation at an early date the scheme of examine applicant for certain consular position to test their competency and fitness adopt under an executive order issue on the 20th of september 1895 have fully demonstrate the usefulness of this innovation in connection with this plan of examination promotion and transfer of deserving incumbent

inspection of consular office provide for by an appropriation for that purpose at the last session of the congress have be productive of such wholesome effect that i hope this important work will in the future be continue i know of nothing that can be do with the same slight expense so improve to the service i desire to repeat the recommendation contain in my last annual message in favor of provide at public expense official residence for our ambassador and minister at foreign capital the reason support this recommendation be strongly state in the report of the secretary of state and the subject seem of such importance that i hope it may receive the early attention of the congress we have during the last year labor faithfully and against unfavorable condition to secure well

support and improvement be fully state in the report of the secretary of the treasury to which the attention of the congress be especially invite the report of the secretary of war exhibit satisfactory condition in the several branch of the public service intrust to his charge the limit of our military force as fix by law be constantly and readily maintain the present discipline and morale of our army be excellent and mark progress and efficiency be apparent throughout its entire organization with the exception of delicate duty in the suppression of slight indian disturbance along our southwestern boundary in which the mexican troop cooperate and the compulsory but peaceful return with the consent of great britain of a band of cree indians from montana to the british possession no active operation have be require of the army during the year past change in method of administration the abandonment of unnecessary post and consequent concentration of troop and the exercise of care and vigilance by the various officer charge with the responsibility in the expenditure of the appropriation have result in reduce to a minimum the cost of maintenance of our military establishment during the past year the work of construct permanent infantry and cavalry post have be continue at the place heretofore designate the secretary of war repeat his recommendation that appropriation for barrack and quarter should more strictly conform to the need of the service as judge by the department rather than respond to the wish and importunity of locality it be imperative that much of the money provide for such construction should now be allot to the erection of necessary quarter for the garrison assign to the coast defense where many man will be need to properly care for and operate modern gun it be essential too that early provision be make to supply the necessary force of artillery to meet the demand of this service the entire army have now be equip with the new magazine arm and wise policy demand that all available public and private resource should be so employ as to provide within a reasonable time a sufficient number to supply the state militia with these modern weapon and provide an ample reserve for any emergency the organized militia number 112,879 man the appropriation for its support by the several states approximate $ 2,800,000 annually and $ 400,000 be contribute by the general government investigation show these troop to be usually well drill and inspire with much military interest but in many instance they be so deficient in proper arm and equipment that a sudden call to active duty would find they inadequately prepare for field service i therefore recommend that prompt measure be take to remedy this condition and that every encouragement be give to this deserve body of unpaid and voluntary citizen soldier upon whose assistance we must largely rely in time of trouble during the past year rapid progress have be make toward the completion of the scheme adopt for the erection and armament of fortification along our seacoast while equal progress have be make in provide the material for submarine defense in connection with these work it be peculiarly gratifying at this time to note the great advance that have be make in this important undertaking since the date of my annual message to the fifty third congress at the opening of its second session in december 1893 at that time i inform the congress of the approach completion of nine 12 inch twenty 10 inch and thirty four 8 inch high power steel gun and seventy five 12 inch rifle mortar this total then seem insignificant when compare with the great work remain to be do yet it be none the less a source of satisfaction to every citizen when he reflect that it represent the first installment of the new ordnance of american design and american manufacture and demonstrate our ability to supply from our own resource gun of unexcelle power and accuracy at that date however there be practically no carriage upon which to mount these gun and only thirty one emplacement for gun and sixty four for mortar nor be all these emplacement in condition to receive their armament only one high power gun be at that time in position for the defense of the entire coast since that time the number of gun actually complete have be increase to a total of twenty one 12 inch fifty six 10 inch sixty one 8 inch high power breech loading steel gun ten rapid fire gun and eighty 12 inch rifle mortar in addition there be in process of construction one 16 inch type gun fifty 12 inch fifty six 10 inch twenty seven 8 inch high power gun and sixty six 12 inch rifle mortar in all four hundred and twenty eight gun and mortar during the same year immediately precede the message refer to the first modern gun carriage have be complete and eleven more be in process of construction all but one be of the nondisappearing type these however be not such as to secure necessary cover for the artillery gunner against the intense fire of modern machine rapid fire and high power gun the inventive genius of ordnance and civilian expert have be tax in design carriage that would obviate this fault result it be believe in the solution of this difficult problem since 1893 the number of gun carriage construct or building have be raise to a total of 129 of which 90 be on the disappear principle and the number of mortar carriage to 152 while the 95 emplacement which be provide for prior to that time have be increase to 280 build and building this improved situation be largely due to the recent generous response of congress to the recommendation of the war department thus we shall soon have complete about one fifth of the comprehensive system the first step in which be note in my message to the congress of december 4 1893.when it be understand that a masonry emplacement not only furnish a platform for the heavy modern high power gun but also in every particular serve the purpose and take the place of the fort of former day the importance of the work accomplish be well comprehend in the hope that the work will be prosecute with no less vigor in the future the secretary of war have submit an estimate by which if allow there will be provide and either build or building by the end of the next fiscal year such additional gun mortar gun carriage and emplacement as will represent not far from one third of the total work to be do under the plan adopt for our coast defense thus afford a prospect that the entire work will be substantially complete within six year in less time than that however we shall have attain a marked degree of security the experience and result of the past year demonstrate that with a continuation of present careful method the cost of the remain work will be much less than the original estimate we should always keep in mind that of all form of military preparation coast defense alone be essentially pacific in its nature while it give the sense of security due to a consciousness of strength it be neither the purpose nor the effect of such permanent fortification to involve we in foreign complication but rather to guarantee we against they they be not temptation to war but security against it thus they be thoroughly in accord with all the tradition of our national diplomacy the attorney general present a detailed and interesting statement of the important work do under his supervision during the last fiscal year the ownership and management by the government of penitentiary for the confinement of those convict in united states court of violation of federal law which for many year have be a subject of executive recommendation have at last to a slight extent be realize by the utilization of the abandon military prison at fort leavenworth as a united states penitentiary this be certainly a movement in the right direction but it ought to be at once supplement by the rebuilding or extensive enlargement of this improvise prison and the construction of at least one more to be locate in the southern states the capacity of the leavenworth penitentiary be so limited that the expense of its maintenance calculate at a per capita rate upon the number of prisoner it can accommodate do not make as economical an exhibit as it would if it be large and well adapt to prison purpose but i be thoroughly convinced that economy humanity and a proper sense of responsibility and duty toward those whom we punish for violation of federal law dictate that the federal government should have the entire control and management of the penitentiary where convict violator be confine it appear that since the transfer of the fort leavenworth military prison to its new use the work previously do by prisoner confine there and for which expensive machinery have be provide have be discontinue this work consist of the manufacture of article for army use now do elsewhere on all ground it be exceedingly desirable that the convict confine in this penitentiary be allow to resume work of this description it be most gratifying to note the satisfactory result that have follow the inauguration of the new system provide for by the act of may 28 1896 under which certain federal official be compensate by salary instead of fee the new plan be put in operation on the 1st day of july 1896 and already the great economy it enforce its prevention of abuse and its tendency to a well enforcement of the law be strikingly apparent detailed evidence of the usefulness of this long delay but now happily accomplished reform will be find clearly set forth in the attorney general 's report our post office department be in good condition and the exhibit make of its operation during the fiscal year end june 30 1896 if allowance be make for imperfection in the law applicable to it be very satisfactory the total receipt during the year be $ 82,499,208.40 the total expenditure be $ 90,626,296.84 exclusive of the $ 1,559,898.27 which be earn by the pacific railroad for transportation and credit on their debt to the government there be an increase of receipt over the previous year of $ 5,516,080.21 or 7.1 per cent and an increase of expenditure of $ 3,836,124.02 or 4.42 per cent the deficit be $ 1,679,956.19 less than that of the precede year the chief expenditure of the postal service be regulate by law and be not in the control of the postmaster general all that he can accomplish by the most watchful administration and economy be to enforce prompt and thorough collection and accounting for public money and such minor saving in small expenditure and in let those contract for post office supply and star service which be not regulate by statute an effective cooperation between the auditor 's office and the post office department and the making and enforcement of order by the department require immediate notification to their surety of all delinquency on the part of postmaster and compelling such postmaster to make more frequent deposit of postal fund have result in a prompter auditing of their account and much less default to the government than heretofore the year 's report show large extension of both star route service and railway mail service with increase postal facility much high accuracy in handle mail have also be reach as appear by the decrease of error in the railway mail service and the reduction of mail matter return to the dead letter office the deficit for the last year although much less than that of the last and precede year emphasize the necessity for legislation to correct the grow abuse of second class rate to which the deficiency be mainly attributable the transmission at the rate of 1 cent a pound of serial library advertising sheet house organ periodical advertise some particular house or institution sample copy and the like ought certainly to be discontinue a glance at the revenue receive for the work do last year will show more plainly than any other statement the gross abuse of the postal service and the grow waste of its earning the free matter carry in the mail for the departments office etc of the government and for congress in pound amount to 94,480,189.if this be offset against building for post office and station the rental of which would more than compensate for such free postal service we have this exhibit weight of mail matter other than above transmit through the mail for the year end june 30 1896 class weight revenue pounds 1 domestic and foreign letter and postal card etc65,337,343$60,624,4642 newspaper and periodical 1 cent per pound348,988,6482,996,4033 book seed etc 8 cent a pound78,701,14810,324,0694 parcels etc 16 cent a pound19,950,1873,129,321total 512,977,32677,044,257the remainder of our postal revenue amount to something more than $ 5,000,000 be derive from box rent registry fee money order business and other similar item the entire expenditure of the department include pay for transportation credit to the pacific railroad be $ 92,186,195.11 which may be consider as the cost of receive carry and deliver the above mail matter it thus appear that though the second class matter constitute more than two third of the total that be carry the revenue derive from it be less than one thirtieth of the total expense the average revenue was-- from each pound of first class matter cents93.0from each pound of second class mills8.5from each pound of third class cents13.1from each pound of fourth class do15.6of the second class 52,348,297 be county free matter the growth in weight of second class matter have be from 299,000,000 pound in 1894 to 312,000,000 in 1895 and to almost 349,000,000 in 1896 and it be quite evident this increase drawback be far outstrip any possible growth of postal revenue our mail service should of course be such as to meet the want and even the convenience of our people at a direct charge upon they so light as perhaps to exclude the idea of our post office department be a money make concern but in the face of a constantly recur deficiency in its revenue and in view of the fact that we supply the good mail service in the world it seem to i it be quite time to correct the abuse that swell enormously our annual deficit if we concede the public policy of carry weekly newspaper free in the county of publication and even the policy of carry at less than one tenth of their cost other bona fide newspaper and periodical there can be no excuse for subject the service to the further immense and increase loss involve in carry at the nominal rate of 1 cent a pound the serial library sometimes include trashy and even harmful literature and other matter which under the loose interpretation of a loose statute have be gradually give second class rate thus absorb all profitable return derive from first class matter which pay three or four time more than its cost and produce a large annual loss to be pay by general taxation if such second class matter pay merely the cost of its handling our deficit would disappear and a surplus result which might be use to give the people still well mail facility or cheap rate of letter postage i recommend that legislation be at once enact to correct these abuse and introduce well business idea in the regulation of our postal rate experience and observation have demonstrate that certain improvement in the organization of the post office department must be secure before we can gain the full benefit of the immense sum expend in its administration this involve the follow reform which i earnestly recommend there should be a small addition to the exist inspector service to be employ in the supervision of the carrier force which now number 13,000 man and perform its service practically without the surveillance exercise over all other branch of the postal or public service of course such a lack of supervision and freedom from wholesome disciplinary restraint must inevitably lead to imperfect service there should also be appoint a few inspector who could assist the central office in necessary investigation concern matter of post office lease post office site allowance for rent fuel and light and in organize and secure the good result from the work of the 14,000 clerk now employ in first and second class office i be convinced that the small expense attend the inauguration of these reform would actually be a profitable investment i especially recommend such a recasting of the appropriation by congress for the post office department as will permit the postmaster general to proceed with the work of consolidate post office this work have already be enter upon sufficiently to fully demonstrate by experiment and experience that such consolidation be productive of well service large revenue and less expenditure to say nothing of the further advantage of gradually withdraw post office from the spoil system the universal postal union which now embrace all the civilized world and whose delegate will represent 1,000,000,000 people will hold its fifth congress in the city of washington in may 1897 the united states may be say to have take the initiative which lead to the first meeting of this congress at berne in 1874 and the formation of the universal postal union which bring the postal service of all country to every man 's neighborhood and have work marvel in cheapen postal rate and secure absolutely safe mail communication throughout the world previous congress have meet in berne paris lisbon and vienna and the respective country in which they have assemble have make generous provision for their accommodation and for the reception and entertainment of the delegate in view of the importance of this assemblage and of its deliberation and of the honor and hospitality accord to our representative by other country on similar occasion i earnestly hope that such an appropriation will be make for the expense necessarily attendant upon the come meeting in our capital city as will be worthy of our national hospitality and indicative of our appreciation of the event the work of the navy department and its present condition be fully exhibit in the report of the secretary the construction of vessel for our new navy have be energetically prosecute by the present administration upon the general line previously adopt the department having see no necessity for radical change in prior method under which the work be find to be progress in a manner highly satisfactory it have be decide however to provide in every shipbuilding contract that the builder should pay all trial expense and it have also be determine to pay no speed premium in future contract the premium recently earn and some yet to be decide be feature of the contract make before this conclusion be reach on march 4 1893 there be in commission but two armored vessel the double turrete monitor miantonomoh and monterey since that date of vessel theretofore authorize there have be place in their first commission 3 first class and 2 second class battle ship 2 armored cruiser 1 harbor defense ram and 5 double turrete monitor include the maine and the puritan just complete eight new unarmored cruiser and 2 new gunboat have also be commission the iowa another battle ship will be complete about march 1 and at least 4 more gunboat will be ready for sea in the early spring it be gratify to state that our ship and their outfit be believe to be equal to the good that can be manufacture elsewhere and that such notable reduction have be make in their cost as to justify the statement that quite a number of vessel be now be construct at rate as low as those that prevail in european shipyard our manufacture facility be at this time ample for all possible naval contingency three of our government navy yard those at mare island cal norfolk va. and brooklyn n. y.--are equip for shipbuilding our ordnance plant in washington be equal to any in the world and at the torpedo station we be successfully make the high grade of smokeless powder the first class private shipyard at newport news philadelphia and san francisco be build battle ship eleven contractor situate in the states of maine rhode island pennsylvania new jersey maryland virginia and the state of washington be construct gunboat or torpedo boat two plant be manufacture large quantity of first class armor and american factory be produce automobile torpedo powder projectile rapid fire gun and everything else necessary for the complete outfit of naval vessel there have be authorize by congress since march 1893 5 battle ship 6 light draft gunboat 16 torpedo boat and 1 submarine torpedo boat contract for the building of all of they have be let the secretary express the opinion that we have for the present a sufficient supply of cruiser and gunboat and that hereafter the construction of battle ship and torpedo boat will supply our need much attention have be give to the method of carry on departmental business important modification in the regulation have be make tend to unify the control of shipbuilding as far as may be under the bureau of construction and repair and also to improve the mode of purchase supply for the navy by the bureau of supplies and account the establishment under recent act of congress of a supply fund with which to purchase these supply in large quantity and other modification of method have tend materially to their cheapening and well quality the war college have develop into an institution which it be believe will be of great value to the navy in teach the science of war as well as in stimulate professional zeal in the navy and it will be especially useful in the devising of plan for the utilization in case of necessity of all the naval resource of the united states the secretary have persistently adhere to the plan he find in operation for secure labor at navy yard through board of labor employment and have do much to make it more complete and efficient the naval officer who be familiar with this system and its operation express the decide opinion that its result have be to vastly improve the character of the work do at our yard and greatly reduce its cost discipline among the officer and man of the navy have be maintain to a high standard and the percentage of american citizen enlist have be very much increase the secretary be consider and will formulate during the come winter a plan for lay up ship in reserve thereby largely reduce the cost of maintain our vessel afloat this plan contemplate that battle ship torpedo boat and such of the cruiser as be not need for active service at sea shall be keep in reserve with skeleton crew on board to keep they in condition cruise only enough to insure the efficiency of the ship and their crew in time of activity the economy to result from this system be too obvious to need comment the naval militia which be authorize a few year ago as an experiment have now develop into a body of enterprise young man active and energetic in the discharge of their duty and promise great usefulness this establishment have nearly the same relation to our navy as the national guard in the different states bear to our army and it constitute a source of supply for our naval force the importance of which be immediately apparent the report of the secretary of the interior present a comprehensive and interesting exhibit of the numerous and important affair commit to his supervision it be impossible in this communication to do more than briefly refer to a few of the subject concern which the secretary give full and instructive information the money appropriate on account of this department and for its disbursement for the fiscal year end june 30 1896 amount to more than $ 157,000,000 or a great sum than be appropriate for the entire maintenance of the government for the two fiscal year end june 30 1861.our public land originally amount to 1,840,000,000 acre have be so reduce that only about 600,000,000 acre still remain in government control exclude alaska the balance be by far the most valuable portion have be give away to settler to new states and to railroad or sell at a comparatively nominal sum the patenting of land in execution of railroad grant have progress rapidly during the year and since the 4th day of march 1893 about 25,000,000 acre have thus be convey to these corporation i agree with the secretary that the remainder of our public land should be more carefully deal with and their alienation guard by well economy and great prudence the commission appoint from the membership of the national academy of sciences provide for by an act of congress to formulate plan for a national forestry system will it be hope soon be prepared to present the result of thorough and intelligent examination of this important subject the total indian population of the united states be 177,235 accord to a census make in 1895 exclusive of those within the state of new york and those comprise the five civilized tribes of this number there be approximately 38,000 child of school age during the year 23,393 of these be enrol in school the progress which have attend recent effort to extend indian school facility and the anticipation of continue liberal appropriation to that end can not fail to afford the utmost satisfaction to those who believe that the education of indian child be a prime factor in the accomplishment of indian civilization it may be say in general term that in every particular the improvement of the indians under government care have be most marked and encouraging the secretary the commissioner of indian affairs and the agent have charge of indians to whom allotment have be make strongly urge the passage of a law prohibit the sale of liquor to allottee who have take their land in severalty i earnestly join in this recommendation and venture to express the hope that the indian may be speedily protect against this great of all obstacle to his well being and advancement the condition of affair among the five civilized tribes who occupy large tract of land in the indian territory and who have government of their own have assume such an aspect as to render it almost indispensable that there should be an entire change in the relation of these indians to the general government this seem to be necessary in furtherance of their own interest as well as for the protection of non indian resident in their territory a commission organize and empower under several recent law be now negotiate with these indians for the relinquishment of their court and the division of their common land in severalty and be aid in the settlement of the troublesome question of tribal membership the reception of their first proffer of negotiation be not encouraging but through patience and such conduct on their part as demonstrate that their intention be friendly and in the interest of the tribe the prospect of success have become more promising the effort should be to save these indians from the consequence of their own mistake and improvidence and to secure to the real indian his right as against intruder and profess friend who profit by his retrogression a change be also need to protect life and property through the operation of court conduct accord to strict justice and strong enough to enforce their mandate as a sincere friend of the indian i be exceedingly anxious that these reform should be accomplish with the consent and aid of the tribe and that no necessity may be present for radical or drastic legislation i hope therefore that the commission now conduct negotiation will soon be able to report that progress have be make toward a friendly adjustment of exist difficulty it appear that a very valuable deposit of gilsonite or asphaltum have be find on the reservation in utah occupy by the uncompahgre ute indians every consideration of care for the public interest and every sensible business reason dictate such management or disposal of this important source of public revenue as will except it from the general rule and incident attend the ordinary disposition of public land and secure to the government a fair share at least of its advantage in place of its transfer for a nominal sum to interested individual i indorse the recommendation make by the present secretary of the interior as well as his predecessor that a permanent commission consist of three member one of whom shall be an army officer be create to perform the duty now devolve upon the commissioner and assistant commissioner of indian affairs the management of the bureau involve such numerous and diverse detail and the advantage of an uninterrupted policy be so apparent that i hope the change suggest will meet the approval of the congress the diminution of our enormous pension roll and the decrease of pension expenditure which have be so often confidently for tell still fail in material realization the number of pensioner on the poll at the close of the fiscal year end june 30 1896 be 970,678 this be the large number ever report the amount pay exclusively for pension during the year be $ 138,214,761.94 a slight decrease from that of the precede year while the total expenditure on account of pension include the cost of maintain the department and expense attend pension distribution amount to $ 142,206,550.59 or within every small fraction of one third of the entire expense of support the government during the same year the number of new pension certificate issue be 90,640 of these 40,374 represent original allowance of claim and 15,878 increase of exist pension the number of person receive pension from the united states but reside in foreign country at the close of the last fiscal year be 3,781 and the amount pay to they during the year be $ 582,735.38.the sum appropriate for the payment of pension for the current fiscal year end june 30 1897 be $ 140,000,000 and for the succeed year it be estimate that the same amount will be necessary the commissioner of pensions report that during the last fiscal year 339 indictment be find against violator of the pension law upon these indictment 167 conviction result in my opinion base upon such statement as these and much other information and observation the abuse which have be allow to creep into our pension system have do incalculable harm in demoralize our people and undermine good citizenship i have endeavor within my sphere of official duty to protect our pension roll and make it what it should be a roll of honor contain the name of those disabled in their country 's service and worthy of their country 's affectionate remembrance when i have see those who pose as the soldier friend active and alert in urge great laxity and more reckless pension expenditure while nursing selfish scheme i have deprecate the approach of a situation when necessary retrenchment and enforce economy may lead to an attack upon pension abuse so determined as to overlook the discrimination due to those who worthy of a nation 's care ought to live and die under the protection of a nation 's gratitude the secretary call attention to the public interest involve in an adjustment of the obligation of the pacific railroad to the government i deem it to be an important duty to especially present this subject to the consideration of the congress on january 1 1897 with the amount already mature more than $ 13,000,000 of the principal of the subsidy bond issue by the united states in aid of the construction of the union pacific railway include its kansas line and more than $ 6,000,000 of like bond issue in aid of the central pacific railroad include those issue to the western pacific railroad company will have fall due and be pay or must on that day be pay by the government without any reference to the application of the sink fund now in the treasury this will create such a default on the part of these company to the government as will give it the right to at once institute proceeding to foreclose its mortgage lien in addition to this indebtedness which will be due january 1 1897 there will mature between that date and january 1 1899 the remain principal of such subsidy bond which must also be meet by the government these amount to more than $ 20,000,000 on account of the union pacific line and exceed $ 21,000,000 on account of the central pacific line the situation of these road and the condition of their indebtedness to the government have be fully set forth in the report of various committee to the present and prior congresses and as early as 1887 they be thoroughly examine by a special commission appoint pursuant to an act of congress the consideration require an adjustment of the government 's relation to the company have be clearly present and the conclusion reach with practical uniformity that if these relation be not terminate they should be revise upon a basis secure their safe continuance under section 4 of the act of congress pass march 3 1887 the president be charge with the duty in the event that any mortgage or other incumbrance paramount to the interest of the united states in the property of the pacific railroad should exist and be lawfully liable to be enforce to direct the action of the departments of treasury and of justice in the protection of the interest of the united states by redemption or through judicial proceeding include foreclosure of the government lien in view of the fact that the congress have for a number of year almost constantly have under consideration various plan for deal with the condition exist between these road and the government i have thus far feel justify in withholding action under the statute above mention in the case of the union pacific company however the situation have become especially and immediately urgent proceeding have be institute to foreclose a first mortgage upon those aid part of the main line upon which the government hold a second and subordinate mortgage lien in consequence of those proceeding and increase complication add to the default occur on the 1st day of january 1897 a condition will be present at that date so far as this company be concern that must emphasize the mandate of the act of 1887 and give to executive duty under its provision a more imperative aspect therefore unless congress shall otherwise direct or shall have previously determine upon a different solution of the problem there will hardly appear to exist any reason for delay beyond the date of the default above mention such executive action as will promise to subserve the public interest and save the government from the loss threaten by further inaction the department of agriculture be so intimately related to the welfare of our people and the prosperity of our nation that it should constantly receive the care and encouragement of the government from small beginning it have grow to be the center of agricultural intelligence and the source of aid and encouragement to agricultural effort large sum of money be annually appropriate for the maintenance of this department and it must be confess that the legislation relate to it have not always be directly in the interest of practical farming or properly guard against waste and extravagance so far however as public money have be appropriate fairly and sensibly to help those who actually till the soil no expenditure have be more profitably make or more generally approve by the people under the present management of the department its usefulness have be enhance in every direction and at the same time strict economy have be enforce to the utmost extent permit by congressional action from the report of the secretary it appear that through careful and prudent financial management he have annually save a large sum from his appropriation aggregate during his incumbency and up to the close of the present fiscal year nearly one fifth of the entire amount appropriate these result have be accomplish by a conscientious study of the real need of the farmer and such a regard for economy as the genuine farmer ought to appreciate supplement by a rigid adherence to civil service method in a department which should be conduct in the interest of agriculture instead of partisan politic the secretary report that the value of our export of farm product during the last fiscal year amount to $ 570,000,000 an increase of $ 17,000,000 over those of the year immediately precede this statement be not the less welcome because of the fact that notwithstanding such increase the proportion of export agricultural product to our total export of all description fall off during the year the benefit of an increase in agricultural export be assure the decrease in its proportion to our total export be the more gratifying when we consider that it be owe to the fact that such total export for the year increase more than $ 75,000,000.the large and increase exportation of our agricultural product suggest the great usefulness of the organization lately establish in the department for the purpose of give to those engage in farming pursuit reliable information concern the condition need and advantage of different foreign market inasmuch as the success of the farmer depend upon the advantageous sale of his product and inasmuch as foreign market must largely be the destination of such product it be quite apparent that a knowledge of the condition and want that affect those market ought to result in sow more intelligently and reap with a well promise of profit such information point out the way to a prudent foresight in the selection and cultivation of crop and to a release from the bondage of unreasone monotony of production a glutted and depressed market and constantly recur unprofitable toil in my opinion the gratuitous distribution of seed by the department as at present conduct ought to be discontinue no one can read the statement of the secretary on this subject and doubt the extravagance and questionable result of this practice the profess friend of the farmer and certainly the farmer themselves be naturally expect to be willing to rid a department devote to the promotion of farming interest of a feature which tend so much to its discredit the weather bureau now attach to the department of agriculture have continue to extend its sphere of usefulness and by an uninterrupted improvement in the accuracy of its forecast have greatly increase its efficiency as an aid and protection to all whose occupation be relate to weather condition omit further reference to the operation of the department i commend the secretary 's report and the suggestion it contain to the careful consideration of the congress the progress make in civil service reform furnish a cause for the utmost congratulation it have survive the doubt of its friend as well as the rancor of its enemy and have gain a permanent place among the agency destine to cleanse our politic and to improve economize and elevate the public service there be now in the competitive classified service upward of 84,000 place more than half of these having be include from time to time since march 4 1893 a most radical and sweeping extension be make by executive order date the 6th day of may 1896 and if fourth class postmastership be not include in the statement it may be say that practically all position contemplate by the civil service law be now classify abundant reason exist for include these postmaster ship base upon economy improve service and the peace and quiet of neighborhood if however obstacle prevent such action at present i earnestly hope that congress will without increase post office appropriation so adjust they as to permit in proper ease a consolidation of these post office to the end that through this process the result desire may to a limited extent be accomplish the civil service rule as amend during the last year provide for a sensible and uniform method of promotion base eligibility to well position upon demonstrate efficiency and faithfulness the absence of fix rule on this subject have be an infirmity in the system more and more apparent as its other benefit have be well appreciate the advantage of civil service method in their business aspect be too well understand to require argument their application have become a necessity to the executive work of the government but those who gain position through the operation of these method should be make to understand that the nonpartisan scheme through which they receive their appointment demand from they by way of reciprocity nonpartisan and faithful performance of duty under every administration and cheerful fidelity to every chief while they should be encourage to decently exercise their right of citizenship and to support through their suffrage the political belief they honestly profess the noisy pestilent and partisan employee who love political turmoil and contention or who render lax and grudge service to an administration not represent his political view should be promptly and fearlessly deal with in such a way as to furnish a warning to other who may be likewise dispose the annual report of the commissioners will be duly transmit and i commend the important matter they have in charge to the careful consideration of the congress the interstate commerce commission have during the last year supply abundant evidence of its usefulness and the importance of the work commit to its charge public transportation be a universal necessity and the question of just and reasonable charge therefor have become of vital importance not only to shipper and carrier but also to the vast multitude of producer and consumer the justice and equity of the principle embody in the exist law pass for the purpose of regulate these charge be everywhere concede and there appear to be no question that the policy thus enter upon have a permanent place in our legislation as the present statute when enact be in the nature of the case more or less tentative and experimental it be hardly expect to supply a complete and adequate system while its wholesome effect be manifest and have amply justify its enactment it be evident that all desire reform in transportation method have not be fully accomplish in view of the judicial interpretation which some provision of this statute have receive and the defect disclose by the effort make for its enforcement its revision and amendment appear to be essential to the end that it may more effectually reach the evil design to be correct i hope the recommendation of the commission upon this subject will be promptly and favorably consider by the congress i desire to recur to the statement elsewhere make concern the government 's receipt and expenditure for the purpose of venture upon some suggestion touch our present tariff law and its operation this statute take effect on the 28th day of august 1894 whatever may be its shortcoming as a complete measure of tariff reform it must be concede that it have open the way to a free and great exchange of commodity between we and other country and thus furnish a wide market for our product and manufacture the only entire fiscal year during which this law have be in force end on the 30th day of june 1896 in that year our import increase over those of the previous year more than $ 6,500,000 while the value of the domestic product we export and which find market abroad be nearly $ 70,000,000 more than during the precede year those who insist that the cost to our people of article come to they from abroad for their needful use should only be increase through tariff charge to an extent necessary to meet the expense of the government as well as those who claim that tariff charge may be lay upon such article beyond the necessity of government revenue and with the additional purpose of so increase their price in our market as to give american manufacturer and producer well and more profitable opportunity must agree that our tariff law be only primarily justify as source of revenue to enable the government to meet the necessary expense of its maintenance consider as to its efficiency in this aspect the present law can by no mean fall under just condemnation during the only complete fiscal year of its operation it have yield nearly $ 8,000,000 more revenue than be receive from tariff duty in the precede year there be nevertheless a deficit between our receipt and expenditure of a little more than $ 25,000,000 this however be not unexpected the situation be such in december last seven month before the close of the fiscal year that the secretary of the treasury foretell a deficiency of $ 17,000,000 the great and increase apprehension and timidity in business circle and the depression in all activity intervene since that time result from cause perfectly well understand and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or its operation seriously check the import we would have otherwise receive and readily account for the difference between this estimate of the secretary and the actual deficiency as well as for a continued deficit indeed it must be confess that we could hardly have have a more unfavorable period than the last two year for the collection of tariff revenue we can not reasonably hope that our recuperation from this business depression will be sudden but it have already set in with a promise of acceleration and continuance i believe our present tariff law if allow a fair opportunity will in the near future yield a revenue which with reasonably economical expenditure will overcome all deficiency in the meantime no deficit that have occur or may occur need excite or disturb we to meet any such deficit we have in the treasury in addition to a gold reserve of one hundred million a surplus of more than $ 128,000,000 applicable to the payment of the expense of the government and which must unless expend for that purpose remain a useless hoard or if not extravagantly waste must in any event be pervert from the purpose of its exaction from our people the payment therefore of any deficiency in the revenue from this fund be nothing more than its proper and legitimate use the government thus apply a surplus fortunately in its treasury to the payment of expense not meet by its current revenue be not at all to be liken to a man live beyond his income and thus incur debt or encroach on his principal it be not one of the function of our government to accumulate and make addition to a fund not need for immediate expenditure with individual it be the chief object of struggle and effort the application of an accumulate fund by the government to the payment of its running expense be a duty an individual live beyond his income and embarrass himself with debt or draw upon his accumulate fund of principal be either unfortunate or improvident the distinction be between a government charge with the duty of expend for the benefit of the people and for proper purpose all the money it receive from any source and the individual who be expect to manifest a natural desire to avoid debt or to accumulate as much as possible and to live within the income derive from such accumulation to the end that they may be increase or at least remain unimpaired for the future use and enjoyment of himself or the object of his love and affection who may survive he it be immeasurably well to appropriate our surplus to the payment of justifiable expense than to allow it to become an invitation to reckless appropriation and extravagant expenditure i suppose it will not be deny that under the present law our people obtain the necessary of a comfortable existence at a cheap rate than formerly this be a matter of supreme importance since it be the palpable duty of every just government to make the burden of taxation as light as possible the people should not be require to relinquish this privilege of cheap living except under the stress of their government 's necessity make plainly manifest this reference to the condition and prospect of our revenue naturally suggest an allusion to the weakness and vice of our financial method they have be frequently press upon the attention of congress in previous executive communication and the inevitable danger of their continue toleration point out without now repeat these detail i can not refrain from again earnestly present the necessity of the prompt reform of a system oppose to every rule of sound finance and show by experience to be fraught with the grave peril and perplexity the terrible civil war which shake the foundation of our government more than thirty year ago bring in its train the destruction of property the wasting of our country 's substance and the estrangement of brother these be now past and forget even the distressing loss of life the conflict entail be but a sacred memory which foster patriotic sentiment and keep alive a tender regard for those who nobly die and yet there remain with we to day in full strength and activity as an incident of that tremendous struggle a feature of its financial necessity not only unsuited to our present circumstance but manifestly a disturbing menace to business security and an ever present agent of monetary distress because we may be enjoy a temporary relief from its depressing influence this should not lull we into a false security nor lead we to forget the suddenness of past visitation i be more convinced than ever that we can have no assure financial peace and safety until the government currency obligation upon which gold may be demand from the treasury be withdraw from circulation and cancel this might be do as have be heretofore recommend by their exchange for long term bond bear a low rate of interest or by their redemption with the proceed of such bond even if only the united states note know as greenback be thus retire it be probable that the treasury note issue in payment of silver purchase under the act of july 14 1890 now pay in gold when demand would not create much disturbance as they might from time to time when receive in the treasury by redemption in gold or otherwise be gradually and prudently replace by silver coin this plan of issue bond for the purpose of redemption certainly appear to be the most effective and direct path to the need reform in default of this however it would be a step in the right direction if currency obligation redeemable in gold whenever so redeemed should be cancel instead of be reissue this operation would be a slow remedy but it would improve present condition national bank should redeem their own note they should be allow to issue circulation to the par value of bond deposit as security for its redemption and the tax on their circulation should be reduce to one fourth of 1 per cent in consider project for the retirement of united states note and treasury note issue under the law of 1890 i be of the opinion that we have place too much stress upon the danger of contract the currency and have calculate too little upon the gold that would be add to our circulation if invite to we by well and safe financial method it be not so much a contraction of our currency that should be avoid as its unequal distribution this might be obviate and any fear of harmful contraction at the same time remove by allow the organization of small bank and in less populous community than be now permit and also authorize exist bank to establish branch in small community under proper restriction the entire case may be present by the statement that the day of sensible and sound financial method will not dawn upon we until our government abandon the banking business and the accumulation of fund and confine its monetary operation to the receipt of the money contribute by the people for its support and to the expenditure of such money for the people 's benefit our business interest and all good citizen long for rest from feverish agitation and the inauguration by the government of a reform financial policy which will encourage enterprise and make certain the reward of labor and industry another topic in which our people rightfully take a deep interest may be here briefly consider i refer to the existence of trust and other huge aggregation of capital the object of which be to secure the monopoly of some particular branch of trade industry or commerce and to stifle wholesome competition when these be defend it be usually on the ground that though they increase profit they also reduce price and thus may benefit the public it must be remember however that a reduction of price to the people be not one of the real object of these organization nor be their tendency necessarily in that direction if it occur in a particular case it be only because it accord with the purpose or interest of those manage the scheme such occasional result fall far short of compensate the palpable evil charge to the account of trust and monopoly their tendency be to crush out individual independence and to hinder or prevent the free use of human faculty and the full development of human character through they the farmer the artisan and the small trader be in danger of dislodgment from the proud position of be his own master watchful of all that touch his country 's prosperity in which he have an individual lot and interested in all that affect the advantage of business of which he be a factor to be relegate to the level of a mere appurtenance to a great machine with little free will with no duty but that of passive obedience and with little hope or opportunity of rise in the scale of responsible and helpful citizenship to the instinctive belief that such be the inevitable trend of trust and monopoly be due the widespread and deep seat popular aversion in which they be hold and the not unreasonable insistence that whatever may be their incidental economic advantage their general effect upon personal character prospect and usefulness can not be otherwise than injurious though congress have attempt to deal with this matter by legislation the law pass for that purpose thus far have prove ineffective not because of any lack of disposition or attempt to enforce they but simply because the law themselves as interpret by the court do not reach the difficulty if the insufficiency of exist law can be remedie by further legislation it should be do the fact must be recognize however that all federal legislation on this subject may fall short of its purpose because of inherent obstacle and also because of the complex character of our governmental system which while make the federal authority supreme within its sphere have carefully limit that sphere by mete and bound that can not be transgress the decision of our high court on this precise question render it quite doubtful whether the evil of trust and monopoly can be adequately treat through federal action unless they seek directly and purposely to include in their object transportation or intercourse between states or between the united states and foreign country it do not follow however that this be the limit of the remedy that may be apply even though it may be find that federal authority be not broad enough to fully reach the case there can be no doubt of the power of the several states to act effectively in the premise and there should be no reason to doubt their willingness to judiciously exercise such power in conclude this communication its last word shall be an appeal to the congress for the most rigid economy in the expenditure of the money it hold in trust for the people the way to perplex extravagance be easy but a return to frugality be difficult when however it be consider that those who bear the burden of taxation have no guaranty of honest care save in the fidelity of their public servant the duty of all possible retrenchment be plainly manifest when our difference be forget and our contest of political opinion be no long remember nothing in the retrospect of our public service will be as fortunate and comforting as the recollection of official duty well perform and the memory of a constant devotion to the interest of our confide fellow countryman
to the senate
 i transmit herewith a treaty for the arbitration of all matter in difference between the united states and great britain
 the provision of the treaty be the result of long and patient deliberation and represent concession make by each party for the sake of agreement upon the general scheme
 though the result reach may not meet the view of the advocate of immediate unlimited and irrevocable arbitration of all international controversy it be nevertheless confidently believe that the treaty can not fail to be everywhere recognize as make a long step in the right direction and as embody a practical working plan by which dispute between the two country will reach a peaceful adjustment as matter of course and in ordinary routine
 in the initiation of such an important movement it must be expect that some of its feature will assume a tentative character look to a further advance and yet it be apparent that the treaty which have be formulate not only make war between the party to it a remote possibility but preclude those fear and rumor of war which of themselves too often assume the proportion of national disaster
 it be eminently fitting as well as fortunate that the attempt to accomplish result so beneficent should be initiate by kindre people speak the same tongue and join together by all the tie of common tradition common institution and common aspiration the experiment of substitute civilized method for brute force as the mean of settle inter national question of right will thus be try under the happy auspex its success ought not to be doubtful and the fact that its ultimate ensue benefit be not likely to be limit to the two country immediately concern should cause it to be promote all the more eagerly the example set and the lesson furnish by the successful operation of this treaty be sure to be feel and take to heart soon or later by other nation and will thus mark the beginning of a new epoch in civilization
 profoundly impressed as i be therefore by the promise of transcendent good which this treaty afford i do not hesitate to accompany its transmission with an expression of my earnest hope that it may commend itself to the favorable consideration of the senate

to the house of representatives
 i herewith return without approval house bill no 7864 entitle an act to amend the immigration law of the united states
 by the first section of this bill it be propose to amend section 1 of the act of march 3 1891 relate to immigration by add to the class of alien thereby exclude from admission to the united states the follow
 all person physically capable and over 16 year of age who can not read and write the english language or some other language but a person not so able to read and write who be over 50 year of age and be the parent or grandparent of a qualified immigrant over 21 year of age and capable of support such parent or grandparent may accompany such immigrant or such a parent or grandparent may be send for and come to join the family of a child or grandchild over 21 year of age similarly qualified and capable and a wife or minor child not so able to read and write may accompany or be send for and come and join the husband or parent similarly qualified and capable
 a radical departure from our national policy relate to immigration be here present heretofore we have welcome all who come to we from other land except those whose moral or physical condition or history threaten danger to our national welfare and safety rely upon the zealous watchfulness of our people to prevent injury to our political and social fabric we have encourage those come from foreign country to cast their lot with we and join in the development of our vast domain secure in return a share in the blessing of american citizenship
 a century&#39;s stupendous growth largely due to the assimilation and thrift of million of sturdy and patriotic adopt citizen attest the success of this generous and free handed policy which while guard the people&#39; interest exact from our immigrant only physical and moral soundness and a willingness and ability to work
 a contemplation of the grand result of this policy can not fail to arouse a sentiment in its defense for however it might have be regard as an original proposition and view as an experiment its accomplishment be such that if it be to be uproot at this late day its disadvantage should be plainly apparent and the substitute adopt should be just and adequate free from uncertainty and guard against difficult or oppressive administration
 it be not claim i believe that the time have come for the further restriction of immigration on the ground that an excess of population overcrowd our land
 it be say however that the quality of recent immigration be undesirable the time be quite within recent memory when the same thing be say of immigrant who with their descendant be now number among our good citizen
 it be say that too many immigrant settle in our city thus dangerously increase their idle and vicious population this be certainly a disadvantage it can not be show however that it affect all our city nor that it be permanent nor do it appear that this condition where it exist demand as its remedy the reversal of our present immigration policy
 the claim be also make that the influx of foreign laborer deprive of the opportunity to work those who be well entitle than they to the privilege of earn their livelihood by daily toil an unfortunate condition be certainly present when any who be willing to labor be unemployed but so far as this condition now exist among our people it must be concede to be a result of phenomenal business depression and the stagnation of all enterprise in which labor be a factor with the advent of settled and wholesome financial and economic governmental policy and consequent encouragement to the activity of capital the misfortune of unemployed labor should to a great extent at least be remedie if it continue its natural consequence must be to check the further immigration to our city of foreign laborer and to deplete the rank of those already there in the meantime those most willing and well entitle ought to be able to secure the advantage of such work as there be to do
 it be propose by the bill under consideration to meet the allege difficulty of the situation by establish an educational test by which the right of a foreigner to make his home with we shall be determine its general scheme be to prohibit from admission to our country all immigrant physically capable and over 16 year of age who can not read and write the english language or some other language and it be provide that this test shall be apply by require immigrant seek admission to read and afterwards to write not less than twenty nor more than twenty five word of the constitution of the united states in some language and that any immigrant fail in this shall not be admit but shall be return to the country from whence he come at the expense of the steamship or railroad company which bring he
 the good reason that could be give for this radical restriction of immigration be the necessity of protect our population against degeneration and save our national peace and quiet from import turbulence and disorder
 i can not believe that we would be protect against these evil by limit immigration to those who can read and write in any language twenty five word of our constitution in my opinion it be infinitely more safe to admit a hundred thousand immigrant who though unable to read and write seek among we only a home and opportunity to work than to admit one of those unruly agitator and enemy of governmental control who can not only read and write but delight in arouse by inflammatory speech the illiterate and peacefully incline to discontent and tumult violence and disorder do not originate with illiterate laborer they be rather the victim of the educate agitator the ability to read and write as require in this bill in and of itself afford in my opinion a misleading test of contented industry and supply unsatisfactory evidence of desirable citizenship or a proper apprehension of the benefit of our institution if any particular element of our illiterate immigration be to be fear for other cause than illiteracy these cause should be deal with directly instead of make illiteracy the pretext for exclusion to the detriment of other illiterate immigrant against whom the real cause of complaint can not be allege
 the provision intend to rid that part of the propose legislation already refer to from obvious hardship appear to i to be indefinite and inadequate
 a parent grandparent wife or minor child of a qualified immigrant though unable to read and write may accompany the immigrant or be send for to join his family provide the immigrant be capable of support such relative these exception to the general rule of exclusion contain in the bill be make to prevent the separation of family and yet neither brother nor sister be provide for in order that relative who be provide for may be reunite those still in foreign land must be send for to join the immigrant here what formality be necessary to constitute this prerequisite and how be the fact of relationship and that the relative be send for to be establish be the illiterate relative of immigrant who have come here under prior law entitle to the advantage of these exception a husband who can read and write and who determine to abandon his illiterate wife abroad will find here under this law an absolutely safe retreat the illiterate relative mention must not only be send for but such immigrant must be capable of support they when they arrive this requirement proceed upon the assumption that the foreign relative come here be in every case by reason of poverty liable to become a public charge unless the immigrant be capable of their support the contrary be very often true and yet if unable to read and write though quite able and willing to support themselves and their relative here besides they could not be admit under the provision of this bill if the immigrant be impoverished though the aid of his fortunate but illiterate relative might be the mean of save he from pauperism
 the fourth section of this bill provides--
 that it shall be unlawful for any male alien who have not in good faith make his declaration before the proper court of his intention to become a citizen of the united states to be employ on any public work of the united states or to come regularly or habitually into the united states by land or water for the purpose of engage in any mechanical trade or manual labor for wage or salary return from time to time to a foreign country
 the fifth section provides--
 that it shall be unlawful for any person partnership company or corporation knowingly to employ any alien come into the united states in violation of the next precede section of this act
 the prohibition against the employment of alien upon any public work of the united states be in line with other legislation of a like character it be quite a different thing however to declare it a crime for an alien to come regularly and habitually into the united states for the purpose of obtain work from private party if such alien return from time to time to a foreign country and to constitute any employment of such alien a criminal offense
 when we consider these provision of the bill in connection with our long northern frontier and the boundary of our states and territories often but an imaginary line separate they from the british dominion and recall the friendly intercourse between the people who be neighbor on either side the provision of this bill affect they must be regard as illiberal narrow and un american
 the resident of these states and territories have separate and especial interest which in many case make an interchange of labor between their people and their alien neighbor most important frequently with the advantage largely in favor of our citizen this suggest the inexpediency of federal interference with these condition when not necessary to the correction of a substantial evil affect the general welfare such unfriendly legislation as be propose could hardly fail to provoke retaliatory measure to the injury of many of our citizen who now find employment on adjoining foreign soil
 the uncertainty of construction to which the language of these provision be subject be a serious objection to a statute which describe a crime an important element in the offense seek to be create by these section be the come regularly or habitually into the united states these word be impossible of definite and certain construction the same may be say of the equally important word return from time to time to a foreign country
 a careful examination of this bill have convince i that for the reason give and other not specifically state its provision be unnecessarily harsh and oppressive and that its defect in construction would cause vexation and its operation would result in harm to our citizen

fellow citizen in obedience to the will of the people and in their presence by theauthority vest in i by this oath i assume the arduous and responsibledutie of president of the united states rely upon the support of mycountryman and invoke the guidance of almighty god our faith teachesthat there be no safe reliance than upon the god of our father who hasso singularly favor the american people in every national trial andwho will not forsake we so long as we obey his commandment and walk humblyin his footstep the responsibility of the high trust to which i have be call alwaysof grave importance be augment by the prevail business conditionsentaile idleness upon willing labor and loss to useful enterprise thecountry be suffer from industrial disturbance from which speedy reliefmust be have our financial system need some revision our money be allgood now but its value must not far be threaten it should all beput upon an endure basis not subject to easy attack nor its stabilityto doubt or dispute our currency should continue under the supervisionof the government the several form of our paper money offer in my judgment a constant embarrassment to the government and a safe balance in the treasury therefore i believe it necessary to devise a system which without diminishingthe circulate medium or offer a premium for its contraction willpresent a remedy for those arrangement which temporary in their nature might well in the year of our prosperity have be displace by wiserprovision with adequate revenue secure but not until then we can enterupon such change in our fiscal law as will while insure safety andvolume to our money no long impose upon the government the necessityof maintain so large a gold reserve with its attendant and inevitabletemptation to speculation most of our financial law be the outgrowthof experience and trial and should not be amend without investigationand demonstration of the wisdom of the propose change we must be both"sure we be right and make haste slowly if therefore congress init wisdom shall deem it expedient to create a commission to take underearly consideration the revision of our coinage banking and currency law and give they that exhaustive careful and dispassionate examination thattheir importance demand i shall cordially concur in such action if suchpower be vest in the president it be my purpose to appoint a commissionof prominent well inform citizen of different party who will commandpublic confidence both on account of their ability and special fitnessfor the work business experience and public training may thus be combine and the patriotic zeal of the friend of the country be so direct thatsuch a report will be make as to receive the support of all party andour finance cease to be the subject of mere partisan contention the experimentis at all event worth a trial and in my opinion it can but provebeneficial to the entire country the question of international bimetallism will have early and earnestattention it will be my constant endeavor to secure it by co operationwith the other great commercial power of the world until that conditioni realize when the parity between our gold and silver money spring fromand be support by the relative value of the two metal the value ofthe silver already coin and of that which may hereafter be coin mustbe keep constantly at par with gold by every resource at our command thecredit of the government the integrity of its currency and the inviolabilityof its obligation must be preserve this be the command verdict ofthe people and it will not be unheede economy be demand in every branch of the government at all time but especially in period like the present of depression in businessand distress among the people the severe economy must be observe inall public expenditure and extravagance stop wherever it be find and prevent wherever in the future it may be develop if the revenuesare to remain as now the only relief that can come must be from decreasedexpenditure but the present must not become the permanent condition ofthe government it have be our uniform practice to retire not increaseour outstanding obligation and this policy must again be resume andvigorously enforce our revenue should always be large enough to meetwith ease and promptness not only our current need and the principal andinterest of the public debt but to make proper and liberal provision forthat most deserving body of public creditor the soldier and sailorsand the widow and orphan who be the pensioner of the united states the government should not be permit to run behind or increase itsdebt in time like the present suitably to provide against this be themandate of duty the certain and easy remedy for most of our financialdifficultie a deficiency be inevitable so long as the expenditure ofthe government exceed its receipt it can only be meet by loan or an increasedrevenue while a large annual surplus of revenue may invite waste and extravagance inadequate revenue create distrust and undermine public and private credit neither should be encourage between more loan and more revenue thereought to be but one opinion we should have more revenue and that withoutdelay hindrance or postponement a surplus in the treasury create byloans be not a permanent or safe reliance it will suffice while it last but it can not last long while the outlay of the government be greaterthan its receipt as have be the case during the past two year normust it be forget that however much such loan may temporarily relievethe situation the government be still indebted for the amount of the surplusthus accrue which it must ultimately pay while its ability to pay isnot strengthen but weaken by a continued deficit loan be imperativein great emergency to preserve the government or its credit but a failureto supply need revenue in time of peace for the maintenance of eitherhas no justification the good way for the government to maintain its credit be to pay asit go not by resort to loan but by keep out of debt throughan adequate income secure by a system of taxation external or internal or both it be the settle policy of the government pursue from the beginningand practice by all party and administration to raise the bulk ofour revenue from taxis upon foreign production enter the united statesfor sale and consumption and avoid for the most part every form ofdirect taxation except in time of war the country be clearly opposedto any needless addition to the subject of internal taxation and be committedby its late popular utterance to the system of tariff taxation therecan be no misunderstanding either about the principle upon which thistariff taxation shall be levy nothing have ever be make plainer ata general election than that the control principle in the raising ofrevenue from duty on import be zealous care for american interest andamerican labor the people have declare that such legislation should behad as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industry andthe development of our country it be therefore earnestly hope and expectedthat congress will at the early practicable moment enact revenue legislationthat shall be fair reasonable conservative and just and which whilesupplye sufficient revenue for public purpose will still be signallybeneficial and helpful to every section and every enterprise of the people to this policy we be all of whatever party firmly bind by the voiceof the people a power vastly more potential than the expression of anypolitical platform the paramount duty of congress be to stop deficienciesby the restoration of that protective legislation which have always beenthe firm prop of the treasury the passage of such a law or law wouldstrengthen the credit of the government both at home and abroad and gofar toward stop the drain upon the gold reserve hold for the redemptionof our currency which have be heavy and well nigh constant for severalyear in the revision of the tariff especial attention should be give tothe re enactment and extension of the reciprocity principle of the lawof 1890 under which so great a stimulus be give to our foreign tradein new and advantageous market for our surplus agricultural and manufacturedproduct the brief trial give this legislation amply justify a furtherexperiment and additional discretionary power in the making of commercialtreatie the end in view always to be the opening up of new market forthe product of our country by grant concession to the product ofother land that we need and can not produce ourselves and which do notinvolve any loss of labor to our own people but tend to increase theiremployment the depression of the past four year have fall with especial severityupon the great body of toiler of the country and upon none more thanthe holder of small farm agriculture have languish and labor suffer the revival of manufacturing will be a relief to both no portion of ourpopulation be more devoted to the institution of free government nor moreloyal in their support while none bear more cheerfully or fully its propershare in the maintenance of the government or be well entitle to itswise and liberal care and protection legislation helpful to producersis beneficial to all the depressed condition of industry on the farm andin the mine and factory have lessen the ability of the people to meetthe demand upon they and they rightfully expect that not only a systemof revenue shall be establish that will secure the large income withthe least burden but that every mean will be take to decrease ratherthan increase our public expenditure business condition be not themost promise it will take time to restore the prosperity of former year if we can not promptly attain it we can resolutely turn our face in thatdirection and aid its return by friendly legislation however troublesomethe situation may appear congress will not i be sure be find lackingin disposition or ability to relieve it as far as legislation can do so the restoration of confidence and the revival of business which men ofall party so much desire depend more largely upon the prompt energetic and intelligent action of congress than upon any other single agency affectingthe situation it be inspire too to remember that no great emergency in the onehundred and eight year of our eventful national life have ever arise thatha not be meet with wisdom and courage by the american people with fidelityto their good interest and high destiny and to the honor of the americanname these year of glorious history have exalt mankind and advancedthe cause of freedom throughout the world and immeasurably strengthenedthe precious free institution which we enjoy the people love and willsustain these institution the great essential to our happiness and prosperityis that we adhere to the principle upon which the government be establishedand insist upon their faithful observance equality of right must prevail and our law be always and everywhere respected and obey we may havefaile in the discharge of our full duty as citizen of the great republic but it be console and encouraging to realize that free speech a freepress free thought free school the free and unmolested right of religiousliberty and worship and free and fair election be dearer and more universallyenjoyed to day than ever before these guaranty must be sacredly preservedand wisely strengthen the constituted authority must be cheerfullyand vigorously uphold lynching must not be tolerate in a great and civilizedcountry like the united states court not mob must execute the penaltiesof the law the preservation of public order the right of discussion the integrity of court and the orderly administration of justice mustcontinue forever the rock of safety upon which our government securelyrest one of the lesson teach by the late election which all can rejoicein be that the citizen of the united states be both law respect andlaw abide people not easily swerve from the path of patriotism andhonor this be in entire accord with the genius of our institution andbut emphasize the advantage of inculcate even a great love for lawand order in the future immunity should be grant to none who violatethe law whether individual corporation or community and as theconstitution impose upon the president the duty of both its own execution and of the statute enact in pursuance of its provision i shall endeavorcarefully to carry they into effect the declaration of the party now restoredto power have be in the past that of opposition to all combination ofcapital organize in trust or otherwise to control arbitrarily the conditionof trade among our citizen and it have support such legislation aswill prevent the execution of all scheme to oppress the people by unduecharge on their supply or by unjust rate for the transportation oftheir product to the market this purpose will be steadily pursue bothby the enforcement of the law now in existence and the recommendationand support of such new statute as may be necessary to carry it into effect our naturalization and immigration law should be far improve tothe constant promotion of a safe a well and a high citizenship a grave peril to the republic would be a citizenship too ignorant to understandor too vicious to appreciate the great value and beneficence of our institutionsand law and against all who come here to make war upon they our gatesmust be promptly and tightly closed nor must we be unmindful of the needof improvement among our own citizen but with the zeal of our forefathersencourage the spread of knowledge and free education illiteracy must bebanished from the land if we shall attain that high destiny as the foremostof the enlightened nation of the world which under providence we oughtto achieve reform in the civil service must go on but the change should be realand genuine not perfunctory or prompt by a zeal in behalf of any partysimply because it happen to be in power as a member of congress i votedand speak in favor of the present law and i shall attempt its enforcementin the spirit in which it be enact the purpose in view be to securethe most efficient service of the good man who would accept appointmentunder the government retain faithful and devoted public servant inoffice but shield none under the authority of any rule or custom who be inefficient incompetent or unworthy the good interest of thecountry demand this and the people heartily approve the law wherever andwhenever it have be thus administrate congress should give prompt attention to the restoration of our americanmerchant marine once the pride of the sea in all the great ocean highwaysof commerce to my mind few more important subject so imperatively demandit intelligent consideration the united states have progress with marvelousrapidity in every field of enterprise and endeavor until we have becomeforemost in nearly all the great line of inland trade commerce and industry yet while this be true our american merchant marine have be steadilydecline until it be now low both in the percentage of tonnage andthe number of vessel employ than it be prior to the civil war commendableprogress have be make of late year in the upbuilding of the americannavy but we must supplement these effort by provide as a proper consortfor it a merchant marine amply sufficient for our own carrying trade toforeign country the question be one that appeal both to our businessnecessitie and the patriotic aspiration of a great people it have be the policy of the united states since the foundation ofthe government to cultivate relation of peace and amity with all the nationsof the world and this accord with my conception of our duty now we havecherishe the policy of non interference with affair of foreign governmentswisely inaugurate by washington keep ourselves free from entanglement either as ally or foe content to leave undisturbed with they the settlementof their own domestic concern it will be our aim to pursue a firm anddignifie foreign policy which shall be just impartial ever watchfulof our national honor and always insist upon the enforcement of thelawful right of american citizen everywhere our diplomacy should seeknothe more and accept nothing less than be due we we want no war ofconquest we must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression war shouldnever be enter upon until every agency of peace have fail peace ispreferable to war in almost every contingency arbitration be the truemethod of settlement of international as well as local or individual difference it be recognize as the good mean of adjustment of difference betweenemployer and employee by the forty ninth congress in 1886 and its applicationwas extend to our diplomatic relation by the unanimous concurrence ofthe senate and house of the fifty first congress in 1890 the latter resolutionwas accept as the basis of negotiation with we by the british houseof commons in 1893 and upon our invitation a treaty of arbitration betweenthe united states and great britain be sign at washington and transmittedto the senate for its ratification in january last since this treaty isclearly the result of our own initiative since it have be recognizeda the lead feature of our foreign policy throughout our entire nationalhistory the adjustment of difficulty by judicial method rather thanforce of arm and since it present to the world the glorious exampleof reason and peace not passion and war control the relation betweentwo of the great nation in the world an example certain to be followedby other i respectfully urge the early action of the senate thereon not merely as a matter of policy but as a duty to mankind the importanceand moral influence of the ratification of such a treaty can hardly beoverestimate in the cause of advance civilization it may well engagethe good thought of the statesman and people of every country and i cannotbut consider it fortunate that it be reserve to the united states tohave the leadership in so grand a work it have be the uniform practice of each president to avoid as fara possible the convening of congress in extraordinary session it isan example which under ordinary circumstance and in the absence of apublic necessity be to be commend but a failure to convene the representativesof the people in congress in extra session when it involve neglect ofa public duty place the responsibility of such neglect upon the executivehimself the condition of the public treasury as have be indicate demandsthe immediate consideration of congress it alone have the power to providerevenue for the government not to convene it under such circumstancesi can view in no other sense than the neglect of a plain duty i do notsympathize with the sentiment that congress in session be dangerous toour general business interest its member be the agent of the people and their presence at the seat of government in the execution of the sovereignwill should not operate as an injury but a benefit there could be nobetter time to put the government upon a sound financial and economic basisthan now the people have only recently vote that this should be do and nothing be more binding upon the agent of their will than the obligationof immediate action it have always seem to i that the postponement ofthe meeting of congress until more than a year after it have be chosendeprive congress too often of the inspiration of the popular will andthe country of the correspond benefit it be evident therefore thatto postpone action in the presence of so great a necessity would be unwiseon the part of the executive because unjust to the interest of the people our action now will be free from mere partisan consideration than if thequestion of tariff revision be postpone until the regular session ofcongress we be nearly two year from a congressional election and politicscannot so greatly distract we as if such contest be immediately pende we can approach the problem calmly and patriotically without fear itseffect upon an early election our fellow citizen who may disagree with we upon the character of thislegislation prefer to have the question settle now even against theirpreconceived view and perhaps settle so reasonably as i trust and believeit will be as to insure great permanence than to have far uncertaintymenace the vast and varied business interest of the united states again whatever action congress may take will be give a fair opportunity fortrial before the people be call to pass judgment upon it and this iconsider a great essential to the rightful and lasting settlement of thequestion in view of these consideration i shall deem it my duty as presidentto convene congress in extraordinary session on monday the 15th day ofmarch 1897 in conclusion i congratulate the country upon the fraternal spiritof the people and the manifestation

to the congress of the united states
 regret the necessity which have require i to call you together i feel that your assembling in extraordinary session be indispensable because of the condition in which we find the revenue of the government it be concede that its current expenditure be great than its receipt and that such a condition have exist for now more than three year with unlimited mean at our command we be present the remarkable spectacle of increase our public debt by borrow money to meet the ordinary outlay incident upon even an economical and prudent administration of the government an examination of the subject disclose this fact in every detail and lead inevitably to the conclusion that the condition of the revenue which allow it be unjustifiable and should be correct
 we find by the report of the secretary of the treasury that the revenue for the fiscal year end june 30 1892 from all source be $ 425,868,260.22 and the expenditure for all purpose be $ 415,953,806.56 leave an excess of receipt over expenditure of $ 9,914,453.66 during that fiscal year $ 40,570,467.98 be pay upon the public debt which have be reduce since march 1 1889 $ 259,076,890 and the annual interest charge decrease $ 11,684,576.60 the receipt of the government from all source during the fiscal year end june 30 1893 amount to $ 461,716,561.94 and its expenditure to $ 459,374,887.65 show an excess of receipt over expenditure of $ 2,341,674.29
 since that time the receipt of no fiscal year and with but few exception of no month of any fiscal year have exceed the expenditure the receipt of the government from all source during the fiscal year end june 30 1894 be $ 372,802,498.29 and its expenditure $ 442,605,758.87 leave a deficit the first since the resumption of specie payment of $ 69,803,260.58 notwithstanding there be a decrease of $ 16,769,128.78 in the ordinary expense of the government as compare with the previous fiscal year its income be still not sufficient to provide for its daily necessity and the gold reserve in the treasury for the redemption of greenback be draw upon to meet they but this do not suffice and the government then resort to loan to replenish the reserve
 in february 1894 $ 50,000,000 in bond be issue and in november follow a second issue of $ 50,000,000 be deem necessary the sum of $ 117,171,795 be realize by the sale of these bond but the reserve be steadily decrease until on february 8 1895 a third sale of $ 62,315,400 in bond for $ 65,116,244 be announce to congress
 the receipt of the government for the fiscal year end june 30 1895 be $ 390,373,203.30 and the expenditure $ 433,178,426.48 show a deficit of $ 42,805,223.18 a further loan of $ 100,000,000 be negotiate by the government in february 1896 the sale net $ 1,166,246 and swell the aggregate of bond issue within three year to $ 262,315,400 for the fiscal year end june 30 1896 the revenue of the government from all source amount to $ 409,475,408.78 while its expenditure be $ 434,678,654.48 or an excess of expenditure over receipt of $ 25,203,245.70 in other word the total receipt for the three fiscal year end june 30 1896 be insufficient by $ 137,811,729.46 to meet the total expenditure
 nor have this condition since improve for the first half of the present fiscal year the receipt of the government exclusive of postal revenue be $ 157,507,603.76 and its expenditure exclusive of postal service $ 195,410,000.22 or an excess of expenditure over receipt of $ 37,902,396.46 in january of this year the receipt exclusive of postal revenue be $ 24,316,994.05 and the expenditure exclusive of postal service $ 30,269,389.29 a deficit of $ 5,952,395.24 for the month in february of this year the receipt exclusive of postal revenue be $ 24,400,997.38 and expenditure exclusive of postal service $ 28,796,056.66 a deficit of $ 4,395,059.28 or a total deficiency of $ 186,061,580.44 for the three year and eight month end march 1 1897 not only be we without a surplus in the treasury but with an increase in the public debt there have be a corresponding increase in the annual interest charge from $ 22,893,883.20 in 1892 the low of any year since 1862 to $ 34,387,297.60 in 1896 or an increase of $ 11,493,414.40
 it may be urge that even if the revenue of the government have be sufficient to meet all its ordinary expense during the past three year the gold reserve would still have be insufficient to meet the demand upon it and that bond would necessarily have be issue for its repletion be this as it may it be clearly manifest without deny or affirm the correctness of such a conclusion that the debt would have be decrease in at least the amount of the deficiency and business confidence immeasurably strengthen throughout the country
 congress should promptly correct the exist condition ample revenue must be supply not only for the ordinary expense of the government but for the prompt payment of liberal pension and the liquidation of the principal and interest of the public debt in raise revenue duty should be so levy upon foreign product as to preserve the home market so far as possible to our own producer to revive and increase manufacture to relieve and encourage agriculture to increase our domestic and foreign commerce to aid and develop mining and building and to render to labor in every field of useful occupation the liberal wage and adequate reward to which skill and industry be justly entitle the necessity of the passage of a tariff law which shall provide ample revenue need not be far urge the imperative demand of the hour be the prompt enactment of such a measure and to this object i earnestly recommend that congress shall make every endeavor before other business be transact let we first provide sufficient revenue to faithfully administer the government without the contracting of further debt or the continued disturbance of our finance


 to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 official information from our consul in cuba establish the fact that a large number of american citizen in the island be in a state of destitution suffer for want of food and medicine this apply particularly to the rural district of the central and eastern part
 the agricultural class have be force from their farm into the near town where they be without work or money the local authority of the several town however kindly dispose be unable to relieve the need of their own people and be altogether powerless to help our citizen
 the late report of consul general lee estimate six to eight hundred americans be without mean of support i have assure he that provision would be make at once to relieve they to that end i recommend that congress make an appropriation of not less than $ 50,000 to be immediately available for use under the direction of the secretary of state
 it be desirable that a part of the sum which may be appropriate by congress should in the discretion of the secretary of state also be use for the transportation of american citizen who desire to return to the united states be without mean to do so



to the congress of the united states
 in my message convene the congress in extraordinary session i call attention to a single subject that of provide revenue adequate to meet the reasonable and proper expense of the government i believe that to be the most pressing subject for settlement then a bill to provide the necessary revenue for the government have already pass the house of representatives and the senate and await executive action
 another question of very great importance be that of the establishment of our currency and banking system on a well basis which i comment upon in my inaugural address in the follow word
 our financial system need some revision our money be all good now but its value must not far be threaten it should all be put upon an endure basis not subject to easy attack nor its stability to doubt or dispute the several form of our paper money offer in my judgment a constant embarrassment to the government and imperil a safe balance in the treasury
 nothing be settle more clearly at the late national election than the determination upon the part of the people to keep their currency stable in value and equal to that of the most advanced nation of the world
 the soundness of our currency be nowhere question no loss can occur to its holder it be the system which should be simplify and strengthen keep our money just as good as it be now with less expense to the government and the people
 the sentiment of the country be strongly in favor of early action by congress in this direction to revise our currency law and remove they from partisan contention a notable assembly of business man with delegate from twenty nine states and territories be hold at indianapolis in january of this year the financial situation command their earnest attention and after a two day session the convention recommend to congress the appointment of a monetary commission
 i recommend this report to the consideration of congress the author of the report recommend a commission to make a thorough investigation of the monetary affair and need of this country in all relation and aspect and to make proper suggestion as to any evil find to exist and the remedy therefor
 this subject should receive the attention of congress at its special session it ought not to be postpone until the regular session
 i therefore urgently recommend that a special commission be create non partisan in its character to be compose of well inform citizen of different party who will command the confidence of congress and the country because of their special fitness for the work whose duty it shall be to make recommendation of whatever change in our present banking and currency law may be find necessary and expedient and to report their conclusion on or before the 1st day of november next in order that the same may be transmit by i to congress for its consideration at its first regular session
 it be to be hope that the report thus make will be so comprehensive and sound as to receive the support of all party and the favorable action of congress at all event such a report can not fail to be of value to the executive branch of the government as well as to those charge with public legislation and to greatly assist in the establishment of an improved system of finance

to the senate and house of representatives it give i pleasure to extend greeting to the fifty fifth congress assemble in regular session at the seat of government with many of whose senator and representatives i have be associate in the legislative service their meeting occur under felicitous condition justify sincere congratulation and call for our grateful acknowledgment to a beneficent providence which have so signally bless and prosper we as a nation peace and good will with all the nation of the earth continue unbroken a matter of genuine satisfaction be the grow feeling of fraternal regard and unification of all section of our country the incompleteness of which have too long delay realization of the high blessing of the union the spirit of patriotism be universal and be ever increase in fervor the public question which now most engross we be lift far above either partisanship prejudice or former sectional difference they affect every part of our common country alike and permit of no division on ancient line question of foreign policy of revenue the soundness of the currency the inviolability of national obligation the improvement of the public service appeal to the individual conscience of every earnest citizen to whatever party he belong or in whatever section of the country he may reside the extra session of this congress which close during july last enact important legislation and while its full effect have not yet be realize what it have already accomplish assure we of its timeliness and wisdom to test its permanent value further time will be require and the people satisfied with its operation and result thus far be in no mind to withhold from it a fair trial tariff legislation having be settle by the extra session of congress the question next press for consideration be that of the currency the work of put our finance upon a sound basis difficult as it may seem will appear easy when we recall the financial operation of the government since 1866 on the 30th day of june of that year we have outstanding demand liability in the sum of $ 728,868,447.41 on the 1st of january 1879 these liability have be reduce to$443,889,495.88 of our interest bear obligation the figure be even more striking on july 1 1866 the principal of the interest bear debt of the government be $ 2,332,331,208 on the 1st day of july 1893 this sum have be reduce to $ 585,137,100 or an aggregate reduction of $ 1,747,294,108 the interest bear debt of the united states on the 1st day of december 1897 be $ 847,365,620 the government money now outstanding december 1 consist of $ 346,681,016 of united states note $ 107,793,280 of treasury note issue by authority of the law of 1890 $ 384,963,504 of silver certificate and $ 61,280,761 of standard silver dollar with the great resource of the government and with the honorable example of the past before we we ought not to hesitate to enter upon a currency revision which will make our demand obligation less onerous to the government and relieve our financial law from ambiguity and doubt the brief review of what be accomplish from the close of the war to 1893 make unreasonable and groundless any distrust either of our financial ability or soundness while the situation from 1893 to 1897 must admonish congress of the immediate necessity of so legislate as to make the return of the condition then prevail impossible there be many plan propose as a remedy for the evil before we can find the true remedy we must appreciate the real evil it be not that our currency of every kind be not good for every dollar of it be good good because the government 's pledge be out to keep it so and that pledge will not be break however the guaranty of our purpose to keep the pledge will be well show by advance toward its fulfillment the evil of the present system be find in the great cost to the government of maintain the parity of our different form of money that be keep all of they at par with gold we surely can not be long heedless of the burden this impose upon the people even under fairly prosperous condition while the past four year have demonstrate that it be not only an expensive charge upon the government but a dangerous menace to the national credit it be manifest that we must devise some plan to protect the government against bond issue for repeat redemption we must either curtail the opportunity for speculation make easy by the multiplied redemption of our demand obligation or increase the gold reserve for their redemption we have $ 900,000,000 of currency which the government by solemn enactment have undertake to keep at par with gold nobody be oblige to redeem in gold but the government the bank be not require to redeem in gold the government be oblige to keep equal with gold all its outstanding currency and coin obligation while its receipt be not require to be pay in gold they be pay in every kind of money but gold and the only mean by which the government can with certainty get gold be by borrow it can get it in no other way when it most need it the government without any fix gold revenue be pledge to maintain gold redemption which it have steadily and faithfully do and which under the authority now give it will continue to do the law which require the government after having redeem its united states note to pay they out again as current fund demand a constant replenishment of the gold reserve this be especially so in time of business panic and when the revenue be insufficient to meet the expense of the government at such time the government have no other way to supply its deficit and maintain redemption but through the increase of its bond debt as during the administration of my predecessor when $ 262,315,400 of four and a half per cent bond be issue and sell and the proceed use to pay the expense of the government in excess of the revenue and sustain the gold reserve while it be true that the great part of the proceed of these bond be use to supply deficient revenue a considerable portion be require to maintain the gold reserve with our revenue equal to our expense there would be no deficit require the issuance of bond but if the gold reserve fall below $ 100,000,000 how will it be replenish except by sell more bond be there any other way practicable under exist law the serious question then be shall we continue the policy that have be pursue in the past that be when the gold reserve reach the point of danger issue more bond and supply the need gold or shall we provide other mean to prevent these recur drain upon the gold reserve if no further legislation be have and the policy of sell bond be to be continue then congress should give the secretary of the treasury authority to sell bond at long or short period bear a less rate of interest than be now authorize by law i earnestly recommend as soon as the receipt of the government be quite sufficient to pay all the expense of the government that when any of the united states note be present for redemption in gold and be redeem in gold such note shall be keep and set apart and only pay out in exchange for gold this be an obvious duty if the holder of the united states note prefer the gold and get it from the government he should not receive back from the government a united states note without pay gold in exchange for it the reason for this be make all the more apparent when the government issue an interest bear debt to provide gold for the redemption of united states note a non interest bear debt surely it should not pay they out again except on demand and for gold if they be put out in any other way they may return again to be follow by another bond issue to redeem they another interest bear debt to redeem a non interest bear debt in my view it be of the utmost importance that the government should be relieve from the burden of provide all the gold require for exchange and export this responsibility be alone bear by the government without any of the usual and necessary banking power to help itself the bank do not feel the strain of gold redemption the whole strain rest upon the government and the size of the gold reserve in the treasury have come to be with or without reason the signal of danger or of security this ought to be stop if we be to have an era of prosperity in the country with sufficient receipt for the expense of the government we may feel no immediate embarrassment from our present currency but the danger still exist and will be ever present menace we so long as the exist system continue and besides it be in time of adequate revenue and business tranquillity that the government should prepare for the bad we can not avoid without serious consequence the wise consideration and prompt solution of this question the secretary of the treasury have outline a plan in great detail for the purpose of remove the threaten recurrence of a deplete gold reserve and save we from future embarrassment on that account to this plan i invite your careful consideration i concur with the secretary of the treasury in his recommendation that national bank be allow to issue note to the face value of the bond which they have deposit for circulation and that the tax on circulate note secure by deposit of such bond be reduce to one half of one per cent per annum i also join he in recommend that authority be give for the establishment of national bank with a minimum capital of $ 25,000 this will enable the small village and agricultural region of the country to be supply with currency to meet their need i recommend that the issue of national bank note be restrict to the denomination of ten dollar and upwards if the suggestion i have herein make shall have the approval of congress then i would recommend that national bank be require to redeem their note in gold the most important problem with which this government be now call upon to deal pertain to its foreign relation concern its duty toward spain and the cuban insurrection problem and condition more or less in common with those now exist have confront this government at various time in the past the story of cuba for many year have be one of unrest grow discontent an effort toward a large enjoyment of liberty and self control of organize resistance to the mother country of depression after distress and warfare and of ineffectual settlement to be follow by renew revolt for no endure period since the enfranchisement of the continental possession of spain in the western continent have the condition of cuba or the policy of spain toward cuba not cause concern to the united states the prospect from time to time that the weakness of spain 's hold upon the island and the political vicissitude and embarrassment of the home government might lead to the transfer of cuba to a continental power call forth between 1823 and 1860 various emphatic declaration of the policy of the united states to permit no disturbance of cuba s connection with spain unless in the direction of independence or acquisition by we through purchase nor have there be any change of this declare policy since upon the part of the government the revolution which begin in 1868 last for ten year despite the strenuous effort of the successive peninsular government to suppress it then as now the government of the united states testify its grave concern and offer its aid to put an end to bloodshed in cuba the overture make by general grant be refuse and the war drag on entail great loss of life and treasure and increase injury to american interest besides throw enhanced burden of neutrality upon this government in 1878 peace be bring about by the truce of zanjon obtain by negotiation between the spanish commander martinez de campos and the insurgent leader the present insurrection break out in february 1895 it be not my purpose at this time to recall its remarkable increase or to characterize its tenacious resistance against the enormous force mass against it by spain the revolt and the effort to subdue it carry destruction to every quarter of the island develop wide proportion and defy the effort of spain for its suppression the civilized code of war have be disregard no less so by the spaniards than by the cubans the exist condition can not but fill this government and the american people with the grave apprehension there be no desire on the part of our people to profit by the misfortune of spain we have only the desire to see the cubans prosperous and content enjoy that measure of self control which be the inalienable right of man protect in their right to reap the benefit of the exhaustless treasure of their country the offer make by my predecessor in april 1896 tender the friendly office of this government fail any mediation on our part be not accept in brief the answer read there be no effectual way to pacify cuba unless it begin with the actual submission of the rebel to the mother country then only could spain act in the promise direction of her own motion and after her own plan the cruel policy of concentration be initiate february 16 1896 the productive district control by the spanish army be depopulate the agricultural inhabitant be herd in and about the garrison town their land lay waste and their dwelling destroy this policy the late cabinet of spain justify as a necessary measure of war and as a means of cut off supply from the insurgent it have utterly fail as a war measure it be not civilized warfare it be extermination against this abuse of the right of war i have feel constrain on repeat occasion to enter the firm and earnest protest of this government there be much of public condemnation of the treatment of american citizen by allege illegal arrest and long imprisonment await trial or pende protract judicial proceeding i feel it my first duty to make instant demand for the release or speedy trial of all american citizen under arrest before the change of the spanish cabinet in october last twenty two prisoner citizen of the united states have be give their freedom for the relief of our own citizen suffer because of the conflict the aid of congress be seek in a special message and under the appropriation of may 24 1897 effective aid have be give to american citizen in cuba many of they at their own request having be return to the united states the instruction give to our new minister to spain before his departure for his post direct he to impress upon that government the sincere wish of the united states to lend its aid toward the ending of the war in cuba by reach a peaceful and lasting result just and honorable alike to spain and to the cuban people these instruction recite the character and duration of the contest the widespread loss it entail the burden and restraint it impose upon we with constant disturbance of national interest and the injury result from an indefinite continuance of this state of thing it be state that at this juncture our government be constrain to seriously inquire if the time be not ripe when spain of her own volition move by her own interest and every sentiment of humanity should put a stop to this destructive war and make proposal of settlement honorable to herself and just to her cuban colony it be urge that as a neighboring nation with large interest in cuba we could be require to wait only a reasonable time for the mother country to establish its authority and restore peace and order within the border of the island that we could not contemplate an indefinite period for the accomplishment of this result no solution be propose to which the slight idea of humiliation to spain could attach and indeed precise proposal be withhold to avoid embarrassment to that government all that be ask or expect be that some safe way might be speedily provide and permanent peace restore it so chance that the consideration of this offer address to the same spanish administration which have decline the tender of my predecessor and which for more than two year have pour man and treasure into cuba in the fruitless effort to suppress the revolt fall to other between the departure of general woodford the new envoy and his arrival in spain the statesman who have shape the policy of his country fall by the hand of an assassin and although the cabinet of the late premier still hold office and receive from our envoy the proposal he bear that cabinet give place within a few day thereafter to a new administration under the leadership of sagasta the reply to our note be receive on the 23d day of october it be in the direction of a well understanding it appreciate the friendly purpose of this government it admit that our country be deeply affect by the war in cuba and that its desire for peace be just it declare that the present spanish government be bind by every consideration to a change of policy that should satisfy the united states and pacify cuba within a reasonable time to this end spain have decide to put into effect the political reform heretofore advocate by the present premier without halt for any consideration in the path which in its judgment lead to peace the military operation it be say will continue but will be humane and conduct with all regard for private right be accompany by political action lead to the autonomy of cuba while guard spanish sovereignty this it be claim will result in invest cuba with a distinct personality the island to be govern by an executive and by a local council or chamber reserve to spain the control of the foreign relation the army and navy and the judicial administration to accomplish this the present government propose to modify exist legislation by decree leave the spanish cortes with the aid of cuban senator and deputy to solve the economic problem and properly distribute the exist debt in the absence of a declaration of the measure that this government propose to take in carry out its proffer of good office it suggest that spain be leave free to conduct military operation and grant political reform while the united states for its part shall enforce its neutral obligation and cut off the assistance which it be assert the insurgent receive from this country the supposition of an indefinite prolongation of the war be deny it be assert that the western province be already well nigh reclaim that the planting of cane and tobacco therein have be resume and that by force of arm and new and ample reform very early and complete pacification be hope for the immediate amelioration of exist condition under the new administration of cuban affair be predict and therewithal the disturbance and all occasion for any change of attitude on the part of the united states discussion of the question of the international duty and responsibility of the united states as spain understand they be present with an apparent disposition to charge we with failure in this regard this charge be without any basis in fact it could not have be make if spain have be cognizant of the constant effort this government have make at the cost of million and by the employment of the administrative machinery of the nation at command to perform its full duty accord to the law of nation that it have successfully prevent the departure of a single military expedition or armed vessel from our shore in violation of our law would seem to be a sufficient answer but of this aspect of the spanish note it be not necessary to speak far now firm in the conviction of a wholly perform obligation due response to this charge have be make in diplomatic course throughout all these horror and danger to our own peace this government have never in any way abrogate its sovereign prerogative of reserve to itself the determination of its policy and course accord to its own high sense of right and in consonance with the dear interest and conviction of our own people should the prolongation of the strife so demand of the untried measure there remain only recognition of the insurgent as belligerent recognition of the independence of cuba neutral intervention to end the war by impose a rational compromise between the contestant and intervention in favor of one or the other party i speak not of forcible annexation for that can not be think of that by our code of morality would be criminal aggression recognition of the belligerency of the cuban insurgent have often be canvass as a possible if not inevitable step both in regard to the previous ten year struggle and during the present war i be not unmindful that the two houses of congress in the spring of 1896 express the opinion by concurrent resolution that a condition of public war exist require or justify the recognition of a state of belligerency in cuba and during the extra session the senate vote a joint resolution of like import which however be not bring to a vote in the house of representatives in the presence of these significant expression of the sentiment of the legislative branch it behoove the executive to soberly consider the condition under which so important a measure must need rest for justification it be to be seriously consider whether the cuban insurrection possess beyond dispute the attribute of statehood which alone can demand the recognition of belligerency in its favor possession in short of the essential qualification of sovereignty by the insurgent and the conduct of the war by they accord to the received code of war be no less important factor toward the determination of the problem of belligerency than be the influence and consequence of the struggle upon the internal polity of the recognize state the wise utterance of president grant in his memorable message of december 7 1875 be signally relevant to the present situation in cuba and it may be wholesome now to recall they at that time a ruinous conflict have for seven year waste the neighboring island during all those year an utter disregard of the law of civilized warfare and of the just demand of humanity which call forth expression of condemnation from the nation of christendom continue unabated desolation and ruin pervade that productive region enormously affect the commerce of all commercial nation but that of the united states more than any other by reason of proximity and large trade and intercourse at that juncture general grant utter these word which now as then sum up the element of the problem a recognition of the independence of cuba be in my opinion impracticable and indefensible the question which next present itself be that of the recognition of belligerent right in the party to the contest in a former message to congress i have occasion to consider this question and reach the conclusion that the conflict in cuba dreadful and devastating as be its incident do not rise to the fearful dignity of war it be possible that the act of foreign power and even act of spain herself of this very nature might be point to in defense of such recognition but now as in its past history the united states should carefully avoid the false light which might lead it into the maze of doubtful law and of questionable propriety and adhere rigidly and sternly to the rule which have be its guide of do only that which be right and honest and of good report the question of accord or of withholding right of belligerency must be judge in every case in view of the particular attend fact unless justify by necessity it be always and justly regard as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration of moral support to the rebellion it be necessary and it be require when the interest and right of another government or of its people be so far affect by a pende civil conflict as to require a definition of its relation to the party thereto but this conflict must be one which will be recognize in the sense of international law as war belligerence too be a fact the mere existence of contend armed body and their occasional conflict do not constitute war in the sense refer to apply to the exist condition of affair in cuba the test recognize by publicist and writer on international law and which have be observe by nation of dignity honesty and power when free from sensitive or selfish and unworthy motive i fail to find in the insurrection the existence of such a substantial political organization real palpable and manifest to the world have the form and capable of the ordinary function of government toward its own people and to other state with court for the administration of justice with a local habitation possess such organization of force such material such occupation of territory as to take the contest out of the category of a mere rebellious insurrection or occasional skirmish and place it on the terrible footing of war to which a recognition of belligerency would aim to elevate it the contest moreover be solely on land the insurrection have not possess itself of a single seaport whence it may send forth its flag nor have it any mean of communication with foreign power except through the military line of its adversary no apprehension of any of those sudden and difficult complication which a war upon the ocean be apt to precipitate upon the vessel both commercial and national and upon the consular officer of other power call for the definition of their relation to the party to the contest consider as a question of expediency i regard the accordance of belligerent right still to be as unwise and premature as i regard it to be at present indefensible as a measure of right such recognition entail upon the country accord the right which flow from it difficult and complicated duty and require the exaction from the contend party of the strict observance of their right and obligation it confer the right of search upon the high sea by vessel of both party it would subject the carrying of arm and munition of war which now may be transport freely and without interruption in the vessel of the united states to detention and to possible seizure it would give rise to countless vexatious question would release the parent government from responsibility for act do by the insurgent and would invest spain with the right to exercise the supervision recognize by our treaty of 1795 over our commerce on the high sea a very large part of which in its traffic between the atlantic and the gulf states and between all of they and the states on the pacific pass through the water which wash the shore of cuba the exercise of this supervision could scarce fail to lead if not to abuse certainly to collision perilous to the peaceful relation of the two states there can be little doubt to what result such supervision would before long draw this nation it would be unworthy of the united states to inaugurate the possibility of such result by measure of questionable right or expediency or by any indirection turn to the practical aspect of a recognition of belligerency and review its inconvenience and positive danger still far pertinent consideration appear in the code of nation there be no such thing as a naked recognition of belligerency unaccompanie by the assumption of international neutrality such recognition without more will not confer upon either party to a domestic conflict a status not theretofore actually possess or affect the relation of either party to other state the act of recognition usually take the form of a solemn proclamation of neutrality which recite the de facto condition of belligerency as its motive it announce a domestic law of neutrality in the declare state it assume the international obligation of a neutral in the presence of a public state of war it warn all citizen and other within the jurisdiction of the proclaimant that they violate those rigorous obligation at their own peril and can not expect to be shield from the consequence the right of visit and search on the sea and seizure of vessel and cargo and contraband of war and good prize under admiralty law must under international law be admit as a legitimate consequence of a proclamation of belligerency while accord the equal belligerent right define by public law to each party in our port disfavor would be impose on both which while nominally equal would weigh heavily in behalf of spain herself possess a navy and control the port of cuba her maritime right could be assert not only for the military investment of the island but up to the margin of our own territorial water and a condition of thing would exist for which the cubans within their own domain could not hope to create a parallel while its creation through aid or sympathy from within our domain would be even more impossible than now with the additional obligation of international neutrality we would perforce assume the enforcement of this enlarge and onerous code of neutrality would only be influential within our own jurisdiction by land and sea and applicable by our own instrumentality it could impart to the united states no jurisdiction between spain and the insurgent it would give the united states no right of intervention to enforce the conduct of the strife within the paramount authority of spain accord to the international code of war for these reason i regard the recognition of the belligerency of the cuban insurgent as now unwise and therefore inadmissible should that step hereafter be deem wise as a measure of right and duty the executive will take it intervention upon humanitarian ground have be frequently suggest and have not fail to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration but should such a step be now take when it be apparent that a hopeful change have supervene in the policy of spain toward cuba a new government have take office in the mother country it be pledge in advance to the declaration that all the effort in the world can not suffice to maintain peace in cuba by the bayonet that vague promise of reform after subjugation afford no solution of the insular problem that with a substitution of commander must come a change of the past system of warfare for one in harmony with a new policy which shall no long aim to drive the cubans to the horrible alternative of take to the thicket or succumb in misery that reform must be institute in accordance with the need and circumstance of the time and that these reform while design to give full autonomy to the colony and to create a virtual entity and self control administration shall yet conserve and affirm the sovereignty of spain by a just distribution of power and burden upon a basis of mutual interest untainte by method of selfish expediency the first act of the new government lie in these honorable path the policy of cruel rapine and extermination that so long shock the universal sentiment of humanity have be reverse under the new military commander a broad clemency be proffer measure have already be set on foot to relieve the horror of starvation the power of the spanish army it be assert be to be use not to spread ruin and desolation but to protect the resumption of peaceful agricultural pursuit and productive industry that past method be futile to force a peace by subjugation be freely admit and that ruin without conciliation must inevitably fail to win for spain the fidelity of a contented dependency decree in application of the foreshadow reform have already be promulgate the full text of these decree have not be receive but as furnish in a telegraphic summary from our minister be all civil and electoral right of peninsular spaniards be in virtue of exist

their nature may not be referable to the central government for decision shall be submit to the court that the government of sagasta have enter upon a course from which recession with honor be impossible can hardly be question that in the few week it have exist it have make earnest of the sincerity of its profession be undeniable i shall not impugn its sincerity nor should impatience be suffer to embarrass it in the task it have undertake it be honestly due to spain and to our friendly relation with spain that she should be give a reasonable chance to realize her expectation and to prove the asserted efficacy of the new order of thing to which she stand irrevocably commit she have recall the commander whose brutal order inflame the american mind and shock the civilized world she have modify the horrible order of concentration and have undertake to care for the helpless and permit those who desire to resume the cultivation of their field to do so and assure they of the protection of the spanish government in their lawful occupation she have just release the competitor prisoner heretofore sentence to death and who have be the subject of repeat diplomatic correspondence during both this and the precede administration not a single american citizen be now in arrest or confinement in cuba of whom this government have any knowledge the near future will demonstrate whether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace just alike to the cubans and to spain as well as equitable to all our interest so intimately involve in the welfare of cuba be likely to be attain if not the exigency of further and other action by the united states will remain to be take when that time come that action will be determine in the line of indisputable right and duty it will be face without misgiving or hesitancy in the light of the obligation this government owe to itself to the people who have confide to it the protection of their interest and honor and to humanity sure of the right keep free from all offense ourselves actuate only by upright and patriotic consideration move neither by passion nor selfishness the government will continue its watchful

clear as to command the support and approval of the civilized world by a special message date the 16th day of june last i lay before the senate a treaty sign that day by the plenipotentiary of the united states and of the republic of hawaii have for its purpose the incorporation of the hawaiian islands as an integral part of the united states and under its sovereignty the senate having remove the injunction of secrecy although the treaty be still pende before that body the subject may be properly refer to in this message because the necessary action of the congress be require to determine by legislation many detail of the eventual union should the fact of annexation be accomplish as i believe it should be while consistently disavow from a very early period any aggressive policy of absorption in regard to the hawaiian group a long series of declaration through three quarter of a century have proclaim the vital interest of the united states in the independent life of the islands and their intimate commercial dependence upon this country at the same time it have be repeatedly assert that in no event could the entity of hawaiian statehood cease by the passage of the islands under the domination or influence of another power than the united states under these circumstance the logic of event require that annexation heretofore offer but decline should in the ripeness of time come about as the natural result of the strengthen tie that bind we to those islands and be realize by the free will of the hawaiian state that treaty be unanimously ratify without amendment by the senate and president of the republic of hawaii on the 10th of september last and only await the favorable action of the american senate to effect the complete absorption of the islands into the domain of the united states what the condition of such a union shall be the political relation thereof to the united states the character of the local administration the quality and degree of the elective franchise of the inhabitant the extension of the federal law to the territory or the enactment of special law to fit the peculiar condition thereof the regulation if need be of the labor system therein be all matter which the treaty have wisely relegate to the congress if the treaty be confirm as every consideration of dignity and honor require the wisdom of congress will see to it that avoid abrupt assimilation of element perhaps hardly yet fit to share in the high franchise of citizenship and have due regard to the geographical condition the most just provision for self rule in local matter with the large political liberty as an integral part of our nation will be accord to the hawaiians no less be due to a people who after nearly five year of demonstrate capacity to fulfill the obligation of self govern statehood come of their free will to merge their destiny in our body politic the question which have arise between japan and hawaii by reason of the treatment of japanese laborer emigrate to the islands under the hawaiian japanese convention of 1888 be in a satisfactory stage of settlement by negotiation this government have not be invite to mediate and on the other hand have seek no intervention in that matter far than to evince its kindliest disposition toward such a speedy and direct adjustment by the two sovereign states in interest as shall comport with equity and honor it be gratify to learn that the apprehension at first display on the part of japan lest the cessation of hawaii 's national life through annexation might impair privilege to which japan honorably lay claim have give place to confidence in the uprightness of this government and in the sincerity of its purpose to deal with all possible ulterior question in the broad spirit of friendliness as to the representation of this government to nicaragua salvador and costa rica i have conclude that mr. william l. merry confirm as minister of the united states to the states of nicaragua salvador and costa rica shall proceed to san jose costa rica and there temporarily establish the headquarters of the united states to those three states i take this action for what i regard as the paramount interest of this country it be develop upon an investigation by the secretary of state that the government of nicaragua while not unwilling to receive mr. merry in his diplomatic quality be unable to do so because of the compact conclude june 20 1895 whereby that republic and those of salvador and honduras form what be know as the greater republic of central america have surrender to the representative diet thereof their right to receive and send diplomatic agent the diet be not willing to accept he because he be not accredit to that body i could not accredit he to that body because the appropriation law of congress do not permit it mr. baker the present minister at managua have be direct to present his letter of recall mr. w. godfrey hunter have likewise be accredit to the government of guatemala and honduras the same as his predecessor guatemala be not a member of the greater republic of central america but honduras be should this latter government decline to receive he he have be instruct to report this fact to his government and await its further instruction a subject of large importance to our country and increase appreciation on the part of the people be the completion of the great highway of trade between the atlantic and pacific know as the nicaragua canal its utility and value to american commerce be universally admit the commission appoint under date of july 24 last to continue the survey and examination authorize by the act approve march 2 1895 in regard to the proper route feasibility and cost of construction of the nicaragua

the united states they have be diligent in their effort to secure the concurrence and cooperation of european country in the international settlement of the question but up to this time have not be able to secure an agreement contemplate by their mission the gratifying action of our great sister republic of france in join this country in the attempt to bring about an agreement among the principal commercial nation of europe whereby a fixed and relative value between gold and silver shall be secure furnish assurance that we be not alone among the large nation of the world in realize the international character of the problem and in the desire of reach some wise and practical solution of it the british government have publish a resume of the step take jointly by the french ambassador in london and the special envoy of the united states with whom our ambassador at london actively co operate in the presentation of this subject to her majesty 's government this will be lay before congress our special envoy have not make their final report as further negotiation between the representative of this government and the government of other country be pende and in contemplation they believe that doubt which have be raise in certain quarter respect the position of maintain the stability of the parity between the metal and kindre question may yet be solve by further negotiation meanwhile it give i satisfaction to state that the special envoy have already demonstrate their ability and fitness to deal with the subject and it be to be earnestly hope that their labor may result in an international agreement which will bring about recognition of both gold and silver as money upon such term and with such safeguard as will secure the use of both metal upon a basis which shall work no injustice to any class of our citizen in order to execute as early as possible the provision of the third and fourth section of the revenue act approve july 24 1897 i appoint the hon john a. kasson of iowa a special commissioner plenipotentiary to undertake the requisite negotiation with foreign country desire to avail themselves of these provision the negotiation be now proceed with several government both european and american it be believe that by a careful exercise of the power confer by that act some grievance of our own and of other country in our mutual trade relation may be either remove or largely alleviate and that the volume of our commercial exchange may be enlarge with advantage to both contracting party most desirable from every standpoint of national interest and patriotism be the effort to extend our foreign commerce to this end our merchant marine should be improve and enlarge we should do our full share of the carry trade of the world we do not do it now we should be the laggard no long the inferiority of our merchant marine be justly humiliating to the national pride the government by every proper constitutional mean should aid in make our ship familiar visitor at every commercial port of the world thus open up new and valuable market to the surplus product of the farm and the factory the effort which have be make during the two previous year by my predecessor to secure well protection to the fur seal in the north pacific ocean and bering sea be renew at an early date by this administration and have be pursue with earnestness upon my invitation the government of japan and russia send delegate to washington and an international conference be hold during the month of october and november last wherein it be unanimously agree that under the exist regulation this specie of useful animal be threaten with extinction and that an international agreement of all the interested power be necessary for their adequate protection the government of great britain do not see proper to be represent at this conference but subsequently send to washington as delegate the expert commissioner of great britain and canada who have during the past two year visit the pribilof islands and who meet in conference similar commissioner on the part of the united states the result of this conference be an agreement on important fact connect with the condition of the seal herd heretofore in dispute which should place beyond controversy the duty of the government concerned to adopt measure without delay for the preservation and restoration of the herd negotiation to this end be now in progress the result of which i hope to be able to report to congress at an early day international arbitration can not be omit from the list of subject claim our consideration event have only serve to strengthen the general view on this question express in my inaugural address the good sentiment of the civilized world be move toward the settlement of difference between nation without resort to the horror of war treaty embody these humane principle on broad line without in any way imperil our interest or our honor shall have my constant encouragement the acceptance by this government of the invitation of the republic of france to participate in the universal exposition of 1900 at paris be immediately follow by the appointment of a special commissioner to represent the united states in the propose exposition with special reference to the securing of space for an adequate exhibit on behalf of the united states the special commissioner delay his departure for paris long enough to ascertain the probable demand for space by american exhibitor his inquiry develop an almost unprecedented interest in the propose exposition and the information thus acquire enable he to justify an application for a much large allotment of space for the american section than have be reserve by the exposition authority the result be particularly gratifying in view of the fact that the united states be one of the last country to accept the invitation of france the reception accord our special commissioner be most cordial and he be give every reasonable assurance that the united states would receive a consideration commensurate with the proportion of our exhibit the report of the special commissioner as to the magnitude and importance of the come exposition and the great demand for space by american exhibitor supply new argument for a liberal and judicious appropriation by congress to the end that an exhibit fairly representative of the industry and resource of our country may be make in an exposition which will illustrate the world 's progress during the nineteenth century that exposition be intend to be the most important and comprehensive of the long series of international exhibition of which our own at chicago be a brilliant example and it be desirable that the united states should make a worthy exhibit of american genius and skill and their unrivaled achievement in every branch of industry the present immediately effective force of the navy consist of four battle ship of the first class two of the second and forty eight other vessel range from armored cruiser to torpedo boat there be under construction five battle ship of the first class sixteen torpedo boat and one submarine boat no provision have yet be make for the armor of three of the five battle ship as it have be impossible to obtain it at the price fix by congress it be of great importance that congress provide this armor as until then the ship be of no fighting value the present naval force especially in view of its increase by the ship now under construction while not as large as that of a few other power be a formidable force its vessel be the very good of each type and with the increase that should be make to it from time to time in the future and careful attention to keep it in a high state of efficiency and repair it be well adapt to the necessity of the country the great increase of the navy which have take place in recent year be justify by the requirement for national defense and have receive public approbation the time have now arrive however when this increase to which the country be commit should for a time take the form of increase facility commensurate with the increase of our naval vessel it be an unfortunate fact that there be only one dock on the pacific coast capable of dock our large ship and only one on the atlantic coast and that the latter have for the last six or seven month be under repair and therefore incapable of use immediate step should be take to provide three or four dock of this capacity on the atlantic coast at least one on the pacific coast and a float dock in the gulf this be the recommendation of a very competent board appoint to investigate the subject there should also be ample provision make for powder and projectile and other munition of war and for an increase number of officer and enlisted man some addition be also necessary to our navy yard for the repair and care of our large number of vessel as there be now on the stock five battle ship of the large class which can not be complete for a year or two i concur with the recommendation of the secretary of the navy for an appropriation authorize the construction of one battle ship for the pacific coast where at present there be only one in commission and one under construction while on the atlantic coast there be three in commission and four under construction and also that several torpedo boat be authorize in connection with our general system of coast defense the territory of alaska require the prompt and early attention of congress the condition now exist demand material change in the law relate to the territory the great influx of population during the past summer and fall and the prospect of a still large immigration in the spring will not permit we to long neglect the extension of civil authority within the territory or postpone the establishment of a more thorough government a general system of public survey have not yet be extend to alaska and all entry thus far make in that district be upon special survey the act of congress extend to alaska the mining law of the united states contain the reservation that it should not be construe to put in force the general land law of the country by act approve march 3 1891 authority be give for entry of land for town site purpose and also for the purchase of not exceed one hundred and sixty acre then or thereafter occupy for purpose of trade and manufacture the purpose of congress as thus far express have be that only such right should apply to that territory as should be specifically name it will be see how much remain to be do for that vast and remote and yet promising portion of our country special authority be give to the president by the act of congress approve july 24 1897 to divide that territory into two land district and to designate the boundary thereof and to appoint register and receiver of say land office and the president be also authorize to appoint a surveyor general for the entire district pursuant to this authority a surveyor general and receiver have be appoint with office at sitka if in the ensue year the condition justify it the additional land district authorize by law will be establish with an office at some point in the yukon valley no appropriation however be make for this purpose and that be now necessary to be do for the two land district into which the territory be to be divide i concur with the secretary of war in his suggestion as to the necessity for a military force in the territory of alaska for the protection of person and property already a small force consist of twenty five man with two officer under command of lieutenant colonel randall of the eighth infantry have be send to st. michael to establish a military post as it be to the interest of the government to encourage the development and settlement of the country and its duty to follow up its citizen there with the benefit of legal machinery i earnestly urge upon congress the establishment of a system of government with such flexibility as will enable it to adjust itself to the future area of great population the startling though possibly exaggerate report from the yukon river country of the probable shortage of food for the large number of people who be winter there without the mean of leave the country be confirm in such measure as to justify bring the matter to the attention of congress access to that country in winter can be have only by the pass from dyea and vicinity which be a most difficult and perhaps an impossible task however should these report of the suffering of our fellow citizen be far verify every effort at any cost should be make to carry they relief for a number of year past it have be apparent that the condition under which the five civilized tribes be establish in the indian territory under treaty provision with the united states with the right of self government and the exclusion of all white person from within their border have undergo so complete a change as to render the continuance of the system thus inaugurate practically impossible the total number of the five civilized tribes as show by the last census be 45,494 and this number have not materially increase while the white population be estimate at from 200,000 to 250,000 which by permission of the indian government have settle in the territory the present area of the indian territory contain 25,694,564 acre much of which be very fertile land the united states citizen reside in the territory most of whom have go there by invitation or with the consent of the tribal authority have make permanent home for themselves numerous town have be build in which from 500 to 5,000 white people now reside valuable residence and business house have be erect in many of they large business enterprise be carry on in which vast sum of money be employ and yet these people who have invest their capital in the development of the productive resource of the country be without title to the land they occupy and have no voice whatever in the government either of the nations or tribes thousand of their child who be bear in the territory be of school age but the door of the school of the nations be shut against they and what education they get be by private contribution no provision for the protection of the life or property of these white citizen be make by the tribal governments and courts the secretary of the interior report that lead indians have absorb great tract of land to the exclusion of the common people and government by an indian aristocracy have be practically establish to the detriment of the people it have be find impossible for the united states to keep its citizen out of the territory and the executory condition contain in the treaty with these nations have for the most part become impossible of execution nor have it be possible for the tribal government to secure to each individual indian his full enjoyment in common with other indians of the common property of the nation friend of the indians have long believe that the good interest of the indians of the five civilized tribes would be find in american citizenship with all the right and privilege which belong to that condition by section 16 of the act of march 3 1893 the president be authorize to appoint three commissioner to enter into negotiation with the cherokee choctaw chickasaw muscogee or creek and seminole nations commonly know as the five civilized tribes in the indian territory briefly the purpose of the negotiation be to be the extinguishment of tribal title to any land within that territory now hold by any and all such nation or tribes either by cession of the same or some part thereof to the united states or by allotment and division of the same in severalty among the indians of such nation or tribes respectively as may be entitle to the same or by such other method as may be agree upon between the several nations and tribes aforesaid or each of they with the united states with a view to such an adjustment upon the basis of justice and equity as may with the consent of the say nations of indians so far as may be necessary be requisite and suitable to enable the ultimate creation of a state or states of the union which shall embrace the land within say indian territory the commission meet much opposition from the beginning the indians be very slow to act and those in control manifest a decided disinclination to meet with favor the proposition submit to they a little more than three year after this organization the commission effect an agreement with the choctaw nation alone the chickasaws however refuse to agree to its term and as they have a common interest with the choctaw in the land of say nations the agreement with the latter nation could have no effect without the consent of the former on april 23 1897 the commission effect an agreement with both tribes-- the choctaws and chickasaws this agreement it be understand have be ratify by the constituted authority of the respective tribes or nations party thereto and only require ratification by congress to make it bind on the 27th of september 1897 an agreement be effect with the creek nation but it be understand that the national council of say nation have refuse to ratify the same negotiation be yet to be have with the cherokees the most populous of the five civilized tribes and with the seminoles the small in point of number and territory the provision in the indian appropriation act approve june 10 1896 make it the duty of the commission to investigate and determine the right of applicant for citizenship in the five civilized tribes and to make complete census roll of the citizen of say tribes the commission be at present engage in this work among the creeks and have make appointment for take the census of these people up to and include the 30th of the present month should the agreement between the choctaws and chickasaws be ratify by congress and should the other tribes fail to make an agreement with the commission then it will be necessary that some legislation shall be have by congress which while just and honorable to the indians shall be equitable to the white people who have settle upon these land by invitation of the tribal nations hon henry l. dawes chairman of the commission in a letter to the secretary of the interior under date of october 11 1897 say individual ownership be in their the commission 's opinion absolutely essential to any permanent improvement in present condition and the lack of it be the root of nearly all the evil which so grievously afflict these people allotment by agreement be the only possible method unless the united states courts be clothe with the authority to apportion the land among the citizen indians for whose use it be originally grant "i concur with the secretary of the interior that there can be no cure for the evil engender by the perversion of these great trust except by their resumption by the government which create they the recent prevalence of yellow fever in a number of city and town throughout the south have result in much disturbance of commerce and demonstrate the necessity of such amendment to our quarantine law as will make the regulation of the national quarantine authority paramount the secretary of the treasury in the portion of his report relate to the operation of the marine hospital service call attention to the defect in the present quarantine law and recommend amendment thereto which will give the treasury department the requisite authority to prevent the invasion of epidemic disease from foreign country and in time of emergency like that of the past summer will add to the efficiency of the sanitary measure for the protection of the people and at the same time prevent unnecessary restriction of commerce i concur in his recommendation in further effort to prevent the invasion of the united states by yellow fever the importance of the discovery of the exact cause of the disease which up to the present time have be undetermined be obvious and to this end a systematic bacteriological investigation should be make i therefore recommend that congress authorize the appointment of a commission by the president to consist of four expert bacteriologist one to be select from the medical officer of the marine hospital service one to be appoint from civil life one to be detail from the medical officer of the army and one from the medical officer of the navy the union pacific railway main line be sell under the decree of the united states court for the district of nebraska on the 1st and 2d of november of this year the amount due the government consist of the principal of the subsidy bond $ 27,236,512 and the accrue interest thereon $ 31,211,711.75 make the total indebtedness $ 58,448,223.75 the bid at the sale cover the first mortgage lien and the entire mortgage claim of the government principal and interest the sale of the subsidize portion of the kansas pacific line upon which the government hold a second mortgage lien have be postpone at the instance of the government to december 16 1897 the debt of this division of the union pacific railway to the government on november 1 1897 be the principal of the subsidy bond $ 6,303,000 and the unpaid and accrue interest thereon $ 6,626,690.33 make a total of $ 12,929,690.33.the sale of this road be originally advertise for november 4 but for the purpose of secure the utmost public notice of the event it be postpone until december 16 and a second advertisement of the sale be make by the decree of the court the upset price on the sale of the kansas pacific will yield to the government the sum of $ 2,500,000 over all prior lien cost and charge if no other or well bid be make this sum be all that the government will receive on its claim of nearly $ 13,000,000 the government have no information as to whether there will be other bidder or a well bid than the minimum amount herein state the question present therefore be whether the government shall under the authority give it by the act of march 3 1887 purchase or redeem the road in the event that a bid be not make by private party cover the entire government claim to qualify the government to bid at the sale will require a deposit of $ 900,000 as follow in the government cause $ 500,000 and in each of the first mortgage cause $ 200,000 and in the latter the deposit must be in cash payment at the sale be as follow upon the acceptance of the bid a sum which with the amount already deposit shall equal fifteen per cent of the bid the balance in installment of twenty five per cent thirty forty and fifty day after the confirmation of the sale the lien on the kansas pacific prior to that of the government on the 30th july 1897 principal and interest amount to $ 7,281,048.11 the government therefore should it become the high bidder will have to pay the amount of the first mortgage lien i believe that under the act of 1887 it have the authority to do this and in absence of any action by congress i shall direct the secretary of the treasury to make the necessary deposit as require by the court 's decree to qualify as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum which will at least equal the principal of the debt due to the government but suggest in order to remove all controversy that an amendment of the law be immediately pass explicitly give such power and appropriating in general term whatever sum be sufficient therefor in so important a matter as the government become the possible owner of railroad property which it perforce must conduct and operate i feel constrain to lay before congress these fact for its consideration and action before the consummation of the sale it be clear to my mind that the government should not permit the property to be sell at a price which will yield less than one half of the principal of its debt and less than one fifth of its entire debt principal and interest but whether the government rather than accept less than its claim should become a bidder and thereby the owner of the property i submit to the congress for action the library building provide for by the act of congress approve april 15 1886 have be complete and open to the public it should be a matter of congratulation that through the foresight and munificence of congress the nation possess this noble treasure house of knowledge it be earnestly to be hope that having do so much toward the cause of education congress will continue to develop the library in every phase of research to the end that it may be not only one of the most magnificent but among the rich and most useful library in the world the important branch of our government know as the civil service the practical improvement of which have long be a subject of earnest discussion have of late year receive increase legislative and executive approval during the past few month the service have be place upon a still firmer basis of business method and personal merit while the right of our veteran soldier to reinstatement in deserve case have be assert dismissal for merely political reason have be carefully guard against the examination for admittance to the service enlarge and at the same time render less technical and more practical and a distinct advance have be make by give a hearing before dismissal upon all case where incompetency be charge or demand make for the removal of official in any of the departments this order have be make to give to the accuse his right to be hear but without in anyway impair the power of removal which should always be exercise in case of inefficiency and incompetency and which be one of the vital safeguard of the civil service reform system prevent stagnation and deadwood and keep every employee keenly alive to the fact that the security of his tenure depend not on favor but on his own test and carefully watch record of service much of course still remain to be accomplish before the system can be make reasonably perfect for our need there be place now in the classified service which ought to be exempt and other not classify may properly be include i shall not hesitate to exempt case which i think have be improperly include in the classified service or include those which in my judgment will well promote the public service the system have the approval of the people and it will be my endeavor to uphold and extend it i be force by the length of this message to omit many important reference to affair of the government with which congress will have to deal at the present session they be fully discuss in the departmental report to all of which i invite your earnest attention the estimate of the expense of the government by the several departments will i be sure have your careful scrutiny while the congress may not find it an easy task to reduce the expense of the government it should not encourage their increase these expense will in my judgment admit of a decrease in many branch of the government without injury to the public service it be a command duty to keep the appropriation within the receipt of the government and thus avoid a deficit
to the congress of the united states
 obedient to that precept of the constitution which command the president to give from time to time to the congress information of the state of union and to recommend to their consideration such measure as shall be judge necessary and expedient it become my duty now to address your body with regard to the grave crisis that have arise in the relation of the united states to spain by reason of the warfare that for more than three year have rage in the neighbor island of cuba
 i do so because of the intimate connection of the cuban question with the state of our own union and the grave relation the course which it be now incumbent upon the nation to adopt must need bear to the traditional policy of our government if it be to accord with the precept lay down by the founder of the republic and religiously observe by succeed administration to the present day
 the present revolution be but the successor of other similar insurrection which have occur in cuba against the dominion of spain extend over a period of nearly half a century each of which during its progress have subject the united states to great effort and expense in enforce its neutrality law cause enormous loss to american trade and commerce cause irritation annoyance and disturbance among our citizen and by the exercise of cruel barbarous and uncivilized practice of warfare shock the sensibility and offend the humane sympathy of our people
 since the present revolution begin in february 1895 this country have see the fertile domain at our threshold ravage by fire and sword in the course of a struggle unequaled in the history of the island and rarely parallel as to the number of the combatant and the bitterness of the contest by any revolution of modern time where dependent people strive to be free have be oppose by the power of the sovereign state
 our people have behold a once prosperous community reduce to comparative want its lucrative commerce virtually paralyze its exceptional productiveness diminish its field lay waste its mill in ruin and its people perish by ten of thousand from hunger and destitution we have find ourselves constrain in the observance of that strict neutrality which our law enjoin and which the law of nation command to police our own water and watch our own seaport in prevention of any unlawful act in aid of the cubans
 our trade have suffer the capital invest by our citizen in cuba have be largely lose and the temper and forbearance of our people have be so sorely try as to beget a perilous unrest among our own citizen which have inevitably find its expression from time to time in the national legislature so that issue wholly external to our own body politic engross attention and stand in the way of the close devotion to domestic advancement that become a self contain commonwealth whose primal maxim have be the avoidance of all foreign entanglement all this must need awaken and have indeed arouse the utmost concern on the part of this government as well during my predecessor&rsquo;s term as in my own
 in april 1896 the evil from which our company suffer through the cuban war become so onerous that my predecessor make an effort to bring about a peace through the mediation of this government in any way that might tend to an honorable adjustment of the contest between spain and her revolted colony on the basis of some effective scheme of self government of cuba under the flag and sovereignty of spain it fail through the refusal of the spanish government then in power to consider any form of mediation or indeed any plan of settlement which do not begin with the actual submission of the insurgent to the mother
 country and the only on such term as spain herself might see fit to grant the war continue unabated the resistance of the insurgent be in no wise diminish
 the effort of spain be increase both by the dispatch of fresh levy to cuba and by the addition to the horror of the strife of a new and inhuman phase happily unprecedented in the modern history of civilized christian people the policy of devastation and concentration inaugurate by the captain general&rsquo;s bando of october 21 1896 in the province of pinar del rio be thence extend to embrace all of the island to which the power of the spanish arm be able to reach by occupation or by military operation the peasantry include all dwell in the open agricultural interior be drive into the garrison town or isolate place hold by the troop
 the raising and movement of provision of all kind be interdict the field ware lay waste dwelling unroofed and fire mill destroy and in short everything that could desolate the land and render it unfit for human habitation or support be command by one or the other of the contend party and execute by all the power at their disposal
 by the time the present administration take office a year ago reconcentration&mdash;so called&mdash;had be make effective over the well part of the four central and western province santa clara matanzas havana pinar del rio
 the agricultural population to the estimate number of 300,000 or more be herd within the town and their immediate vicinage deprive of the mean of support render destitute of shelter leave poorly clothe and expose to the most unsanitary condition as the scarcity of food increase with the devastation of the depopulated area of production destitution and want become misery and starvation month by month the death rate increase in an alarming ration by march 1897 accord to conservative estimate from official spanish source the mortality among the reconcentrado from starvation and the disease thereto incident exceed 50 per centum of their total number
 no practical relief be accord to the destitute the overburdened town already suffer from the general dearth could give no aid so call ldquo;zone of cultivation&rdquo establish within the immediate area of effective military control about the city and fortified camp prove illusory as a remedy for the suffering the unfortunate be for the most part woman and child with aged and helpless man enfeeble by disease and hunger could not have till the soil without tool seed or shelter for their own support or for the supply of the city reconcentration adopt avowedly as a ware measure in order to cut off the resource of the insurgent work its predestine result as i say in my message of last december it be not civilized warfare it be extermination the only peace it could beget be that of the wilderness and the grave
 meanwhile the military situation in the island have undergo a noticeable change the extraordinary activity that characterize the second year of the war when the insurgent invade even the thitherto unharmed field of pinar del rio and carry havoc and destruction up to the wall of the city of havana itself have relapse into a dogged struggle in the central and eastern province the spanish arm regain a measure of control in pinar del rio and part of havana but under the exist condition of the rural country without immediate improvement of their productive situation even thus partially restrict the revolutionist hold their own and their conquest and submission put forward by spain as the essential and sole basis of peace seem as far distant as at the outset
 in this state of affair my administration find itself confront with the grave problem of its duty my message of last december review the situation and narrate the step take with a view to relieve its acuteness and open the way to some from of honorable settlement the assassination of the prime minister canovas lead to a change of government in spain the former administration pledge to subjugation without concession give place to that of a ~~more liberal party commit long in advance to a policy of reform involve the wide principle of home rule for cuba and puerto rico
 the overture of this government make through its new envoy general woodford and look to an immediate and effective amelioration of the condition of the island although not accept to the extent of the condition of the island although not accept to the extent of admit mediation in any shape be meet by assurance that home rule in advanced phase would be forthwith offer to cuba without wait for the war to end and that more humane method should thenceforth prevail in the conduct of hostility coincidentally with these declaration the new government of spain continue and complete the policy already begin by its predecessor of testify friendly regard for this nation by release american citizen hold under one charge or another connect with the insurrection so that by the end of november not a single person entitle in any way to our national protection remain in a spanish prison
 while these negotiation be in progress the increase destitution of the unfortunate reconcentrado and alarming mortality among they claim earnest attention the success which have attend the limited measure of relief extend to the suffer american citizen among they by the judicious expenditure through the consular agency of the money appropriate expressly for their succor by the joint resolution approve may 24 1897 prompt the humane extension of a similar scheme of aid to the great body of sufferer a suggestion to this end be acquiesce in by the spanish authority on the 24th of december last i cause to be issue an appeal to the american people invite contribution in money or in kind for the succor of the starve sufferer in cuba follow this on the 8th of january by a similar public announcement of the formation of a central cuban relief committee with headquarters in new york city compose of three member represent the american national red cross and the religious and business element of the community
 the effort of that committee have be untiring and have accomplish much arrangement for free transportation to cuba have greatly aid the charitable work the president of the american red cross and representative of other contributory organization have generously visit cuba and cooperate with the consul general and the local authority to make effective distribution of the relief collect through the effort of the central committee nearly $ 200,000 in money and supply have already reach the sufferer and more be forthcoming the supply be admit duty free and transportation to the interior have be arrange so that the relief at first necessarily confine to havana and the large city be now extend through most if not all of the town where suffering exist
 thousand of life have already be save the necessity for change in the condition of the reconcentrados be recognize by the spanish government within a few day past the order of general weyler have be revoke the reconcentrado it be say be to be permit to return to their home and aid to resume the self support pursuit of peace public work have be order to give they employment and a sum of $ 600,000 have be appropriate for their relief
 the war in cuba be of such a nature that short of subjugation or extermination a final military victory for either side seem impracticable the alternative lie in the physical exhaustion of the one or the other party or perhaps of both&mdash;a condition which in effect end the ten year&rsquo;s war by the truce of zanjon the prospect of such a protraction and conclusion of the present strife be a contingency hardly to be contemplate with equanimity by the civilized world and least of all by the united states affect and injure as we be deeply and intimately by its very existence
 realize this it appear to be my duty in a spirit of true friendliness no less to spain than the cubans who have so much to lose by the prolongation of the struggle to seek to bring about on immediate termination of the war to this end i submit on the 27th ultimo as a result of much representation and correspondence through the united states minister at
 madrid proposition to the spanish government look to an armistice until october 1 for the negotiation of peace with the good office of the president
 in addition i ask the immediate revocation of the order of reconcentration so as to permit the people to return to their farm and the needy to be relieve with provision and supply from the united states cooperate with the spanish authority so as to afford full relief
 the reply of the spanish cabinet be receive on the night of the 31st ultimo it offer as the mean to bring about peace in cuba to confide the preparation thereof to the insular parliament inasmuch as the concurrence of that body would be necessary to reach a final result it be however understand that the power reserve by the constitution to the central government be not lessen or diminish as the cuban parliament do not meet until the 4th of may next the spanish government would not object for its part to accept at one a suspension of hostility if ask for by the insurgent from the general in chief to whom it would pertain in such case to determine the duration and condition of the armistice
 the proposition submit by general woodford and the reply of the spanish government be both in the form or brief memoranda the text of which be before i and be substantially in the language above give the function of the cuban parliament in the matter of ldquo;preparing&rdquo peace and the manner of its do so be not express in the spanish memorandum but from general woodford&rsquo;s explanatory report of preliminary discussion precede the final conference it be understand that the spanish government stand ready to give the insular congress full power to settle the term of peace with the insurgents&mdash;whether by direct negotiation or indirectly by mean of legislation do not appear
 with this last overture in the direction of immediate peace and its disappointing reception by spain the executive be bring to the end of his effort
 in my annual message of december last i say
 of the untried measure there remain only recognition of the insurgent as belligerent recognition of the independence of cuba neutral intervention to end the war by impose a national a rational compromise between the contestant and intervention in favor of one or the other party i speak not of forcible annexation for that can not be think of that by our code of morality would be criminal aggression
 thereupon i review these alternative in the light of president grant&rsquo;s measure word utter in 1875 when after seven year of sanguinary destructive and cruel hostility in cuba he reach the conclusion that the recognition of the independence of cuba be impracticable and indefensible and that the recognition of belligerence be not warrant by the fact accord to the test of public law i comment especially upon the latter aspect of the question point out the inconvenience and positive danger of a recognition of belligerence which while add to the already onerous burden of neutrality within our own jurisdiction could not in any way extend our influence or effective office in the territory of hostility
 nothing have since occur to change my view in this regard and i recognize as fully now as then that the issuance of a proclamation of neutrality by which process the so call recognition of belligerent be publish could of itself and unattended by other action accomplish nothing toward the one end for which we labor&mdash;the instant pacification of cuba and cessation of the misery that afflict the island
 turn to the question of recognize at this time the independence of the present insurgent government in cuba we find safe precedent in our history from an early day they be well
 sum up in president jackson&rsquo;s message to congress december 21 1836 on the subject of the recognition of the independence of texas he say
 in all the contest that have arise out of the revolution of france out of the dispute relate to the crowns of portugal and spain out of the separation of the american possession of both from the european governments and out of the numerous and constantly occur struggle for dominion in spanish america so wisely consistent with our just principle have be the action of our government that we have under the most critical circumstance avoid all censure and encounter no other evil than the produce by a transient estrangement of good will in those against whom we have be by force of evidence compel to decide
 it have thus make known to the world that the uniform policy and practice of the united states be to avoid all interference in dispute which merely relate to the internal government of other nation and eventually to recognize the authority of the prevail party without reference to our particular interest and view or to the merit of the original controversy
 but on this as on every other try occasion safety be to be find in a rigid adherence to principle
 in the contest between spain and the revolted colony we stand aloof and wait not only until the ability of the new states to protect themselves be fully establish but until the danger of their be again subjugate have entirely pass away then and not until then be they recognize
 such be our course in regard to mexico herself it be true that with defeat the chief of the republic himself capture and all present power to control the newly organize government of texas annihilate within its confine but on the other hand there be in appearance at least an immense disparity of physical force on the side of texas the mexican republic under another executive be rally its force under a new lender and menace a fresh invasion to recover its lose dominion
 upon the issue of this threaten invasion the independence of texas may be consider as suspend and be there nothing peculiar in the relative situation of the united states and texas our acknowledgment of its independence at such a crisis could scarcely be regard as consistent with the prudent reserve with which we have hitherto hold ourselves bind to treat all similar question
 thereupon andrew jackson proceed to consider the risk that there might be impute to the united states motive of selfish interest in view of the former claim on our part to the territory of texas and of the avow purpose of the texas in seek recognition of independence as an incident to the incorporation of texas into the union conclude thus
 prudence therefore seem to dictate that we should still stand aloof and maintain our present attitude if not until mexico itself or one of the great foreign power shall recognize the independence of the new government at least until the lapse of time or the course of event shall have prove beyond cavil or dispute the ability of the people of that country to maintain their separate sovereignty and to uphold the government constitute by they neither of the contend party can justly complain of this course by pursue it we be but carry out the long establish policy of our government a policy which have secure to we respect and influence abroad and inspire confidence at home
 these be the word of the resolute and patriotic jackson they be evidence that the united states in addition to the test impose by public law as the condition of the recognition of independence by a neutral state to wit that the revolted state shall ldquo;constitute in fact a body politic have a government in substance as well as in name possess of the element of
 stability,&rdquo and form de facto ldquo;if leave to itself a state among the nation reasonably capable of discharge the duty of a state&rdquo have impose for its own governance in deal with case like these the further condition that recognition of independent statehood be not due to a revolted dependency until the danger of its being again subjugate by the parent state have entirely pass away
 this extreme test be in fact apply in the case of texas the congress to whom president jackson refer the question as one ldquo;probably lead to war,&rdquo and therefore a proper subject for ldquo;a previous understanding with that body by whom war can alone be declare and by whom all the provision for sustain its peril must be furnished,&rdquo leave the matter of the recognition of texas to the discretion of the executive provide merely for the sending of a diplomatic agent when the president should be satisfied that the republic of texas have become ldquo;an independent state.&rdquo it be so recognize by president van buren who commission a charge d&rsquo;affaire march 7 1837 after mexico have abandon an attempt to reconquer the texan territory and when there be at the time no bona fide contest go on between the insurgent province and its former sovereign
 i say in my message of december last ldquo;it be to be seriously consider whether the cuban insurrection possess beyond dispute the attribute of statehood which alone can demand the recognition of belligerency in its favor.&rdquo the same requirement must certainly be no less seriously consider when the graver issue of recognize independence be in question for no less positive test can be apply to the great act than to the less while on the other hand the influence and consequence of the struggle upon the internal policy of the recognize state which form important factor when the recognition of belligerency be concern be secondary if not rightly eliminable factor when the real question be whether the community claim recognition be or be not independent beyond peradventure
 nor from the standpoint of expediency do i think it would be wise or prudent for this government to recognize at the present time the independence of the so call cuban republic such recognition be not necessary in order to enable the united states to intervene and pacify the island to commit this country now to the recognition of any particular government in cuba might subject we to embarrass condition of international obligation toward the organization so recognize in case of intervention our conduct would be subject to the approval or disapproval of such government we would be require to submit to its direction and to assume to it the mere relation of a friendly ally
 when it shall appear hereafter that there be within the island a government capable of perform the duty and discharge the function of a separate nation and have as a matter of fact the proper form and attribute of nationality such government can be promptly and readily recognize and the relation and interest of the united states with such nation adjust
 there remain the alternative form of intervention to end the war either as an impartial neutral by impose a rational compromise between the contestant or as the active ally of the one party or the other
 as to the first it be not to be forget that during the last few month the relation of the united states have virtually be one of friendly intervention in many way each not of itself conclusive but all tend to the exertion of a potential influence toward an ultimate pacific result just and honorable to all interest concern the spirit of all our act hitherto have be an earnest unselfish desire for peace and prosperity in cuba untarnishe by difference between we and spain and unstaine by the blood of american citizen
 the forcible intervention of the united states as a neutral to stop the war accord to the large dictate of humanity and follow many historical precedent where neighboring state have interfere to check the hopeless sacrifice of life by internecine conflict beyond their
 border be justifiable on rational ground it involve however hostile constraint upon both the party to the contest as well to enforce a truce as to guide the eventual settlement
 the ground for such intervention may be briefly summarize as follow
 first in the cause of humanity and to put an end to the barbarity bloodshed starvation and horrible misery now exist there and which the party to the conflict be either unable or unwilling to stop or mitigate it be no answer to say this be all in another country belong to another nation and be therefore none of our business it be specially our duty for it be right at our door
 second we owe it to our citizen in cuba to afford they that protection and indemnity for life and property which no government there can or will afford and to that end to terminate the condition that deprive they of legal protection
 third the right to intervene may be justify by the very serious injury to the commerce trade and business of our people and by the wanton destruction of property and devastation of the island
 fourth and which be of the utmost importance the present condition of affair in cuba be a constant menace to our peace and entail upon this government and enormous expense with such a conflict wage for year in an island so near we and with which our people have such trade and business relation when the life and liberty of our citizen be in constant danger and their property destroy and themselves ruin where our trading vessel be liable to seizure and be seize at our very door by war ship of a foreign nation the expedition of filibuster that we be powerless to prevent altogether and the irritate question and entanglement thus arising&mdash;all these and other that i need not mention with the result strained relation be constant menace to our peace and compel we to keep on a semiwar foot with a nation with which we be at peace
 these element of danger and disorder already point out have be strikingly illustrate by a tragic event which have deeply and justly move the american people i have already transmit to congress the report of the naval court of inquiry on the destruction of the battle ship maine in the harbor of havana during the night of the 15th of february the destruction of that noble vessel have fill the national heart with inexpressible horror tow hundred and fifty eight brave sailor and marine and two officer of our navy repose in the fancied security of a friendly harbor have be hurl to death grief and want bring to their home and sorrow to the nation
 the naval court of inquiry which it be needless to say command the unqualified confidence of the government be unanimous in its conclusion that the destruction of the maine be cause by an exterior explosion that of a submarine mine it do not assume to place the responsibility that remain to be fix
 in any event the destruction of the maine by whatever exterior cause be a patent and impressive proof of a state of thing in cuba that be intolerable that condition be thus show to be such that the spanish government can not assure safety and security to a vessel of the americas navy in the harbor of havana on a mission of peace and rightfully there
 far refer in this connection to recent diplomatic correspondence a dispatch from our minister to spain of the 36th ultimo contain the statement that the spanish minister for foreign affair assure he positively that the spain will do all that the high honor and justice require in the matter of the maine the reply above refer to of the 31st ultimo also contain an expression of the readiness of spain to submit to an arbitration all the difference which can arise in this matter which be subsequently explain by the note of the spanish minister at washington of the 10th instant as follow
 as to the question of fact which spring from the diversity of view between the report of the american and spanish board spain propose that the fact be ascertain by an impartial investigation by expert whose decision spain accept in advance
 to this i have make no reply
 president grant in 1875 after discuss the phase of the contest as it then appear and its hopeless and apparent indefinite prolongation say
 in such event i be of opinion that other nation will be compel to assume the responsibility which devolve upon they and to seriously consider the only remain measure possible&mdash;mediation and intervention owing perhaps to the large expanse of water separate the island from the peninsula the contend party appear to have within themselves no depository of common confidence to suggest wisdom when passion and excitement have their away and to assume the part of peacemaker
 in this view in the early day of the contest the good office of the united states as a mediator be tender in good faith without any selfish purpose in the interest of humanity and in sincere friendship for both party but be at the time decline by spain with the declaration nevertheless that at a future time they would be indispensable no intimation have be receive that in the opinion of spain that time have be reach and yet the strife continue with all its dread horror and all its injury to the interest of the united states and of other nation
 each party seem quite capable of work great injury and damage to the other as well as to all the relation and interest dependent on the existence of peace in the island but they seem incapable of reach any adjustment and both have thus far fail of achieve any success whereby one party shall possess and control the island to the exclusion of the other under these circumstance the agency of other either by mediation or intervention seem to be the only alternative which must soon or later be invoke for the termination of the strife
 in the last annual message of my immediate predecessor during the pende struggle it be say
 when the inability of spain to deal successfully with the insurrection have become manifest and it be demonstrate that her sovereignty be extinct in cuba for all purpose of its rightful existence and when a hopeless struggle for its reestablishment have degenerate into a strife which mean nothing more then the useless sacrifice of human life and the utter destruction of the very subject matter of the conflict a situation will be present in which our obligation to the sovereignty of spain will be supersede by high obligation which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge
 in my annual message to congress december last speak to this question i say
 the near future will demonstrate whether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace just alike to the cubans and to spain as well as equitable to all our interest so intimately involve in the welfare of cuba be likely to be attain if not the exigency of further and other action by the united states will remain to be take when the time come that action will be determine in the line of indisputable right and duty it will be face without misgiving or hesitancy in the light of the obligation this government over to itself to the people who have confide to it the protection of their interest and honor and to humanity
 sure of the right keep free from all offense ourselves actuate only by upright and patriotic consideration move neither by passion nor selfishness the government will continue its watchful care over the right and property of american citizen and will abate
 none of its effort to bring about by peaceful agency a peace which shall be honorable and enduring if it shall hereafter appear to be a duty impose by our obligation to ourselves to civilization and humanity to intervene with force it shall be without fault on our part only because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the support and approval of the civilized world
 the long trail have prove that the object for which spain have wage the war can not be attain the fire of insurrection may flame or may smolder with varying season but it have not be and it be plain that it can not be extinguish by present method the only hope of relief and repose from a condition which can no long be endure be the enforce pacification of cuba in the name of humanity in the name of civilization in behalf of endanger american interest which give we the right and the duty to speak and to act the war in cuba must stop
 in view of these fact and of these consideration i ask the congress to authorize and empower the president to take measure to secure a full and final termination of hostility between the government of spain and the people of cuba and to secure in the island the establishment of a stable government capable of maintain order and observe its international obligation insure peace and tranquility and the security of its citizen as well as our own and to use the military and naval force of the united states as may be necessary for these purpose
 and in the interest of humanity and to aid in preserve the life of the starve people of the island i recommend that the distribution of food and supply be continue and that an appropriation be make out of the public treasury to supplement the charity of our citizen
 the issue be now with the congress it be a solemn responsibility i have exhaust every effort to relieve the intolerable condition of affair which be at our door prepare to execute every obligation impose upon i by the constitution and the law i await your action
 yesterday and since the preparation of the foregoing message official information be receive by i that the late decree of the queen regent of spain direct general blanco in order to prepare and facilitate peace to proclaim a suspension of hostility the duration and detail of which have not yet be communicate to i
 this fact with every other pertinent consideration will i be sure have your just and careful attention in the solemn deliberation upon which you be about to enter if this measure attain a successful result then our aspiration as a christian peace love people will be realize if it fail it will be only another justification for our contemplated action

issue which have arise demand in one instance the ultimate determination by arm and involve far reach consequence which will require the earnest attention of the congress in my last annual message very full consideration be give to the question of the duty of the government of the united states toward spain and the cuban insurrection as be by far the most important problem with which we be then call upon to deal the consideration then advance and the exposition of the view therein express disclose my sense of the extreme gravity of the situation set aside as logically unfounded or practically inadmissible the recognition of the cuban insurgent as belligerent the recognition of the independence of cuba neutral intervention to end the war by impose a rational compromise between the contestant intervention in favor of one or the other party and forcible annexation of the island i conclude it be honestly due to our friendly relation with spain that she should be give a reasonable chance to realize her expectation of reform to which she have become irrevocably commit within a few week previously she have announce comprehensive plan which it be confidently asserted would be efficacious to remedy the evil so deeply affect our own country so injurious to the true interest of the mother country as well as to those of cuba and so repugnant to the universal sentiment of humanity the ensue month bring little sign of real progress toward the pacification of cuba the autonomous administration set up in the capital and some of the principal city appear not to gain the favor of the inhabitant nor to be able to extend their influence to the large extent of territory hold by the insurgent while the military arm obviously unable to cope with the still active rebellion continue many of the most objectionable and offensive policy of the government that have precede it no tangible relief be afford the vast number of unhappy reconcentrado despite the reiterate profession make in that regard and the amount appropriate by spain to that end the proffered expedient of zone of cultivation prove illusory indeed no less practical nor more delusive promise of succor could well have be tender to the exhausted and destitute people strip of all that make life and home dear and herd in a strange region among unsympathetic stranger hardly less necessitous than themselves by the end of december the mortality among they have frightfully increase conservative estimate from spanish source place the death among these distressed people at over 40 per cent from the time general weyler 's decree of reconcentration be enforce with the acquiescence of the spanish authority a scheme be adopt for relief by charitable contribution raise in this country and distribute under the direction of the consul general and the several consul by noble and earnest individual effort through the organized agency of the american red cross thousand of life be thus save but many thousand more be inaccessible to such form of aid the war continue on the old footing without comprehensive plan develop only the same spasmodic encounter barren of strategic result that have mark the course of the early ten year rebellion as well as the present insurrection from its start no alternative save physical exhaustion of either combatant and therewithal the practical ruin of the island lie in sight but how far distant no one could venture to conjecture at this juncture on the 15th of february last occur the destruction of the battle ship maine while rightfully lie in the harbor of havana on a mission of international courtesy and good will a catastrophe the suspicious nature and horror of which stir the nation 's heart profoundly it be a striking evidence of the poise and sturdy good sense distinguish our national character that this shocking blow fall upon a generous people already deeply touch by precede event in cuba do not move they to an instant desperate resolve to tolerate no long the existence of a condition of danger and disorder at our door that make possible such a deed by whomsoever wrought yet the instinct of justice prevail and the nation anxiously await the result of the search investigation at once set on foot the finding of the naval board of inquiry establish that the origin of the explosion be external by a submarine mine and only halt through lack of positive testimony to fix the responsibility of its authorship all these thing carry conviction to the most thoughtful even before the finding of the naval court that a crisis in our relation with spain and toward cuba be at hand so strong be this belief that it need but a brief executive suggestion to the congress to receive immediate answer to the duty of make instant provision for the possible and perhaps speedily probable emergency of war and the remarkable almost unique spectacle be present of a unanimous vote of both houses on the 9th of march appropriate $ 50,000,000 for the national defense and for each and every purpose connect therewith to be expend at the discretion of the president that this act of prevision come none too soon be disclose when the application of the fund be undertake our coast be practically undefended our navy need large provision for increase ammunition and supply and even number to cope with any sudden attack from the navy of spain which comprise modern vessel of the high type of continental perfection our army also require enlargement of man and munition the detail of the hurried preparation for the dreaded contingency be tell in the report of the secretaries of war and of the navy and need not be repeat here it be sufficient to say that the outbreak of war when it do come find our nation not unprepared to meet the conflict nor be the apprehension of come strife confine to our own country it be feel by the continental power which on april 6 through their ambassador and envoy address to the executive an expression of hope that humanity and moderation might mark the course of this government and people and that further negotiation would lead to an agreement which while secure the maintenance of peace would afford all necessary guaranty for the reestablishment of order in cuba in respond to that representation i say i share the hope the envoy have express that peace might be preserve in a manner to terminate the chronic condition of disturbance in cuba so injurious and menacing to our interest and tranquillity as well as shocking to our sentiment of humanity and while appreciate the humanitarian and disinterested character of the communication they have make on behalf of the power i state the confidence of this government for its part that equal appreciation would be show for its own earnest and unselfish endeavor to fulfill a duty to humanity by end a situation the indefinite prolongation of which have become insufferable still animate by the hope of a peaceful solution and obey the dictate of duty no effort be relax to bring about a speedy ending of the cuban struggle negotiation to this object continue actively with the government of spain look to the immediate conclusion of a six month armistice in cuba with a view to effect the recognition of her people 's right to independence besides this the instant revocation of the order of reconcentration be ask so that the sufferer return to their home and aid by united american and spanish effort might be put in a way to support themselves and by orderly resumption of the well nigh destroy productive energy of the island contribute to the restoration of its tranquillity and well being negotiation continue for some little time at madrid result in offer by the spanish government which could not but be regard as inadequate it be propose to confide the preparation of peace to the insular parliament yet to be convene under the autonomous decree of november 1897 but without impairment in any wise of the constitutional power of the madrid government which to that end would grant an armistice if solicit by the insurgent for such time as the general in chief might see fit to fix how and with what scope of discretionary power the insular parliament be expect to set about the preparation of peace do not appear if it be to be by negotiation with the insurgent the issue seem to rest on the one side with a body choose by a fraction of the elector in the district under spanish control and on the other with the insurgent population hold the interior country unrepresente in the so call parliament and defiant at the suggestion of sue for peace grieved and disappoint at this barren outcome of my sincere endeavor to reach a practicable solution i feel it my duty to remit the whole question to the congress in the message of april 11 1898 i announce that with this last overture in the direction of immediate peace in cuba and its disappointing reception by spain the effort of the executive be bring to an end i again review the alternative course of action which have be propose conclude that the only one consonant with international policy and compatible with our firm set historical tradition be intervention as a neutral to stop the war and check the hopeless sacrifice of life even though that resort involve hostile constraint upon both the party to the contest as well to enforce a truce as to guide the eventual settlement the ground justify that step be the interest of humanity the duty to protect the life and property of our citizen in cuba the right to check injury to our commerce and people through the devastation of the island and most important the need of remove at once and forever the constant menace and the burden entail upon our government by the uncertainty and peril of the situation cause by the unendurable disturbance in cuba i say the long trial have prove that the object for which spain have wage the war can not be attain the fire of insurrection may flame or may smolder with varying season but it have not be and it be plain that it can not be extinguish by present method the only hope of relief and repose from a condition which can no long be endure be the enforce pacification of cuba in the name of humanity in the name of civilization in behalf of endanger american interest which give we the right and the duty to speak and to act the war in cuba must stop in view of all this the congress be ask to authorize and empower the president to take measure to secure a full and final termination of hostility between spain and the people of

government or the future of the new possession which will come to we as the result of the war with spain such discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratify in the meantime and until the congress have legislate otherwise it will be my duty to continue the military government which have exist since our occupation and give to the people security in life and property and encouragement under a just and beneficent rule as soon as we be in possession of cuba and have pacify the island it will be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form a government for themselves this should be undertake at the early moment consistent with safety and assure success it be important that our relation with this people shall be of the most friendly character and our commercial relation close and reciprocal it should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste place of the island encourage the industry of the people and assist they to form a government which shall be free and independent thus realize the good aspiration of the cuban people spanish rule must be replace by a just benevolent and humane government create by the people of cuba capable of perform all international obligation and which shall encourage thrift industry and prosperity and promote peace and good will among all of the inhabitant whatever may have be their relation in the past neither revenge nor passion should have a place in the new government until there be complete tranquillity in the island and a stable government inaugurate military occupation will be continue with the one exception of the rupture with spain the intercourse of the united states with the great family of nation have be mark with cordiality and the close of the eventful year find most of the issue that necessarily arise in the complex relation of sovereign state adjust or present no serious obstacle to a just and honorable solution by amicable agreement a long unsettle dispute as to the extended boundary between the argentine republic and chile stretch along the andean crest from the southern border of the atacama desert to magellan straits nearly a third of the length of the south american continent assume an acute stage in the early part of the year and afford to this government occasion to express the hope that the resort to arbitration already contemplate by exist convention between the party might prevail despite the grave difficulty arise in its application i be happy to say that arrangement to this end have be perfect the question of fact upon which the respective commissioner be unable to agree be in course of reference to her britannic majesty for determination a residual difference touch the northern boundary line across the atacama desert for which exist treaty provide no adequate adjustment bid fair to be settle in like manner by a joint commission upon which the united states minister at buenos ayres have be invite to serve as umpire in the last resort i have find occasion to approach the argentine government with a view to remove difference of rate charge impose upon the cable of an american corporation in the transmission between buenos ayres and the city of uruguay and brazil of through message pass from and to the united states although the matter be complicate by exclusive concession by uruguay and brazil to foreign company there be strong hope that a good understanding will be reach and that the important channel of commercial communication between the united states and the atlantic city of south america may be free from an almost prohibitory discrimination in this relation i may be permit to express my sense of the fitness of an international agreement whereby the interchange of message over connect cable may be regulate on a fair basis of uniformity the world have see the postal system develop from a congerie of independent and exclusive service into a well order union of which all country enjoy the manifold benefit it would be strange be the nation not in time bring to realize that modern civilization which owe so much of its progress to the annihilation of space by the electric force demand that this all important mean of communication be a heritage of all people to be administer and regulate in their common behoof a step in this direction be take when the international convention of 1884 for the protection of submarine cable be sign and the day be i trust not far distant when this medium for the transmission of thought from land to land may be bring within the domain of international concert as completely as be the material carriage of commerce and correspondence upon the face of the water that divide they the claim of thomas jefferson page against argentina which have be pende many year have be adjust the sum award by the congress of argentina be $ 4,242.35.the sympathy of the american people have justly be offer to the ruler and the people of austria hungary by reason of the affliction that have lately befall they in the assassination of the empress queen of that historic realm on the 10th of september 1897 a conflict take place at lattimer pa. between a body of strike miner and the sheriff of luzerne county and his deputy in which 22 miner be kill and 44 wound of whom 10 of the kill and 12 of the wound be austrian and hungarian subject this deplorable event naturally arouse the solicitude of the austro hungarian government which on the assumption that the killing and wounding involve the unjustifiable misuse of authority claim reparation for the sufferer apart from the search investigation and peremptory action of the authority of pennsylvania the federal executive take appropriate step to learn the merit of the case in order to be in a position to meet the urgent complaint of a friendly power the sheriff and his deputy having be indict for murder be try and acquit after protract proceeding and the hearing of hundred of witness on the ground that the killing be in the line of their official duty to uphold law and preserve public order in the state a representative of the department of justice attend the trial and report its course fully with all the fact in its possession this government expect to reach a harmonious understanding on the subject with that of austria hungary notwithstanding the renew claim of the latter after learn the result of the trial for indemnity for its injure subject despite the brief time allot for preparation the exhibit of this country at the universal exposition at brussels in 1897 enjoy the singular distinction of a large proportion of award have regard to the number and class of article enter than those of other country the worth of such a result in make know our national capacity to supply the world 's market be obvious exhibition of this international character be become more frequent as the exchange of commercial country grow more intimate and varied hardly a year pass that this government be not invite to national participation at some important foreign center but often on too short notice to permit of recourse to congress for the power and mean to do so my predecessor have suggest the advisability of provide by a general enactment and a stand appropriation for accept such invitation and for representation of this country by a commission this plan have my cordial approval i trust that the belgian restriction on the importation of cattle from the united states originally adopt as a sanitary precaution will at an early day be relax as to their present feature of hardship and discrimination so as to admit live cattle under due regulation of their slaughter after land i be hopeful too of favorable change in the belgian treatment of our preserve and salt meat the growth of direct trade between the two country not alone for belgian consumption and belgian product but by way of transit from and to other continental states have be both encouraging and beneficial no effort will be spare to enlarge its advantage by seek the removal of needless impediment and by arrangement for increase commercial exchange the year 's event in central america deserve more than pass mention a menacing rupture between costa rica and nicaragua be happily compose by the signature of a convention between the party with the concurrence of the guatemalan representative as a mediator the act be negotiate and sign on board the united states steamer alert then lie in central american water it be believe that the good office of our envoy and of the commander of that vessel contribute toward this gratifying outcome in my last annual message the situation be present with respect to the diplomatic representation of this government in central america create by the association of nicaragua honduras and salvador under the title of the greater republic of central america and the delegation of their international function to the diet thereof while the representative character of the diet be recognize by my predecessor and have be confirm during my administration by receive its accredited envoy and grant exequatur to consul commission under its authority that recognition be qualified by the distinct understanding that the responsibility of each of the component sovereign republics toward the united states remain wholly unaffected this proviso be needful inasmuch as the compact of the three republic be at the outset an association whereby certain representative function be delegate to a tripartite commission rather than a federation possess centralized power of government and administration in this view of their relation and of the relation of the united states to the several republics a change in the representation of this country in central america be neither recommend by the executive nor initiate by congress thus leave one of our envoy accredit as heretofore separately to two states of the greater republic nicaragua and salvador and to a third state costa rica which be not a party to the compact while our other envoy be similarly accredit to a union state honduras and a nonunion state guatemala the result have be that the one have present credential only to the president of costa rica the other having be receive only by the government of guatemala subsequently the three associate republic enter into negotiation for take the step forecast in the original compact a convention of their delegate frame for they a federal constitution under the name of the united states of central america and provide for a central federal government and legislature upon ratification by the constituent states the 1st of november last be fix for the new system to go into operation within a few week thereafter the plan be severely test by revolutionary movement arise with a consequent demand for unity of action on the part of the military power of the federal states to suppress they under this strain the new union seem to have be weaken through the withdrawal of its more important member this government be not officially advise of the installation of the federation and have maintain an attitude of friendly expectancy while in no wise relinquish the position hold from the outset that the responsibility of the several states toward we remain unaltered by their tentative relation among themselves the nicaragua canal commission under the chairmanship of rear admiral john g. walker appoint july 24 1897 under the authority of a provision in the sundry civil act of june 4 of that year have nearly complete its labor and the result of its exhaustive inquiry into the proper route the feasibility and the cost of construction of an interoceanic canal by a nicaraguan route will be lay before you in the performance of its task the commission receive all possible courtesy and assistance from the government of nicaragua and costa rica which thus testify their appreciation of the importance of give a speedy and practical outcome to the great project that have for so many year engross the attention of the respective country as the scope of the recent inquiry embrace the whole subject with the aim of make plan and survey for a canal by the most convenient route it necessarily include a review of the result of previous survey and plan and in particular those adopt by the maritime canal company under its exist concession from nicaragua and costa rica so that to this extent those grant necessarily hold as essential a part in the deliberation and conclusion of the canal commission as they have hold and must need hold in the discussion of the matter by the congress under these circumstance and in view of overture make to the government of nicaragua and costa rica by other party for a new canal concession predicate on the assumed approach lapse of the contract of the maritime canal company with those states i have not hesitate to express my conviction that consideration of expediency and international policy as between the several government interested in the construction and control of an interoceanic canal by this route require the maintenance of the status quo until the canal commission shall have report and the united states congress shall have have the opportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter during the present session without prejudice by reason of any change in the exist condition nevertheless it appear that the government of nicaragua as one of its last sovereign act before merge its power in those of the newly form united states of central america have grant an optional concession to another association to become effective on the expiration of the present grant it do not appear what survey have be make or what route be propose under this contingent grant so that an examination of the feasibility of its plan be necessarily not embrace in the report of the canal commission all these circumstance suggest the urgency of some definite action by the congress at this session if the labor of the past be to be utilize and the linking of the atlantic and pacific ocean by a practical waterway be to be realize that the construction of such a maritime highway be now more than ever indispensable to that intimate and ready intercommunication between our eastern and western seaboard demand by the annexation of the hawaiian islands and the prospective expansion of our influence and commerce in the pacific and that our national policy now more imperatively than ever call for its control by this government be proposition which i doubt not the congress will duly appreciate and wisely act upon a convention provide for the revival of the late united states and chilean claims commission and the consideration of claim which be duly present to the late commission but not consider because of the expiration of the time limit for the duration of the commission be sign may 24 1897 and have remain unacted upon by the senate the term therein fix for effect the exchange of ratification having elapse the convention fall unless the time be extend by amendment which i be endeavor to bring about with the friendly concurrence of the chilean government the united states have not be an indifferent spectator of the extraordinary event transpire in the chinese empire whereby portion of its maritime province be pass under the control of various european power but the prospect that the vast commerce which the energy of our citizen and the necessity of our staple production for chinese use have build up in those region may not be prejudice through any exclusive treatment by the new occupant have obviate the need of our country become an actor in the scene our position among nation have a large pacific coast and a constantly expand direct trade with the farth orient give we the equitable claim to consideration and friendly treatment in this regard and it will be my aim to subserve our large interest in that quarter by all mean appropriate to the constant policy of our government the territory of kiao chow of wei hai wei and of port arthur and talienwan lease to germany great britain and russia respectively for term of year will it be announce be open to international commerce during such alien occupation and if no discriminating treatment of american citizen and their trade be find to exist or be hereafter develop the desire of this government would appear to be realize in this relation as show the volume and value of our exchange with china and the peculiarly favorable condition which exist for their expansion in the normal course of trade i refer to the communication address to the speaker of the house of representatives by the secretary of the treasury on the 14th of last june with its accompany letter of the secretary of state recommend an appropriation for a commission to study the commercial and industrial condition in the chinese empire and report as to the opportunity for and obstacle to the enlargement of market in china for the raw product and manufacture of the united states action be not take thereon during the late session i cordially urge that the recommendation receive at your hand the consideration which its importance and timeliness merit meanwhile there may be just ground for disquietude in view of the unrest and revival of the old sentiment of opposition and prejudice to alien people which pervade certain of the chinese province as in the case of the attack upon our citizen in szechuen and at kutien in 1895 the united states minister have be instruct to secure the full measure of protection both local and imperial for any menace american interest and to demand in case of lawless injury to person or property instant reparation appropriate to the case war ship have be station at tientsin for more ready observation of the disorder which have invade even the chinese capital so as to be in a position to act should need arise while a guard of marines have be send to peking to afford the minister the same measure of authoritative protection as the representative of other nation have be constrain to employ follow close upon the rendition of the award of my predecessor as arbitrator of the claim of the italian subject cerruti against the republic of colombia difference arise between the party to the arbitration in regard to the scope and extension of the award of which certain article be contest by colombia while italy claim their literal fulfillment the award having be make by the president of the united states as an act of friendly consideration and with the sole view to an impartial composition of the matter in dispute i could not but feel deep concern at such a miscarriage and while unable to accept the colombian theory that i in my official capacity possess continue function as arbitrator with power to interpret or revise the term of the award my good effort be lend to bring the party to a harmonious agreement as to the execution of its provision a naval demonstration by italy result in an engagement to pay the liability claim upon their ascertainment but this apparent disposition of the controversy be follow by a rupture of diplomatic intercourse between colombia and italy which still continue although fortunately without acute symptom having supervene notwithstanding this effort be report to be continue for the ascertainment of colombia 's contingent liability on account of cerruti 's debt under the fifth article of the award a claim of an american citizen against the dominican republic for a public bridge over the ozama river which have be in diplomatic controversy for several year have be settle by expert arbitration and an award in favor of the claimant amounting to about $ 90,000 it however remain unpaid despite urgent demand for its settlement accord to the term of the compact there be now every prospect that the participation of the united states in the universal exposition to be hold in paris in 1900 will be on a scale commensurate with the advanced position hold by our product and industry in the world 's chief mart the preliminary report of mr. moses p. handy who under the act approve july 19 1897 be appoint special commissioner with a view to secure all attainable information necessary to a full and complete understanding by congress in regard to the participation of this government in the paris exposition be lay before you by my message of december 6 1897 and show the large opportunity open to make known our national progress in art science and manufacture as well as the urgent need of immediate and adequate provision to enable due advantage thereof to be take mr. handy 's death soon afterwards render it necessary for another to take up and complete his unfinished work and on january 11 last mr. thomas w. cridler third assistant secretary of state be designate to fulfill that task his report be lay before you by my message of june 14 1898 with the gratifying result of awakening renew interest in the project display by a provision in the sundry civil appropriation act of july 1 1898 a sum not to exceed $ 650,000 be allot for the organization of a commission to care for the proper preparation and installation of american exhibit and for the display of suitable exhibit by the several executive departments particularly by the department of agriculture the fish commission and the smithsonian institution in representation of the government of the united states pursuant to that enactment i appoint mr. ferdinand w. peck of chicago commissioner general with an assistant commissioner general and a secretary mr. peck at once proceed to paris where his success in enlarge the scope and variety of the united states exhibit have be most gratifying notwithstanding the comparatively limited area of the exposition site less than one half that of the world 's fair at chicago the space assign to the united states have be increase from the absolute allotment of 157,403 square foot report by mr. handy to some 202,000 square foot with correspond augmentation of the field for a truly characteristic representation of the various important branch of our country 's development mr. peck 's report will be lay before you in my judgment its recommendation will call for your early consideration especially as regard an increase of the appropriation to at least one million dollar in all so that not only may the assign space be fully take up by the good possible exhibit in every class but the preparation and installation be on so perfect a scale as to rank among the first in that unparalleled competition of artistic and inventive production and thus counterbalance the disadvantage with which we start as compare with other country whose appropriation be on a more generous scale and whose preparation be in a state of much great forwardness than ourwhere our artisan have the admit capacity to excel where our inventive genius have initiate many of the grand discovery of these later day of the century and where the native resource of our land be as limitless as they be valuable to supply the world 's need it be our province as it should be our earnest care to lead in the march of human progress and not rest content with any secondary place moreover if this be due to ourselves it be no less due to the great french nation whose guest we become and which have in so many way testify its wish and hope that our participation shall befit the place the two people have win in the field of universal development

during the present session of congress negotiation to the same end with germany have be set on foot meanwhile no effort have be relax to convince the imperial government of the thoroughness of our inspection of pork product for exportation and it be trust that the efficient administration of this measure by the department of agriculture will be recognize as a guaranty of the healthfulness of the food staple we send abroad to country where their use be large and necessary i transmit to the senate on the 10th of february last information touch the prohibition against the importation of fresh fruit from this country which have then recently be decree by germany on the ground of danger of disseminate the san jose scale insect this precautionary measure be justify by germany on the score of the drastic step take in several states of the union against the spread of the pest the elaborate report of the department of agriculture be put in evidence to show the danger to german fruit

island a joint resolution to accomplish the same purpose by accept the offer cession and incorporate the cede territory into the union be adopt by the congress and approve july 7 1898 i thereupon

hawaii with whom the admiral and the united states minister be authorize to make appropriate arrangement for transfer the sovereignty of the island to the united states this be simply but impressively accomplish on the 12th of august last by the delivery of a certify copy of the resolution to president dole who thereupon yield up to the representative of the government of the united states the

provide for the uninterrupted continuance of all the administrative and municipal function of the annexed territory until congress shall otherwise enact follow the further provision of the joint resolution i appoint the hons shelby m. cullom of illinois john t. morgan of alabama robert r. hitt of illinois sanford b. dole of hawaii and walter f. frear of hawaii as commissioner to confer and recommend to congress such legislation concern the hawaiian islands as they should deem necessary or proper the commissioner having fulfil the mission confide to they their report will be lay before you at an early day it be believe that their recommendation will have the earnest consideration due to the magnitude of the responsibility rest upon you to give such shape to the relationship of those mid pacific land to our home union as will benefit both in the high degree realize the aspiration of the community that have cast its lot with we and elect to share our political heritage while at the same time justify the foresight of those who for three quarter of a century have look to the assimilation of hawaii as a natural and inevitable consummation in harmony with our need and in fulfillment of our cherish tradition the question heretofore pende between hawaii and japan grow out of the alleged mistreatment of japanese treaty immigrant be i be pleased to say adjust before the act of transfer by the payment of a reasonable indemnity to the government of japan under the provision of the joint resolution the exist custom relation of the hawaiian islands with the united states and with other country remain unchanged until legislation shall otherwise provide the consul of hawaii here and in foreign country continue to fulfill their commercial agency while the united states consulate at honolulu be maintain for all appropriate service pertain to trade and the revenue it would be desirable that all foreign consul in the hawaiian islands should receive new exequatur from this government the attention of congress be call to the fact that our consular office having cease to exist in hawaii and be about to cease in other country come under the sovereignty of the united states the provision for the relief and transportation of destitute american seaman in these country under our consular regulation will in consequence terminate it be proper therefore that new legislation should be enact upon this subject in order to meet the change condition the interpretation of certain provision of the extradition convention of december 11 1861 have be at various time the occasion of controversy with the government of mexico an acute difference arise in the case of the mexican demand for the delivery of jesus guerra who having lead a maraud expedition near the border with the proclaim purpose of initiate an insurrection against president diaz escape into texas extradition be refuse on the ground that the alleged offense be political in its character and therefore come within the treaty proviso of nonsurrender the mexican contention be that the exception only relate to purely political offense and that as guerra 's act be admix with the common crime of murder arson kidnaping and robbery the option of nondelivery become void a position which this government be unable to admit in view of the received international doctrine and practice in the matter the mexican government in view of this give notice january 24 1898 of the termination of the convention to take effect twelve month from that date at the same time invite the conclusion of a new convention toward which negotiation be on foot in this relation i may refer to the necessity of some amendment of our exist extradition statute it be a common stipulation of such treaty that neither party shall be bind to give up its own citizen with the add proviso in one of our treaty that with japan that it may surrender if it see fit it be hold in this country by an almost uniform course of decision that where a treaty negative the obligation to surrender the president be not invest with legal authority to act the conferment of such authority would be in the line of that sound morality which shrink from afford secure asylum to the author of a heinous crime again statutory provision might well be make for what be style extradition by way of transit whereby a fugitive surrender by one foreign government to another may be convey across the territory of the united states to the jurisdiction of the demand state a recommendation in this behalf make in the president 's message of 1886 be not act upon the matter be present for your consideration the problem of the mexican free zone have be often discuss with regard to its inconvenience as a provocative of smuggling into the united states along an extensive and thinly guard land border the effort make by the joint resolution of march 1 1895 to remedy the abuse charge by suspend the privilege of free transportation in bond across the territory of the united states to mexico fail of good result as be state in report no 702 of the house of representatives submit in the last session march 11 1898 as the question be one to be conveniently meet by wise concurrent legislation of the two country look to the protection of the revenue by harmonious measure operate equally on either side of the boundary rather than by conventional arrangement i suggest that congress consider the advisability of authorize and invite a conference of representative of the treasury departments of the united states and mexico to consider the subject in all its complex bearing and make report with pertinent recommendation to the respective government for the information and consideration of their congress the mexican water boundary commission have adjust all matter submit to it to the satisfaction of both government save in three important case that of the chamizal at el paso tex where the two commissioner fail to agree and wherein for this case only this government have propose to mexico the addition of a third member the propose elimination of what be know as bancos small isolate island form by the cutting

conference the active military force of the united states as measure by our population territorial area and taxable wealth be and under any conceivable prospective condition must continue to be in time of peace so conspicuously less than that of the armed power to whom the czar 's appeal be especially address that the question can have for we no practical importance save as mark an auspicious step toward the betterment of the condition of the modern people and the cultivation of peace and good will among they but in this view it behoove we as a nation to lend countenance and aid to the beneficent project the claim of owner of american sealing vessel for seizure by russian cruiser in bering sea be be press to a settlement the equity of the case justify the expectation that a measure of reparation will eventually be accord in harmony with precedent and in the light of the proven fact the recommendation make in my special message of april 27 last be renew that appropriation be make

adopt such a modus vivendi and in view of the accession of the united states to those additional article in 1882 although the exchange of ratification thereof still remain uneffected the swiss proposal be promptly and cordially accept by we and simultaneously by spain this government feel a keen satisfaction in having thus be enable to testify its adherence to the broad principle of humanity even amidst the clash of war and it be to be hope that the extension of the red cross compact to hostility by sea as well as on land may soon become an accomplished fact through the general promulgation of the additional naval red cross article by the maritime power now party to the convention of 1864.the important question of the claim of switzerland to the perpetual cantonal allegiance of american citizen of swiss origin have not make hopeful progress toward a solution and controversy in this regard still continue the newly accredit envoy of the united states to the ottoman porte carry instruction look to the disposal of matter in controversy with turkey for a number of year he be especially charge to press for a just settlement of our claim for indemnity by reason of the destruction of the property of american missionary resident in that country during the armenian trouble of 1895 as well as for the recognition of old claim of equal justness he be also instruct to seek an adjustment of the dispute grow out of the refusal of turkey to recognize the acquire citizenship of ottoman bear person naturalize in the united states since 1869 without prior imperial consent and in the same general relation he be direct to endeavor to bring about a solution of the question which have more or less acutely exist since 1869 concern the jurisdictional right of the united states in matter of criminal procedure and punishment under article iv of the treaty of 1830 this latter difficulty grow out of a verbal difference claim by turkey to be essential between the original turkish text and the promulgated translation after more than two year from the appointment of a consul of this country to erzerum he have receive his exequatur the arbitral tribunal appoint under the treaty of february 2 1897 between great britain and venezuela to determine the boundary line between the latter and the colony of british guiana be to convene at paris during the present month it be a source of much gratification to this government to see the friendly resort of arbitration apply to the settlement of this controversy not alone because of the earnest part we have have in bring about the result but also because the two member name on behalf of venezuela mr. chief justice fuller and mr. justice brewer choose from our high court appropriately testify the continue interest we feel in the definitive adjustment of the question accord to the strict rule of justice the british member lord herschell and sir richard collins be jurist of no less exalted repute while the fifth member and president of the tribunal m. f. de martens have earn a world wide reputation as an authority upon international law the claim of felipe scandella against venezuela for arbitrary expulsion and injury to his business have be adjust by the revocation of the order of expulsion and by the payment of the sum of $ 16,000.i have the satisfaction of be able to state that the bureau of the american republics create in 1890 as the organ for promote commercial intercourse and fraternal relation among the country of the western hemisphere have become a more efficient instrument of the wise purpose of its founder and be receive the cordial support of the contribute member of the international union which be actually represent in its board of management a commercial directory in two volume contain a mass of statistical matter descriptive of the industrial and commercial interest of the various country have be print in english spanish portuguese and french and a monthly bulletin publish in these four language and distribute in the latin american country as well as in the united states have prove to be a valuable medium for disseminate information and further the varied interest of the international union during the past year the important work of collect information of practical benefit to american industry and trade through the agency of the diplomatic and consular officer have be steadily advance and in order to lay such datum before the public with the least delay the practice be begin in january 1898 of issue the commercial report from day to day as they be receive by the department of state it be believe that for promptitude as well as fullness of information the service thus supply to our merchant and manufacturer will be find to show sensible improvement and to merit the liberal support of congress the experience of the last year bring forcibly home to we a sense of the burden and the waste of war we desire in common with most civilized nation to reduce to the low possible point the damage sustain in time of war by peaceable trade and commerce it be true we may suffer in such case less than other community but all nation be damage more or less by the state of uneasiness and apprehension into which an outbreak of hostility throw the entire commercial world it should be our object therefore to minimize so far as practicable this inevitable loss and disturbance this purpose can probably well be accomplish by an international agreement to regard all private property at sea as exempt from capture or destruction by the force of belligerent power the united states government have for many year advocate this humane and beneficent principle and be now in position to recommend it to other power without the imputation of selfish motive i therefore suggest for your consideration that the executive be authorize to correspond with the government of the principal maritime power with a view of incorporate into the permanent law of civilized nation the principle of the exemption of all private property at sea not contraband of war from capture or destruction by belligerent power the secretary of the treasury report that the receipt of the government from all source during the fiscal year end june 30 1898 include $ 64,751,223 receive from sale of pacific railroad amount to $ 405,321,335 and its expenditure to $

distil spirit be $ 92,546,999 on manufactured tobacco $ 36,230,522 and on ferment liquor $ 39,515,421 we export merchandise during the year amount to $ 1,231,482,330 an increase of $ 180,488,774 from the precede year it be estimate upon the basis of present revenue law that the receipt of the government for the year end june 30 1899 will be $ 577,874,647 and its expenditure $ 689,874,647 result in a deficiency of $ 112,000,000.on the 1st of december 1898 there be hold in the treasury gold coin amounting to $ 138,441,547 gold bullion amounting to $ 138,502,545 silver bullion amounting to $ 93,359,250 and other form of money amount to $ 451,963,981.on the same date the amount of money of all kind in circulation or not include in treasury holding be $ 1,886,879,504 an increase for the year of $ 165,794,966 estimate our population at 75,194,000 at the time mention the per capita circulation be $ 25.09 on the same date there be in the treasury gold bullion amounting to $ 138,502,545.the provision make for strengthen the resource of the treasury in connection with the war have give increase confidence in the purpose and power of the government to maintain the present standard and have establish more firmly than ever the national credit at home and abroad a marked evidence of this be find in the inflow of gold to the treasury its net gold holding on november 1 1898 be $ 239,885,162 as compare with $ 153,573,147 on november 1 1897 and an increase of net cash of $ 207,756,100 november 1 1897 to $ 300,238,275 november 1 1898 the present ratio of net treasury gold

per cent as compare with 16.96 per cent november 1 1897.i renew so much of my recommendation of december 1897 as follow that when any of the united states note be present for redemption in gold and be redeem in gold such note shall be keep and set apart and only pay out in exchange for gold this be an obvious duty if the holder of the united states note prefer the gold and get it from the government he should not receive back from the government a united states note without pay gold in exchange for it the reason for this be make all the more apparent when the government issue an interest bear debt to provide gold for the redemption of united states note a non interest bear debt surely it should not pay they out again except on demand and for gold if they be put out in any other way they may return again to he follow by another bond issue to redeem they another interest bear debt to redeem a non interest bear debt this recommendation be make in the belief that such provision of law would insure to a great degree the safety of the present standard and well protect our currency from the danger to which it be subject from a disturbance in the general business condition of the country in my judgment the present condition of the treasury amply justify the immediate enactment of the legislation recommend one year ago under which a portion of the gold holding should be place in a trust fund from which greenback should be redeem upon presentation but when once redeem should not thereafter be pay out except for gold it be not to be infer that other legislation relate to our currency be not require on the contrary there be an obvious demand for it the importance of adequate provision which will insure to our future a money standard relate as our money standard now be to that of our commercial rival be generally recognize the companion proposition that our domestic paper currency shall be keep safe and yet be so related to the need of our industry and internal commerce as to be adequate and responsive to such need be a proposition scarcely less important the subject in all its part be commend to the wise consideration of the congress the annexation of hawaii and the change relation of the united states to cuba puerto rico and the philippines result from the war compel the prompt adoption of a maritime policy by the united states there should be establish regular and frequent steamship communication encourage by the united states under the american flag with the newly acquire island spain furnish to its colony at an annual cost of about $ 2,000,000 steamship line communicate with a portion of the world 's market as well as with trade center of the home government the united states will not undertake to do less it be our duty to furnish the people of hawaii with facility under national control for their export and import trade it will be concede that the present situation call for legislation which shall be prompt durable and liberal the part which american merchant vessel and their seaman perform in the war with spain demonstrate that this service furnish both picket and the second line of defense be a national necessity and should be encourage in every constitutional way detail and method for the accomplishment of this purpose be discuss in the report of the secretary of the treasury to which the attention of congress be respectfully invite in my last annual message i recommend that congress authorize the appointment of a commission for the purpose of make systematic investigation with reference to the cause and prevention of yellow fever this matter have acquire an increase importance as a result of the military occupation of the island of cuba and the commercial intercourse between this island and the united states which we have every reason to expect the sanitary problem connect with our new relation with the island of cuba and the acquisition of puerto rico be no less important than those relate to finance commerce and administration it be my earnest desire that these problem may be consider by competent expert and that everything may be do which the most recent advance in sanitary science can offer for the protection of the health of our soldier in those island and of our citizen who be expose to the danger of infection from the importation of yellow fever i therefore renew my recommendation that the authority of congress may be give and a suitable appropriation make to provide for a commission of expert to be appoint for the purpose indicate under the act of congress approve april 26 1898 authorize the president in his discretion upon a declaration of war by congress or a declaration by congress that war exist i direct the increase of the regular

of the commission or enlisted force of the regular army beyond that now provide by the law in force prior to the passage of this act except as to the increase of twenty five major provide for in section 1 hereof the importance of legislation for the permanent increase of the army be therefore manifest and the recommendation of the secretary of war for that purpose have my unqualified approval there can be no question that at this time and probably for some time in the future 100,000 man will be none too many to meet the necessity of the situation at all event whether that number shall be require permanently or not the power should be give to the president to enlist that force if in his discretion it should be necessary and the further discretion should be give he to recruit for the army within the above limit from the inhabitant of the island with the government of which we be charge it be my purpose to muster out the entire volunteer army as soon as the congress shall provide for the increase of the regular establishment this will be only an act of justice and will be much appreciate by the brave man who leave their home and employment to help the country in its emergency in my last annual message i state the union pacific railway main line be sell under the decree of the united states court for the district of nebraska on the 1st and 2d of november of this year the

possession of the mortgage premise and maintain and operate the same until the court or congress otherwise direct thereupon the reorganization committee agree that if say petition be withdraw and the sale allow to proceed on the 16th of february 1898 they would bid a sum at the sale which would realize to the government the entire principal of its debt $ 6,303,000.believing that no well price could be obtain and appreciate the difficulty under which the government would labor if it should become the purchaser of the road at the sale in the absence of any authority by congress to take charge of and operate the road i direct that upon the guaranty of a minimum bid which should give the government the principal of its debt the sale should proceed by this transaction the government secure an advance of $ 3,803,000 over and above the sum which the court have fix as the upset price and which the reorganization committee have declare be the maximum which they would pay for the property it be a gratifying fact that the result of these proceeding against the union pacific system and the kansas pacific line be that the government have receive on account of its subsidy claim

dilapidated appearance unsuited to the dignity which should attach to this important department a proper regard for the safety comfort and convenience of the officer and employee would justify the

ground occupy by the present structure and adjoining vacant lot comprise in all a frontage of 201 foot on pennsylvania avenue and a depth of 136 foot in this connection i may likewise refer to the

absorb the circulate medium it be far true that year by year with large area of land under cultivation the increase volume of agricultural product cotton corn and wheat call for a large volume of money supply this be especially noticeable at the crop harvesting and crop move period in its early history the national banking act seem to prove a reasonable avenue through which needful addition to the circulation could from time to time be make change condition have apparently render it now inoperative to that end the high margin in bond security require result from large premium which government bond command in the market or the tax on note issue or both operate together appear to be the influence which impair its public utility the attention of congress be respectfully invite to this important matter with the view of ascertain whether or not such reasonable modification can be make in the national banking act as will render its service in the particular here refer to more responsive to the people 's need i again urge that national bank be authorize to organize with a capital of $ 25,000.i urgently recommend that to support the exist gold standard and to maintain the parity in value of the coin of the two metal gold and silver and the equal power of every dollar at all time in the market and in the payment of debt the secretary of the treasury be give additional power and charge with the duty to sell united states bond and to employ such other effective mean as may be necessary to these end the authority should include the power to sell bond on long and short time as condition may require and should provide for a rate of interest low than that fix by the act of january 14 1875 while there be now no commercial fright which withdraw gold from the government but on the contrary such widespread confidence that gold seek the treasury demand paper money in exchange yet the very situation point to the present as the most fitting time to make adequate provision to insure the continuance of the gold standard and of public confidence in the ability and purpose of the government to meet all its obligation in the money which the civilized world recognize as the good the financial transaction of the government be conduct upon a gold basis we receive gold when we sell united states bond and use gold for their payment we be maintain the parity of all the money issue or coin by authority of the government we be do these thing with the mean at hand happily at the present time we be not compel to resort to loan to supply gold it have be do in the past however and may have to be do in the future it behoove we therefore to provide at once the good mean to meet the emergency when it arise and the good mean be those which be the most certain and economical those now authorize have the virtue neither of directness nor economy we have already eliminate one of the cause of our financial plight and embarrassment during the year 1893 1894 1895 and 1896 our receipt now equal our expenditure deficient revenue no long create alarm let we remove the only remain cause by confer the full and necessary power on the secretary of the treasury and impose upon he the duty to uphold the present gold standard and preserve the coin of the two metal on a parity with each other which be the repeatedly declare policy of the united states in this connection i repeat my former recommendation that a portion of the gold holding shall be place in a trust fund from which greenback shall be redeem upon presentation but when once redeem shall not thereafter be pay out except for gold the value of an american merchant marine to the extension of our commercial trade and the strengthening of our power upon the sea invite the immediate action of the congress our national development will be one sided and unsatisfactory so long as the remarkable growth of our inland industry remain unaccompanie by progress on the sea there be no lack of constitutional authority for legislation which shall give to the country maritime strength commensurate with its industrial achievement and with its rank among the nation of the earth the past year have record exceptional activity in our shipyard and the promise of continual prosperity in shipbuilding be abundant advanced legislation for the protection of our seaman have be enact our coast trade under regulation wisely frame at the beginning of the government and since show result for the past fiscal year unequaled in our record or those of any other power we shall fail to realize our opportunity however if we complacently regard only matter at home and blind ourselves to the necessity of secure our share in the valuable carrying trade of the world last year american vessel transport a small share of our export and import than during any former year in all our history and the measure of our dependence upon foreign shipping be painfully manifest to our people without any choice of our own but from necessity the departments of the government charge with military and naval operation in the east and west indies have to obtain from foreign flag merchant vessel essential for those operation the other great nation have not hesitate to adopt the require mean to develop their shipping as a factor in national defense and as one of the sure and speedy mean of obtain for their producer a share in foreign market like vigilance and effort on our part can not fail to improve our situation which be regard with humiliation at home and with surprise abroad even the seem sacrifice which at the beginning may be involve will be offset later by more than equivalent gain the expense be as nothing compare to the advantage to be achieve the reestablishment of our merchant marine involve in a large measure our continued industrial progress and the extension of our commercial triumph i be satisfied the judgment of the country favor the policy of aid to our merchant marine which will broaden our commerce and market and upbuild our sea carry capacity for the product of agriculture and manufacture which with the increase of our navy mean more work and wage to our countryman as well as a safeguard to american interest in every part of the world combination of capital organize into trust to control the condition of trade among our citizen to stifle competition limit production and determine the price of product use and consume by the people be justly provoke public discussion and should early claim the attention of the congress the industrial commission create by the act of the congress of june 18 1898 have be engage in extend hearing upon the dispute question involve in the subject of combination in restraint of trade and competition they have not yet complete their investigation of this subject and the conclusion and recommendation at which they may arrive be undetermined the subject be one give rise to many divergent view as to the nature and variety or cause and extent of the 111juries to the public which may result from large combination concentrate more or less numerous enterprise and establishment which previously to the formation of the combination be carry on separately it be universally concede that combination which engross or control the market of any particular kind of merchandise or commodity necessary to the general community by suppress natural and ordinary competition whereby price be unduly enhance to the general consumer re obnoxious not only to the common law but also to the public welfare there must be a remedy for the evil involve in such organization if the present law can be extend more certainly to control or check these monopoly or trust it should be do without delay whatever power the congress possess over this most important subject should be promptly ascertain and assert president harrison in his annual message of december 3 1889 say earnest attention should be give by congress to a consideration of the question how far the restraint of those combination of capital commonly call 11 trust be matter of federal jurisdiction when organize as they often be to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize the production or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity they be dangerous conspiracy against the public good and should be make the subject of prohibitory and even penal legislation an act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraint and monopoly be pass by congress on the 2d of july 1890 the provision of this statute be comprehensive and stringent it declare every contract or combination in the form of a trust or otherwise or conspiracy in the restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nation to be unlawful it denominate as a criminal every person who make any such contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy and provide a punishment by fine or imprisonment it invest the several circuit court of the united states with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violation of the act and make it the duty of the several united states district attorney under the direction of the attorney general to institute proceeding in equity to prevent and restrain such violation it far confer upon any person who shall be injure in his business or property by any other person or corporation by reason of anything forbid or declare to be unlawful by the act the power to sue therefore in any circuit court of the united states without respect to the amount in controversy and to recover threefold the damage by he sustain and the cost of the suit include reasonable attorney fee it will be perceive that the act be aim at every kind of combination in the nature of a trust or monopoly in restraint of interstate or international commerce the prosecution by the united states of offense under the act of 1890 have be frequently resort to in the federal court and notable effort in the restraint of interstate commerce such as the trans missouri freight association and the joint traffic association have be successfully oppose and suppress president cleveland in his annual message of december 7 1896 more than six year subsequent to the enactment of this law after state the evil of these trust combination say though congress have attempt to deal with this matter by legislation the law pass for that purpose thus far have prove ineffective not because of any lack of disposition or attempt to enforce they but simply because the law themselves as interpret by the court do not reach the difficulty if the insufficiency of exist law can be remedie by further legislation it should be do the fact must be recognize however that all federal legislation on this subject may fall short of its purpose because of inherent obstacle and also because of the complex character of our governmental system which while make the federal authority supreme within its sphere have carefully limit that sphere by mete and bound which can not be transgress the decision of our high court on this precise question render it quite doubtful whether the evil of trust and monopoly may be adequately treat through federal action unless they seek directly and purposely to include in their object transportation or intercourse between states or between the united states and foreign country it do not follow however that this be the limit of the remedy that may be apply even though it may be find that federal authority be not broad enough to fully reach the case there can be no doubt of the power of the several states to act effectively in the premise and there should be no reason to doubt their willingness to judiciously exercise such power the state legislation to which president cleveland look for relief from the evil of trust have fail to accomplish fully that object this be probably due to a great extent to the fact that different state take different view as to the proper way to discriminate between evil and injurious combination and those association which be beneficial and necessary to the business prosperity of the country the great diversity of treatment in different state arise from this cause and the intimate relation of all part of the country to each other without regard state line in the conduct of business have make the enforcement of state law difficult it be apparent that uniformity of legislation upon this subject in the several states be much to be desire it be to be hope that such uniformity found in a wise and just discrimination between what be injurious and what be useful and necessary in business operation may be obtain and that mean may be find for the congress within the limitation of its constitutional power so to supplement an effective code of state legislation as to make a complete system of law throughout the united states adequate to compel a general observance of the salutary rule to which i have refer the whole question be so important and far reach that i be sure no part of it will be lightly consider but every phase of it will have the study deliberation of the congress result in wise and judicious action a review of our relation with foreign states be present with such recommendation as be deem appropriate the long pende boundary dispute between the argentine republic and chile be settle in march last by the award of an arbitral commission on which the united states minister at buenos ayres serve as umpire progress have be make toward the conclusion of a convention of

toward a strictly representative display of all that most characteristically mark american achievement in the inventive art and most adequately show the excellence of our natural production in this age of keen rivalry among nation for mastery in commerce the doctrine of evolution and the rule of the survival of the fit must be as inexorable in their operation as they be positive in the result they bring about the place win in the struggle by an industrial people can only be hold by unrelaxed endeavor and constant advance in achievement the present extraordinary impetus in every line of american exportation and the astounding increase in the volume and value of our share in the world 's market may not be attribute to accidental condition the reason be not far to seek they lie deep in

all that promise close relation of intercourse and commerce and a well understanding between two race have so many trait in common germany can be assure of the most cordial cooperation of this government and people we may be rival in many material path but our rivalry should be generous and open ever aim toward the attainment of large result and the mutually beneficial advancement of each in the line of its especial adaptability the several government of the empire seem reluctant to admit the natural excellence of our food production and to accept the evidence we constantly tender of the care with which their purity be guard by rigid inspection from the farm through the slaughterhouse and the packing establishment to the port of shipment our system of control over export food staple invite examination from any quarter and challenge respect by its efficient thoroughness it be to be hope that in time the two government will act in common accord toward the realization of their common purpose to safeguard the public health and to insure the purity and wholesomeness of all food product import by either country from the other be the congress to authorize an invitation to germany in connection with the pende reciprocity negotiation for the constitution of a joint commission of scientific expert and practical man of affair to conduct a search investigation of food

negotiation with great britain in respect to the dominion of canada by mean of an executive agreement a joint high commission have be create for the purpose of adjust all unsettle question between the united states and canada embrace twelve subject among which be the question of the fur seal the fishery of the coast and contiguous inland water the alaskan boundary the transit of merchandise in bond the alien labor law mining right reciprocity in trade revision of the agreement respect naval vessel in the great lakes a more complete marking of part of the boundary provision for the conveyance of criminal and for wreck and salvage much progress have be make by the commission toward the adjustment of many of these question when it become apparent that an irreconcilable difference of view be entertain respect the delimitation of the alaskan boundary in the failure of an agreement as to the meaning of articles iii and iv of the treaty of 1825 between russia and great britain which define the boundary between alaska and canada the american commissioners propose that the subject of the boundary be lay aside and that the remain question of difference be proceed with some of which be so far advanced as to assure the probability of a settlement this be decline by the british commissioners an adjournment be take until the boundary should be adjust by the two government the subject have be receive the careful attention which its importance demand with the result that a modus vivendi for provisional demarcation in the region about the head of lynn canal have be agree upon and it be hope that the negotiation now in progress between the two government will end in an agreement for the establishment and delimitation of a permanent boundary apart from these question grow out of our relationship with our northern neighbor the most friendly disposition and ready agreement have mark the discussion of numerous matter arise in the vast and intimate intercourse of the united states with great britain this government have maintain an attitude of neutrality in the unfortunate contest between great britain and the boer states of africa we have remain faithful to the precept of avoid entangle alliance as to affair not of our direct concern have circumstance suggest that the party to the quarrel would have welcome any kindly expression of the hope of the american people that war might be avert good office would have be gladly tender the united states representative at pretoria be early instruct to see that all neutral american interest be respect by the combatant this have be an easy task in view of the positive declaration of both british and boer authority that the personal and property right of our citizen should be observe upon the withdrawal of the british agent from pretoria the united states consul be authorize upon the request of the british government and with the assent of the south african and orange free state government to exercise the customary good office of a neutral for the care of british interest in the discharge of this function i be happy to say that abundant opportunity have be afford to show the impartiality of this government toward both the combatant for the fourth time in the present decade question have arise with the government of italy in regard to the lynching of italian subject the late of these deplorable event occur at tallulah louisiana whereby five unfortunate of italian origin be take from jail and hang the authority of the state and a representative of the italian embassy having separately investigate the occurrence with discrepant result particularly as to the alleged citizenship of the victim and it not appear that the state have be able to discover and punish the violator of the law an independent investigation have be set on foot through the agency of the department of state and be still in progress the result will enable the executive to treat the question with the government of italy it a spirit of fairness and justice a satisfactory solution will doubtless be reach the recurrence of these distressing manifestation of blind mob fury direct at dependent or native of a foreign country suggest that the contingency have arise for action by congress in the direction of confer upon the federal court jurisdiction in this class of international case where the ultimate responsibility of the federal government may be involve the suggestion be not new in his annual message of december 9 1891 my predecessor president harrison say it would i believe be entirely competent for congress to make offense against the treaty right of foreigner domicile in the united states cognizable in the federal court this have not however be do and the federal officer and court have no power in such case to intervene either for the protection of a foreign citizen or for the punishment of his slayer it seem to i to follow in this state of the law that the officer of the state charge with police and judicial power in such case must in the consideration of international question grow out of such incident be regard in such sense as federal agent as to make this government answerable for their act in case where it would be answerable if the united states have use its constitutional power to define and punish crime against treaty right a bill to provide for the punishment of violation of treaty right of alien be introduce in the senate march 1 1892 and report favorably march 30 having doubtless in view the language of that part of article iii of the treaty of february 26 1871 between the united states and italy which stipulate that the citizen of each of the high contracting party shall receive in the states and territories of the other most constant protection and security for their person and property and shall enjoy in this respect the same right and privilege as be or shall be grant to the native on their submit themselves to the condition impose upon the native the bill so introduce and report provide that any act commit in any state or territory of the united states in violation of the right of a citizen or subject of a foreign country secure to such citizen or subject by treaty between the united states and such foreign country and constitute a crime under the law of the state or territory shall constitute a like crime against the united states and be cognizable in the federal court no action be take by congress in the matter i earnestly recommend that the subject be take tip anew and act upon during the present session the necessity for some such provision abundantly appear precedent for constitute a federal jurisdiction in criminal case where alien be sufferer be rationally deducible from the exist statute which give to the district and circuit court of the united states jurisdiction of civil suit bring by alien where the amount involve exceed a certain sum if such jealous solicitude be show for alien right in case of mere]y civil and pecuniary import how much great should be the public duty to take cognizance of matter affect the life and the right of alien tinder the settle principle of international law no less than under treaty stipulation in case of such transcendent wrong do as mob murder especially when experience have show that local justice be too often helpless to punish the offender after many year of endeavor on the part of this government to that end the italian government have consent to enter into negotiation for a naturalization convention have for one of its object the regulation of the status of italians except those of an age for active military service who having be naturalize in the united states may revisit italy it be hope that with the mutually conciliatory spirit display a successful conclusion will be reach the treaty of commerce and navigation between the united states and japan on november 22 1894 take effect in accordance with the term of its xixth article on the 17th of july last simultaneously with the enforcement of like treaty with the other power except france whose convention do not go into operation until august 4 the united states be however grant up to that date all the privilege and right accord to french citizen under the old french treaty by this notable conventional reform japan 's position as a fully independent sovereign power be assure control be gain of taxation custom revenue judicial administration coast trade and all other domestic function of government and foreign extra territorial right be renounce comprehensive code of civil and criminal procedure accord to western method public instruction patent and copyright municipal administration include jurisdiction over the former foreign settlement custom tariff and procedure public health and other administrative measure have be proclaim the working of the new system have give rise to no material complaint on the part of the american citizen or interest a circumstance which attest the ripe consideration with which the change have be prepare valuable assistance be render by the japanese authority to the united states transport ship morgan city while strand at kobe permission have be grant to land and pasture army horse at japanese port of call on the way to the philippine islands these kindly evidence of good will are highly appreciated the japanese government have show a lively interest in the proposition of the pacific cable company to add to its project cable line to hawaii guam and the philippines a branch connection with the coast of japan it would be a gratifying consummation be the utility of the contemplated scheme enhance by bring japan and the united states into direct telegraphic relation without repeat the observation of my special message of february 10 1899 concern the necessity of a cable to manila i respectfully invite attention to it i recommend that in case the congress should not take measure to bring about this result by direct action of the government the postmaster general be authorize to invite competitive bid for the establishment of a cable the company make the well responsible bid to be award the contract the successful company to give ample bond to insure the completion of the work within a reasonable time the year have be mark by constant increase in the intimacy of our relation with mexico and in the magnitude of mutually advantageous interchange this government have omit no opportunity to show its strong desire to develop and perpetuate the tie of cordiality now so long

responsibility for the future good government of cuba we have accept a trust the fulfillment of which call for the stern integrity of purpose and the exercise of the high wisdom the new cuba yet to arise from the ashe of the past must need be bind to we by tie of singular intimacy and strength if its endure welfare be to be assure whether those tie shall be organic or conventional the destiny of cuba be in some rightful form and manner irrevocably link with our own but how and how far be for the future to determine in the ripeness of event whatever be the outcome we must see to it that free cuba be a reality not a name a perfect entity not a hasty experiment bearing within itself the element of failure our mission to accomplish which we take up the wager of battle be not to be fulfil by turn adrift any loosely frame commonwealth to face the vicissitude which too often attend weak state whose natural wealth and abundant resource be offset by the incongruity of their political organization and the recur occasion for internal rivalry to sap their strength and dissipate their energy the great blessing which can come to cuba be the restoration of her agricultural and industrial prosperity which will give employment to idle man and re establish the pursuit of peace this be her chief and immediate need on the 19th of august last an order be make for the taking of the census in the island to be complete on the 3oth of november by the treaty of peace the spanish people on the island have until april 11 1900 to elect whether they will remain citizen of spain or

tabulate and we shall proceed to provide for election which will commit the municipal government of the island to the officer elect by the people the experience thus acquire will prove of great value in the formation of a representative convention of the people to draft a constitution and establish a general system of independent government for the island in the meantime and so long as we exercise control over the island the product of cuba should have a market in the united states on as good term and with as favorable rate of duty as be give to the west india islands under treaty of

by the treaty of peace the cuban political prisoner in spanish penal station have be and be be release and return to their home in accordance with article vi of the treaty negotiation be about to be have for define the conventional relation between the two country which fall into abeyance by reason of the war i trust that these will include a favorable arrangement for commercial reciprocity under the term of section 3 and 4 of the current tariff act in these as in all matter of international concern no effort will be spare to respond to the good disposition of spain and to cultivate in all practicable way the intimacy which should prevail between two nation whose past history have so often and in so many way be mark by sincere friendship and by community of interest i would recommend appropriate legislation in order to carry into execution article vii of the treaty of peace with spain by which the united states assure the payment of certain claim for indemnity of its citizen against spain the united states minister to turkey continue under instruction to press for a money payment in satisfaction of the just claim for injury suffer by american citizen in the disorder of several year past and for wrong do to they by the ottoman authority some of these claim be of many year standing this government be hopeful of a general agreement in this regard in the turkish empire the situation of our citizen remain unsatisfactory our effort during nearly forty year to bring about a convention of naturalization seem to be on the brink of final failure through the announce policy of the ottoman porte to refuse recognition of the alien status of native turkish subject naturalize abroad since 1867 our statute do not allow this government to admit any distinction between the treatment of native and naturalize americans abroad so that ceaseless controversy arise in case where person owe in the eye of international law a dual allegiance be prevent from enter turkey or be expel after entrance our law in this regard contrast with that of the european states the british act for instance do not claim effect for the naturalization of an alien in the event of his return to his native country unless the change be recognize by the law of that country or stipulate by treaty between it and the naturalize state the arbitrary treatment in some instance of american production in turkey have attract attention of late notably in regard to our flour large shipment by the recently open direct steamship line to turkish port have be deny entrance on the score that although of standard composition and unquestioned purity the flour be pernicious to health because of deficient elasticity as indicate by antiquated and untrustworthy test upon due protest by the american minister and it appear that the act be a virtual discrimination against our product the shipment in question be admit in these as in all instance wherever occur when american product may be subject in a foreign country upon specious pretext to discrimination compare with the like product of another country this government will use its earnest effort to secure fair and equal treatment for its citizen and their good fail this it will not hesitate to apply whatever corrective may be provide by the statute the international commission of arbitration appoint under the anglo venezuelan treaty of 1897 render an award on october 3 last whereby the boundary line between venezuela and british guiana be determine thus end a controversy which have exist for the great part of the century the award as to which the arbitrator be unanimous while not meet the extreme contention of either party give to great britain a large share of the interior territory in dispute and to venezuela the entire mouth of the orinoco include barima point and the caribbean littoral for some distance to the eastward the decision appear to be equally satisfactory to both party venezuela have once more undergone a revolution the insurgent under general castro after a sanguinary engagement in which they suffer much loss rally in the mountainous interior and advance toward the capital the bulk of the army having side with the movement president andrade quit caracas where general castro set up a provisional government with which our minister and the representative of other power enter into diplomatic relation on the 20th of november 1899.the fourth section of the tariff act approve july 24 x897 appear to provide only for commercial treaty which should be enter into by the president and also ratify by the senate within two year from its passage owe to delay inevitable in negotiation of this nature none of the treaty initiate under that section could be conclude in time for ratification by the senate prior to its adjournment on the 4th of march last some of the pende negotiation however be near conclusion at that time and the result convention have since be sign by the plenipotentiary other within both the third and fourth section of the act be still under consideration act under the constitutional power of the executive in respect to treaty i have deem it my duty while observe the limitation of concession provide by the fourth section to bring to a conclusion all pende negotiation and submit they to the senate for its advice and consent convention of reciprocity have be sign during the congressional recess with great britain for the respective colony of british guiana barbados bermuda jamaica and turks and caicos islands and with the republic of nicaragua important reciprocal convention have also be conclude with france and with the argentine republic in my last annual message the progress note in the work of the diplomatic and consular officer in collect information as to the industry and commerce of other country and in the care and promptitude with which their report be print and distribute have continue during the past year with increasingly valuable result in suggest new source of demand for american product and in point out the obstacle still to be overcome in facilitate the remarkable expansion of our foreign trade it will doubtless be gratify to congress to learn that the various agency of the department of state be co operate in these endeavor with a zeal and effectiveness which be not only receive the cordial recognition of our business interest but be exciting the emulation of other government in any rearrangement of the great and complicated work of obtain official datum of an economic character which congress may undertake it be most important in my judgment that the result already secure by the effort of the department of state should be carefully consider with a view to a judicious development and increase utility to our export trade the interest take by the various states form the international union of american republics in the work of its organic bureau be evidence by the fact that for the first time since its creation in i8go all the republics of south and central america be now represent in it the unanimous recommendation of the international american conference provide for the international union of american republics state that it should continue in force during a term of ten year from the date of its organization and no country become a member of the union should cease to be a member until the end of say period of ten year and unless twelve month before the expiration of say period a majority of the member of the union have give to the secretary of state of the united states official notice of their wish to terminate the union at the end of its first period that the union should continue to be maintain for another period of ten year and thereafter under the same condition for successive period of ten year each the period for notification expire on july 14 1899 without any of the member having give the necessary notice of withdrawal its maintenance be therefore assure for the next ten year in view of this fact and of the numerous question of general interest and common benefit to all of the republics of america some of which be consider by the first international american conference but not finally settle and other which have since then grow to importance it would seem expedient that the various republic constitute the union should be invite to hold at an early date another conference in the capital of one of the country other than the united states which have already enjoy this honor the purely international character of the work be do by the bureau and the appreciation of its value be far emphasize by the active co operation which the various government of the latin american republics and their diplomatic representative in this capital be now exhibit and the zealous endeavor they be make to extend its field of usefulness to promote through it commercial intercourse and strengthen the bond of amity and confidence between its various member and the nation of this continent the act to encourage the holding of the pan amencan exposition on the niagara frontier within the county of erie or niagara in the state of new york

american republics and most of the states of the united states that these country and states will make an unique interesting and instructive exhibit peculiarly illustrative of their material progress during the century which be about to close the law provide an appropriation of $ 500,000 for the purpose of make an exhibit at the exposition by the government of the united states from its executive departments and from the smithsonian institution and national museum the united states commission of fish and fishery the department of labor and the bureau of the american republics to secure a

keeping of the article and material to be exhibit this board have be organize and have already enter upon the performance of its duty as provide for by the lawi have every reason to hope and believe that this exposition will tend more firmly to cement the cordial relation between the nation on this continent in accordance with an act of congress approve december 21 1898 and under the auspex of the philadelphia commercial museum a most interesting and valuable exposition of product and manufacture especially adapt to export trade be hold in philadelphia from the 14th of september to the 1st

the steady growth of our enlarged exportation of manufactured good which have be the most remarkable fact in the economic development of the united states in recent year a feature of this exposition which be likely to become of permanent and increase utility to our industry be the collection of sample of merchandise produce in various country with special reference to particular market provide practical object lesson to united states manufacturer as to quality style and price of good such as meet the special demand of consumer and may be export with advantage in connection with the

possess while earnestly promote the idea of establish a permanent international tribunal the delegation of the united states be not unmindful of the inconvenience which might arise from an obtrusive

situation their willing sacrifice for their country and the integrity and ability with which they have perform unusual and difficult duty in our island possession in the organization of the volunteer regiment authorize by the act of march 2 1899 it be find that no provision have be make for chaplain this omission be doubtless from inadvertence i recommend the early authorization for the appointment of one chaplain for each of say regiment these regiment be now in the philippines and it be important that immediate action be have in restore peaceful condition orderly rule and civic progress in cuba puerto rico and so far as practicable in the philippines the rehabilitation of the postal service have be an essential and important part of the work it become necessary to provide mail facility both for our force of occupation and for the native population to meet this requirement have involve a substantial reconstruction the exist system be so fragmentary defective and inadequate that a new and comprehensive organization have to be create american train official have be assign to the directing and executive position while native have be chiefly employ in make up the body of the force in work out this plan the merit rule have be rigorously and faithfully apply the appointment of director general of posts of cuba be give to an expert who have be chief post office inspector and assistant postmaster general and who unite large experience with administrative capacity for the postmastership at havana the range of skilled and available man be scan and the choice fall upon one who have be twenty year in the service as deputy postmaster and postmaster of a large city this principle govern and determine the selection of the american official send not only to cuba but to puerto rico and the philippines and they be instruct to apply it so far as practicable in the employment of the native as minor postmaster and clerk the postal system in cuba though remain under the general guidance of the postmaster general be make essentially independent it be feel that it should not be a burden upon the postal service of the united states and provision be make that any deficit in the postal revenue should be a charge upon the general revenue of the island though puerto rico and the philippines hold a different relation to the united states yet for convenience of administration the same principle of an autonomous system have be extend to they the development of the service in all of the island have be rapid and successful it have move forward on american line with free delivery money order and registry system and have give the people mail facility far great and more reliable than any they have ever before enjoy it be thus not only a vital agency of industrial social and business progress but an important influence in diffuse a just understanding of the true spirit and character of american administration the domestic postal service continue to grow with extraordinary rapidity the expenditure and the revenue will each exceed $ 100,000,000 during the current year fortunately since the revival of prosperous time the revenue have grow much fast than the expenditure and there be every indication that a short period will witness the obliteration of the annual deficit in this connection the report of the postmaster general embody a statement of some evil which have grow up outside of the contemplation of law in the treatment of some class of mail matter which wrongly exercise the privilege of the pound rate and show that if this matter have be properly classify and have pay the rate which it should have pay instead of a postal deficit for the last fiscal year of $ 6,610,000 there would have be on one basis a surplus of $ 17,637,570 and on another of $ 5,733,836 the reform thus suggest in the opinion of the postmaster general would not only put the postal service at once on a self sustain basis but would permit great and valuable improvement and i commend the subject to the consideration of the congress the navy have maintain the spirit and high efficiency which have always characterize that service and have lose none of the gallantry in heroic action which have signalize its brilliant and glorious past the nation have equal pride in its early and later achievement its habitual readiness for every emergency have win the confidence and admiration of the country the people be interested in the continue preparation and prestige of the navy and will justify liberal appropriation for its maintenance and improvement the officer have show peculiar adaptation for the performance of new and delicate duty which our recent war have impose it can not be doubt that congress will at once make necessary provision for the armor plate for the vessel now under contract and building its attention be respectfully call to the report of the secretary of the navy in which the subject be fully present i unite in his recommendation that the congress enact such special legislation as may be necessary to enable the department to make contract early in the come year for armor of the good quality that can be obtain in this country for the maine ohio and missouri and that the provision of the act of march 3 1899 limit the price of armor to $ 300 per ton be remove in the matter of naval construction italy and japan of the great power lay down less tonnage in the year 1899 than this country and italy alone have less tonnage under construction i heartily concur in the recommendation for the increase of the navy as suggest by the secretary our future progress and prosperity depend upon our ability to equal if not surpass other nation in the enlargement and advance of science industry and commerce to invention we must turn as one of the most powerful aid to the accomplishment of such a result the attention of the congress be direct to the report of the commissioner of patents in which will be find valuable suggestion and recommendation on the 30th of june 1899 the pension roll of the united states number 991,519 these include the pensioner of the army and navy in all our war the number add to the roll during the year be 40,991 the number drop by reason of death remarriage minor by legal limitation failure to claim within three year and other cause be 43 186 and the number of claim disallow be 107,gig during the year 89,054 pension certificate be issue of which 37,077 be for new or original pension the amount disburse for army and navy pension during the year be $ 138,355,052.95 which be $ 1,651,461.61 less than the sum of the appropriation the grand army of the republic at its recent national encampment hold in philadelphia have bring to my attention and to that of the congress the wisdom and justice of a modification of the third section of the act of june 27 x8go which provide pension for the widow of officer and enlisted man who serve ninety day or more during the war of the rebellion and be honorably discharge provide that such widow be without other mean of sup port than their daily labor and be married to the soldier sailor or marine on account of whose service they claim pension prior to the date of the act the present holding of the department be that if the widow 's income aside from her daily labor do not exceed in amount what her pension would be to wit $ 96 per annum she would be deem to be without other mean of support than her daily labor and would be entitle to a pension under this act while if the widow 's income independent of the amount receive by she as the result of her daily labor exceed $ 96 she would not be pensionable under the act i be advise by the commissioner of pensions that the amount of the income allow before title to pension would be bar have vary widely under different administration of the pension office as well as during different period of the same administration and have be the cause of just complaint and criticism with the approval of the secretary of the interior the commissioner of pensions recommend that in order to make the practice at all time uniform and to do justice to the dependent widow the amount of income allow independent of the proceed of her daily labor should be not less than $ 250 per annum and he urge that the congress shall so amend the act as to permit the pension office to grant

the island be cede by the government of spain which have be in undisputed possession of they for century they be accept not merely by our authorize commissioner in paris under the direction of the executive but by the constitutional and well consider action of the representative of the people of the united states in both houses of congress i have every reason to believe and i still believe that this transfer of sovereignty be in accordance with the wish and the aspiration of the great mass of the filipino people from the early moment no opportunity be lose of assure the people of the island of our ardent desire for their welfare and of the intention of this government to do everything possible to advance their interest in my order of the 19th of may 1898 the commander of the military

there should be no conflict with the insurgent on the 1st day of january 1899 urgent order be reiterate that the kindly intention of this government should be in every possible way communicate to the insurgent on the 21st of january i announce my intention of dispatch to manila a commission compose of three gentleman of the high character and distinction thoroughly acquaint with the orient who in association with admiral dewey and major general otis be instruct to facilitate the most humane and effective extension of authority throughout the island and to secure with the least possible delay the benefit of a wise and generous protection of life and property to the inhabitant these gentleman be dr. jacob gould schurman president of cornell university the hon charles denby for many year minister to china and prof. dean c. worcester of the university of michigan who have make a most careful study of life in the philippines while the treaty of peace be under consideration in the senate these commissioners set out on their mission of good will and liberation their character be a sufficient guaranty of the beneficent purpose with which they go even if they have not bear the positive instruction of this government which make their errand pre eminently one of peace and friendship but before their arrival at manila the sinister ambition of a few leader of the filipinos have create a situation full of embarrassment for we and most grievous in its consequence to themselves the clear and impartial preliminary report of the commissioners which i transmit herewith give so lucid and comprehensive a history of the present insurrectionary movement that the story need not be here repeat it be enough to say that the claim of the rebel leader that he be promise independence by an officer of the united states in return for his assistance have no foundation in fact and be categorically deny by the very witness who be call to prove it the most the insurgent leader hope for when he come back to manila be the liberation of the island from the spanish control which they have be labor for year without success to throw off the prompt accomplishment of this work by the american army and navy give he other idea and ambition and insidious suggestion from various quarter pervert the purpose and intention with which he have take up arm no soon have our army capture manila than the filipino force begin to assume an attitude of suspicion and hostility which the utmost effort of our officer and troop be unable to disarm or modify their kindness and forbearance be take as a proof of cowardice the aggression of the filipinos continually increase until finally just before the time set by the senate of the united states for a vote upon the treaty an attack evidently prepare in advance be make all along the american line which result in a terribly destructive and sanguinary repulse of the insurgent ten day later an order of the insurgent government be issue to its adherent who have remain in manila of which general otis justly observe that for barbarous intent it be unequaled in modern time it direct that at 8 o'clock on the night of the 15th of february the territorial militia shall come together in the street of san pedro arm with their bolo with gun and ammunition where convenient that filipino family only shall be respect but that all other individual of whatever race they maybe shall be exterminate without any compassion after the extermination of the army of occupation and add brother we must avenge ourselves on the americans and exterminate they that we may take our revenge for the infamy and treachery which they have commit upon we have no compassion upon they attack with vigor a copy of this fall by good fortune into the hand of our officer and they be able to take measure to control the rising which be actually attempt on the night of february 22 a week later than be originally contemplate considerable number of armed insurgent enter the city by waterway and swamp and in concert with confederate inside attempt to destroy manila by fire they be keep in check during the night and the next day drive out of the city with heavy loss this be the unhappy condition of affair which confront our commissioners on their arrival in manila they have come with the hope and intention of co operate with admiral dewey and major general otis in establish peace and order in the archipelago and the large measure of self government compatible with the true welfare of the people what they actually find can well be set forth in their own word deplorable as war be the one in which we be now engage be unavoidable by we we be attack by a bold adventurous and enthusiastic army no alternative be leave to we except ignominious retreat it be not to be conceive of that any american would have sanction the surrender of manila to the insurgent our obligation to other nation and to the friendly filipinos and to ourselves and our flag demand that force should be meet by force whatever the future of the philippines may be there be no course open to we now except the prosecution of the war until the insurgent be reduce to submission the commission be of the opinion that there have be no time since the destruction of the spanish squadron by admiral dewey when it be possible to withdraw our force from the island either with honor to ourselves or with safety to the inhabitant the course thus clearly indicate have be unflinchingly pursue the rebellion must be put down civil government can not be thoroughly establish until order be restore with a devotion and gallantry worthy of its most brilliant history the army ably and loyally assist by the navy have carry on this unwelcome but most righteous campaign with richly deserve success the noble self sacrifice with which our soldier and sailor whose term of service have expire refuse to avail themselves of their right to return home as long as they be need at the front form one of the bright page in our annal although their operation have be somewhat interrupted and check by a rainy season of unusual violence and duration they have gain ground steadily in every direction and now look forward confidently to a speedy completion of their task the unfavorable circumstance connect with an active campaign have not be permit to interfere with the equally important work of reconstruction again i invite your attention to the report of the commissioners for the interesting and encourage detail of the work already accomplish in the establishment of peace and order and the inauguration of self govern municipal life in many portion of the archipelago a notable beginning have be make in the establishment of a government in the island of negros which be deserve of special consideration this be the first island to accept american sovereignty its people unreservedly proclaim allegiance to the united states and adopt a constitution look to the establishment of a popular government it be impossible to guarantee to the people of negros that the constitution so adopt should be the ultimate form of government such a question under the treaty with spain and in accordance with our own constitution and law come exclusively within the jurisdiction of the congress the government actually set up by the inhabitant of negros eventually prove unsatisfactory to the native themselves a new system be put into force by order of the major general commanding the department of which the follow be the most important element it be order that the government of the island of

in the archipelago of jolo shall have the right to purchase freedom by pay to the master the usual market value the agreement by general bates be make subject to confirmation by the president and to future modification by the consent of the party in interest i have confirm say agreement subject to the action of the congress and with the reservation which i have direct shall be communicate to the

the congress for its information and action everything indicate that with the speedy suppression of the tagalo rebellion life in the archipelago will soon resume its ordinary course under the protection of our sovereignty and the people of those favor island will enjoy a prosperity and a freedom which they have never before know already hundred of school be open and fill with child religious freedom be sacredly assure and enjoy the court be dispense justice business be begin to circulate in its accustomed channel manila whose inhabitant be flee to the country a few month ago be now a populous and thriving mart of commerce the earnest and unremitting endeavor of the commission and the admiral and major general commanding the department of the pacific to assure the people of the beneficent intention of this government have have their legitimate effect in convince the great mass of they that peace and safety and prosperity and stable government can only be find in a loyal acceptance of the authority of the united states the future government of the philippines rest with the congress of the united states few graver responsibility have ever be confide to we if we accept they in a spirit worthy of our race and our tradition a great opportunity come with they the island lie under the shelter of our flag they be our by every title of law and equity they can not be abandon if we desert they we leave they at once to anarchy and finally to barbarism we fle they a golden apple of discord among the rival power no one of which could permit another to seize they unquestioned their rich plain and valley would be the scene of endless strife and bloodshed the advent of dewey 's fleet in manila bay instead of be as we tope the dawn of a new day of freedom and progress will have be the beginning of an era of misery and violence bad than any which have darken their unhappy past the suggestion have be make that we could renounce our authority over the island and give they independence could retain a protectorate over they this proposition will not be find i be sure worthy of your serious attention such an arrangement would involve at the outset a cruel breach of faith it would place the peaceable and loyal majority who ask nothing well than to accept our authority at the mercy of the minority of armed insurgent it would make we responsible for the act of the insurgent leader and give we no power to control they it would charge we with the task of protect they against each other and defend they against any foreign power with which they choose to quarrel in short it would take from the congress of the united states the power of declare war and vest that tremendous prerogative in the tagal leader of the hour it do not seem desirable that i should recommend at this time a specific and final form of government for these island when peace shall be restore it will be the duty of congress to construct a plan of government which shall establish and maintain freedom and order and peace in the philippines the insurrection be still exist and when it terminate further information will be require as to the actual condition of affair before inaugurate a permanent scheme of civil government the full report of the commission now in preparation will contain information and suggestion which will be of value to congress and which i will transmit as soon as it be complete as long as the insurrection continue the military arm must necessarily be supreme but there be no reason why step should not be take from time to time to inaugurate government essentially popular in their form as fast as territory be hold and con troll by our troop to this end i be consider the advisability of the return of the commission or such of the member thereof as can be secure to aid the exist authority and facilitate this work throughout the island i have believe that reconstruction should not begin by the establishment of one central civil government for all the island with its seat at manila but rather that the work should be commence by build up from the bottom first establish municipal government and then provincial government a central government at last to follow until congress shall have make known the formal expression of its will i shall use the authority vest in i by the constitution and the statute to uphold the sovereignty of the united states in those distant island as in all other place where our flag rightfully float i shall put at the disposal of the army and navy all the mean which the liberality of congress and the people have provide to cause this unprovoked and wasteful insurrection to cease if any order of mine be require to insure the merciful conduct of military and naval operation they would not be lack but every step of the progress of our troop have be mark by q humanity which have surprise even the misguided insurgent the true kindness to they will be a swift and effective defeat of their present leader the hour of victory will be the hour of clemency and reconstruction no effort will be spare to build up the waste place desolate by war and by long year of misgovernment we shall not wait for the end of strife to begin the beneficent work we shall continue as we have begin to open the school and the church to set the court in operation to foster industry and trade and agriculture and in every way in our power to make these people whom providence have bring within our jurisdiction feel that it be their liberty and not our power their welfare and not our gain we be seek to enhance our flag have never wave over any community but in blessing i believe the filipinos will soon recognize the fact that it have not lose its gift of benediction in its world wide journey to their shore some embarrassment in administration have occur by reason of the peculiar status which the hawaiian islands at present occupy under the joint resolution of annexation approve july 7 1898 while by that resolution the republic of hawaii as an independent nation be extinguish its separate sovereignty destroy and its property and possession vest in the united states yet a complete establishment for its government under our system be not effect while the municipal law of the island not enact for the fulfillment of treaty and not inconsistent with the joint resolution or contrary to the constitution of the united state or any of its treaty remain in force yet these law relate only to the social and internal affair of the island and do not touch many subject of importance which be of a broad national character for example the hawaiian republic be divest of all title to the public land in the island and be not only unable to dispose of land to settler desire to take up homestead site but be without power to give complete title in case where land have be enter upon under lease or other condition which carry with they the right to the purchaser lessee or settler to have a full title grant to he upon compliance with the condition prescribe by law or by his particular agreement of entry question of doubt and difficulty have also arise with reference to the collection of tonnage tax on vessel come from hawaiian port with reference to the status of chinese in the island their entrance and exit there from as to patent and copyright as to the register of vessel under the navigation law as to the necessity of hold election in accordance with the provision of the hawaiian statute for the choice of various officer and as to several other matter of detail touch the interest both of the island and of the federal government by the resolution of annexation the president be direct to appoint five commissioner to recommend to congress such legislation concern the island as they should deem necessary or proper these commissioner be duly appoint and after a careful investigation and study of the system of law and government prevail in the island and of the condition exist there they prepare a bill to provide a government under the title of the territory of hawaii the report of the commission with the bill which they prepare be transmit by i to congress on december 6 1898 but the bill still await final action the people of these island be entitle to the benefit and privilege of our constitution but in the absence of any act of congress provide for federal court in the island and for a procedure by which appeal writ of error and other judicial proceeding necessary for the enforcement of civil right may be prosecute they be powerless to secure their enforcement by the judgment of the court of the united states it be manifestly important therefore that an act shall be pass as speedily as possible erect these island into a judicial district provide for the appointment of a judge and other proper officer and method of procedure in appellate proceeding and that the government of this newly acquire territory under the federal constitution shall be fully define and provide for a necessity for immediate legislative relief exist in the territory of alaska substantially the only law provide a civil government for this territory be the act of may 17 1884 this be meager in its provision and be fit only for the administration of affair in a country sparsely inhabit by civilized people and unimportant in trade and production as be alaska at the time this act be pass the increase in population by immigration during the past few year consequent upon the discovery of gold have produce such a condition as call for more ample facility for local self government and more numerous convenience of civil and judicial administration settlement have grow up in various place constitute in point of population and business city of thousand of inhabitant yet there be no provision of law under which a municipality can be organize or maintain in some locality the inhabitant have meet together and voluntarily form a municipal organization for the purpose of local government adopt the form of a municipal constitution and charter under which say official have be appoint and ordinance create and regulate a police force a fire department a department of health and make provision for the care of the insane and indigent poor and sick and for public school have be pass these proceeding and the ordinance pass by such municipality be without statutory authority and have no sanction except as they be maintain by the popular sentiment of the community there be an entire absence of authority to provide the ordinary instrument of local police control and administration the population consist of the usual percentage of lawless adventurer of the class that always flock to new field of enterprise or discovery and under circumstance which require more than ordinary provision for the maintenance of peace good order and lawful conduct the whole vast area of alaska comprise but one judicial district with one judge one marshal and one district attorney yet the civil and criminal business have more than double within the past year and be many time great both in volume and importance than it be in 1884 the duty of the judge require he to travel thousand of mile to discharge his judicial duty at the various place designate for that purpose the territory should be divide into at least two district and an additional judge district attorney marshal and other appropriate officer be provide there be practically no organized form of government in the territory there be no authority except in congress to pass any law no matter how local or trivial and the difficulty of convey to the congress an adequate conception and understanding of the various need of the people in the different community be easily understand i see no reason why a more complete form of territorial organization should not be provide follow the precedent establish in the year 1805 when a temporary government be provide for the recently acquire territory then know under the name of louisiana it seem to i that it would be advantageous to confer great executive power upon the governor and to establish as be do in the case of the territory of louisiana a legislative council have power to adopt ordinance which shall extend to all the rightful subject of local legislation such ordinance not to take effect until report to and approve by the congress if in session and if that body be not in session then by the president in this manner a system of law provide for the incorporation and government of town and city have a certain population give they the power to establish and maintain a system of education to be locally support and ordinance provide for police sanitary and other such purpose could be speedily provide i believe a provision of this kind would be satisfactory to the people of the territory it be probable that the area be too vast and the population too scatter and transitory to make it wise at the present time to provide for an elective legislative body but the condition call for local self government will undoubtedly very soon exist and will be facilitate by the measure which i have recommend i recommend that legislation to the same end be have with reference to the government of puerto rico the time be ripe for the adoption of a temporary form of government for this island and many suggestion make with reference to alaska be applicable also to puerto rico the system of civil jurisprudence now adopt by the people of this island be describe by competent lawyer who be familiar with it as thoroughly modern and scientific so far as it relate to matter of internal business trade production and social and private right in general the city of the island be govern under charter which probably require very little or no change so that with relation to matter of local concern and private right it be not probable that much if any legislation be desirable but with reference to public administration and the relation of the island to the federal government there be many matter which be of press urgency the same necessity exist for legislation on the part of congress to establish federal court and federal jurisdiction in the island as have be previously point out by i with reference to hawaii besides the administration of justice there be the subject of the public land the control and improvement of river and harbor the control of the water or stream not navigable which under the spanish law belong to the crown of spain and have by the treaty of cession pass to the united states the immigration of people from foreign country the importation of contract labor the imposition and collection of internal revenue the application of the navigation law the regulation of the current money the establishment of post office and post road the regulation of tariff rate on merchandise import from the island into the united states the establishment of port of entry and delivery the regulation of patent and copyright these with various other subject which rest entirely within the power of the congress call for careful consideration and immediate action it must be bear in mind that since the cession puerto rico have be deny the principal market she have long enjoy and our tariff have be continue against her product as when she be under spanish sovereignty the market of spain be close to her product except upon term to which the commerce of all nation be subject the island of cuba which use to buy her cattle and tobacco without custom duty now impose the same duty upon those product as from any other country enter her port she have therefore lose her free intercourse with spain and cuba without any compensating benefit in this market her coffee be little known and not in use by our people and therefore there be no demand here for this one of her chief product the market of the united states should be open up to her product our plain duty be to abolish all custom tariff between the united states and puerto rico and give her product free access to our market as a result of the hurricane which sweep over puerto rico on the 8th of august 1899 over 100,000 people be reduce to absolute destitution without home and deprive of the necessary of life to the appeal of the war department the people of the united states make prompt and generous response in addition to the private charity of our people the war department have expend for the relief of the distressed $ 392,342.63 which do not include the cost of transportation it be desirable that the government of the island under the law of belligerent right now maintain through the executive department should be supersede by an administration entirely civil in its nature for present purpose i recommend that congress pass a law for the organization of a temporary government which shall provide for the appointment by the president subject to confirmation by the senate of a governor and such other officer as the general ad ministration of the island may require and that for legislative purpose upon subject of a local nature not partake of a federal character a legislative council compose partly of puerto ricans and partly of citizen of the united states shall be nominate and appoint by the president subject to confirmation by the senate their act to be subject to the approval of the congress or the president prior to go into effect in the municipality and other local subdivision i recommend that the principle of local self government be apply at once so as to enable the intelligent citizen of the island to participate in their own government and to learn by practical experience the duty and requirement of a self contain and self govern people i have not think it wise to commit the entire government of the island to officer select by the people because i doubt whether in habit training and experience they be such as to fit they to exercise at once so large a degree of self government but it be my judgment and expectation that they will soon arrive at an attainment of experience and wisdom and self control that will justify confer upon they a much large participation in the choice of their insular officer the fundamental requirement for these people as for all people be education the free schoolhouse be the good preceptor for citizenship in the introduction of modern educational method care however must be exercise that change be not make too abruptly and that the history and racial peculiarity of the inhabitant shall be give due weight system of education in these new possession found upon common sense method adapt to exist condition and look to the future moral and industrial advancement of the people will commend to they in a peculiarly effective manner the blessing of free government the love of law and the sense of obedience and submission to the lawfully constitute judicial tribunal be embed in the heart of our people and any violation of these sentiment and disregard of their obligation justly arouse public condemnation the guaranty of life liberty and of civil right should be faithfully uphold the right of trial by jury respect and defend the rule of the court should assure the public of the prompt trial of those charge with criminal offense and upon conviction the punishment should be commensurate with the enormity of the crime those who in disregard of law and the public peace unwilling to await the judgment of court and jury constitute themselves judge and executioner should not escape the severe penalty for their crime what i say in my inaugural address of march 4 1897 i now repeat the constituted authority must be cheerfully and vigorously uphold lynching must not be tolerate in a great and civilized country like the united states court not mob must execute the penalty of the law the preservation of public order the right of discussion the integrity of court and
