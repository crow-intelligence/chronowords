 in 1992 we just have a roadmap today we have result

 even more important america again have the confidence to dream big dream but we must not let this confidence drift into complacency for we all of we will be judge by the dream and deed we pass on to our child and on that score we will be hold to a high standard indeed because our chance to do good be so great

 my fellow americans we have cross the bridge we build to the 21st century now we must shape a 21st century american revolution of opportunity responsibility and community we must be now as we be in the beginning a new nation

 at the dawn of the last century theodore roosevelt say the one characteristic more essential than any other be foresight it should be the grow nation with a future that take the long look ahead so tonight let we take our long look ahead and set great goal for our nation

 to 21st century america let we pledge these thing every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed every family will be able to succeed at home and at work and no child will be raise in poverty we will meet the challenge of the aging of america we will assure quality affordable health care at last for all americans we will make america the safe big country on earth we will pay off our national debt for the first time since 1835 we will bring prosperity to every american community we will reverse the course of climate change and leave a safe clean planet america will lead the world toward share peace and prosperity and the far frontier of science and technology and we will become at last what our founder pledge we to be so long ago

 white house correction

 one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all

 these be great goal worthy of a great nation we will not reach they all this year not even in this decade but we will reach they let we remember that the first american revolution be not win with a single shot the continent be not settle in a single year the lesson of our history and the lesson of the last seven year be that great goal be reach step by step always build on our progress always gain ground

 of course you can not gain ground if you ’re stand still and for too long this congress have be stand still on some of our most pressing national priority so let ’s begin tonight with they

 again i ask you to pass a real patient bill of rights i ask you to pass common sense gun safety legislation i ask you to pass campaign finance reform i ask you to vote up or down on judicial nomination and other important appointee and again i ask you i implore you to raise the minimum wage

 now two year ago let i try to balance the seesaw here—[laughter]—two year ago as we reach across party line to reach our first balanced budget i ask that we meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintain our fiscal discipline because we refuse to stray from that path we be do something that would have seem unimaginable seven year ago we be actually pay down the national debt now if we stay on this path we can pay down the debt entirely in just 13 year now and make america debt free for the first time since andrew jackson be president in 1835

 in 1993 we begin to put our fiscal house in order with the deficit reduction act which you ’ll all remember win passage in both houses by just a single vote your former colleague my first secretary of the treasury lead that effort and spark our long boom he ’ here with we tonight lloyd bentsen you have serve america well and we thank you

 beyond pay off the debt we must ensure that the benefit of debt reduction go to preserve two of the most important guarantee we make to every american social security and medicare tonight i ask you to work with i to make a bipartisan downpayment on social security reform by credit the interest saving from debt reduction to the social security trust

 fund so that it will be strong and sound for the next 50 year

 but this be just the start of our journey we must also take the right step toward reach our great goal first and foremost we need a 21st century revolution in education guide by our faith that every single child can learn because education be more important than ever more than ever the key to our child ’s future we must make sure all our child have that key that mean quality preschool and after school the well train teacher in the classroom and college opportunity for all our child

 for seven year now we ’ve work hard to improve our school with opportunity and responsibility invest more but demand more in turn reading math college entrance score be up some of the most impressive gain be in school in very poor neighborhood

 but all successful school have follow the same proven formula high standard more accountability and extra help so child who need it can get it to reach those standard i have send congress a reform plan base on that formula it hold state and school district accountable for progress and reward they for result each year our national government invest more than $ 15 billion in our school it be time to support what work and stop support what do n’t

 now as we demand more from our school we should also invest more in our school let ’s double our investment to help state and district turn around their bad perform school or shut they down let ’s double our investment in after school and summer school program which boost achievement and keep people off the street and out of trouble if we do this we can give every single child in every fail school in america everyone the chance to meet high standard

 since 1993 we ’ve nearly double our investment in head start and improve its quality tonight i ask you for another $ 1 billion for head start the large increase in the history of the program

 we know that child learn good in small class with good teacher for two year in a row congress have support my plan to hire 100,000 new qualified teacher to low class size in the early grade i thank you for that and i ask you to make it three in a row and to make sure all teacher know the subject they teach tonight i propose a new teacher quality initiative to recruit more talented people into the classroom reward good teacher for stay there and give all teacher the training they need

 we know charter school provide real public school choice when i become president there be just one independent public charter school in all america today thank to you there be 1,700 i ask you now to help we meet our goal of 3,000 charter school by next year

 we know we must connect all our classroom to the internet and we ’re get there in 1994 only 3 percent of our classroom be connect today with the help of the vice president ’s e rate program more than half of they be and 90 percent of our school have at least one internet connection but we can not finish the job when a third of all our school be in serious disrepair many of they have wall and wire so old they ’re too old for the internet so tonight i propose to help 5,000 school a year make immediate and urgent repair and again to help build or modernize 6,000 more to get student out of trailer and into high tech classroom

 i ask all of you to help i double our bipartisan gear up program which provide mentor for disadvantaged young people if we double it we can provide mentor for 1.4 million of they let ’s also offer these kid from disadvantaged background the same chance to take the same college test prep course wealthy student use to boost their test score

 to make the american dream achievable for all we must make college affordable for all for seven year on a bipartisan basis we have take action toward that goal large pell grants more affordable student loan education ira and our hope scholarship which have already benefit five million young people

 now 67 percent of high school graduate be go on to college that ’ up 10 percent since 1993 yet million of family still strain to pay college tuition they need help so i propose a landmark $ 30 billion college opportunity tax cut a middle class tax deduction for up to $ 10,000 in college tuition cost the previous action of this congress have already make two year of college affordable for all it ’ time make four year of college affordable for all if we take all these step we ’ll move a long way toward make sure every child start school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed

 we also need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen family by give every parent the tool to succeed at work and at the most important work of all raise child that mean make sure every family have health care and the support to care for age parent the tool to bring their child up right and that no child grow up in poverty

 from my first day as president we ’ve work to give family well access to well health care in 1997 we pass the children ’s health insurance program chip so that worker who do not have coverage through their employer at least can get it for their child so far we ’ve enrol two million child we ’re well on our way to our goal of five million

 but there be still more than 40 million of our fellow americans without health insurance more than there be in 1993 tonight i propose that we follow vice president gore ’s suggestion to make low income parent eligible for the insurance that cover their child together with our child ’s initiative think of this together with our child ’s initiative this action would enable we to cover nearly a quarter of all the uninsured people in america

 again i want to ask you to let people between the age of 55 and 65 the fast grow group of uninsured buy into medicare and this year i propose to give they a tax credit to make that choice an affordable one i hope you will support that as well

 when the baby boomer retire medicare will be face with care for twice as many of our citizen yet it be far from ready to do so my generation must not ask our child ’s generation to shoulder our burden we simply must act now to strengthen and modernize medicare

 my budget include a comprehensive plan to reform medicare to make it more efficient and more competitive and it dedicate nearly $ 400 billion of our budget surplus to keep medicare solvent past 2025 and at long last it also provide fund to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drug

 lifesaving drug be an indispensable part of modern medicine no one create a medicare program today would even think of exclude coverage for prescription drug yet more than three in five of our senior now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their life million of old americans who need prescription drug the most pay the high price for they in good conscience we can not let another year pass without extend to all our senior this lifeline of affordable prescription drug

 record number of americans be provide for age or ailing love one at home it ’ a love but a difficult and often very expensive choice last year i propose a $ 1,000 tax credit for long term care frankly it be n’t enough this year let ’s triple it to $ 3,000 but this year let ’s pass it

 we also have to make need investment to expand access to mental health care i want to take a moment to thank the person who lead our first white house conference on mental health last year and who for seven year have lead all our effort to break down the barrier to decent treatment of people with mental illness thank you tipper gore

 take together these proposal would mark the large investment in health care in the 35 year since medicare be create the large investment in 35 year that would be a big step toward assure quality health care for all americans young and old and i ask you to embrace they and pass they

 we must also make investment that reward work and support family nothing do that well than the earn income tax credit the eitc the e in the eitc be about earn working take responsibility and be reward for it in my very first address to you i ask congress to greatly expand this credit and you do as a result in 1998 alone the eitc help more than 4.3 million americans work their way out of poverty toward the middle class that ’ double the number in 1993

 tonight i propose another major expansion of the eitc to reduce the marriage penalty to make sure it reward marriage as it reward work and also to expand the tax credit for family that have more than two child it punish people with more than two child today our proposal would allow family with three or more child to get up to $ 1,100 more in tax relief these be work family their child should not be in poverty

 we also can not reward work and family unless man and woman get equal pay for equal work today the female unemployment rate be the low it have be in 46 year yet woman still only earn about 75 cent for every dollar man earn we must do well by provide the resource to enforce present equal pay law train more woman for high pay high tech job and pass the paycheck fairness act

 many work parent spend up to a quarter a quarter of their income on child care last year we help parent provide child care for about two million child my child care initiative before you now along with fund already secure in welfare reform would make child care well safe and more affordable for another 400,000 child i ask you to pass that they need it out there

 for hard press middle income family we should also expand the child care tax credit and i believe strongly we should take the next big step and make that tax credit refundable for low income family for people make under $ 30,000 a year that could mean up to $ 2,400 for child care cost you know we all say we ’re pro work and pro family pass this proposal would prove it

 ten of million of americans live from paycheck to paycheck as hard as they work they still do not have the opportunity to save too few can make use of ira and 401k plan we should do more to help all work family save and accumulate wealth that ’ the idea behind the individual development accounts the ida i ask you to take that idea to a new level with new retirement saving account that enable every low and moderate income family in america to save for retirement a first home a medical emergency or a college education i propose to match their contribution however small dollar for dollar every year they save and i propose to give a major new tax credit to any small business that will provide a meaningful pension to its worker those people ought to have retirement as well as the rest of we

 nearly one in three american child grow up without a father these child be five time more likely to live in poverty than child with both parent at home clearly demand and support responsible fatherhood be critical to lift all our child out of poverty we ’ve double child support collection since 1992 and i ’m propose to you tough new measure to hold still more father responsible

 but we should recognize that a lot of father want to do right by their child but need help to do it carlos rosas of st. paul minnesota want to do right by his son and he get the help to do it now he ’s get a good job and he support his little boy my budget will help 40,000 more father make the same choice carlos rosas do i thank he for be here tonight stand up carlos applause thank you

 if there be any single issue on which we should be able to reach across party line it be in our common commitment to reward work and strengthen family just remember what we do last year we come together to help people with disability keep their health insurance when they go to work and i thank you for that thank to overwhelming bipartisan support from this congress we have improve foster care we ’ve help those young people who leave it when they turn 18 and we have dramatically increase the number of foster care child go into adoptive home i thank all of you for all of that

 of course i be forever grateful to the person who have lead our effort from the beginning and who ’s work so tirelessly for child and family for 30 year now my wife hillary and i thank she

 if we take the step just discuss we can go a long long way toward empower parent to succeed at home and at work and ensure that no child be raise in poverty we can make these vital investment in health care education support for working family and still offer tax cut to help pay for college for retirement to care for age parent to reduce the marriage penalty we can do these thing without forsake the path of fiscal discipline that get we to this point here tonight indeed we must make these investment and these tax cut in the context of a balanced budget that strengthen and extend the life of social security and medicare and pay down the national debt

 crime in america have drop for the past seven year that ’s the long decline on record thank to a national consensus we help to forge on community police sensible gun safety law and effective prevention but nobody nobody here nobody in america believe we ’re safe enough so again i ask you to set a high goal let ’s make this country the safe big country in the world

 last fall congress support my plan to hire in addition to the 100,000 community police we ’ve already fund 50,000 more concentrate in high crime neighborhood i ask your continued support for that

 soon after the columbine tragedy congress consider commonsense gun legislation to require brady background check at the gun show child safety lock for new handgun and a ban on the importation of large capacity ammunition clip with courage and a tie break vote by the vice president—[laughter the senate face down the gun lobby stand up for the american people and pass this legislation but the house fail to follow suit

 now we have all see what happen when gun fall into the wrong hand daniel mauser be only 15 year old when he be gun down at columbine he be an amazing kid a straight a student a good skier like all parent who lose their child his father tom have bear unimaginable grief somehow he have find the strength to honor his son by transform his grief into action early this month he take a leave of absence from his job to fight for tough gun safety law i pray that his courage and wisdom will at long last move this congress to make commonsense gun legislation the very next order of business tom mauser stand up we thank you for be here tonight tom thank you tom applause

 we must strengthen our gun law and enforce those already on the book well federal gun crime prosecution be up 16 percent since i take office but we must do more i propose to hire more federal and local gun prosecutor and more atf agent to crack down on illegal gun trafficker and bad apple dealer and we must give they the enforcement tool that they need tool to trace every gun and every bullet use in every gun crime in the united states i ask you to help we do that

 every state in this country already require hunter and automobile driver to have a license i think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchase now specifically i propose a plan to ensure that all new handgun buyer must first have a photo license from their state show they pass the brady background check and a gun safety course before they get the gun i hope you ’ll help i pass that in this congress

 listen to this listen to this the accidental gun rate the accidental gun death rate of child under 15 in the united states be nine time high than in the other 25 industrialize country combine now technology now exist that could lead to gun that can only be fire by the adult who own they i ask congress to fund research into smart gun technology to save these child ’s life i ask responsible leader in the gun industry to work with we on smart gun and other step to keep gun out of the wrong hand to keep our child safe

 you know every parent i know worry about the impact of violence in the medium on their child i want to begin by thank the entertainment industry for accept my challenge to put voluntary rating on tv program and video and internet game but frankly the rating be too numerous diverse and confuse to be really useful to parent so tonight i ask the industry to accept the first lady ’s challenge to develop a single voluntary rating system for all child ’s entertainment that be easy for parent to understand and enforce

 the step i outline will take we well on our way to make america the safe big country in the world

 now to keep our historic economic expansion go the subject of a lot of discussion in this community and other i believe we need a 21st century revolution to open new market start new business hire new worker right here in america in our inner city poor rural area and native american reservation

 our nation ’s prosperity have not yet reach these place over the last six month i ’ve travel to a lot of they join by many of you and many far sight business people to shine a spotlight on the enormous potential in community from appalachia to the mississippi delta from watts to the pine ridge reservation everywhere i go i meet talented people eager for opportunity and able to work tonight i ask you let ’s put they to work for business it ’ the smart thing to do for america it ’ the right thing to do and let i ask you something if we do n’t do this now when in the wide world will we ever get around to it

 so i ask congress to give business the same incentive to invest in america ’s new market they now have to invest in market overseas tonight i propose a large new market tax credit and other incentive to spur $ 22 billion in private sector capital to create new business and new investment in our inner city and rural area because empowerment zone have be create these opportunity for five year now i also ask you to increase incentive to invest in they and to create more of they

 and let i say to all of you again what i have try to say at every turn this be not a democratic or a republican issue give people a chance to live their dream be an american issue

 mr. speaker it be a powerful moment last november when you join reverend jesse jackson and i in your home state of illinois and commit to work toward our common goal by combine the good idea from both side of the aisle i want to thank you again and to tell you mr. speaker i look forward to work with you this be a worthy joint endeavor thank you

 i also ask you to make special effort to address the area of our nation with the high rate of poverty our native american reservation and the mississippi delta my budget include a $ 110 million initiative to promote economic development in the delta and a billion dollar to increase economic opportunity health care education and law enforcement for our native american community we should begin this new century by honor our historic responsibility to empower the first americans and i want to thank tonight the leader and the member from both party who ’ve express to i an interest in work with we on these effort they be profoundly important

 there ’ another part of our american community in trouble tonight our family farmer when i sign the farm bill in 1996 i say there be great danger it would work well in good time but not in bad well drought flood and historically low price have make these time very bad for the farmer we must work together to strengthen the farm safety net invest in land conservation and create some new market for they by expand our program for bio base fuel and product please they need help let ’s do it together

 opportunity for all require something else today have access to a computer and know how to use it that mean we must close the digital divide between those who ’ve get the tool and those who do n’t connect classroom and library to the internet be crucial but it ’ just a start my budget ensure that all new teacher be train to teach 21st century skill and it create technology center in 1,000 community to serve adult this spring i ’ll invite high tech leader to join i on another new market tour to close the digital divide and open opportunity for our people i want to thank the high tech company that already be do so much in this area i hope the new tax incentive i have propose will get all the rest of they to join we this be a national crusade we have get to do this and do it quickly

 now again i say to you these be step but step by step we can go a long way toward our goal of bring opportunity to every community

 to realize the full possibility of this economy we must reach beyond our own border to shape the revolution that be tear down barrier and build new network among nation and individual and economy and culture globalization it ’ the central reality of our time

 of course change this profound be both liberating and threaten to people but there ’ no turn back and our open creative society stand to benefit more than any other if we understand and act on the reality of interdependence we have to be at the center of every vital global network as a good neighbor and a good partner we have to recognize that we can not build our future without help other to build theirs

 the first thing we have get to do be to forge a new consensus on trade now those of we who believe passionately in the power of open trade we have to ensure that it lift both our living standard and our value never tolerate abusive child labor or a race to the bottom in the environment and worker protection but other must recognize that open market and rule base trade be the good engine we know of for raise living standard reduce global poverty and environmental destruction and assure the free flow of idea

 i believe as strongly tonight as i do the first day i get here the only direction forward for america on trade the only direction for america on trade be to keep go forward i ask you to help i forge that consensus we have to make develop economy our partner in prosperity that ’s why i would like to ask you again to finalize our groundbreaking african and caribbean basin trade initiative

 but globalization be about more than economic our purpose must be to bring together the world around freedom and democracy and peace and to oppose those who would tear it apart here be the fundamental challenge i believe america must meet to shape the 21st century world

 first we must continue to encourage our former adversary russia and china to emerge as stable prosperous democratic nation both be be hold back today from reach their full potential russia by the legacy of communism an economy in turmoil a cruel and self defeat war in chechnya china by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom

 but think how much have change in the past decade 5,000 former soviet nuclear weapon take out of commission russian soldier actually serve with our in the balkans russian people elect their leader for the first time in 1,000 year and in china an economy more open to the world than ever before

 of course no one not a single person in this chamber tonight can know for sure what direction these great nation will take but we do know for sure that we can choose what we do and we should do everything in our power to increase the chance that they will choose wisely to be constructive member of our global community

 that ’ why we should support those russians who be struggle for a democratic prosperous future continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenal and help russia to safeguard weapon and material that remain

 and that ’ why i believe congress should support the agreement we negotiate to bring china into the wto by pass permanent normal trade relation with china as soon as possible this year i think you ought to do it for two reason first of all our market be already open to china this agreement will open china ’s market to we and second it will plainly advance the cause of peace in asia and promote the cause of change in china no we do not know where it ’s go all we can do be decide what we ’re go to do but when all be say and do we need to know we do everything we possibly could to maximize the chance that china will choose the right future

 a second challenge we ’ve get be to protect our own security from conflict that pose the risk of wide war and threaten our common humanity we can not prevent every conflict or stop every outrage but where our interest be at stake and we can make a difference we should be and we must be peacemaker

 we should be proud of our role in bring the middle east close to a last peace build peace in northern ireland work for peace in east timor and africa promote reconciliation between greece and turkey and in cyprus work to defuse these crisis between india and pakistan in defend human right and religious freedom and we should be proud of the man and woman of our armed forces and those of our ally who stop the ethnic cleansing in kosovo enable a million people to return to their home

 when slobodan milosevic unleash his terror on kosovo captain john cherrey be one of the brave airmen who turn the tide and when another american plane be shoot down over serbia he fly into the tooth of enemy air defense to bring his fellow pilot home thank to our armed forces skill and bravery we prevail in kosovo without lose a single american in combat i want to introduce captain cherrey to you we honor captain cherrey and we promise you captain we ’ll finish the job you begin stand up so we can see you applause

 a third challenge we have be to keep this inexorable march of technology from give terrorist and potentially hostile nation the mean to undermine our defense keep in mind the same technological advance that have shrink cell phone to fit in the palm of our hand can also make weapon of terror easy to conceal and easy to use

 we must meet this threat by make effective agreement to restrain nuclear and missile program in north korea curb the flow of lethal technology to iran prevent iraq from threaten its neighbor increase our preparedness against chemical and biological attack protect our vital computer system from hacker and criminal and develop a system to defend against new missile threat while work to preserve our abm missile treaty with russia we must do all these thing

 i predict to you when most of we be long go but some time in the next 10 to 20 year the major security threat this country will face will come from the enemy of the nation state the narcotrafficker and the terrorist and the organized criminal who will be organize together work together with increase access to ever more sophisticated chemical and biological weapon and i want to thank the pentagon and other for do what they ’re do right now to try to help protect we and plan for that so that our defense will be strong i ask for your support to ensure they can succeed

 i also want to ask you for a constructive bipartisan dialog this year to work to build a consensus which i hope will eventually lead to the ratification of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty

 i hope we can also have a constructive effort to meet the challenge that be present to our planet by the huge gulf between rich and poor we can not accept a world in which part of humanity live on the cutting edge of a new economy and the rest live on the bare edge of survival i think we have to do our part to change that with expand trade expand aid and the expansion of freedom

 this be interesting from nigeria to indonesia more people get the right to choose their leader in 1999 than in 1989 when the berlin wall fall we ’ve get to stand by these democracy include and especially tonight colombia which be fight narcotrafficker for its own people ’s life and our child ’s life i have propose a strong two year package to help colombia win this fight i want to thank the leader in both party in both houses for listen to i and the president of colombia about it we have get to pass this i want to ask your help a lot be ride on it and it ’ so important for the long term stability of our country and for what happen in latin america

 i also want you to know i ’m go to send you new legislation to go after what these drug baron value the most their money and i hope you ’ll pass that as well

 in a world where over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day we also have get to do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debt of the poor country so they can invest in education health care and economic growth that ’ what the pope and other religious leader have urge we to do and last year congress make a downpayment on america ’s share i ask you to continue that i thank you for what you do and ask you to stay the course

 i also want to say that america must help more nation to break the bond of disease last year in africa 10 time as many people die from aids as be kill in wars—10 time the budget i give you invest $ 150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killer and today i propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccine for disease like malaria tb and aids i ask the private sector and our partner around the world to join we in embrace this cause we can save million of life together and we ought to do it

 i also want to mention our final challenge which as always be the most important i ask you to pass a national security budget that keep our military the well train and well equip in the world with heighten readiness and 21st century weapon which raise salary for our service man and woman which protect our veteran which fully fund the diplomacy that keep our soldier out of war which make good on our commitment to our u.n. due and arrear i ask you to pass this budget

 i also want to say something if i might very personal tonight the american people watch we at home with the help of all the commentator can tell from who stand and who sit and who clap and who do n’t that there ’s still modest difference of opinion in this room laughter but i want to thank you for something every one of you i want to thank you for the extraordinary support you have give republicans and democrats alike to our man and woman in uniform i thank you for that

 i also want to thank especially two people first i want to thank our secretary of defense bill cohen for symbolize our bipartisan commitment to national security thank you sir even more i want to thank his wife janet who more than any other american citizen have tirelessly travel this world to show the support we all feel for our troop thank you janet cohen i appreciate that thank you

 these be the challenge we have to meet so that we can lead the world toward peace and freedom in an era of globalization

 i want to tell you that i be very grateful for many thing as president but one of the thing i ’m grateful for be the opportunity that the vice president and i have have to finally put to rest the bogus idea that you can not grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time

 as our economy have grow we ’ve rid more than 500 neighborhood of toxic waste ensure clean air and water for million of people in the past three month alone we ’ve help preserve 40 million acre of roadless land in the national forest create three new national monument

 but as our community grow our commitment to conservation must continue to grow

 tonight i propose create a permanent conservation fund to restore wildlife protect coastline save natural treasure from the california redwood to the florida everglades this land legacy endowment would represent by far the most enduring investment in land preservation ever propose in this house i hope we can get together with all the people with different idea and do this this be a gift we should give to our child and our grandchild for all time across party line we can make an agreement to do this

 last year the vice president launch a new effort to make community more liberal liv able—[laughter]—liberal i know laughter wait a minute i ’ve get a punchline now that ’s this year ’s agenda last year be livable right laughter that ’ what senator lott be go to say in the commentary afterwards—[laugh ter to make our community more livable this be big business this be a big issue what do that mean you ask anybody that live in an unlivable community and they ’ll tell you they want their kid to grow up next to park not parking lot the parent do not have to spend all their time stall in traffic when they could be home with their child

 tonight i ask you to support new funding for the follow thing to make american community more liberal livable laughter i ’ve do pretty well with this speech but i can not say that

 one i want you to help we to do three thing we need more funding for advanced transit system we need more funding for save open space in place of heavy development and we need more funding this ought to have bipartisan appeal we need more funding for help major city around the great lakes protect their waterway and enhance their quality of life we need these thing and i want you to help we

 the great environmental challenge of the new century be global warming the scientist tell we the 1990s be the hot decade of the entire millennium if we fail to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas deadly heat wave and drought will become more frequent coastal area will flood and economy will be disrupt that be go to happen unless we act

 many people in the united states some people in this chamber and lot of folk around the world still believe you can not cut greenhouse gas emission without slow economic growth in the industrial age that may well have be true but in this digital economy it be not true anymore new technology make it possible to cut harmful emission and provide even more growth

 for example just last week automaker unveil car that get 70 to 80 mile a gallon the fruit of a unique research partnership between government and industry and before you know it efficient production of bio fuel will give we the equivalent of hundred of mile from a gallon of gasoline

 to speed innovation in these kind of technology i think we should give a major tax incentive to business for the production of clean energy and to family for buy energy save home and appliance and the next generation of superefficient car when they hit the showroom floor i also ask the auto industry to use the available technology to make all new car more fuel efficient right away

 and i ask this congress to do something else please help we make more of our clean energy technology available to the develop world that will create clean growth abroad and a lot more new job here in the united states of america

 in the new century innovation in science and technology will be key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvement in the quality of our life and advance in the economy later this year researcher will complete the first draft of the entire human genome the very blueprint of life it be important for all our fellow americans to recognize that federal tax dollar have fund much of this research and that this and other wise investment in science be lead to a revolution in our ability to detect treat and prevent disease

 for example researcher have identify gene that cause parkinson ’s diabetes and certain kind of cancer they be design precision therapy that will block the harmful effect of these gene for good researcher already be use this new technique to target and destroy cell that cause breast cancer soon we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of alzheimer ’s scientist be also work on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see and listen to this microchip that would actually directly stimulate damage spinal cord in a way that could allow people now paralyzed to stand up and walk

 these kind of innovation be also propel our remarkable prosperity information technology only include 8 percent of our employment but now account for a third of our economic growth along with job that pay by the way about 80 percent above the private sector average again we ought to keep in mind government fund research bring supercomputer the internet and communication satellite into be soon researcher will bring we device that can translate foreign language as fast as you can talk material 10 time strong than steel at a fraction of the weight and this be unbelievable to i molecular computer the size of a teardrop with the power of today ’s fast supercomputer

 to accelerate the march of discovery across all these discipline in science and technology i ask you to support my recommendation of an unprecedented $ 3 billion in the 21st century research fund the large increase in civilian research in a generation we owe it to our future

 now these new breakthrough have to be use in way that reflect our value first and foremost we have to safeguard our citizen privacy last year we propose to protect every citizen ’s medical record this year we will finalize those rule we ’ve also take the first step to protect the privacy of bank and credit card record and other financial statement soon i will send legislation to you to finish that job we must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination whatever by employer or insurer i hope you will support that

 these step will allow we to lead toward the far frontier of science and technology they will enhance our health the environment the economy in way we can not even imagine today but we all know that at a time when science technology and the force of globalization be bring so many change into all our life it ’ more important than ever that we strengthen the bond that root we in our local community and in our national community

 no tie bind different people together like citizen service there ’ a new spirit of service in america a movement we ’ve try to support with americorps expand peace corps unprecedented new partnership with business foundation community group partnership for example like the one that enlist 12,000 company which have now move 650,000 of our fellow citizen from welfare to work partnership to battle drug abuse aids teach young people to read save america ’s treasure strengthen the art fight teen pregnancy prevent violence among young people promote racial healing the american people be work together

 but we should do more to help americans help each other first we should help faith base organization to do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help people get back on the right track with initiative like second chance homes that do so much to help unwed teen mother second we should support americans who tithe and contribute to charity but do not earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it tonight i propose new tax incentive that would allow low and middle income citizen who do not itemize to get that deduction it ’ nothing but fair and it will get more people to give

 we should do more to help new immigrant to fully participate in our community that ’ why i recommend spend more to teach they civic and english and since everybody in our community count we ’ve get to make sure everyone be count in this year ’s census

 within 10 year just 10 year there will be no majority race in our large state of california in a little more than 50 year there will be no majority race in america in a more interconnected world this diversity can be our great strength just look around this chamber look around we have member in this congress from virtually every racial ethnic and religious background and i think you would agree that america be strong because of it applause

 you also have to agree that all those difference you just clap for all too often spark hatred and division even here at home just in the last couple of year we ’ve see a man drag to death in texas just because he be black we see a young man murder in wyoming just because he be gay last year we see the shooting of african americans asian americans and jewish child just because of who they be this be not the american way and we must draw the line

 i ask you to draw that line by pass without delay the hate crimes prevention act and the employment non discrimination act and i ask you to reauthorize the violence against women act

 finally tonight i propose the large ever investment in our civil right law for enforcement because no american should be subject to discrimination in find a home get a job go to school or secure a loan protection in law should be protection in fact

 last february because i think this be so important i create the white house office of one america to promote racial reconciliation that ’ what one of my personal hero hank aaron have do all his life from his day as our all time home run king to his recent act of healing he have always bring people together we should follow his example and we ’re honor to have he with we tonight stand up hank aaron applause

 i just want to say one more thing about this and i want every one of you to think about this the next time you get mad at one of your colleague on the other side of the aisle this fall at the white house hillary have one of her millennium dinner and we have this very distinguished scientist there who be an expert in this whole work in the human genome and he say that we be all regardless of race genetically 99.9 percent the same

 now you may find that uncomfortable when you look around here laughter but it be worth remember we can laugh about this but you think about it modern science have confirm what ancient faith have always teach the most important fact of life be our common humanity therefore we should do more than just tolerate our diversity we should honor it and celebrate it

 my fellow americans every time i prepare for the state of the union i approach it with hope and expectation and excitement for our nation but tonight be very special because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium behind we we can look back and see the great expanse of american achievement and before we we can see even great grander frontier of possibility we should all of we be fill with gratitude and humility for our present progress and prosperity we should be fill with awe and joy at what lie over the horizon and we should be fill with absolute determination to make the most of it

 you know when the framers finished craft our constitution in philadelphia benjamin franklin stand in independence hall and he reflect on the carving of the sun that be on the back of a chair he see the sun be low on the horizon so he say this he say i ’ve often wonder whether that sun be rise or set today franklin say i have the happiness to know it ’ a rise sun today because each succeed generation of americans have keep the fire of freedom burn brightly light those frontier of possibility we all still bask in the glow and the warmth of mr. franklin ’s rise sun

 after 224 year the american revolution continue we remain a new nation and as long as our dream outweigh our memory america will be forever young that be our destiny and this be our moment

 thank you god bless you and god bless america

my fellow citizen tonight be my last opportunity to speak to you from the oval office as your president i be profoundly grateful to you for twice give i the honor to serve to work for you and with you to prepare our nation for the 21st century
 and i be grateful to vice president gore to my cabinet secretaries and to all those who have serve with i for the last eight year
 this have be a time of dramatic transformation and you have rise to every new challenge you have make our social fabric strong our family healthy and safe our people more prosperous you the american people have make our passage into the global information age an era of great american renewal
 in all the work i have do as president every decision i have make every executive action i have take every bill i have propose and sign i've try to give all americans the tool and condition to build the future of our dream in a good society with a strong economy a clean environment and a freer safe more prosperous world
 i have steer my course by our endure value opportunity for all responsibility from all a community of all americans i have seek to give america a new kind of government small more modern more effective full of idea and policy appropriate to this new time always put people first always focus on the future
 work together america have do well our economy be break record with more than 22 million new job the low unemployment in 30 year the high homeownership ever the long expansion in history our family and community be strong thirty five million americans have use the family leave law 8 million have move off welfare crime be at a 25 year low over 10 million americans receive more college aid and more people than ever be go to college our school be well high standard great accountability and large investment have bring high test score and high graduation rate more than 3 million child have health insurance now and more than 7 million americans have be lift out of poverty income be rise across the board our air and water be clean our food and drinking water be safe and more of our precious land have be preserve in the continental united states than at any time in a 100 year
 america have be a force for peace and prosperity in every corner of the globe i be very grateful to be able to turn over the rein of leadership to a new president with america in such a strong position to meet the challenge of the future
 tonight i want to leave you with three thought about our future first america must maintain our record of fiscal responsibility
 through our last four budget we have turn record deficit to record surplus and we have be able to pay down $ 600 billion of our national debt on track to be debt free by the end of the decade for the first time since 1835 stay on that course will bring low interest rate great prosperity and the opportunity to meet our big challenge if we choose wisely we can pay down the debt deal with the retirement of the baby boomer invest more in our future and provide tax relief
 second because the world be more connected every day in every way america 's security and prosperity require we to continue to lead in the world at this remarkable moment in history more people live in freedom than ever before our alliance be strong than ever people all around the world look to america to be a force for peace and prosperity freedom and security
 the global economy be give more of our own people and billion around the world the chance to work and live and raise their family with dignity but the force of integration that have create these good opportunity also make we more subject to global force of destruction to terrorism organized crime and narcotrafficking the spread of deadly weapon and disease the degradation of the global environment
 the expansion of trade have not fully close the gap between those of we who live on the cutting edge of the global economy and the billion around the world who live on the knife 's edge of survival this global gap require more than compassion it require action global poverty be a powder keg that could be ignite by our indifference
 in his first inaugural address thomas jefferson warn of entangle alliance but in our time america can not and must not disentangle itself from the world if we want the world to embody our share value then we must assume a shared responsibility
 if the war of the 20th century especially the recent one in kosovo and bosnia have teach we anything it be that we achieve our aim by defend our value and lead the force of freedom and peace we must embrace boldly and resolutely that duty to lead to stand with our ally in word and deed and to put a human face on the global economy so that expand trade benefit all people in all nation lift life and hope all across the world
 third we must remember that america can not lead in the world unless here at home we weave the thread of our coat of many color into the fabric of one america as we become ever more diverse we must work hard to unite around our common value and our common humanity we must work hard to overcome our difference in our heart and in our law we must treat all our people with fairness and dignity regardless of their race religion gender or sexual orientation and regardless of when they arrive in our country always move toward the more perfect union of our founder dream
 hillary chelsea and i join all americans in wish our very good to the next president george w. bush to his family and his administration in meet these challenge and in lead freedom 's march in this new century
 as for i i will leave the presidency more idealistic more full of hope than the day i arrive and more confident than ever that america 's good day lie ahead
 my day in this office be nearly through but my day of service i hope be not in the year ahead i will never hold a position high or a covenant more sacred than that of president of the united states but there be no title i will wear more proudly than that of citizen
 thank you god bless you and god bless america

president clinton distinguished guest and my fellow citizen the peaceful transfer of authority be rare in history yet common in our country with a simple oath we affirm old tradition and make new beginning
 as i begin i thank president clinton for his service to our nation
 and i thank vice president gore for a contest conduct with spirit and end with grace
 i be honor and humble to stand here where so many of america 's leader have come before i and so many will follow
 we have a place all of we in a long story a story we continue but whose end we will not see it be the story of a new world that become a friend and liberator of the old a story of a slave hold society that become a servant of freedom the story of a power that go into the world to protect but not possess to defend but not to conquer
 it be the american story a story of flawed and fallible people unite across the generation by grand and endure ideal
 the grandest of these ideal be an unfold american promise that everyone belong that everyone deserve a chance that no insignificant person be ever bear
 americans be call to enact this promise in our life and in our law and though our nation have sometimes halt and sometimes delay we must follow no other course
 through much of the last century america 's faith in freedom and democracy be a rock in a rage sea now it be a seed upon the wind take root in many nation
 our democratic faith be more than the creed of our country it be the inborn hope of our humanity an ideal we carry but do not own a trust we bear and pass along and even after nearly 225 year we have a long way yet to travel
 while many of our citizen prosper other doubt the promise even the justice of our own country the ambition of some americans be limit by fail school and hide prejudice and the circumstance of their birth and sometimes our difference run so deep it seem we share a continent but not a country
 we do not accept this and we will not allow it our unity our union be the serious work of leader and citizen in every generation and this be my solemn pledge i will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity
 i know this be in our reach because we be guide by a power large than ourselves who create we equal in his image
 and we be confident in principle that unite and lead we onward
 america have never be unite by blood or birth or soil we be bind by ideal that move we beyond our background lift we above our interest and teach we what it mean to be citizen every child must be teach these principle every citizen must uphold they and every immigrant by embrace these ideal make our country more not less american
 today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation 's promise through civility courage compassion and character
 america at its good match a commitment to principle with a concern for civility a civil society demand from each of we good will and respect fair dealing and forgiveness
 some seem to believe that our politic can afford to be petty because in a time of peace the stake of our debate appear small
 but the stake for america be never small if our country do not lead the cause of freedom it will not be lead if we do not turn the heart of child toward knowledge and character we will lose their gift and undermine their idealism if we permit our economy to drift and decline the vulnerable will suffer most
 we must live up to the calling we share civility be not a tactic or a sentiment it be the determined choice of trust over cynicism of community over chaos and this commitment if we keep it be a way to share accomplishment
 america at its good be also courageous
 our national courage have be clear in time of depression and war when defend common danger define our common good now we must choose if the example of our father and mother will inspire we or condemn we we must show courage in a time of blessing by confront problem instead of pass they on to future generation
 together we will reclaim america 's school before ignorance and apathy claim more young life
 we will reform social security and medicare spare our child from struggle we have the power to prevent and we will reduce taxis to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of work americans
 we will build our defense beyond challenge lest weakness invite challenge
 we will confront weapon of mass destruction so that a new century be spare new horror
 the enemy of liberty and our country should make no mistake america remain engage in the world by history and by choice shape a balance of power that favor freedom we will defend our ally and our interest we will show purpose without arrogance we will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength and to all nation we will speak for the value that give our nation birth
 america at its good be compassionate in the quiet of american conscience we know that deep persistent poverty be unworthy of our nation 's promise
 and whatever our view of its cause we can agree that child at risk be not at fault abandonment and abuse be not act of god they be failure of love
 and the proliferation of prison however necessary be no substitute for hope and order in our soul
 where there be suffer there be duty american in need be not stranger they be citizen not problem but priority and all of we be diminish when any be hopeless
 government have great responsibility for public safety and public health for civil right and common school yet compassion be the work of a nation not just a government
 and some need and hurt be so deep they will only respond to a mentor 's touch or a pastor 's prayer church and charity synagogue and mosque lend our community their humanity and they will have an honor place in our plan and in our law
 many in our country do not know the pain of poverty but we can listen to those who do
 and i can pledge our nation to a goal when we see that wound traveler on the road to jericho we will not pass to the other side
 america at its good be a place where personal responsibility be value and expect
 encouraging responsibility be not a search for scapegoat it be a call to conscience and though it require sacrifice it bring a deep fulfillment we find the fullness of life not only in option but in commitment and we find that child and community be the commitment that set we free
 our public interest depend on private character on civic duty and family bond and basic fairness on uncounted unhonored act of decency which give direction to our freedom
 sometimes in life we be call to do great thing but as a saint of our time have say every day we be call to do small thing with great love the most important task of a democracy be do by everyone
 i will live and lead by these principle to advance my conviction with civility to pursue the public interest with courage to speak for great justice and compassion to call for responsibility and try to live it as well
 in all these way i will bring the value of our history to the care of our time
 what you do be as important as anything government do i ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort to defend need reform against easy attack to serve your nation begin with your neighbor i ask you to be citizen citizen not spectator citizen not subject responsible citizen build community of service and a nation of character
 americans be generous and strong and decent not because we believe in ourselves but because we hold belief beyond ourselves when this spirit of citizenship be miss no government program can replace it when this spirit be present no wrong can stand against it
 after the declaration of independence be sign virginia statesman john page write to thomas jefferson we know the race be not to the swift nor the battle to the strong do you not think an angel ride in the whirlwind and direct this storm
 much time have pass since jefferson arrive for his inauguration the year and change accumulate but the theme of this day he would know our nation 's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity
 we be not this story 's author who fill time and eternity with his purpose yet his purpose be achieve in our duty and our duty be fulfil in service to one another
 never tiring never yield never finish we renew that purpose today to make our country more just and generous to affirm the dignity of our life and every life
 this work continue this story go on and an angel still ride in the whirlwind and direct this storm
 god bless you all and god bless america

 as i say in my inaugural address compassion be the work of a nation not just a government it be more than the calling of politician it be the calling of citizen it be citizen who turn mean street into good neighborhood it be citizen who turn cold city into real community

 it be one of the great goal of my administration to invigorate the spirit of involvement and citizenship we will encourage faith base and community program without change their mission we will help all in their work to change heart while keep a commitment to pluralism

 i approach this goal with some basic principle government have important responsibility for public health or public order and civil right yet government and government will never be replace by charity and community group yet when we see social need in america my administration will look first to faith base program and community group which have prove their power to save and change life we will not fund the religious activity of any group but when people of faith provide social service we will not discriminate against they

 as long as there be secular alternative faith base charity should be able to compete for funding on an equal basis and in a manner that do not cause they to sacrifice their mission and we will make sure that help go to large organization and to small one as well we value large organization with generation of experience we also value neighborhood healer who have only the scar and testimony of their own experience

 tomorrow i will begin turn these principle into a legislative agenda i will send to congress a series of idea and proposal today i want to raise the priority and profile of these issue within my own administration i want to ensure that faith base and community group will always have a place at the table in our deliberation

 in a few moment i will sign two executive order the first executive order will create a new office call the white house office of faith base and community initiatives the head of this office will report directly to i and be charge with important responsibility he will oversee our initiative on this issue he will make sure our government where it work with private group be fair and supportive and he will highlight group as national model so other can learn from they

 and secondly professor john dilulio will head the new office i be announce today he be one of the most influential social entrepreneur in america i can not tell you how honored i be for he to leave his post in academia to join we he be the author of a respected textbook on american government he have a servant 's heart on the issue that we will confront he be work with disadvantaged child he have be a major force in mobilize the city of philadelphia to support faith base and community group

 it be a fantastic team i be honor to have they on my team i look forward to hear from they as well as i look forward to work with the people in this room and the social entrepreneur all across america who have hear the universal call to love a neighbor like they would like to be love themselves to exist and work hard not out of the love of money but out of the love of their fellow human being i be absolutely convinced the great fabric of the nation exist in neighborhood amongst unsung hero who do heroic act on a daily and hourly basis it be the fabric of the country that make america unique it be the power of promise that make the future so promising be the power of the mission that stand behind i

 this be an effort that will be an effort from now the second week of my administration to the last week of my administration because i be confident that this initiative when fully implement will help we realize the dream that america its hope its promise its greatness will extend its reach throughout every single neighborhood all across the land

 the devastation across the globe leave by aids malaria tuberculosis the sheer number of those infected and die be almost beyond comprehension suffer on the african continent have be especially great aids alone have leave at least 11 million orphan in sub sahara africa in several african country as many as half of today 's 15 year old could die of aids in a part of the world where so many have suffer from war and want and famine these late tribulation be the cruel of fate

 only through sustained and focus international cooperation can we address problem so grave and suffer so great my guest today have be do their part and more and i thank they for their leadership

 base on this morning 's meeting i believe a consensus be form on the basic element that must shape the global fund and its use first we agree on the need for partnership across border and among both the public and private sector we must call upon the compassion energy and generosity of people everywhere this mean that not only government can help but also private corporation foundation faith base group and nongovernmental organization as well

 second we agree on an integrated approach that emphasize prevention and training of medical personnel as well as treatment and care prevention be indispensable to any strategy of control a pandemic such as we now face

 third we must concentrate our effort on program that work prove good practice whenever the global fund support any health program we must know that it meet certain essential criterion we must know that the money be well spend victim be well care for and local population be well serve

 that lead to the fourth criterion namely that all proposal must be review for effectiveness by medical and public health expert address a plague of this magnitude require scientific accountability to ensure result

 and finally we understand the importance of innovation in create lifesave medicine that combat disease that be why we believe the fund must respect intellectual property right as an incentive for vital research and development

 this morning we have make a good beginning i expect the upcoming u.n. special session and this summer 's g-8 summit in italy to turn these idea into reality this be one of those moment that remind we all in public service why we be here it challenge we to act wisely and act together and to act quickly across the world at this moment there be people in true desperation and we must help

 it be now my honor to sign the first broad tax relief in a generation

good evening   i appreciate you give i a few minute of your time tonight so i can discuss with you a complex and difficult issue an issue that be one of the most profound of our time

      the issue of research involve stem cell derive from human embryo be increasingly the subject of a national debate and dinner table discussion   the issue be confront every day in laboratory as scientist ponder the ethical ramification of their work   it be agonize over by parent and many couple as they try to have child or to save child already bear

      the issue be debate within the church with people of different faith even many of the same faith come to different conclusion   many people be find that the more they know about stem cell research the less certain they be about the right ethical and moral conclusion

      my administration must decide whether to allow federal fund your tax dollar to be use for scientific research on stem cell derive from human embryos   a large number of these embryo already exist   they be the product of a process call in vitro fertilization which help so many couple conceive child   when doctor match sperm and egg to create life outside the womb they usually produce more embryo than be plant in the mother   once a couple successfully have child or if they be unsuccessful the additional embryo remain frozen in laboratory

      some will not survive during long storage other be destroy   a number have be donate to science and use to create privately fund stem cell line   and a few have be implant in an adoptive mother and bear and be today healthy child

      base on preliminary work that have be privately fund scientist believe further research use stem cell offer great promise that could help improve the life of those who suffer from many terrible disease from juvenile diabete to alzheimer 's from parkinson 's to spinal cord injury   and while scientist admit they be not yet certain they believe stem cell derive from embryo have unique potential

      you should also know that stem cell can be derive from source other than embryo from adult cell from umbilical cord that be discard after baby be bear from human placenta   and many scientist feel research on these type of stem cell be also promise   many patient suffer from a range of disease be already be help with treatment develop from adult stem cell

      however most scientist at least today believe that research on embryonic stem cell offer the most promise because these cell have the potential to develop in all of the tissue in the body

      scientist far believe that rapid progress in this research will come only with federal fund   federal dollar help attract the good and bright scientist   they ensure new discovery be widely share at the large number of research facility and that the research be direct toward the great public good

      the united states have a long and proud record of lead the world toward advance in science and medicine that improve human life   and the united states have a long and proud record of uphold the high standard of ethic as we expand the limit of science and knowledge research on embryonic stem cell raise profound ethical question because extract the stem cell destroy the embryo and thus destroy its potential for life   like a snowflake each of these embryo be unique with the unique genetic potential of an individual human being

      as i think through this issue i keep return to two fundamental question   first be these frozen embryo human life and therefore something precious to be protect   and second if they be go to be destroy anyway should not they be use for a great good for research that have the potential to save and improve other life

      i have ask those question and other of scientist scholar bioethicist religious leader doctor researcher member of congress my cabinet and my friend   i have read heartfelt letter from many americans   i have give this issue a great deal of thought prayer and considerable reflection   and i have find widespread disagreement

      on the first issue be these embryos human life well one researcher tell i he believe this five day old cluster of cell be not an embryo not yet an individual but a pre embryo   he argue that it have the potential for life but it be not a life because it can not develop on its own

      an ethicist dismiss that as a callous attempt at rationalization make no mistake he tell i that cluster of cell be the same way you and i and all the rest of we start our life   one go with a heavy heart if we use these he say because we be deal with the seed of the next generation

      and to the other crucial question if these be go to be destroy anyway why not use they for good purpose i also find different answer   many argue these embryo be byproduct of a process that help create life and we should allow couple to donate they to science so they can be use for good purpose instead of waste their potential   other will argue there be no such thing as excess life and the fact that a living being be go to die do not justify experiment on it or exploit it as a natural resource

      at its core this issue force we to confront fundamental question about the beginning of life and the end of science   it lie at a difficult moral intersection juxtapose the need to protect life in all its phase with the prospect of save and improve life in all its stage

      as the discovery of modern science create tremendous hope they also lie vast ethical mine field   as the genius of science extend the horizon of what we can do we increasingly confront complex question about what we should do   we have arrive at that brave new world that seem so distant in 1932 when aldous huxley write about human being create in test tube in what he call a hatchery

      in recent week we learn that scientist have create human embryo in test tube solely to experiment on they   this be deeply troubling and a warning sign that should prompt all of we to think through these issue very carefully

      embryonic stem cell research be at the leading edge of a series of moral hazard   the initial stem cell researcher be at first reluctant to begin his research fear it might be use for human cloning   scientist have already clone a sheep   researcher be tell we the next step could be to clone human being to create individual designer stem cell essentially to grow another you to be available in case you need another heart or lung or liver

      i strongly oppose human cloning as do most americans   we recoil at the idea of grow human being for spare body part or create life for our convenience   and while we must devote enormous energy to conquer disease it be equally important that we pay attention to the moral concern raise by the new frontier of human embryo stem cell research even the most noble end do not justify any mean

      my position on these issue be shape by deeply hold belief   i be a strong supporter of science and technology and believe they have the potential for incredible good to improve life to save life to conquer disease   research offer hope that million of our love one may be cure of a disease and rid of their suffering   i have friend whose child suffer from juvenile diabetes   nancy reagan have write i about president reagan 's struggle with alzheimer 's   my own family have confront the tragedy of childhood leukemia   and like all americans i have great hope for cure

      i also believe human life be a sacred gift from our creator   i worry about a culture that devalue life and believe as your president i have an important obligation to foster and encourage respect for life in america and throughout the world   and while we be all hopeful about the potential of this research no one can be certain that the science will live up to the hope it have generate

      eight year ago scientist believe fetal tissue research offer great hope for cure and treatment yet the progress to date have not live up to its initial expectation   embryonic stem cell research offer both great promise and great peril   so i have decide we must proceed with great care

      as a result of private research more than 60 genetically diverse stem cell line already exist   they be create from embryo that have already be destroy and they have the ability to regenerate themselves indefinitely create ongoing opportunity for research   i have conclude that we should allow federal fund to be use for research on these exist stem cell line where the life and death decision have already be make

      lead scientist tell i research on these 60 line have great promise that could lead to breakthrough therapy and cure   this allow we to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research without cross a fundamental moral line by provide taxpayer funding that would sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryo that have at least the potential for life

      i also believe that great scientific progress can be make through aggressive federal funding of research on umbilical cord placenta adult and animal stem cell which do not involve the same moral dilemma   this year your government will spend $ 250 million on this important research

      i will also name a president 's council to monitor stem cell research to recommend appropriate guideline and regulation and to consider all of the medical and ethical ramification of biomedical innovation   this council will consist of lead scientist doctor ethicist lawyer theologian and other and will be chair by dr. leon kass a lead biomedical ethicist from the university of chicago

      this council will keep we apprise of new development and give our nation a forum to continue to discuss and evaluate these important issue as we go forward i hope we will always be guide by both intellect and heart by both our capability and our conscience

      i have make this decision with great care and i pray it be the right one

      thank you for listen   good night and god bless america

 on september the 11th enemy of freedom commit an act of war against our country americans have know war but for the past 136 year they have be war on foreign soil except for one sunday in 1941 americans have know the casualty of war but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning americans have know surprise attack but never before on thousand of civilian all of this be bring upon we in a single day and night fall on a different world a world where freedom itself be under attack

 americans have many question tonight americans be ask who attack our country the evidence we have gather all point to a collection of loosely affiliate terrorist organization know as al qaeda they be the same murderer indict for bomb american embassy in tanzania and kenya and responsible for bomb the uss cole

 al qaeda be to terror what the mafia be to crime but its goal be not make money its goal be remake the world and impose its radical belief on people everywhere

 the terrorist practice a fringe form of islamic extremism that have be reject by muslim scholar and the vast majority of muslim cleric a fringe movement that pervert the peaceful teaching of islam the terrorist directive command they to kill christians and jews to kill all americans and make no distinction among military and civilian include woman and child

 this group and its leader a person name osama bin laden be link to many other organization in different country include the egyptian islamic jihad and the islamic movement of uzbekistan there be thousand of these terrorist in more than 60 country they be recruit from their own nation and neighborhood and bring to camp in place like afghanistan where they be train in the tactic of terror they be send back to their home or send to hide in country around the world to plot evil and destruction

 the leadership of al qaeda have great influence in afghanistan and support the taliban regime in control most of that country in afghanistan we see al qaeda 's vision for the world

 afghanistan 's people have be brutalize many be starve and many have flee woman be not allow to attend school you can be jail for own a television religion can be practice only as their leader dictate a man can be jail in afghanistan if his beard be not long enough

 the united states respect the people of afghanistan after all we be currently its large source of humanitarian aid but we condemn the taliban regime   it be not only repress its own people it be threaten people everywhere by sponsor and shelter and supply terrorist by aid and abet murder the taliban regime be commit murder

 and tonight the united states of america make the follow demand on the taliban deliver to united states authority all the leader of al qaeda who hide in your land release all foreign national include american citizen you have unjustly imprison protect foreign journalist diplomat and aid worker in your country close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in afghanistan and hand over every terrorist and every person in their support structure to appropriate authority give the united states full access to terrorist training camp so we can make sure they be no long operate

 these demand be not open to negotiation or discussion the taliban must act and act immediately they will hand over the terrorist or they will share in their fate

 i also want to speak tonight directly to muslims throughout the world we respect your faith it be practice freely by many million of americans and by million more in country that america count as friend its teaching be good and peaceful and those who commit evil in the name of allah blaspheme the name of allah   the terrorist be traitor to their own faith try in effect to hijack islam itself the enemy of america be not our many muslim friend it be not our many arab friend our enemy be a radical network of terrorist and every government that support they

 our war on terror begin with al qaeda but it do not end there it will not end until every terrorist group of global reach have be find stop and defeat

 americans be ask why do they hate we they hate what we see right here in this chamber a democratically elect government their leader be self appoint they hate our freedom our freedom of religion our freedom of speech our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other

 they want to overthrow exist government in many muslim country such as egypt saudi arabia and jordan they want to drive israel out of the middle east they want to drive christians and jews out of vast region of asia and africa

 these terrorist kill not merely to end life but to disrupt and end a way of life with every atrocity they hope that america grow fearful retreat from the world and forsake our friend they stand against we because we stand in their way

 we be not deceive by their pretense to piety we have see their kind before they be the heir of all the murderous ideology of the 20th century by sacrifice human life to serve their radical vision by abandon every value except the will to power they follow in the path of fascism and nazism and totalitarianism and they will follow that path all the way to where it end in history 's unmarked grave of discard lie

 americans be ask how will we fight and win this war we will direct every resource at our command every mean of diplomacy every tool of intelligence every instrument of law enforcement every financial influence and every necessary weapon of war to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network

 this war will not be like the war against iraq a decade ago with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion it will not look like the air war above kosovo two year ago where no ground troop be use and not a single american be lose in combat

 our response involve far more than instant retaliation and isolated strike americans should not expect one battle but a lengthy campaign unlike any other we have ever see it may include dramatic strike visible on tv and covert operation secret even in success we will starve terrorist of funding turn they one against another drive they from place to place until there be no refuge or no rest and we will pursue nation that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism every nation in every region now have a decision to make either you be with we or you be with the terrorist from this day forward any nation that continue to harbor or support terrorism will be regard by the united states as a hostile regime

 our nation have be put on notice we be not immune from attack we will take defensive measure against terrorism to protect americans today dozen of federal department and agency as well as state and local government have responsibility affect homeland security these effort must be coordinate at the high level so tonight i announce the creation of a cabinet level position report directly to i the office of homeland security

 and tonight i also announce a distinguished american to lead this effort to strengthen american security a military veteran an effective governor a true patriot a trusted friend pennsylvania 's tom ridge he will lead oversee and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism and respond to any attack that may come

 these measure be essential but the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life be to stop it eliminate it and destroy it where it grow

 many will be involve in this effort from fbi agent to intelligence operative to the reservist we have call to active duty all deserve our thank and all have our prayer and tonight a few mile from the damage pentagon i have a message for our military be ready i have call the armed forces to alert and there be a reason the hour be come when america will act and you will make we proud

 this be not however just america 's fight and what be at stake be not just america 's freedom this be the world 's fight this be civilization 's fight this be the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism tolerance and freedom

 we ask every nation to join we we will ask and we will need the help of police force intelligence service and banking system around the world the united states be grateful that many nation and many international organization have already respond with sympathy and with support nation from latin america to asia to africa to europe to the islamic world perhaps the nato charter reflect good the attitude of the world an attack on one be an attack on all

 the civilized world be rally to america 's side they understand that if this terror go unpunished their own city their own citizen may be next terror unanswered can not only bring down building it can threaten the stability of legitimate government and you know what we're not go to allow it

 americans be ask what be expect of we i ask you to live your life and hug your child i know many citizen have fear tonight and i ask you to be calm and resolute even in the face of a continue threat

 i ask you to uphold the value of america and remember why so many have come here we be in a fight for our principle and our first responsibility be to live by they no one should be single out for unfair treatment or unkind word because of their ethnic background or religious faith

 i ask you to continue to support the victim of this tragedy with your contribution those who want to give can go to a central source of information libertyunites.org to find the name of group provide direct help in new york pennsylvania and virginia

 the thousand of fbi agent who be now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation and i ask you to give it

 i ask for your patience with the delay and inconvenience that may accompany tight security and for your patience in what will be a long struggle

 i ask your continued participation and confidence in the american economy terrorist attack a symbol of american prosperity they do not touch its source america be successful because of the hard work and creativity and enterprise of our people these be the true strength of our economy before september 11th and they be our strength today

 and finally please continue pray for the victim of terror and their family for those in uniform and for our great country prayer have comfort we in sorrow and will help strengthen we for the journey ahead

 tonight i thank my fellow americans for what you have already do and for what you will do and lady and gentleman of the congress i thank you their representative for what you have already do and for what we will do together

 tonight we face new and sudden national challenge we will come together to improve air safety to dramatically expand the number of air marshal on domestic flight and take new measure to prevent hijacking we will come together to promote stability and keep our airline fly with direct assistance during this emergency

 we will come together to give law enforcement the additional tool it need to track down terror here at home we will come together to strengthen our intelligence capability to know the plan of terrorist before they act and find they before they strike

 we will come together to take active step that strengthen america 's economy and put our people back to work

 tonight we welcome two leader who embody the extraordinary spirit of all new yorkers governor george pataki and mayor rudolph giuliani as a symbol of america 's resolve my administration will work with congress and these two leader to show the world that we will rebuild new york city

 after all that have just pass all the life take and all the possibility and hope that die with they it be natural to wonder if america 's future be one of fear some speak of an age of terror i know there be struggle ahead and danger to face but this country will define our time not be define by they as long as the united states of america be determined and strong this will not be an age of terror this will be an age of liberty here and across the world

 great harm have be do to we we have suffer great loss and in our grief and anger we have find our mission and our moment freedom and fear be at war the advance of human freedom the great achievement of our time and the great hope of every time now depend on we our nation this generation will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future we will rally the world to this cause by our effort by our courage we will not tire we will not falter and we will not fail

 it be my hope that in the month and year ahead life will return almost to normal we will go back to our life and routine and that be good even grief recede with time and grace but our resolve must not pass each of we will remember what happen that day and to whom it happen we will remember the moment the news come where we be and what we be do some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue some will carry memory of a face and a voice go forever

 and i will carry this it be the police shield of a man name george howard who die at the world trade center try to save other it be give to i by his mom arlene as a proud memorial to her son this be my reminder of life that end and a task that do not end

 i will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflict it i will not yield i will not rest i will not relent in wage this struggle for freedom and security for the american people

 the course of this conflict be not know yet its outcome be certain freedom and fear justice and cruelty have always be at war and we know that god be not neutral between they

 fellow citizen we will meet violence with patient justice assure of the rightness of our cause and confident of the victory to come in all that lie before we may god grant we wisdom and may he watch over the united states of america

 and we owe the child of america a good education   and today begin a new era a new time in public education in our country   as of this hour america 's school will be on a new path of reform and a new path of result

 our school will have high expectation   we believe every child can learn   our school will have great resource to help meet those goal parent will have more information about the school and more say in how their child be educate   from this day forward all student will have a well chance to learn to excel and to live out their dream applause

 i want to thank the secretary of education rod paige for be here and for his leadership   applause   i ask rod to join my administration because i want somebody who understand what it mean to run a school district in washington d.c.   i do not need somebody that base his knowledge on theory i want somebody who base his knowledge on experience   and rod be a teacher a school board member and the superintendent of the houston independent school district   he do a fine job there and he be do a fine job in washington   applause

 there be other member of the congress who be here as well and i want to thank they for come   senator evan bayh from the state of indiana be here   evan thank you for your leadership on education reform applause   senator mike dewine of your state of ohio who help author applause who help to author the safe and drug free school part of this bill   thank you for your leadership   applause

 steve chabot of ohio van hilleary of tennessee thank you both for come as well   applause   in that box be the bill   i do not intend to read it all   laughter   it be not exactly light reading   laughter but if you be to read it all you would find that it contain some very important principle that will help guide our public school system for the next decade

 first principle be accountability   every school have a job to do   and that be to teach the basic and teach they well   if we want to make sure no child be leave behind every child must learn to read   and every child must learn to add and subtract   applause   so in return for federal dollar we be ask state to design accountability system to show parent and teacher whether or not child can read and write and add and subtract in grade three through eight

 the fundamental principle of this bill be that every child can learn we expect every child to learn and you must show we whether or not every child be learn   applause   i read a quote one time from a young lady in new york   she say i do not ever remember take an exam   they just keep pass i along   i end up drop out in the 7th grade   i basically feel nobody care

 the story of child be just shuffle through the system be one of the sad story of america   let us just move they through   it be so much easy to move a child through than try to figure out how to solve a child 's problem   the first step to make sure that a child be not shuffle through be to test that child as to whether or not he or she can read and write or add and subtract

 the first way to solve a problem be to diagnose it   and so what this bill say it say every child can learn   and we want to know early before it be too late whether or not a child have a problem in learn   i understand take test be not fun   too bad   laughter   we need to know in america   we need to know whether or not child have get the basic education   applause

 no long be it acceptable to hide poor performance   no long be it acceptable to keep result away from parent   one of the interesting thing about this bill it say that we be never go to give up on a school that be perform poorly that when we find poor performance a school will be give time and incentive and resource to correct their problem   a school will be give time to try other methodology perhaps other leadership to make sure that people can succeed   if however school do not perform if however give the new resource focused resource they be unable to solve the problem of not educate their child there must be real consequence   there must be a moment in which parent can say i have have enough of this school   parent must be give real option in the face of failure in order to make sure reform be meaningful

 and so therefore this bill 's second principle be be that we trust parent to make the right decision for their child   any school that do not perform any school that can not catch up and do its job a parent will have these option a well public school a tutor or a charter school   we do not want child trap in school that will not change and will not teach   applause

 the third principle of this bill be that we have get to trust the local folk on how to achieve standard to meet the standard   in washington there be some smart people there but the people who care most about the child in hamilton be the citizen of hamilton   the people who care most about the child in this school be the teacher and parent and school board member   applause   and therefore school not only have the responsibility to improve they now have the freedom to improve

 the federal government will not micromanage how school be run   we believe strongly we believe strongly the good path to education reform be to trust the local people   and so the new role of the federal government be to set high standard provide resource hold people accountable and liberate school district to meet the standard applause

 i can not think of any well way to say to teacher we trust you and first of all we have get to thank all the teacher who be here   i thank you for teaching   applause   your be indeed a noble profession and our society be well off because you decide to teach   and by say we trust local folk we be really say we trust you   we trust you   we want you to have as much flexibility as possible to see to it that every child that walk in your classroom can succeed   so thank you for what you do   applause

 and a fourth principle be that we be go to spend more money more resource but they will be direct at method that work   not feel good method not sound good method but method that actually work particularly when it come to read   we be go to spend more on our school and we be go to spend it more wisely

 if we have learn anything over the last generation money alone do not make a good school   it certainly help   but as john mention we have spend billion of dollar with lousy result   so now it be time to spend billion of dollar and get good result   applause

 as john mention too many of our kid can not read   you know a huge percentage of child in poverty can not read at grade level   that be not right in america   we be go to win the war overseas and we need to win the war against illiteracy here at home as well   and so this bill applause so this bill focus on read   it set a grand goal for the country   our child will be read by the third grade

 that be not an impossible goal   it be a goal we must meet if we want every child to succeed   and so therefore we triple the amount of federal funding for scientifically base early reading program   we have get money in there to make sure teacher know how to teach what work   we have get money in there to help promote proven method of instruction

 there be no more excuse as far as i be concern about not teach child how to read   we know what work   the money be now available and it be up to each local district to make sure it happen   it be up to you the citizen of hamilton to make sure no child be leave behind   and the federal government can spend money and we can help set standard and we can assist upon accountability   but the truth of the matter be our school will flourish when citizen join in the noble cause of make sure no child be leave behind

 this be the end of a legislative process   sign this bill be the end of a long long time of people sit in room try to hammer out difference   it be a great symbol of what be possible in washington when good people come together to do what be right   but it be just the beginning of change   and now it be up to you the local citizen of our great land the compassionate decent citizen of america to stand up and demand high standard and to demand that no child not one single child in america be leave behind

 thank you for let we come   may god bless   applause

thank you very much mr. speaker vice president cheney member of congress distinguished guest fellow citizen

 as we gather tonight our nation be at war our economy be in recession and the civilized world face unprecedented danger yet the state of our union have never be strong

 we last meet in an hour of shock and suffering in four short month our nation have comfort the victim begin to rebuild new york and the pentagon rally a great coalition capture arrest and rid the world of thousand of terrorist destroy afghanistan 's terrorist training camp save a people from starvation and free a country from brutal oppression

 the american flag fly again over our embassy in kabul terrorist who once occupy afghanistan now occupy cell at guantanamo bay and terrorist leader who urge follower to sacrifice their life be run for their own

 america and afghanistan be now ally against terror we will be partner in rebuild that country and this evening we welcome the distinguished interim leader of a liberated afghanistan chairman hamid karzai

 the last time we meet in this chamber the mother and daughter of afghanistan be captive in their own home forbid from work or go to school today woman be free and be part of afghanistan 's new government and we welcome the new minister of women 's affairs dr. sima samar

 our progress be a tribute to the spirit of the afghan people to the resolve of our coalition and to the might of the united states military when i call our troop into action i do so with complete confidence in their courage and skill and tonight thank to they we be win the war on terror the man and woman of our armed force have deliver a message now clear to every enemy of the united states even 7,000 mile away across ocean and continent on mountaintop and in cave you will not escape the justice of this nation

 for many americans these four month have bring sorrow and pain that will never completely go away every day a retired firefighter return to ground zero to feel close to his two son who die there at a memorial in new york a little boy leave his football with a note for his lost father dear daddy please take this to heaven i do not want to play football until i can play with you again some day

 last month at the grave of her husband micheal a cia officer and marine who die in mazar e sharif shannon spann say these word of farewell semper fi my love shannon be with we tonight shannon i assure you and all who have lose a love one that our cause be just and our country will never forget the debt we owe micheal and all who give their life for freedom

 our cause be just and it continue our discovery in afghanistan confirm our bad fear and show we the true scope of the task ahead we have see the depth of our enemy hatred in video where they laugh about the loss of innocent life and the depth of their hatred be equal by the madness of the destruction they design we have find diagram of american nuclear powerplant and public water facility detailed instruction for make chemical weapon surveillance map of american city and thorough description of landmark in america and throughout the world

 what we have find in afghanistan confirm that far from end there our war against terror be only begin most of the 19 man who hijack plane on september 11 be train in afghanistan 's camp and so be ten of thousand of other thousand of dangerous killer school in the method of murder often support by outlaw regime be now spread throughout the world like tick timebomb set to go off without warn

 thank to the work of our law enforcement official and coalition partner hundred of terrorist have be arrest yet ten of thousand of train terrorist be still at large these enemy view the entire world as a battlefield and we must pursue they wherever they be so long as training camp operate so long as nation harbor terrorist freedom be at risk and america and our ally must not and will not allow it

 our nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in the pursuit of two great objective first we will shut down terrorist camp disrupt terrorist plan and bring terrorist to justice and second we must prevent the terrorist and regime who seek chemical biological or nuclear weapon from threaten the united states and the world

 our military have put the terror training camp of afghanistan out of business yet camp still exist in at least a dozen country a terrorist underworld include group like hamas hezbollah islamic jihad jaish e mohammed operate in remote jungle and desert and hide in the center of large city

 while the most visible military action be in afghanistan america be act elsewhere we now have troop in the philippines help to train that country 's armed force to go after terrorist cell that have execute an american and still hold hostage our soldier work with the bosnian government seize terrorist who be plot to bomb our embassy our navy be patrol the coast of africa to block the shipment of weapon and the establishment of terrorist camp in somalia

 my hope be that all nation will heed our call and eliminate the terrorist parasite who threaten their country and our own many nation be act forcefully pakistan be now crack down on terror and i admire the strong leadership of president musharraf but some government will be timid in the face of terror and make no mistake about it if they do not act america will

 our second goal be to prevent regime that sponsor terror from threaten america or our friend and ally with weapon of mass destruction some of these regime have be pretty quiet since september 11 but we know their true nature

 north korea be a regime arm with missile and weapon of mass destruction while starve its citizen

 iran aggressively pursue these weapon and export terror while an unelected few repress the iranian people 's hope for freedom

 iraq continue to flaunt its hostility toward america and to support terror the iraqi regime have plot to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapon for over a decade this be a regime that have already use poison gas to murder thousand of its own citizen leave the body of mother huddle over their dead child this be a regime that agree to international inspection then kick out the inspector this be a regime that have something to hide from the civilized world

 state like these and their terrorist ally constitute an axis of evil arm to threaten the peace of the world by seek weapon of mass destruction these regime pose a grave and grow danger they could provide these arm to terrorist give they the mean to match their hatred they could attack our ally or attempt to blackmail the united states in any of these case the price of indifference would be catastrophic

 we will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorist and their state sponsor the material technology and expertise to make and deliver weapon of mass destruction we will develop and deploy effective missile defense to protect america and our ally from sudden attack and all nation should know america will do what be necessary to ensure our nation 's security

 we will be deliberate yet time be not on our side i will not wait on event while danger gather i will not stand by as peril draw close and close the united states of america will not permit the world 's most dangerous regime to threaten we with the world 's most destructive weapon

 our war on terror be well begin but it be only begin this campaign may not be finish on our watch yet it must be and it will be wage on our watch we can not stop short if we stop now leave terror camp intact and terrorist state unchecked our sense of security would be false and temporary history have call america and our ally to action and it be both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom 's fight

 our first priority must always be the security of our nation and that will be reflect in the budget i send to congress my budget support three great goal for america we will win this war we will protect our homeland and we will revive our economy

 september 11 bring out the good in america and the good in this congress and i join the american people in applaud your unity and resolve now americans deserve to have this same spirit direct toward address problem here at home i be a proud member of my party yet as we act to win the war protect our people and create job in america we must act first and foremost not as republicans not as democrats but as americans

 it cost a lot to fight this war we have spend more than $ 1 billion a month over $ 30 million a day and we must be prepare for future operation afghanistan prove that expensive precision weapon defeat the enemy and spare innocent life and we need more of they we need to replace age aircraft and make our military more agile to put our troop anywhere in the world quickly and safely our man and woman in uniform deserve the good weapon the good equipment the good training and they also deserve another pay raise

 my budget include the large increase in defense spending in two decade because while the price of freedom and security be high it be never too high whatever it cost to defend our country we will pay

 the next priority of my budget be to do everything possible to protect our citizen and strengthen our nation against the ongoing threat of another attack time and distance from the event of september 11 will not make we safe unless we act on its lesson america be no long protect by vast ocean we be protect from attack only by vigorous action abroad and increase vigilance at home

 my budget nearly double funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security focus on four key area bioterrorism emergency response airport and border security and improve intelligence we will develop vaccine to fight anthrax and other deadly disease we will increase funding to help state and community train and equip our heroic police and firefighter we will improve intelligence collection and sharing expand patrol at our border strengthen the security of air travel and use technology to track the arrival and departure of visitor to the united states

 homeland security will make america not only strong but in many way well knowledge gain from bioterrorism research will improve public health strong police and fire department will mean safe neighborhood stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal drug and as government work to well secure our homeland america will continue to depend on the eye and ear of alert citizen

 a few day before christmas an airline flight attendant spot a passenger light a match the crew and passenger quickly subdue the man who have be train by al qaeda and be arm with explosive the people on that plane be alert and as a result likely save nearly 200 life and tonight we welcome and thank flight attendant hermis moutardier and christina jones

 once we have fund our national security and our homeland security the final great priority of my budget be economic security for the american people to achieve these great national objective to win the war protect the homeland and revitalize our economy our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short term so long as congress restrain spend and act in a fiscally responsible manner we have clear priority and we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have show overseas we will prevail in the war and we will defeat this recession

 americans who have lose their job need our help and i support extend unemployment benefit and direct assistance for health care coverage yet american worker want more than unemployment check they want a steady paycheck when america work america prosper so my economic security plan can be sum up in one word job

 good job begin with good school and here we have make a fine start republicans and democrats work together to achieve historic education reform so that no child be leave behind i be proud to work with member of both party chairman john boehner and congressman george miller senator judd gregg and i be so proud of our work i even have nice thing to say about my friend ted kennedy laughter i know the folk at the crawford coffee shop could not believe i would say such a thing—[laughter]—but our work on this bill show what be possible if we set aside posturing and focus on result

 there be more to do we need to prepare our child to read and succeed in school with improved head start and early childhood development program we must upgrade our teacher college and teacher training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great goal for america a quality teacher in every classroom

 good job also depend on reliable and affordable energy this congress must act to encourage conservation promote technology build infrastructure and it must act to increase energy production at home so america be less dependent on foreign oil

 good job depend on expand trade sell into new market create new job so i ask congress to finally approve trade promotion authority

 on these two key issue trade and energy the house of representatives have act to create job and i urge the senate to pass this legislation

 good job depend on sound tax policy last year some in this hall think my tax relief plan be too small some think it be too big but when the check arrive in the mail most americans think tax relief be just about right congress listen to the people and respond by reduce tax rate double the child credit and end the death tax for the sake of long term growth and to help americans plan for the future let us make these tax cut permanent

 the way out of this recession the way to create job be to grow the economy by encourage investment in factory and equipment and by speed up tax relief so people have more money to spend for the sake of american worker let us pass a stimulus package

 good job must be the aim of welfare reform as we reauthorize these important reform we must always remember the goal be to reduce dependency on government and offer every american the dignity of a job

 americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without health security i ask congress to join i this year to enact a patient bill of right to give uninsured worker credit to help buy health coverage to approve an historic increase in the spending for veteran health and to give senior a sound and modern medicare system that include coverage for prescription drug

 a good job should lead to security in retirement i ask congress to enact new safeguard for 401 k and pension plan employee who have work hard and save all their life should not have to risk lose everything if their company fail through strict accounting standard and tough disclosure requirement corporate america must be make more accountable to employee and shareholder and hold to the high standard of conduct

 retirement security also depend upon keep the commitment of social security and we will we must make social security financially stable and allow personal retirement account for young worker who choose they

 member you and i will work together in the month ahead on other issue productive farm policy a clean environment broad homeownership especially among minority and way to encourage the good work of charity and faith base group i ask you to join i on these important domestic issue in the same spirit of cooperation we have apply to our war against terrorism

 during these last few month i have be humble and privilege to see the true character of this country in a time of testing our enemy believe america be weak and materialistic that we would splinter in fear and selfishness they be as wrong as they be evil

 the american people have respond magnificently with courage and compassion strength and resolve as i have meet the hero hug the family and look into the tired face of rescuer i have stand in awe of the american people

 and i hope you will join i i hope you will join i in express thank to one american for the strength and calm and comfort she bring to our nation in crisis our first lady laura bush

 none of we would ever wish the evil that be do on september 11 yet after america be attack it be as if our entire country look into a mirror and see our well self we be remind that we be citizen with obligation to each other to our country and to history we begin to think less of the good we can accumulate and more about the good we can do

 for too long our culture have say if it feel good do it now america be embrace a new ethic and a new creed let us roll in the sacrifice of soldier the fierce brotherhood of firefighter and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizen we have glimpse what a new culture of responsibility could look like we want to be a nation that serve goal large than self we have be offer a unique opportunity and we must not let this moment pass

 my call tonight be for every american to commit at least two year 4,000 hour over the rest of your lifetime to the service of your neighbor and your nation many be already serve and i thank you if you be not sure how to help i have get a good place to start to sustain and extend the good that have emerge in america i invite you to join the new usa freedom corps the freedom corps will focus on three area of need respond in case of crisis at home rebuild our community and extend american compassion throughout the world

 and america need citizen to extend the compassion of our country to every part of the world so we will renew the promise of the peace corps double its volunteer over the next five year and ask it to join a new effort to encourage development and education and opportunity in the islamic world

 this time of adversity offer a unique moment of opportunity a moment we must seize to change our culture through the gathering momentum of million of act of service and decency and kindness i know we can overcome evil with great good

 and we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the value that will bring last peace all father and mother in all society want their child to be educate and live free from poverty and violence no people on earth yearn to be oppress or aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police if anyone doubt this let they look to afghanistan where the islamic street greet the fall of tyranny with song and celebration let the skeptic look to islam 's own rich history with its century of learning and tolerance and progress america will lead by defend liberty and justice because they be right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere

 no nation own these aspiration and no nation be exempt from they we have no intention of impose our culture but america will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demand of human dignity the rule of law limit on the power of the state respect for woman private property free speech equal justice and religious tolerance

 america will take the side of brave man and woman who advocate these value around the world include the islamic world because we have a great objective than eliminate threat and contain resentment we seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror

 in this moment of opportunity a common danger be erase old rivalry america be work with russia and china and india in way we have never before to achieve peace and prosperity in every region free market and free trade and free society be prove their power to lift life together with friend and ally from europe to asia and africa to latin america we will demonstrate that the force of terror can not stop the momentum of freedom

 the last time i speak here i express the hope that life would return to normal in some way it have in other it never will those of we who have live through these challenging time have be change by they we have come to know truth that we will never question evil be real and it must be oppose beyond all difference of race or creed we be one country mourn together and face danger together deep in the american character there be honor and it be strong than cynicism and many have discover again that even in tragedy especially in tragedy god be near

 in a single instant we realize that this will be a decisive decade in the history of liberty that we have be call to a unique role in human event rarely have the world face a choice more clear or consequential

 our enemy send other people 's child on mission of suicide and murder they embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed we stand for a different choice make long ago on the day of our founding we affirm it again today we choose freedom and the dignity of every life

 steadfast in our purpose we now press on we have know freedom 's price we have show freedom 's power and in this great conflict my fellow americans we will see freedom 's victory

 as you leave here today i know there be one thing you will never miss about this place be a plebe applause but even a plebe at west point be make to feel he or she have some standing in the world laughter i be tell that plebe when ask whom they outrank be require to answer this sir the superintendent 's dog laughter the commandant 's cat and all the admiral in the whole damn navy applause i probably will not be share that with the secretary of the navy laughter

 history have also issue its call to your generation in your last year america be attack by a ruthless and resourceful enemy you graduate from this academy in a time of war take your place in an american military that be powerful and be honorable our war on terror be only begin but in afghanistan it be begin well applause

 i be proud of the man and woman who have fight on my order america be profoundly grateful for all who serve the cause of freedom and for all who have give their life in its defense this nation respect and trust our military and we be confident in your victory to come applause

 this war will take many turn we can not predict yet i be certain of this wherever we carry it the american flag will stand not only for our power but for freedom applause our nation 's cause have always be large than our nation 's defense we fight as we always fight for a just peace a peace that favor human liberty we will defend the peace against threat from terrorist and tyrant we will preserve the peace by build good relation among the great power and we will extend the peace by encourage free and open society on every continent

 build this just peace be america 's opportunity and america 's duty from this day forward it be your challenge as well and we will meet this challenge together applause you will wear the uniform of a great and unique country america have no empire to extend or utopia to establish we wish for other only what we wish for ourselves safety from violence the reward of liberty and the hope for a well life

 in defend the peace we face a threat with no precedent enemy in the past need great army and great industrial capability to endanger the american people and our nation the attack of september the 11th require a few hundred thousand dollar in the hand of a few dozen evil and deluded man all of the chaos and suffering they cause come at much less than the cost of a single tank the danger have not pass this government and the american people be on watch we be ready because we know the terrorist have more money and more man and more plan

 the grave danger to freedom lie at the perilous crossroad of radicalism and technology when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapon along with ballistic missile technology when that occur even weak state and small group could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nation our enemy have declare this very intention and have be catch seek these terrible weapon they want the capability to blackmail we or to harm we or to harm our friend and we will oppose they with all our power applause

 for much of the last century america 's defense rely on the cold war doctrine of deterrence and containment in some case those strategy still apply but new threat also require new thinking deterrence the promise of massive retaliation against nation mean nothing against shadowy terrorist network with no nation or citizen to defend containment be not possible when unbalanced dictator with weapon of mass destruction can deliver those weapon on missile or secretly provide they to terrorist ally

 we can not defend america and our friend by hope for the good we can not put our faith in the word of tyrant who solemnly sign non proliferation treaty and then systemically break they if we wait for threat to fully materialize we will have wait too long applause

 homeland defense and missile defense be part of strong security and they be essential priority for america yet the war on terror will not be win on the defensive we must take the battle to the enemy disrupt his plan and confront the bad threat before they emerge applause in the world we have enter the only path to safety be the path of action and this nation will act applause

 our security will require the good intelligence to reveal threat hide in cave and grow in laboratory our security will require modernize domestic agency such as the fbi so they be prepared to act and act quickly against danger our security will require transform the military you will lead a military that must be ready to strike at a moment 's notice in any dark corner of the world and our security will require all americans to be forward look and resolute to be ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty and to defend our life applause

 the work ahead be difficult the choice we will face be complex we must uncover terror cell in 60 or more country use every tool of finance intelligence and law enforcement along with our friend and ally we must oppose proliferation and confront regime that sponsor terror as each case require some nation need military training to fight terror and we will provide it other nation oppose terror but tolerate the hatred that lead to terror and that must change applause we will send diplomat where they be need and we will send you our soldier where you be need applause

 all nation that decide for aggression and terror will pay a price we will not leave the safety of america and the peace of the planet at the mercy of a few mad terrorist and tyrant applause we will lift this dark threat from our country and from the world

 because the war on terror will require resolve and patience it will also require firm moral purpose in this way our struggle be similar to the cold war now as then our enemy be totalitarian hold a creed of power with no place for human dignity now as then they seek to impose a joyless conformity to control every life and all of life

 america confront imperial communism in many different way diplomatic economic and military yet moral clarity be essential to our victory in the cold war when leader like john f. kennedy and ronald reagan refuse to gloss over the brutality of tyrant they give hope to prisoner and dissident and exile and rally free nation to a great cause

 some worry that it be somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong i disagree applause different circumstance require different method but not different morality applause moral truth be the same in every culture in every time and in every place target innocent civilian for murder be always and everywhere wrong applause brutality against woman be always and everywhere wrong applause there can be no neutrality between justice and cruelty between the innocent and the guilty we be in a conflict between good and evil and america will call evil by its name applause by confront evil and lawless regime we do not create a problem we reveal a problem and we will lead the world in oppose it applause

 as we defend the peace we also have an historic opportunity to preserve the peace we have our good chance since the rise of the nation state in the 17th century to build a world where the great power compete in peace instead of prepare for war the history of the last century in particular be dominate by a series of destructive national rivalry that leave battlefield and graveyard across the earth germany fight france the axis fight the allies and then the east fight the west in proxy war and tense standoff against a backdrop of nuclear armageddon

 competition between great nation be inevitable but armed conflict in our world be not more and more civilized nation find ourselves on the same side unite by common danger of terrorist violence and chaos america have and intend to keep military strength beyond challenge applause thereby make the destabilizing arm race of other era pointless and limit rivalry to trade and other pursuit of peace

 today the great power be also increasingly unite by common value instead of divide by conflict ideology the united states japan and our pacific friend and now all of europe share a deep commitment to human freedom embody in strong alliance such as nato and the tide of liberty be rise in many other nation

 generation of west point officer plan and practice for battle with soviet russia i have just return from a new russia now a country reach toward democracy and our partner in the war against terror applause even in china leader be discover that economic freedom be the only last source of national wealth in time they will find that social and political freedom be the only true source of national greatness applause

 when the great power share common value we be well able to confront serious regional conflict together well able to cooperate in prevent the spread of violence or economic chaos in the past great power rival take side in difficult regional problem make division deep and more complicated today from the middle east to south asia we be gather broad international coalition to increase the pressure for peace we must build strong and great power relation when time be good to help manage crisis when time be bad america need partner to preserve the peace and we will work with every nation that share this noble goal applause

 and finally america stand for more than the absence of war we have a great opportunity to extend a just peace by replace poverty repression and resentment around the world with hope of a well day through most of history poverty be persistent inescapable and almost universal in the last few decade we have see nation from chile to south korea build modern economy and free society lift million of people out of despair and want and there be no mystery to this achievement

 the 20th century end with a single survive model of human progress base on non negotiable demand of human dignity the rule of law limit on the power of the state respect for woman and private property and free speech and equal justice and religious tolerance america can not impose this vision yet we can support and reward government that make the right choice for their own people in our development aid in our diplomatic effort in our international broadcasting and in our educational assistance the united states will promote moderation and tolerance and human right and we will defend the peace that make all progress possible

 when it come to the common right and need of man and woman there be no clash of civilization the requirement of freedom apply fully to africa and latin america and the entire islamic world the people of the islamic nation want and deserve the same freedom and opportunity as people in every nation and their government should listen to their hope applause

 a truly strong nation will permit legal avenue of dissent for all group that pursue their aspiration without violence an advance nation will pursue economic reform to unleash the great entrepreneurial energy of its people a thriving nation will respect the right of woman because no society can prosper while deny opportunity to half its citizen mother and father and child across the islamic world and all the world share the same fear and aspiration in poverty they struggle in tyranny they suffer and as we see in afghanistan in liberation they celebrate applause

 america have a great objective than control threat and contain resentment we will work for a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror

 the bicentennial class of west point now enter this drama with all in the united states army you will stand between your fellow citizen and grave danger you will help establish a peace that allow million around the world to live in liberty and to grow in prosperity you will face time of calm and time of crisis and every test will find you prepared because you be the man and woman of west point applause you leave here mark by the character of this academy carry with you the high ideal of our nation

 toward the end of his life dwight eisenhower recall the first day he stand on the plain at west point the feeling come over i he say that the expression the united states of america would now and henceforth mean something different than it have ever before from here on it would be the nation i would be serve not myself

 nearly nine month have pass since the day that forever change our country debris from what be once the world trade center have be clear away in a hundred thousand truckload the west side of the pentagon look almost as it do on september the 10th and as child finish school and family prepare for summer vacation for many life seem almost normal

 yet we be a different nation today sadder and strong less innocent and more courageous more appreciative of life and for many who serve our country more willing to risk life in a great cause for those who have lose family and friend the pain will never go away and neither will the responsibility that day thrust upon all of we america be lead the civilized world in a titanic struggle against terror freedom and fear be at war and freedom be win

 tonight over 60,000 american troop be deploy around the world in the war against terror more than 7,000 in afghanistan other in the philippines yemen and the republic of georgia to train local force next week afghanistan will begin select a representative government even as american troop along with our ally still continuously raid remote al qaeda hiding place

 among those we have capture be a man name abu zabedah al qaeda 's chief of operation from he and from hundred of other we be learn more about how the terrorist plan and operate information crucial in anticipate and prevent future attack

 our coalition be strong more than 90 nation have arrest or detain over 2,400 terrorist and their supporter more than 180 country have offer or be provide assistance in the war on terrorism and our military be strong and prepare to oppose any emerge threat to the american people

 every day in this war will not bring the drama of liberate a country yet every day bring new information a tip or arrest another step or two or three in a relentless march to bring security to our nation and justice to our enemy

 every day i review a document call the threat assessment it summarize what our intelligence service and key law enforcement agency have pick up about terrorist activity sometimes the information be very general vague talk brag about future attack sometimes the information be more specific as in a recent case when an al qaeda detainee say attack be plan against financial institution

 when credible intelligence warrant appropriate law enforcement and local official be alert these warning be unfortunately a new reality in american life and we have recently see an increase in the volume of general threat americans should continue to do what you be do go about your life but pay attention to your surrounding add your eye and ear to the protection of our homeland

 in protect our country we depend on the skill of our people the troop we send to battle intelligence operative who risk their life for bit of information law enforcement officer who sift for clue and search for suspect we be now learn that before september the 11th the suspicion and insight of some of our front line agent do not get enough attention

 my administration support the important work of the intelligence committee in congress to review the activity of law enforcement and intelligence agency we need to know when warning be miss or sign unheede not to point the finger of blame but to make sure we correct any problem and prevent they from happen again

 base on everything i have see i do not believe anyone could have prevent the horror of september the 11th yet we now know that thousand of train killer be plot to attack we and this terrible knowledge require we to act differently

 if you be a front line worker for the fbi the cia some other law enforcement or intelligence agency and you see something that raise suspicion i want you to report it immediately i expect your supervisor to treat it with the seriousness it deserve information must be fully share so we can follow every lead to find the one that may prevent tragedy

 i applaud the leader and employee at the fbi and cia for begin essential reform they must continue to think and act differently to defeat the enemy

 the first and good way to secure america 's homeland be to attack the enemy where he hide and plan and we be do just that we be also take significant step to strengthen our homeland protection secure cockpit tighten our border stockpile vaccine increase security at water treatment and nuclear power plant

 after september the 11th we need to move quickly and so i appoint tom ridge as my homeland security advisor as governor ridge have work with all level of government to prepare a national strategy and as we have learn more about the plan and capability of the terrorist network we have conclude that our government must be reorganize to deal more effectively with the new threat of the 21st century so tonight i ask the congress to join i in create a single permanent department with an override and urgent mission secure the homeland of america and protect the american people

 right now as many as a hundred different government agency have some responsibility for homeland security and no one have final accountability for example the coast guard have several mission from search and rescue to maritime treaty enforcement it report to the transportation department whose primary responsibility be road rail bridge and the airway the customs service among other duty collect tariff and prevent smuggling and it be part of the treasury department whose primary responsibility be fiscal policy not security

 tonight i propose a permanent cabinet level department of homeland security to unite essential agency that must work more closely together among they the coast guard the border patrol the customs service immigration official the transportation security administration and the federal emergency management agency employee of this new agency will come to work every morning know their most important job be to protect their fellow citizen the department of homeland security will be charge with

 the department of homeland security will be charge with four primary task this new agency will control our border and prevent terrorist and explosive from enter our country it will work with state and local authority to respond quickly and effectively to emergency it will bring together our good scientist to develop technology that detect biological chemical and nuclear weapon and to discover the drug and treatment to well protect our citizen and this new department will review intelligence and law enforcement information from all agency of government and produce a single daily picture of threat against our homeland analyst will be responsible for imagine the bad and plan to counter it

 the reason to create this department be not to create the size of government but to increase its focus and effectiveness the staff of this new department will be largely draw from the agency we be combine by end duplication and overlap we will spend less on overhead and more on protect america this reorganization will give the good people of our government their good opportunity to succeed by organize our resource in a way that be thorough and unified

 what i be propose tonight be the most extensive reorganization of the federal government since the 1940 during his presidency harry truman recognize that our nation 's fragmented defense have to be reorganize to win the cold war he propose unite our military force under a single department of defense and create the national security council to bring together defense intelligence and diplomacy truman 's reform be still help we to fight terror abroad and now we need similar dramatic reform to secure our people at home

 only the united states congress can create a new department of government so tonight i ask for your help in encourage your representative to support my plan we face an urgent need and we must move quickly this year before the end of the congressional session all in our government have learn a great deal since september the 11th and we must act on every lesson we be strong and well prepare tonight than we be on that terrible morning and with your help and the support of congress we will be strong still

 history have call our nation into action history have place a great challenge before we will america with our unique position and power blink in the face of terror or will we lead to a free more civilized world there be only one answer this great country will lead the world to safety security peace and freedom

 we have accomplish much in the last year in afghanistan and beyond we have much yet to do in afghanistan and beyond many nation represent here have join in the fight against global terror and the people of the united states be grateful

 the united nations be bear in the hope that survive a world war the hope of a world move toward justice escape old pattern of conflict and fear the found member resolve that the peace of the world must never again be destroy by the will and wickedness of any man we create the united nations security council so that unlike the league of nations our deliberation would be more than talk our resolution would be more than wish after generation of deceitful dictator and broken treaty and squander life we dedicate ourselves to standard of human dignity share by all and to a system of security defend by all

 today these standard and this security be challenge our commitment to human dignity be challenge by persistent poverty and rage disease the suffering be great and our responsibility be clear the united states be join with the world to supply aid where it reach people and lift up life to extend trade and the prosperity it bring and to bring medical care where it be desperately need

 as a symbol of our commitment to human dignity the united states will return to unesco applause this organization have be reform and america will participate fully in its mission to advance human right and tolerance and learning

 our common security be challenge by regional conflict ethnic and religious strife that be ancient but not inevitable in the middle east there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both side america stand committed to an independent and democratic palestine live side by side with israel in peace and security like all other people palestinians deserve a government that serve their interest and listen to their voice my nation will continue to encourage all party to step up to their responsibility as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict

 president george w. bush address the united nations general assembly in new york city on the issue concern iraq thursday september 12 white house photo by paul morse above all our principle and our security be challenge today by outlaw group and regime that accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambition in the attack on america a year ago we see the destructive intention of our enemy this threat hide within many nation include my own in cell and camp terrorist be plot further destruction and build new basis for their war against civilization and our great fear be that terrorist will find a shortcut to their mad ambition when an outlaw regime supply they with the technology to kill on a massive scale

 in one place in one regime we find all these danger in their most lethal and aggressive form exactly the kind of aggressive threat the united nations be bear to confront

 twelve year ago iraq invade kuwait without provocation and the regime 's force be poise to continue their march to seize other country and their resource have saddam hussein be appease instead of stop he would have endanger the peace and stability of the world yet this aggression be stop by the might of coalition force and the will of the united nations

 to suspend hostility to spare himself iraq 's dictator accept a series of commitment the term be clear to he and to all and he agree to prove he be comply with every one of those obligation

 he have prove instead only his contempt for the united nations and for all his pledge by break every pledge by his deception and by his cruelty saddam hussein have make the case against himself

 in 1991 security council resolution 688 demand that the iraqi regime cease at once the repression of its own people include the systematic repression of minority which the council say threaten international peace and security in the region this demand goes ignore

 last year the u.n. commission on human rights find that iraq continue to commit extremely grave violation of human right and that the regime 's repression be all pervasive ten of thousand of political opponent and ordinary citizen have be subject to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment summary execution and torture by beat and burning electric shock starvation mutilation and rape wife be torture in front of their husband child in the presence of their parent and all of these horror conceal from the world by the apparatus of a totalitarian state

 in 1991 the u.n. security council through resolutions 686 and 687 demand that iraq return all prisoner from kuwait and other land iraq 's regime agree it break its promise last year the secretary general 's high level coordinator for this issue report that kuwait saudi indian syrian lebanese iranian egyptian bahraini and omani national remain unaccounted for more than 600 people one american pilot be among they

 in 1991 the u.n. security council through resolution 687 demand that iraq renounce all involvement with terrorism and permit no terrorist organization to operate in iraq iraq 's regime agree it break this promise in violation of security council resolution 1373 iraq continue to shelter and support terrorist organization that direct violence against iran israel and western government iraqi dissident abroad be target for murder in 1993 iraq attempt to assassinate the emir of kuwait and a former american president iraq 's government openly praise the attack of september the 11th and al qaeda terrorist escape from afghanistan and be know to be in iraq

 in 1991 the iraqi regime agree to destroy and stop develop all weapon of mass destruction and long range missile and to prove to the world it have do so by comply with rigorous inspection iraq have break every aspect of this fundamental pledge

 from 1991 to 1995 the iraqi regime say it have no biological weapon after a senior official in its weapon program defect and expose this lie the regime admit to produce ten of thousand of liter of anthrax and other deadly biological agent for use with scud warhead aerial bomb and aircraft spray tank u.n. inspector believe iraq have produce two to four time the amount of biological agent it declare and have fail to account for more than three metric ton of material that could be use to produce biological weapon right now iraq be expand and improve facility that be use for the production of biological weapon

 united nations inspection also reveal that iraq likely maintain stockpile of vx mustard and other chemical agent and that the regime be rebuild and expand facility capable of produce chemical weapon

 and in 1995 after four year of deception iraq finally admit it have a crash nuclear weapon program prior to the gulf war we know now be it not for that war the regime in iraq would likely have possess a nuclear weapon no later than 1993

 today iraq continue to withhold important information about its nuclear program weapon design procurement log experiment datum an accounting of nuclear material and documentation of foreign assistance iraq employ capable nuclear scientist and technician it retain physical infrastructure need to build a nuclear weapon iraq have make several attempt to buy high strength aluminum tube use to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon should iraq acquire fissile material it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year and iraq 's state control medium have report numerous meeting between saddam hussein and his nuclear scientist leave little doubt about his continued appetite for these weapon

 iraq also possess a force of scud type missile with range beyond the 150 kilometer permit by the u.n. work at testing and production facility show that iraq be build more long range missile that it can inflict mass death throughout the region

 in 1990 after iraq 's invasion of kuwait the world impose economic sanction on iraq those sanction be maintain after the war to compel the regime 's compliance with security council resolution in time iraq be allow to use oil revenue to buy food saddam hussein have subvert this program work around the sanction to buy missile technology and military material he blame the suffering of iraq 's people on the united nations even as he use his oil wealth to build lavish palace for himself and to buy arm for his country by refuse to comply with his own agreement he bear full guilt for the hunger and misery of innocent iraqi citizen

 in 1991 iraq promise u.n. inspector immediate and unrestricted access to verify iraq 's commitment to rid itself of weapon of mass destruction and long range missile iraq break this promise spend seven year deceive evade and harass u.n. inspector before cease cooperation entirely just month after the 1991 cease fire the security council twice renew its demand that the iraqi regime cooperate fully with inspector condemn iraq 's serious violation of its obligation the security council again renew that demand in 1994 and twice more in 1996 deplore iraq 's clear violation of its obligation the security council renew its demand three more time in 1997 cite flagrant violation and three more time in 1998 call iraq 's behavior totally unacceptable and in 1999 the demand be renew yet again

 as we meet today it be be almost four year since the last u.n. inspector set foot in iraq four year for the iraqi regime to plan and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy

 we know that saddam hussein pursue weapon of mass murder even when inspector be in his country be we to assume that he stop when they leave the history the logic and the fact lead to one conclusion saddam hussein 's regime be a grave and gather danger to suggest otherwise be to hope against the evidence to assume this regime 's good faith be to bet the life of million and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble and this be a risk we must not take

 delegate to the general assembly we have be more than patient we have try sanction we have try the carrot of oil for food and the stick of coalition military strike but saddam hussein have defy all these effort and continue to develop weapon of mass destruction the first time we may be completely certain he have a nuclear weapon be when god forbid he use one we owe it to all our citizen to do everything in our power to prevent that day from come

 the conduct of the iraqi regime be a threat to the authority of the united nations and a threat to peace iraq have answer a decade of u.n. demand with a decade of defiance all the world now face a test and the united nations a difficult and defining moment be security council resolution to be honor and enforce or cast aside without consequence will the united nations serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant

 the united states help find the united nations we want the united nations to be effective and respectful and successful we want the resolution of the world 's most important multilateral body to be enforce and right now those resolution be be unilaterally subvert by the iraqi regime our partnership of nation can meet the test before we by make clear what we now expect of the iraqi regime

 if the iraqi regime wish peace it will immediately and unconditionally forswear disclose and remove or destroy all weapon of mass destruction long range missile and all related material

 if the iraqi regime wish peace it will immediately end all support for terrorism and act to suppress it as all state be require to do by u.n. security council resolution

 if the iraqi regime wish peace it will cease persecution of its civilian population include shi'a sunnis kurds turkomans and other again as require by security council resolution

 if the iraqi regime wish peace it will release or account for all gulf war personnel whose fate be still unknown it will return the remain of any who be deceased return steal property accept liability for loss result from the invasion of kuwait and fully cooperate with international effort to resolve these issue as require by security council resolution

 if the iraqi regime wish peace it will immediately end all illicit trade outside the oil for food program it will accept u.n. administration of fund from that program to ensure that the money be use fairly and promptly for the benefit of the iraqi people

 if all these step be take it will signal a new openness and accountability in iraq and it could open the prospect of the united nations help to build a government that represent all iraqis a government base on respect for human right economic liberty and internationally supervise election

 the united states have no quarrel with the iraqi people they have suffer too long in silent captivity liberty for the iraqi people be a great moral cause and a great strategic goal the people of iraq deserve it the security of all nation require it free society do not intimidate through cruelty and conquest and open society do not threaten the world with mass murder the united states support political and economic liberty in a unified iraq

 we can harbor no illusion and that be important today to remember saddam hussein attack iran in 1980 and kuwait in 1990 he be fire ballistic missile at iran and saudi arabia bahrain and israel his regime once order the killing of every person between the age of 15 and 70 in certain kurdish village in northern iraq he have gas many iranians and 40 iraqi village

 my nation will work with the u.n. security council to meet our common challenge if iraq 's regime defy we again the world must move deliberately decisively to hold iraq to account we will work with the u.n. security council for the necessary resolution but the purpose of the united states should not be doubt the security council resolution will be enforce the just demand of peace and security will be meet or action will be unavoidable and a regime that have lose its legitimacy will also lose its power

 event can turn in one of two way if we fail to act in the face of danger the people of iraq will continue to live in brutal submission the regime will have new power to bully and dominate and conquer its neighbor condemn the middle east to more year of bloodshed and fear the regime will remain unstable the region will remain unstable with little hope of freedom and isolate from the progress of our time with every step the iraqi regime take toward gain and deploy the most terrible weapon our own option to confront that regime will narrow and if an emboldened regime be to supply these weapon to terrorist ally then the attack of september the 11th would be a prelude to far great horror

 if we meet our responsibility if we overcome this danger we can arrive at a very different future the people of iraq can shake off their captivity they can one day join a democratic afghanistan and a democratic palestine inspire reform throughout the muslim world these nation can show by their example that honest government and respect for woman and the great islamic tradition of learn can triumph in the middle east and beyond and we will show that the promise of the united nations can be fulfil in our time

 neither of these outcome be certain both have be set before we we must choose between a world of fear and a world of progress we can not stand by and do nothing while danger gather we must stand up for our security and for the permanent right and the hope of mankind by heritage and by choice the united states of america will make that stand and delegate to the united nations you have the power to make that stand as well

 thank you very much applause

mr. speaker vice president cheney member of congress distinguished citizen and fellow citizen

 every year by law and by custom we meet here to consider the state of the union this year we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive day that lie ahead

 you and i serve our country in a time of great consequence during this session of congress we have the duty to reform domestic program vital to our country we have the opportunity to save million of life abroad from a terrible disease we will work for a prosperity that be broadly shared and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threaten the american people

 in all these day of promise and day of reckoning we can be confident in a whirlwind of change and hope and peril our faith be sure our resolve be firm and our union be strong

 this country have many challenge we will not deny we will not ignore we will not pass along our problem to other congresses to other president and other generation we will confront they with focus and clarity and courage

 during the last two year we have see what can be accomplish when we work together to lift the standard of our public school we achieve historic education reform which must now be carry out in every school and in every classroom so that every child in america can read and learn and succeed in life to protect our country we reorganize our government and create the department of homeland security which be mobilize against the threat of a new era to bring our economy out of recession we deliver the large tax relief in a generation to insist on integrity in american business we pass tough reform and we be hold corporate criminal to account

 some might call this a good record i call it a good start tonight i ask the house and the senate to join i in the next bold step to serve our fellow citizen

 our first goal be clear we must have an economy that grow fast enough to employ every man and woman who seek a job after recession terrorist attack corporate scandal and stock market decline our economy be recover yet it be not grow fast enough or strongly enough with unemployment rise our nation need more small business to open more company to invest and expand more employer to put up the sign that say help wanted

 job be create when the economy grow the economy grow when americans have more money to spend and invest and the good and fairest way to make sure americans have that money be not to tax it away in the first place

 i be propose that all the income tax reduction set for 2004 and 2006 be make permanent and effective this year and under my plan as soon as i have sign the bill this extra money will start show up in worker paycheck instead of gradually reduce the marriage penalty we should do it now instead of slowly raise the child credit to $ 1,000 we should send the check to american family now

 the tax relief be for everyone who pay income taxis and it will help our economy immediately 92 million americans will keep this year an average of almost $ 1,100 more of their own money a family of four with an income of $ 40,000 would see their federal income taxis fall from $ 1,178 to $ 45 per year our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small business

 you the congress have already pass all these reduction and promise they for future year if this tax relief be good for americans three or five or seven year from now it be even well for americans today

 we should also strengthen the economy by treat investor equally in our tax law it be fair to tax a company 's profit it be not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profit to boost investor confidence and to help the nearly 10 million senior who receive dividend income i ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividend

 low taxis and great investment will help this economy expand more job mean more taxpayer and high revenue to our government the good way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget be to encourage economic growth and to show some spending discipline in washington d.c.

 we must work together to fund only our most important priority i will send you a budget that increase discretionary spending by 4 percent next year about as much as the average family 's income be expect to grow and that be a good benchmark for we federal spending should not rise any fast than the paycheck of american family

 a grow economy and a focus on essential priority will be crucial to the future of social security as we continue to work together to keep social security sound and reliable we must offer young worker a chance to invest in retirement account that they will control and they will own

 our second goal be high quality affordable health for all americans the american system of medicine be a model of skill and innovation with a pace of discovery that be add good year to our life yet for many people medical care cost too much and many have no health coverage at all these problem will not be solve with a nationalize health care system that dictate coverage and ration care

 instead we must work toward a system in which all americans have a good insurance policy choose their own doctor and senior and low income americans receive the help they need instead of bureaucrat and trial lawyer and hmos we must put doctor and nurse and patient back in charge of american medicine

 health care reform must begin with medicare medicare be the bind commitment of a caring society we must renew that commitment by give senior access to preventive medicine and new drug that be transform health care in america

 senior happy with the current medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it be and just like you the member of congress and your staff and other federal employee all senior should have the choice of a health care plan that provide prescription drug

 my budget will commit an additional $ 400 billion over the next decade to reform and strengthen medicare leader of both political party have talk for year about strengthen medicare i urge the member of this new congress to act this year

 to improve our health care system we must address one of the prime cause of high cost the constant threat that physician and hospital will be unfairly sue because of excessive litigation everybody pay more for health care and many part of america be lose fine doctor no one have ever be heal by a frivolous lawsuit i urge the congress to pass medical liability reform

 our third goal be to promote energy independence for our country while dramatically improve the environment i have send you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation to develop clean technology and to produce more energy at home i have send you clear skies legislation that mandate a 70 percent cut in air pollution from powerplant over the next 15 year i have send you a healthy forests initiative to help prevent the catastrophic fire that devastate community kill wildlife and burn away million of acre of treasured forest

 i urge you to pass these measure for the good of both our environment and our economy even more i ask you to take a crucial step and protect our environment in way that generation before we could not have imagine

 in this century the great environmental progress will come about not through endless lawsuit or command and control regulation but through technology and innovation tonight i be propose $ 1.2 billion in research funding so that america can lead the world in develop clean hydrogen power automobile

 a simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generate energy which can be use to power a car produce only water not exhaust fume with a new national commitment our scientist and engineer will overcome obstacle to take these car from laboratory to showroom so that the first car drive by a child bear today could be power by hydrogen and pollution free join i in this important innovation to make our air significantly clean and our country much less dependent on foreign source of energy

 our fourth goal be to apply the compassion of america to the deep problem of america for so many in our country the homeless and the fatherless the addict the need be great yet there be power wonder work power in the goodness and idealism and faith of the american people

 americans be do the work of compassion every day visit prisoner provide shelter for battered woman bring companionship to lonely senior these good work deserve our praise they deserve our personal support and when appropriate they deserve the assistance of the federal government

 i urge you to pass both my faith base initiative and the citizen service act to encourage act of compassion that can transform america one heart and one soul at a time

 last year i call on my fellow citizen to participate in the usa freedom corps which be enlist ten of thousand of new volunteer across america tonight i ask congress and the american people to focus the spirit of service and the resource of government on the need of some of our most vulnerable citizen boy and girl try to grow up without guidance and attention and child who have to go through a prison gate to be hug by their mom or dad i propose a $ 450 million initiative to bring mentor to more than a million disadvantaged junior high student and child of prisoner government will support the training and recruiting of mentor yet it be the man and woman of america who will fill the need one mentor one person can change a life forever and i urge you to be that one person

 another cause of hopelessness be addiction to drug addiction crowd out friendship ambition moral conviction and reduce all the richness of life to a single destructive desire as a government we be fight illegal drug by cut off supply and reduce demand through antidrug education program yet for those already addict the fight against drug be a fight for their own life too many americans in search of treatment can not get it so tonight i propose a new $ 600 million program to help an additional 300,000 americans receive treatment over the next three year

 our nation be bless with recovery program that do amazing work one of they be find at the healing place church in baton rouge louisiana a man in the program say god do miracle in people 's life and you never think it could be you tonight let we bring to all americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope the miracle of recovery be possible and it could be you

 since september 11 our intelligence and law enforcement agency have work more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorist the fbi be improve its ability to analyze intelligence and be transform itself to meet new threat tonight i be instruct the leader of the fbi the cia the homeland security and the department of defense to develop a terrorist threat integration center to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location our government must have the very good information possible and we will use it to make sure the right people be in the right place to protect all our citizen

 our war against terror be a contest of will in which perseverance be power in the ruin of two tower at the western wall of the pentagon on a field in pennsylvania this nation make a pledge and we renew that pledge tonight whatever the duration of this struggle and whatever the difficulty we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affair of man free people will set the course of history

 today the grave danger in the war on terror the grave danger face america and the world be outlaw regime that seek and possess nuclear chemical and biological weapon these regime could use such weapon for blackmail terror and mass murder they could also give or sell those weapon to terrorist ally who would use they without the least hesitation

 this threat be new america 's duty be familiar throughout the 20th century small group of man seize control of great nation build army and arsenal and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world in each case their ambition of cruelty and murder have no limit in each case the ambition of hitlerism militarism and communism be defeat by the will of free people by the strength of great alliance and by the might of the united states of america

 now in this century the ideology of power and domination have appear again and seek to gain the ultimate weapon of terror once again this nation and all our friend be all that stand between a world at peace and a world of chaos and constant alarm once again we be call to defend the safety of our people and the hope of all mankind and we accept this responsibility

 america be make a broad and determined effort to confront these danger we have call on the united nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand that iraq disarm we be strongly support the international atomic energy agency in its mission to track and control nuclear material around the world we be work with other government to secure nuclear material in the former soviet union and to strengthen global treaty ban the production and shipment of missile technology and weapon of mass destruction

 in all these effort however america 's purpose be more than to follow a process it be to achieve a result the end of terrible threat to the civilized world all free nation have a stake in prevent sudden and catastrophic attack and we be ask they to join we and many be do so yet the course of this nation do not depend on the decision of other whatever action be require whenever action be necessary i will defend the freedom and security of the american people

 different threat require different strategy in iran we continue to see a government that repress its people pursue weapon of mass destruction and support terror we also see iranian citizen risk intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and human right and democracy iranian like all people have a right to choose their own government and determine their own destiny and the united states support their aspiration to live in freedom

 on the korean peninsula an oppressive regime rule a people live in fear and starvation throughout the 1990 the united states rely on a negotiate framework to keep north korea from gain nuclear weapon we now know that that regime be deceive the world and develop those weapon all along and today the north korean regime be use its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concession america and the world will not be blackmail

 america be work with the country of the region south korea japan china and russia to find a peaceful solution and to show the north korean government that nuclear weapon will bring only isolation economic stagnation and continued hardship the north korean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people only when it turn away from its nuclear ambition

 our nation and the world must learn the lesson of the korean peninsula and not allow an even great threat to rise up in iraq a brutal dictator with a history of reckless aggression with tie to terrorism with great potential wealth will not be permit to dominate a vital region and threaten the united states

 twelve year ago saddam hussein face the prospect of be the last casualty in a war he have start and lose to spare himself he agree to disarm of all weapon of mass destruction for the next 12 year he systematically violate that agreement he pursue chemical biological and nuclear weapon even while inspector be in his country nothing to date have restrain he from his pursuit of these weapon not economic sanction not isolation from the civilized world not even cruise missile strike on his military facility

 almost three month ago the united nations security council give saddam hussein his final chance to disarm he have show instead utter contempt for the united nations and for the opinion of the world the 108 u.n. inspector be send to conduct be not send to conduct a scavenger hunt for hide material across a country the size of california the job of the inspector be to verify that iraq 's regime be disarm it be up to iraq to show exactly where it be hide its ban weapon lie those weapon out for the world to see and destroy they as direct nothing like this have happen

 the united nations conclude in 1999 that saddam hussein have biological weapon sufficient to produce over 25,000 liter of anthrax enough dose to kill several million people he have not account for that material he be give no evidence that he have destroy it the united nations conclude that saddam hussein have material sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liter of botulinum toxin enough to subject million of people to death by respiratory failure he have not account for that material he be give no evidence that he have destroy it our intelligence official estimate that saddam hussein have the material to produce as much as 500 ton of sarin mustard and vx nerve agent in such quantity these chemical agent could also kill untold thousand he be not account for these material he have give no evidence that he have destroy they u.s. intelligence indicate that saddam hussein have upwards of 30,000 munition capable of deliver chemical agent inspector recently turn up 16 of they despite iraq 's recent declaration deny their existence saddam hussein have not account for the remain 29,984 of these prohibit munition he be give no evidence that he have destroy they

 from three iraqi defector we know that iraq in the late 1990 have several mobile biological weapon lab these be design to produce germ warfare agent and can be move from place to a place to evade inspector saddam hussein have not disclose these facility he be give no evidence that he have destroy they

 the international atomic energy agency confirm in the 1990 that saddam hussein have an advanced nuclear weapon development program have a design for a nuclear weapon and be work on five different method of enrich uranium for a bomb the british government have learn that saddam hussein recently seek significant quantity of uranium from africa our intelligence source tell we that he have attempt to purchase high strength aluminum tube suitable for nuclear weapon production saddam hussein have not credibly explain these activity he clearly have much to hide

 the dictator of iraq be not disarm to the contrary he be deceive from intelligence source we know for instance that thousand of iraqi security personnel be at work hiding document and material from the u.n. inspector sanitize inspection site and monitor the inspector themselves iraqi official accompany the inspector in order to intimidate witness

 iraq be block u-2 surveillance flight request by the united nations iraqi intelligence officer be pose as the scientist inspector be suppose to interview real scientist have be coach by iraqi official on what to say intelligence source indicate that saddam hussein have order that scientist who cooperate with u.n. inspector in disarm iraq will be kill along with their family

 year after year saddam hussein have go to elaborate length spend enormous sum take great risk to build and keep weapon of mass destruction but why the only possible explanation the only possible use he could have for those weapon be to dominate intimidate or attack

 with nuclear arm or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapon saddam hussein could resume his ambition of conquest in the middle east and create deadly havoc in that region and this congress and the american people must recognize another threat evidence from intelligence source secret communication and statement by people now in custody reveal that saddam hussein aid and protect terrorist include member of al qaeda secretly and without fingerprint he could provide one of his hide weapon to terrorist or help they develop their own

 before september 11 many in the world believe that saddam hussein could be contain but chemical agent lethal virus and shadowy terrorist network be not easily contain imagine those 19 hijacker with other weapon and other plan this time arm by saddam hussein it would take one vial one canister one crate slip into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever know we will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never come

 some have say we must not act until the threat be imminent since when have terrorist and tyrant announce their intention politely put we on notice before they strike if this threat be permit to fully and suddenly emerge all action all word and all recrimination would come too late trust in the sanity and restraint of saddam hussein be not a strategy and it be not an option

 the dictator who be assemble the world 's most dangerous weapon have already use they on whole village leave thousand of his own citizen dead blind or disfigure iraqi refugee tell we how force confession be obtain by torture child while their parent be make to watch international human right group have catalog other method use in the torture chamber of iraq electric shock burn with hot iron dripping acid on the skin mutilation with electric drill cut out tongue and rape if this be not evil then evil have no meaning

 and tonight i have a message for the brave and oppress people of iraq your enemy be not surround your country your enemy be rule your country and the day he and his regime be remove from power will be the day of your liberation

 the world have wait 12 year for iraq to disarm america will not accept a serious and mount threat to our country and our friend and our ally the united states will ask the u.n. security council to convene on february 5 to consider the fact of iraq 's ongoing defiance of the world secretary of state powell will present information and intelligence about iraqi 's legal iraq 's illegal weapon program its attempt to hide those weapon from inspector and its link to terrorist group

 we will consult but let there be no misunderstanding if saddam hussein do not fully disarm for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world we will lead a coalition to disarm he

 tonight i have a message for the man and woman who will keep the peace member of the american armed force many of you be assemble in or near the middle east and some crucial hour may lay ahead in those hour the success of our cause will depend on you your training have prepare you your honor will guide you you believe in america and america believe in you

 send americans into battle be the most profound decision a president can make the technology of war have change the risk and suffering of war have not for the brave americans who bear the risk no victory be free from sorrow this nation fight reluctantly because we know the cost and we dread the day of mourning that always come

 we seek peace we strive for peace and sometimes peace must be defend a future live at the mercy of terrible threat be no peace at all if war be force upon we we will fight in a just cause and by just mean spare in every way we can the innocent and if war be force upon we we will fight with the full force and might of the united states military and we will prevail

 and as we and our coalition partner be do in afghanistan we will bring to the iraqi people food and medicine and supply and freedom

 many challenge abroad and at home have arrive in a single season in two year america have go from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril from bitter division in small matter to calm unity in great cause and we go forward with confidence because this call of history have come to the right country

 americans be a resolute people who have rise to every test of our time adversity have reveal the character of our country to the world and to ourselves america be a strong nation and honorable in the use of our strength we exercise power without conquest and we sacrifice for the liberty of stranger

 americans be a free people who know that freedom be the right of every person and the future of every nation the liberty we prize be not america 's gift to the world it be god 's gift to humanity

 we americans have faith in ourselves but not in ourselves alone we do not know we do not claim to know all the way of providence yet we can trust in they place our confidence in the love god behind all of life and all of history

 may he guide we now and may god continue to bless the united states of america

my fellow citizen event in iraq have now reach the final day of decision for more than a decade the united states and other nation have pursue patient and honorable effort to disarm the iraqi regime without war that regime pledge to reveal and destroy all its weapon of mass destruction as a condition for end the persian gulf war in 1991

 since then the world have engage in 12 year of diplomacy we have pass more than a dozen resolution in the united nations security council we have send hundred of weapon inspector to oversee the disarmament of iraq our good faith have not be return

 the iraqi regime have use diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage it have uniformly defy security council resolution demand full disarmament over the year u.n. weapon inspector have be threaten by iraqi official electronically bug and systematically deceive peaceful effort to disarm the iraqi regime have fail again and again because we be not deal with peaceful man

 intelligence gather by this and other government leave no doubt that the iraq regime continue to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapon ever devise this regime have already use weapon of mass destruction against iraq 's neighbor and against iraq 's people

 the regime have a history of reckless aggression in the middle east it have a deep hatred of america and our friend and it have aid train and harbor terrorist include operative of al qaeda

 the danger be clear use chemical biological or one day nuclear weapon obtain with the help of iraq the terrorist could fulfill their stated ambition and kill thousand or hundred of thousand of innocent people in our country or any other

 the united states and other nation do nothing to deserve or invite this threat but we will do everything to defeat it instead of drift along toward tragedy we will set a course toward safety before the day of horror can come before it be too late to act this danger will be remove

 the united states of america have the sovereign authority to use force in assure its own national security that duty fall to i as commander in chief by the oath i have swear by the oath i will keep

 recognize the threat to our country the united states congress vote overwhelmingly last year to support the use of force against iraq america try to work with the united nations to address this threat because we want to resolve the issue peacefully we believe in the mission of the united nations one reason the u.n. be found after the second world war be to confront aggressive dictator actively and early before they can attack the innocent and destroy the peace

 in the case of iraq the security council do act in the early 1990 under resolutions 678 and 687 both still in effect the united states and our ally be authorize to use force in rid iraq of weapon of mass destruction this be not a question of authority it be a question of will

 last september i go to the u.n. general assembly and urge the nation of the world to unite and bring an end to this danger on november 8th the security council unanimously pass resolution 1441 find iraq in material breach of its obligation and vow serious consequence if iraq do not fully and immediately disarm

 today no nation can possibly claim that iraq have disarm and it will not disarm so long as saddam hussein hold power for the last four and a half month the united states and our ally have work within the security council to enforce that council 's long stand demand yet some permanent member of the security council have publicly announce they will veto any resolution that compel the disarmament of iraq these government share our assessment of the danger but not our resolve to meet it many nation however do have the resolve and fortitude to act against this threat to peace and a broad coalition be now gather to enforce the just demand of the world the united nations security council have not live up to its responsibility so we will rise to ours

 in recent day some government in the middle east have be do their part they have deliver public and private message urge the dictator to leave iraq so that disarmament can proceed peacefully he have thus far refuse all the decade of deceit and cruelty have now reach an end saddam hussein and his son must leave iraq within 48 hour their refusal to do so will result in military conflict commence at a time of our choosing for their own safety all foreign national include journalist and inspector should leave iraq immediately

 many iraqis can hear i tonight in a translate radio broadcast and i have a message for they if we must begin a military campaign it will be direct against the lawless man who rule your country and not against you as our coalition take away their power we will deliver the food and medicine you need we will tear down the apparatus of terror and we will help you to build a new iraq that be prosperous and free in a free iraq there will be no more war of aggression against your neighbor no more poison factory no more execution of dissident no more torture chamber and rape room the tyrant will soon be go the day of your liberation be near

 it be too late for saddam hussein to remain in power it be not too late for the iraqi military to act with honor and protect your country by permit the peaceful entry of coalition force to eliminate weapon of mass destruction our force will give iraqi military unit clear instruction on action they can take to avoid be attack and destroy i urge every member of the iraqi military and intelligence service if war come do not fight for a die regime that be not worth your own life

 and all iraqi military and civilian personnel should listen carefully to this warning in any conflict your fate will depend on your action do not destroy oil well a source of wealth that belong to the iraqi people do not obey any command to use weapon of mass destruction against anyone include the iraqi people war crime will be prosecute war criminal will be punish and it will be no defense to say i be just follow order

 should saddam hussein choose confrontation the american people can know that every measure have be take to avoid war and every measure will be take to win it americans understand the cost of conflict because we have pay they in the past war have no certainty except the certainty of sacrifice

 yet the only way to reduce the harm and duration of war be to apply the full force and might of our military and we be prepared to do so if saddam hussein attempt to cling to power he will remain a deadly foe until the end in desperation he and terrorist group might try to conduct terrorist operation against the american people and our friend these attack be not inevitable they be however possible and this very fact underscore the reason we can not live under the threat of blackmail the terrorist threat to america and the world will be diminish the moment that saddam hussein be disarm

 our government be on heighten watch against these danger just as we be prepare to ensure victory in iraq we be take further action to protect our homeland in recent day american authority have expel from the country certain individual with tie to iraqi intelligence service among other measure i have direct additional security of our airport and increase coast guard patrol of major seaport the department of homeland security be work closely with the nation 's governor to increase armed security at critical facility across america

 should enemy strike our country they would be attempt to shift our attention with panic and weaken our morale with fear in this they would fail no act of theirs can alter the course or shake the resolve of this country we be a peaceful people yet we be not a fragile people and we will not be intimidate by thug and killer if our enemy dare to strike we they and all who have aid they will face fearful consequence

 we be now act because the risk of inaction would be far great in one year or five year the power of iraq to inflict harm on all free nation would be multiply many time over with these capability saddam hussein and his terrorist ally could choose the moment of deadly conflict when they be strong we choose to meet that threat now where it arise before it can appear suddenly in our sky and city

 the cause of peace require all free nation to recognize new and undeniable reality in the 20th century some choose to appease murderous dictator whose threat be allow to grow into genocide and global war in this century when evil man plot chemical biological and nuclear terror a policy of appeasement could bring destruction of a kind never before see on this earth

 terrorist and terror state do not reveal these threat with fair notice in formal declaration and respond to such enemy only after they have strike first be not self defense it be suicide the security of the world require disarm saddam hussein now

 as we enforce the just demand of the world we will also honor the deep commitment of our country unlike saddam hussein we believe the iraqi people be deserve and capable of human liberty and when the dictator have depart they can set an example to all the middle east of a vital and peaceful and self govern nation

 the united states with other country will work to advance liberty and peace in that region our goal will not be achieve overnight but it can come over time the power and appeal of human liberty be feel in every life and every land and the great power of freedom be to overcome hatred and violence and turn the creative gift of man and woman to the pursuit of peace

 that be the future we choose free nation have a duty to defend our people by unite against the violent and tonight as we have do before america and our ally accept that responsibility

 good night and may god continue to bless america

my fellow citizen at this hour american and coalition force be in the early stage of military operation to disarm iraq to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger

 on my order coalition force have begin strike select target of military importance to undermine saddam hussein 's ability to wage war these be open stage of what will be a broad and concerted campaign more than 35 country be give crucial support from the use of naval and air basis to help with intelligence and logistic to the deployment of combat unit every nation in this coalition have choose to bear the duty and share the honor of serve in our common defense

 to all the man and woman of the united states armed forces now in the middle east the peace of a troubled world and the hope of an oppressed people now depend on you that trust be well place

 the enemy you confront will come to know your skill and bravery the people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the american military in this conflict america face an enemy who have no regard for convention of war or rule of morality saddam hussein have place iraqi troop and equipment in civilian area attempt to use innocent man woman and child as shield for his own military a final atrocity against his people

 i want americans and all the world to know that coalition force will make every effort to spare innocent civilian from harm a campaign on the harsh terrain of a nation as large as california could be long and more difficult than some predict and help iraqis achieve a united stable and free country will require our sustained commitment

 we come to iraq with respect for its citizen for their great civilization and for the religious faith they practice we have no ambition in iraq except to remove a threat and restore control of that country to its own people

 i know that the family of our military be pray that all those who serve will return safely and soon million of americans be pray with you for the safety of your love one and for the protection of the innocent for your sacrifice you have the gratitude and respect of the american people and you can know that our force will be come home as soon as their work be do

 our nation enter this conflict reluctantly yet our purpose be sure the people of the united states and our friend and ally will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threaten the peace with weapon of mass murder we will meet that threat now with our army air force navy coast guard and marines so that we do not have to meet it later with army of fire fighter and police and doctor on the street of our city

 now that conflict have come the only way to limit its duration be to apply decisive force and i assure you this will not be a campaign of half measure and we will accept no outcome but victory


 my fellow citizen the danger to our country and the world will be overcome we will pass through this time of peril and carry on the work of peace we will defend our freedom we will bring freedom to other and we will prevail

 may god bless our country and all who defend she

thank you all very much please be seat thank for the warm welcome and thank for invite i to join you in this 20th anniversary of the national endowment for democracy the staff and director of this organization have see a lot of history over the last two decade you have be a part of that history by speak for and stand for freedom you have lift the hope of people around the world and you have bring great credit to america

 i appreciate vin for the short introduction i be a man who like short introduction and he do not let i down but more importantly i appreciate the invitation i appreciate the member of congress who be here senator from both political party member of the house of representatives from both political party i appreciate the ambassador who be here i appreciate the guest who have come i appreciate the bipartisan spirit the nonpartisan spirit of the national endowment for democracy i be glad that republicans and democrats and independent be work together to advance human liberty

 the root of our democracy can be trace to england and to its parliament and so can the root of this organization in june of 1982 president ronald reagan speak at westminster palace and declare the turning point have arrive in history he argue that soviet communism have fail precisely because it do not respect its own people their creativity their genius and their right

 president reagan say that the day of soviet tyranny be pass that freedom have a momentum which would not be halt he give this organization its mandate to add to the momentum of freedom across the world your mandate be important 20 year ago it be equally important today applause

 a number of critic be dismissive of that speech by the president accord to one editorial of the time it seem hard to be a sophisticated european and also an admirer of ronald reagan laughter some observer on both side of the atlantic pronounce the speech simplistic and naive and even dangerous in fact ronald reagan 's word be courageous and optimistic and entirely correct applause

 the great democratic movement president reagan describe be already well underway in the early 1970 there be about 40 democracy in the world by the middle of that decade portugal and spain and greece hold free election soon there be new democracy in latin america and free institution be spread in korea in taiwan and in east asia this very week in 1989 there be protest in east berlin and in leipzig by the end of that year every communist dictatorship in central america have collapse within another year the south african government release nelson mandela four year later he be elect president of his country ascend like walesa and havel from prisoner of state to head of state

 as the 20th century end there be around 120 democracy in the world and i can assure you more be on the way applause ronald reagan would be please and he would not be surprised

 we have witness in little over a generation the swift advance of freedom in the 2,500 year story of democracy historian in the future will offer their own explanation for why this happen yet we already know some of the reason they will cite it be no accident that the rise of so many democracy take place in a time when the world 's most influential nation be itself a democracy

 the united states make military and moral commitment in europe and asia which protect free nation from aggression and create the condition in which new democracy could flourish as we provide security for whole nation we also provide inspiration for oppressed people in prison camp in ban union meeting in clandestine church man and woman know that the whole world be not share their own nightmare they know of at least one place a bright and hopeful land where freedom be value and secure and they pray that america would not forget they or forget the mission to promote liberty around the world

 historian will note that in many nation the advance of market and free enterprise help to create a middle class that be confident enough to demand their own right they will point to the role of technology in frustrating censorship and central control and marvel at the power of instant communication to spread the truth the news and courage across border

 historian in the future will reflect on an extraordinary undeniable fact over time free nation grow strong and dictatorship grow weak in the middle of the 20th century some imagine that the central planning and social regimentation be a shortcut to national strength in fact the prosperity and social vitality and technological progress of a people be directly determine by extent of their liberty freedom honor and unleash human creativity and creativity determine the strength and wealth of nation liberty be both the plan of heaven for humanity and the good hope for progress here on earth

 the progress of liberty be a powerful trend yet we also know that liberty if not defend can be lose the success of freedom be not determine by some dialectic of history by definition the success of freedom rest upon the choice and the courage of free people and upon their willingness to sacrifice in the trench of world war i through a two front war in the 1940 the difficult battle of korea and vietnam and in mission of rescue and liberation on nearly every continent americans have amply display our willingness to sacrifice for liberty

 the sacrifice of americans have not always be recognize or appreciate yet they have be worthwhile because we and our ally be steadfast germany and japan be democratic nation that no long threaten the world a global nuclear standoff with the soviet union end peacefully as do the soviet union the nation of europe be move towards unity not divide into armed camp and descend into genocide every nation have learn or should have learn an important lesson freedom be worth fight for die for and stand for and the advance of freedom lead to peace applause

 and now we must apply that lesson in our own time we have reach another great turning point and the resolve we show will shape the next stage of the world democratic movement

 our commitment to democracy be test in country like cuba and burma and north korea and zimbabwe outpost of oppression in our world the people in these nation live in captivity and fear and silence yet these regime can not hold back freedom forever and one day from prison camp and prison cell and from exile the leader of new democracy will arrive applause communism and militarism and rule by the capricious and corrupt be the relic of a pass era and we will stand with these oppress people until the day of their freedom finally arrive applause

 our commitment to democracy be test in china that nation now have a sliver a fragment of liberty yet china 's people will eventually want their liberty pure and whole china have discover that economic freedom lead to national wealth china 's leader will also discover that freedom be indivisible that social and religious freedom be also essential to national greatness and national dignity eventually man and woman who be allow to control their own wealth will insist on control their own life and their own country

 our commitment to democracy be also test in the middle east which be my focus today and must be a focus of american policy for decade to come in many nation of the middle east country of great strategic importance democracy have not yet take root and the question arise be the people of the middle east somehow beyond the reach of liberty be million of man and woman and child condemn by history or culture to live in despotism be they alone never to know freedom and never even to have a choice in the matter i for one do not believe it i believe every person have the ability and the right to be free applause

 some skeptic of democracy assert that the tradition of islam be inhospitable to the representative government this cultural condescension as ronald reagan term it have a long history after the japanese surrender in 1945 a so call japan expert assert that democracy in that former empire would never work another observer declare the prospect for democracy in post hitler germany be and i quote most uncertain at good he make that claim in 1957 seventy four year ago the sunday london times declare nine tenth of the population of india to be illiterate not care a fig for politic yet when indian democracy be imperil in the 1970 the indian people show their commitment to liberty in a national referendum that save their form of government

 time after time observer have question whether this country or that people or this group be ready for democracy as if freedom be a prize you win for meet our own western standard of progress in fact the daily work of democracy itself be the path of progress it teach cooperation the free exchange of idea and the peaceful resolution of difference as man and woman be show from bangladesh to botswana to mongolia it be the practice of democracy that make a nation ready for democracy and every nation can start on this path

 it should be clear to all that islam the faith of one fifth of humanity be consistent with democratic rule democratic progress be find in many predominantly muslim country in turkey and indonesia and senegal and albania niger and sierra leone muslim man and woman be good citizen of india and south africa of the nation of western europe and of the united states of america

 more than half of all the muslims in the world live in freedom under democratically constitute government they succeed in democratic society not in spite of their faith but because of it a religion that demand individual moral accountability and encourage the encounter of the individual with god be fully compatible with the right and responsibility of self government

 yet there be a great challenge today in the middle east in the word of a recent report by arab scholar the global wave of democracy have and i quote barely reach the arab state they continue this freedom deficit undermine human development and be one of the most painful manifestation of lag political development the freedom deficit they describe have terrible consequence of the people of the middle east and for the world in many middle eastern country poverty be deep and it be spread woman lack right and be deny schooling whole society remain stagnant while the world move ahead these be not the failure of a culture or a religion these be the failure of political and economic doctrine

 as the colonial era pass away the middle east see the establishment of many military dictatorship some ruler adopt the dogma of socialism seize total control of political party and the medium and university they ally themselves with the soviet bloc and with international terrorism dictator in iraq and syria promise the restoration of national honor a return to ancient glory they have leave instead a legacy of torture oppression misery and ruin

 other man and group of man have gain influence in the middle east and beyond through an ideology of theocratic terror behind their language of religion be the ambition for absolute political power rule cabal like the taliban show their version of religious piety in public whipping of woman ruthless suppression of any difference or dissent and support for terrorist who arm and train to murder the innocent the taliban promise religious purity and national pride instead by systematically destroy a proud and work society they leave behind suffering and starvation

 many middle eastern government now understand that military dictatorship and theocratic rule be a straight smooth highway to nowhere but some government still cle to the old habit of central control there be government that still fear and repress independent thought and creativity and private enterprise the human quality that make for a strong and successful society even when these nation have vast natural resource they do not respect or develop their great resource the talent and energy of man and woman work and live in freedom

 instead of dwell on past wrong and blame other government in the middle east need to confront real problem and serve the true interest of their nation the good and capable people of the middle east all deserve responsible leadership for too long many people in that region have be victim and subject they deserve to be active citizen

 government across the middle east and north africa be begin to see the need for change morocco have a diverse new parliament king mohammed have urge it to extend the right to woman here be how his majesty explain his reform to parliament how can society achieve progress while woman who represent half the nation see their right violate and suffer as a result of injustice violence and marginalization notwithstanding the dignity and justice grant to they by our glorious religion the king of morocco be correct the future of muslim nation will be well for all with the full participation of woman applause

 in bahrain last year citizen elect their own parliament for the first time in nearly three decade oman have extend the vote to all adult citizen qatar have a new constitution yemen have a multiparty political system kuwait have a directly elect national assembly and jordan hold historic election this summer recent survey in arab nation reveal broad support for political pluralism the rule of law and free speech these be the stirring of middle eastern democracy and they carry the promise of great change to come

 as change come to the middle eastern region those with power should ask themselves will they be remember for resist reform or for lead it in iran the demand for democracy be strong and broad as we see last month when thousand gather to welcome home shirin ebadi the winner of the nobel peace prize the regime in teheran must heed the democratic demand of the iranian people or lose its last claim to legitimacy applause

 for the palestinian people the only path to independence and dignity and progress be the path of democracy applause and the palestinian leader who block and undermine democratic reform and feed hatred and encourage violence be not leader at all they be the main obstacle to peace and to the success of the palestinian people

 the saudi government be take first step toward reform include a plan for gradual introduction of election by give the saudi people a great role in their own society the saudi government can demonstrate true leadership in the region

 the great and proud nation of egypt have show the way toward peace in the middle east and now should show the way toward democracy in the middle east applause champion of democracy in the region understand that democracy be not perfect it be not the path to utopia but it be the only path to national success and dignity

 as we watch and encourage reform in the region we be mindful that modernization be not the same as westernization representative government in the middle east will reflect their own culture they will not and should not look like we democratic nation may be constitutional monarchy federal republic or parliamentary system and work democracy always need time to develop as do our own we have take a 200 year journey toward inclusion and justice and this make we patient and understanding as other nation be at different stage of this journey

 there be however essential principle common to every successful society in every culture successful society limit the power of the state and the power of the military so that government respond to the will of the people and not the will of an elite successful society protect freedom with the consistent and impartial rule of law instead of select apply selectively apply the law to punish political opponent successful society allow room for healthy civic institution for political party and labor union and independent newspaper and broadcast medium successful society guarantee religious liberty the right to serve and honor god without fear of persecution successful society privatize their economy and secure the right of property they prohibit and punish official corruption and invest in the health and education of their people they recognize the right of woman and instead of direct hatred and resentment against other successful society appeal to the hope of their own people applause

 these vital principle be be apply in the nation of afghanistan and iraq with the steady leadership of president karzai the people of afghanistan be build a modern and peaceful government next month 500 delegate will convene a national assembly in kabul to approve a new afghan constitution the propose draft would establish a bicameral parliament set national election next year and recognize afghanistan 's muslim identity while protect the right of all citizen afghanistan face continue economic and security challenge it will face those challenge as a free and stable democracy applause

 in iraq the coalition provisional authority and the iraqi governing council be also work together to build a democracy and after three decade of tyranny this work be not easy the former dictator rule by terror and treachery and leave deeply ingrain habit of fear and distrust remnant of his regime join by foreign terrorist continue their battle against order and against civilization our coalition be respond to recent attack with precision raid guide by intelligence provide by the iraqis themselves and we be work closely with iraqi citizen as they prepare a constitution as they move toward free election and take increase responsibility for their own affair as in the defense of greece in 1947 and later in the berlin airlift the strength and will of free people be now be test before a watch world and we will meet this test applause

 secure democracy in iraq be the work of many hand american and coalition force be sacrifice for the peace of iraq and for the security of free nation aid worker from many country be face danger to help the iraqi people the national endowment for democracy be promote woman 's right and train iraqi journalist and teach the skill of political participation iraqis themselves police and border guard and local official be join in the work and they be share in the sacrifice

 this be a massive and difficult undertaking it be worth our effort it be worth our sacrifice because we know the stake the failure of iraqi democracy would embolden terrorist around the world increase danger to the american people and extinguish the hope of million in the region iraqi democracy will succeed and that success will send forth the news from damascus to teheran that freedom can be the future of every nation applause the establishment of a free iraq at the heart of the middle east will be a watershed event in the global democratic revolution applause

 sixty year of western nation excuse and accommodate the lack of freedom in the middle east do nothing to make we safe because in the long run stability can not be purchase at the expense of liberty as long as the middle east remain a place where freedom do not flourish it will remain a place of stagnation resentment and violence ready for export and with the spread of weapon that can bring catastrophic harm to our country and to our friend it would be reckless to accept the status quo applause

 therefore the united states have adopt a new policy a forward strategy of freedom in the middle east this strategy require the same persistence and energy and idealism we have show before and it will yield the same result as in europe as in asia as in every region of the world the advance of freedom lead to peace applause

 the advance of freedom be the calling of our time it be the calling of our country from the fourteen points to the four freedoms to the speech at westminster america have put our power at the service of principle we believe that liberty be the design of nature we believe that liberty be the direction of history we believe that human fulfillment and excellence come in the responsible exercise of liberty and we believe that freedom the freedom we prize be not for we alone it be the right and the capacity of all mankind applause

 work for the spread of freedom can be hard yet america have accomplish hard task before our nation be strong we be strong of heart and we be not alone freedom be find ally in every country freedom find ally in every culture and as we meet the terror and violence of the world we can be certain the author of freedom be not indifferent to the fate of freedom

 medicare be a great achievement of a compassionate government and it be a basic trust we honor medicare have spare million of senior from needless hardship each generation benefit from medicare each generation have a duty to strengthen medicare and this generation be fulfil our duty

 first and foremost this new law will provide medicare coverage for prescription drug medicare be enact to provide senior with the late in modern medicine in 1965 that usually mean house call or operation or long hospital stay today modern medicine include out patient care disease screening and prescription drug

 medicine have change but medicare have not until today medicare today will pay for extended hospital stay for ulcer surgery that be at a cost of about $ 28,000 per patient yet medicare will not pay for the drug that eliminate the cause of most ulcer drug that cost about $ 500 a year it be a good thing that medicare pay when senior get sick now you see we be take this a step far medicare will pay for prescription drug so that few senior will get sick in the first place applause

 drug coverage under medicare will allow senior to replace more expensive surgery and hospitalization with less expensive prescription medicine and even more important drug coverage under medicare will save our senior from a lot of worry some old americans spend much of their social security check just on their medication some cut down on the dosage to make a bottle of pill last long elderly americans should not have to live with those kind of fear and hard choice this new law will ease the burden on senior and will give they the extra help they need

 senior will start see help quickly during the transition to the full prescription benefit senior will receive a drug discount card this medicare approve card will deliver saving of 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most medicine low income senior will receive the same saving plus a $ 600 credit on their card to help they pay for the medication they need

 in about two year full prescription coverage under medicare will begin in return for a monthly premium of about $ 35 most senior without any prescription drug coverage can now expect to see their current drug bill cut roughly in half this new law will provide 95 percent coverage for out of pocket drug spending that exceed $ 3,600 a year for the first time we be give senior peace of mind that they will not have to face unlimited expense for their medicine

 the new law offer special help to one third of old americans will low income such as a senior couple with low saving and an annual income of about $ 18,000 or less these senior will pay little or no premium for full drug coverage their deductible will be no high than $ 50 per year and their co payment on each prescription will be as little as $ 1 senior in the great need will have the great help under the modernized medicare system applause

 i visit with senior around the country and hear many of their story i be proud that this legislation will give they practical and much need help mary jane jones from midlothian virginia have a modest income her drug bill total nearly $ 500 a month thing get so tight for a while she have to use needle twice or three time for her insulin shot with this law mary jane will not have to go to such extreme in exchange for a monthly premium of about $ 35 mary jane jones would save nearly $ 2,700 in annual prescription drug spending

 hugh iverson from west des moines iowa just get his medicare membership and that be a good thing because he have not have health insurance for more than three year his drug bill total at least $ 400 a month within two year with the $ 35 a month coverage he will be able to cut those bill nearly in half save he about $ 2,400 a year

 neil legrow from culpepper virginia take 15 medication cost he at least $ 700 a month to afford all those medication neil have to stay work and thank to this law once he be enrol in the drug benefit he will be able to cut back his work hour and enjoy his retirement more because he will have coverage that save he about $ 4,700 a year

 i promise these senior when i meet with they that we would work hard to give they the help they need they be all here today so i be happy to report to they in person mary jane hugh and neil we be keep our promise applause

 in addition to provide coverage for prescription drug this legislation achieve a second great goal we be give our senior more health care choice so they can get the coverage and care that meet their need every senior need to know if you do not want to change your current coverage you do not have to change you be the one in charge if you want to keep your medicare the way it be along with the new prescription benefit that be your right if you want to improve benefit maybe dental coverage or eyeglass coverage or manage care plan that reduce out of pocket cost you will be free to make those choice as well

 and when senior have the ability to make choice health care plan within medicare will have to compete for their business by offer high quality service for the senior of america more choice and more control will mean well health care these be the kind of health care option we give to the member of congress and federal employee they have the ability to pick plan to that be right for their own need what be good for member of congress be also good for senior our senior be fully capable of make health care choice and this bill allow they to do just that applause

 a third purpose achieve by this legislation be smart medicine within the medicare system for year our senior have be deny medicare coverage have be deny medicare coverage for a basic physical exam begin in 2005 all newly enrol medicare beneficiary will be cover for a complete physical

 the medicare system will now help senior and their doctor diagnose health problem early so they can treat they early and our senior can have a well quality life for example start next year all people on medicare will be cover for blood test that can diagnose heart disease those at high risk for diabetes will be cover for blood sugar screening test modern health care be not complete without prevention so we be expand preventive service under medicare applause

 fourth the new law will help all americans pay for out of pocket health cost this legislation will create health saving account effective january 1 2004 so americans can set aside up to $ 4,500 every year tax free to save for medical expense depend on your tax bracket that mean you will save between 10 to 35 percent on any cost cover by money in your account our law encourage people to plan for retirement and to save for education now the law will make it easy for americans to save for their future health care as well applause

 a health saving account be a good deal and all americans should consider it every year the money not spend would stay in the account and gain interest tax free just like an ira and people will have an incentive to live more healthy lifestyle because they want to see their health saving account grow these account will be good for small business owner and employee more business can focus on cover worker for major medical problem such as hospitalization for an injury or illness and at the same time employee and their family will use these account to cover doctor visit or lab test or other small cost some employer will contribute to employee health account this will help more american family get the health care they need at the price they can afford

 the legislation i be about to sign will set in motion a series of improvement in the care available to all america 's senior citizen and as we begin it be important for senior and those approach retirement to understand their new benefit

 this come spring senior will receive a letter to explain the drug discount card in june these card include the $ 600 annual drug credit for low income senior will be activate this drug card can be use until the end of 2005 in the fall of that year senior will receive an information booklet give simple guidance on change in the program and the new choice they will have then in january of 2006 senior will have their new coverage include permanent coverage for prescription drug

 these reform be the act of a vibrant and compassionate government we show be concern for the dignity of our senior by give they quality health care we show our respect for senior by give they more choice and more control over their decision making we be put individual in charge of their health care decision and as we move to modernize and reform other program of this government we will always trust individual and their decision and put personal choice at the heart of our effort applause

 the challenge face senior on medicare be apparent for many year and those year pass with much debate and a lot of politic and little reform to show for it and that change with the 108th congress this year we meet our challenge with focus and perseverance we confront problem instead of pass they along to future administration and future congress we overcome old partisan difference we keep our promise and find a way to get the job do this legislation be the achievement of member in both political party and this legislation be a victory for all of america 's senior applause

 many of you here today be americans by choice and you have follow in the path of million and over the generation we have receive energetic ambitious optimistic people from every part of the world by tradition and conviction our country be a welcome society america be a strong and well nation because of the hard work and the faith and entrepreneurial spirit of immigrant

 every generation of immigrant have reaffirm the wisdom of remain open to the talent and dream of the world and every generation of immigrant have reaffirm our ability to assimilate newcomer which be one of the defining strength of our country

 during one great period of immigration between 1891 and 1920 our nation receive some 18 million man woman and child from other nation the hard work of these immigrant help make our economy the large in the world the child of immigrant put on the uniform and help to liberate the land of their ancestor one of the primary reason america become a great power in the 20th century be because we welcome the talent and the character and the patriotism of immigrant family

 the contribution of immigrant to america continue about 14 percent of our nation 's civilian workforce be foreign bear most begin their work life in america by take hard job and clock long hour in important industry many immigrant also start business take the familiar path from hire labor to ownership

 as a texan i have know many immigrant family mainly from mexico and i have see what they add to our country they bring to america the value of faith in god love of family hard work and self reliance the value that make we a great nation to begin with we have all see those value in action through the service and sacrifice of more than 35,000 foreign bear man and woman currently on active duty in the united states military one of they be master gunnery sergeant guadalupe denogean an immigrant from mexico who have serve in the marine corps for 25 year and counting last year i be honor and proud to witness sergeant denogean take the oath of citizenship in a hospital where he be recover from wound he receive in iraq i be honor to be his commander in chief i be proud to call he a fellow american applause

 as a nation that value immigration and depend on immigration we should have immigration law that work and make we proud yet today we do not instead we see many employer turn to the illegal labor market we see million of hard work man and woman condemn to fear and insecurity in a massive undocumented economy illegal entry across our border make more difficult the urgent task of secure the homeland the system be not work our nation need an immigration system that serve the american economy and reflect the american dream

 reform must begin by confront a basic fact of life and economic some of the job be generate in america 's grow economy be job american citizen be not fill yet these job represent a tremendous opportunity for worker from abroad who want to work and fulfill their duty as a husband or a wife a son or a daughter

 their search for a well life be one of the most basic desire of human being many undocumented worker have walk mile after mile through the heat of the day and the cold of the night some have risk their life in dangerous desert border crossing or entrust their life to the brutal ring of heartless human smuggler worker who seek only to earn a living end up in the shadow of american life fearful often abuse and exploit when they be victimize by crime they be afraid to call the police or seek recourse in the legal system they be cut off from their family far away fear if they leave our country to visit relative back home they might never be able to return to their job

 the situation i describe be wrong it be not the american way out of common sense and fairness our law should allow willing worker to enter our country and fill job that americans have be not fill applause we must make our immigration law more rational and more humane and i believe we can do so without jeopardize the livelihood of american citizen

 our reform should be guide by a few basic principle first america must control its border follow the attack of september the 11th 2001 this duty of the federal government have become even more urgent and we be fulfil that duty

 for the first time in our history we have consolidate all border agency under one roof to make sure they share information and the work be more effective we be match all visa applicant against an expand screening list to identify terrorist and criminal and immigration violator this month we have begin use advanced technology to well record and track alien who enter our country and to make sure they leave as schedule we have deploy new gamma and x ray system to scan cargo and container and shipment at port of entry to america we have significantly expand the border patrol with more than a thousand new agent on the border and 40 percent great funding over the last two year we be work closely with the canadian and mexican government to increase border security america be act on a basic belief our border should be open to legal travel and honest trade our border should be shut and bar tight to criminal to drug trader to drug trafficker and to criminal and to terrorist

 second new immigration law should serve the economic need of our country if an american employer be offer a job that american citizen be not willing to take we ought to welcome into our country a person who will fill that job

 third we should not give unfair reward to illegal immigrant in the citizenship process or disadvantage those who come here lawfully or hope to do so

 fourth new law should provide incentive for temporary foreign worker to return permanently to their home country after their period of work in the united states have expire

 today i ask the congress to join i in pass new immigration law that reflect these principle that meet america 's economic need and live up to our high ideal applause

 i propose a new temporary worker program that will match willing foreign worker with willing american employer when no americans can be find to fill the job this program will offer legal status as temporary worker to the million of undocumented man and woman now employ in the united states and to those in foreign country who seek to participate in the program and have be offer employment here this new system should be clear and efficient so employer be able to find worker quickly and simply

 all who participate in the temporary worker program must have a job or if not live in the united states a job offer the legal status grant by this program will last three year and will be renewable but it will have an end participant who do not remain employ who do not follow the rule of the program or who break the law will not be eligible for continue participation and will be require to return to their home

 under my proposal employer have key responsibility employer who extend job offer must first make every reasonable effort to find an american worker for the job at hand our government will develop a quick and simple system for employer to search for american worker employer must not hire undocumented alien or temporary worker whose legal status have expire they must report to the government the temporary worker they hire and who leave their employ so that we can keep track of people in the program and well enforce immigration law there must be strong workplace enforcement with tough penalty for anyone for any employer violate these law

 undocumented worker now here will be require to pay a one time fee to register for the temporary worker program those who seek to join the program from abroad and have comply with our immigration law will not have to pay any fee all participant will be issue a temporary worker card that will allow they to travel back and forth between their home and the united states without fear of be deny re entry into our country applause

 this program expect temporary worker to return permanently to their home country after their period of work in the united states have expire and there should be financial incentive for they to do so i will work with foreign government on a plan to give temporary worker credit when they enter their own nation 's retirement system for the time they have work in america i also support make it easy for temporary worker to contribute a portion of their earning to tax prefer saving account money they can collect as they return to their native country after all in many of those country a small nest egg be what be necessary to start their own business or buy some land for their family

 some temporary worker will make the decision to pursue american citizenship those who make this choice will be allow to apply in the normal way they will not be give unfair advantage over people who have follow legal procedure from the start i oppose amnesty place undocumented worker on the automatic path to citizenship grant amnesty encourage the violation of our law and perpetuate illegal immigration america be a welcome country but citizenship must not be the automatic reward for violate the law of america applause

 the citizenship line however be too long and our current limit on legal immigration be too low my administration will work with the congress to increase the annual number of green card that can lead to citizenship those willing to take the difficult path of citizenship the path of work and patience and assimilation should be welcome in america like generation of immigrant before they applause

 in the process of immigration reform we must also set high expectation for what new citizen should know an understanding of what it mean to be an american be not a formality in the naturalization process it be essential to full participation in our democracy my administration will examine the standard of knowledge in the current citizenship test we must ensure that new citizen know not only the fact of our history but the ideal that have shape our history every citizen of america have an obligation to learn the value that make we one nation liberty and civic responsibility equality under god and tolerance for other

 this new temporary worker program will bring more than economic benefit to america our homeland will be more secure when we can well account for those who enter our country instead of the current situation in which million of people be unknown unknown to the law law enforcement will face few problem with undocumented worker and will be well able to focus on the true threat to our nation from criminal and terrorist and when temporary worker can travel legally and freely there will be more efficient management of our border and more effective enforcement against those who pose a danger to our country applause

 this new system will be more compassionate decent hard work people will now be protect by labor law with the right to change job earn fair wage and enjoy the same working condition that the law require for american worker temporary worker will be able to establish their identity by obtain the legal document we all take for grant and they will be able to talk openly to authority to report crime when they be harm without the fear of be deport applause

 the good way in the long run to reduce the pressure that create illegal immigration in the first place be to expand economic opportunity among the country in our neighborhood in a few day i will go to mexico for the special summit of the americas where we will discuss way to advance free trade and to fight corruption and encourage the reform that lead to prosperity real growth and real hope in the nation of our hemisphere will lessen the flow of new immigrant to america when more citizen of other country be able to achieve their dream at their own home applause

 yet our country have always benefit from the dream that other have bring here by work hard for a well life immigrant contribute to the life of our nation the temporary worker program i be propose today represent the good tradition of our society a society that honor the law and welcome the newcomer this plan will help return order and fairness to our immigration system and in so do we will honor our value by show our respect for those who work hard and share in the ideal of america

 may god bless you all applause

 our great responsibility be the active defense of the american people twenty eight month have pass since september 11 2001 over two year without an attack on american soil and it be tempting to believe that the danger be behind we that hope be understandable comfort and false the killing have continue in bali jakarta casablanca riyadh mombasa jerusalem istanbul and baghdad the terrorist continue to plot against america and the civilized world and by our will and courage this danger will be defeat

 inside the united states where the war begin we must continue to give our homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend we and one of those essential tool be the patriot act which allow federal law enforcement to well share information to track terrorist to disrupt their cell and to seize their asset for year we have use similar provision to catch embezzler and drug trafficker if these method be good for hunt criminal they be even more important for hunt terrorist

 key provision of the patriot act be set to expire next year the terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule our law enforcement need this vital legislation to protect our citizen you need to renew the patriot act

 america be on the offensive against the terrorist who start this war last march khalid sheik mohammed a mastermind of september 11 awake to find himself in the custody of u.s. and pakistani authority last august 11 bring the capture of the terrorist hambali who be a key player in the attack in indonesia that kill over 200 people we be track al qaeda around the world and nearly two third of their known leader have now be capture or kill thousand of very skilled and determined military personnel be on the manhunt go after the remain killer who hide in city and cave and one by one we will bring these terrorist to justice

 as part of the offensive against terror we be also confront the regime that harbor and support terrorist and could supply they with nuclear chemical or biological weapon the united states and our ally be determine we refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger

 the first to see our determination be the taliban who make afghanistan the primary training base of al qaeda killer as of this month that country have a new constitution guarantee free election and full participation by woman business be open health care center be be establish and the boy and girl of afghanistan be back in school with the help from the new afghan army our coalition be lead aggressive raid against the survive member of the taliban and al qaeda the man and woman of afghanistan be build a nation that be free and proud and fight terror and america be honor to be their friend

 since we last meet in this chamber combat force of the united states great britain australia poland and other country enforce the demand of the united nations end the rule of saddam hussein and the people of iraq be free

 having break the ba'athist regime we face a remnant of violent saddam supporter man who run away from our troop in battle be now dispersed and attack from the shadow these killer join by foreign terrorist be a serious continue danger yet we be make progress against they the once all powerful ruler of iraq be find in a hole and now sit in a prison cell of the top 55 official of the former regime we have capture or kill 45 our force be on the offensive lead over 1,600 patrol a day and conduct an average of 180 raid a week we be deal with these thug in iraq just as surely as we deal with saddam hussein 's evil regime

 the work of build a new iraq be hard and it be right and america have always be willing to do what it take for what be right last january iraq 's only law be the whim of one brutal man today our coalition be work with the iraqi governing council to draft a basic law with a bill of right we be work with iraqis and the united nations to prepare for a transition to full iraqi sovereignty by the end of june

 as democracy take hold in iraq the enemy of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear they be try to shake the will of our country and our friend but the united states of america will never be intimidate by thug and assassin the killer will fail and the iraqi people will live in freedom

 month by month iraqis be assume more responsibility for their own security and their own future and tonight we be honor to welcome one of iraq 's most respected leader the current president of the iraqi governing council adnan pachachi

 sir america stand with you and the iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation

 because of american leadership and resolve the world be change for the well last month the leader of libya voluntarily pledge to disclose and dismantle all of his regime 's weapon of mass destruction program include a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapon colonel qadhafi correctly judge that his country would be well off and far more secure without weapon of mass murder

 nine month of intense negotiation involve the united states and great britain succeed with libya while 12 year of diplomacy with iraq do not and one reason be clear for diplomacy to be effective word must be credible and no one can now doubt the word of america

 different threat require different strategy along with nation in the region we be insist that north korea eliminate its nuclear program america and the international community be demand that iran meet its commitment and not develop nuclear weapon america be commit to keep the world 's most dangerous weapon out of the hand of the most dangerous regime

 when i come to this rostrum on september 20 2001 i bring the police shield of a fall officer my reminder of life that end and a task that do not end i give to you and to all americans my complete commitment to secure our country and defeat our enemy and this pledge give by one have be keep by many

 you in the congress have provide the resource for our defense and cast the difficult vote of war and peace our close ally have be unwavering america 's intelligence personnel and diplomat have be skilled and tireless and the man and woman of the american military they have take the hard duty we have see their skill and their courage in armored charge and midnight raid and lonely hour on faithful watch we have see the joy when they return and feel the sorrow when one be lose i have have the honor of meet our service man and woman at many post from the deck of a carrier in the pacific to a mess hall in baghdad

 many of our troop be listen tonight and i want you and your family to know america be proud of you and my administration and this congress will give you the resource you need to fight and win the war on terror

 i know that some people question if america be really in a war at all they view terrorism more as a crime a problem to be solve mainly with law enforcement and indictment after the world trade center be first attack in 1993 some of the guilty be indict and try and convict and send to prison but the matter be not settle the terrorist be still train and plot in other nation and draw up more ambitious plan after the chaos and carnage of september 11 it be not enough to serve our enemy with legal paper the terrorist and their supporter declare war on the united states and war be what they get

 some in this chamber and in our country do not support the liberation of iraq objection to war often come from principled motive but let we be candid about the consequence of leave saddam hussein in power we be seek all the fact already the kay report identify dozen of weapon of mass destruction relate program activity and significant amount of equipment that iraq conceal from the united nations have we fail to act the dictator 's weapon of mass destruction program would continue to this day have we fail to act security council resolution on iraq would have be reveal as empty threat weaken the united nations and encourage defiance by dictator around the world iraq 's torture chamber would still be fill with victim terrified and innocent the kill field of iraq where hundred of thousand of man and woman and child vanish into the sand would still be know only to the killer for all who love freedom and peace the world without saddam hussein 's regime be a well and safe place

 some critic have say our duty in iraq must be internationalize this particular criticism be hard to explain to our partner in britain australia japan south korea the philippines thailand italy spain poland denmark hungary bulgaria ukraine romania the netherlands norway el salvador and the 17 other country that have commit troop to iraq as we debate at home we must never ignore the vital contribution of our international partner or dismiss their sacrifice

 from the beginning america have seek international support for our operation in afghanistan and iraq and we have gain much support there be a difference however between lead a coalition of many nation and submit to the objection of a few america will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country

 we also hear doubt that democracy be a realistic goal for the great middle east where freedom be rare yet it be mistaken and condescend to assume that whole culture and great religion be incompatible with liberty and self government i believe that god have plant in every human heart the desire to live in freedom and even when that desire be crush by tyranny for decade it will rise again

 as long as the middle east remain a place of tyranny and despair and anger it will continue to produce man and movement that threaten the safety of america and our friend so america be pursue a forward strategy of freedom in the great middle east we will challenge the enemy of reform confront the ally of terror and expect a high standard from our friend to cut through the barrier of hateful propaganda the voice of america and other broadcast service be expand their programming in arabic and persian and soon a new television service will begin provide reliable news and information across the region i will send you a proposal to double the budget of the national endowment for democracy and to focus its new work on the development of free election and free market free press and free labor union in the middle east and above all we will finish the historic work of democracy in afghanistan and iraq so those nation can light the way for other and help transform a troubled part of the world

 america be a nation with a mission and that mission come from our most basic belief we have no desire to dominate no ambition of empire our aim be a democratic peace a peace found upon the dignity and right of every man and woman america act in this cause with friend and ally at our side yet we understand our special calling this great republic will lead the cause of freedom

 in the last three year adversity have also reveal the fundamental strength of the american economy we have come through recession and terrorist attack and corporate scandal and the uncertainty of war and because you act to stimulate our economy with tax relief this economy be strong and grow strong

 you have double the child tax credit from 500 to $ 1,000 reduce the marriage penalty begin to phase out the death tax reduce taxis on capital gain and stock dividend cut taxis on small business and you have lower taxis for every american who pay income taxis

 americans take those dollar and put they to work drive this economy forward the pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 be the fast in nearly 20 year new home construction the high in almost 20 year homeownership rate the high ever manufacturing activity be increase inflation be low interest rate be low export be grow productivity be high and job be on the rise these number confirm that the american people be use their money far well than government would have and you be right to return it

 america 's grow economy be also a change economy as technology transform the way almost every job be do america become more productive and worker need new skill much of our job growth will be find in high skilled field like health care and biotechnology so we must respond by help more americans gain the skill to find good job in our new economy

 all skill begin with the basic of reading and math which be suppose to be learn in the early grade of our school yet for too long for too many child those skill be never master by pass the no child leave behind act you have make the expectation of literacy the law of our country we be provide more funding for our school a 36 percent increase since 2001 we be require high standard we be regularly test every child on the fundamental we be report result to parent and make sure they have well option when school be not perform we be make progress toward excellence for every child in america

 but the status quo always have defender some want to undermine the no child leave behind act by weakening standard and accountability yet the result we require be really a matter of common sense we expect third grader to read and do math at the third grade level and that be not ask too much testing be the only way to identify and help student who be fall behind this nation will not go back to the day of simply shuffle child along from grade to grade without they learn the basic i refuse to give up on any child and the no child left behind act be open the door of opportunity to all of america 's child

 at the same time we must ensure that old student and adult can gain the skill they need to find work now many of the fast grow occupation require strong math and science preparation and training beyond the high school level so tonight i propose a series of measure call jobs for the 21st century this program will provide extra help to middle and high school student who fall behind in reading and math expand advanced placement program in low income school invite math and science professional from the private sector to teach part time in our high school i propose large pell grants for student who prepare for college with demand course in high school i propose increase our support for america 's fine community college so they can i do so so they can train worker for industry that be create the most new job by all these action we will help more and more americans to join in the grow prosperity of our country job training be important and so be job creation we must continue to pursue an aggressive progrowth economic agenda

 congress have some unfinished business on the issue of taxis the tax reduction you pass be set to expire unless you act the unfair tax on marriage will go back up unless you act million of family will be charge $ 300 more in federal taxis for every child unless you act small business will pay high taxis unless you act the death tax will eventually come back to life unless you act americans face a tax increase what congress have give the congress should not take away for the sake of job growth the tax cut you pass should be permanent

 our agenda for job and growth must help small business owner and employee with relief from needless federal regulation and protect they from junk and frivolous lawsuit

 consumer and business need reliable supply of energy to make our economy run so i urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system promote conservation and make america less dependent on foreign source of energy

 my administration be promote free and fair trade to open up new market for america 's entrepreneur and manufacturer and farmer to create job for american worker young worker should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by save part of their social security taxis in a personal retirement account we should make the social security system a source of ownership for the american people and we should limit the burden of government on this economy by act as good steward of taxpayer dollar

 in two week i will send you a budget that fund the war protect the homeland and meet important domestic need while limit the growth in discretionary spending to less than four percent this will require that congress focus on priority cut wasteful spending and be wise with the people 's money by do so we can cut the deficit in half over the next five year

 tonight i also ask you to reform our immigration law so they reflect our value and benefit our economy i propose a new temporary worker program to match willing foreign worker with willing employer when no americans can be find to fill the job this reform will be good for our economy because employer will find need worker in an honest and orderly system a temporary worker program will help protect our homeland allow border patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threat to our national security

 i oppose amnesty because it would encourage further illegal immigration and unfairly reward those who break our law my temporary worker program will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law while bring million of hard work man and woman out from the shadow of american life

 our nation 's health care system like our economy be also in a time of change amazing medical technology be improve and save life this dramatic progress have bring its own challenge in the rise cost of medical care and health insurance member of congress we must work together to help control those cost and extend the benefit of modern medicine throughout our country

 meet these goal require bipartisan effort and two month ago you show the way by strengthen medicare and add a prescription drug benefit you keep a basic commitment to our senior you be give they the modern medicine they deserve

 start this year under the law you pass senior can choose to receive a drug discount card save they 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most prescription drug and million of low income senior can get an additional $ 600 to buy medicine begin next year senior will have new coverage for preventive screening against diabetes and heart disease and senior just enter medicare can receive wellness exam

 in january of 2006 senior can get prescription drug coverage under medicare for a monthly premium of about $ 35 most senior who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bill cut roughly in half under this reform senior citizen will be able to keep their medicare just as it be or they can choose a medicare plan that fit they well just as you as members of congress can choose an insurance plan that meet your need and start this year million of americans will be able to save money tax free for their medical expense in a health saving account

 i sign this measure proudly and any attempt to limit the choice of our senior or to take away their prescription drug coverage under medicare will meet my veto

 on the critical issue of health care our goal be to ensure that americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that well fit their individual need to make insurance more affordable congress must act to address rapidly rise health care cost small business should be able to band together and negotiate for low insurance rate so they can cover more worker with health insurance i urge you to pass association health plan i ask you to give low income americans a refundable tax credit that would allow million to buy their own basic health insurance

 by computerize health record we can avoid dangerous medical mistake reduce cost and improve care to protect the doctor patient relationship and keep good doctor do good work we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuit and tonight i propose that individual who buy catastrophic health care coverage as part of our new health saving account be allow to deduct 100 percent of the premium from their taxis

 a government run health care system be the wrong prescription by keep cost under control expand access and help more americans afford coverage we will preserve the system of private medicine that make america 's health care the good in the world

 we be live in a time of great change in our world in our economy in science and medicine yet some thing endure courage and compassion reverence and integrity respect for difference of faith and race the value we try to live by never change and they be instill in we by fundamental institution such as family and school and religious congregation these institution these unseen pillar of civilization must remain strong in america and we will defend they we must stand with our family to help they raise healthy responsible child when it come to help child make right choice there be work for all of we to do

 one of the bad decision our child can make be to gamble their life and future on drug our government be help parent confront this problem with aggressive education treatment and law enforcement drug use in high school have decline by 11 percent over the last two year four hundred thousand few young people be use illegal drug than in the year 2001 in my budget i propose new funding to continue our aggressive community base strategy to reduce demand for illegal drug drug testing in our school have prove to be an effective part of this effort so tonight i propose an additional 23 million for school that want to use drug testing as a tool to save child 's life the aim here be not to punish child but to send they this message we love you and we do not want to lose you

 to help child make right choice they need good example athletic play such an important role in our society but unfortunately some in professional sport be not set much of an example the use of performance enhance drug like steroid in baseball football and other sport be dangerous and it send the wrong message that there be shortcut to accomplishment and that performance be more important than character so tonight i call on team owner union representative coach and player to take the lead to send the right signal to get tough and to get rid of steroid now

 to encourage right choice we must be willing to confront the danger young people face even when they be difficult to talk about each year about three million teenager contract sexually transmit disease that can harm they or kill they or prevent they from ever become parent in my budget i propose a grassroots campaign to help inform family about these medical risk we will double federal funding for abstinence program so school can teach this fact of life abstinence for young people be the only certain way to avoid sexually transmit disease

 decision child now make can affect their health and character for the rest of their life all of we parent and school and government must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture and to send the right message to our child

 a strong america must also value the institution of marriage i believe we should respect individual as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental endure institution of our civilization congress have already take a stand on this issue by pass the defense of marriage act sign in 1996 by president clinton that statute protect marriage under federal law as a union of a man and a woman and declare that one state may not redefine marriage for other state

 activist judge however have begin redefine marriage by court order without regard for the will of the people and their elect representative on an issue of such great consequence the people 's voice must be hear if judge insist on force their arbitrary will upon the people the only alternative leave to the people would be the constitutional process our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage

 the outcome of this debate be important and so be the way we conduct it the same moral tradition that define marriage also teach that each individual have dignity and value in god 's sight

 it be also important to strengthen our community by unleash the compassion of america 's religious institution religious charity of every creed be do some of the most vital work in our country mentor child feed the hungry take the hand of the lonely yet government have often deny social service grant and contract to these group just because they have a cross or a star of david or a crescent on the wall

 by executive order i have open billion of dollar in grant money to competition that include faith base charity tonight i ask you to codify this into law so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate against they again

 in the past we have work together to bring mentor to child of prisoner and provide treatment for the addicted and help for the homeless tonight i ask you to consider another group of americans in need of help this year some 600,000 inmate will be release from prison back into society we know from long experience that if they can not find work or a home or help they be much more likely to commit crime and return to prison so tonight i propose a four year $ 300 million prisoner reentry initiative to expand job training and placement service to provide transitional housing and to help newly release prisoner get mentor include from faith base group america be the land of second chance and when the gate of the prison open the path ahead should lead to a well life

 for all americans the last three year have bring test we do not ask for and achievement share by all by our action we have show what kind of nation we be in grief we have find the grace to go on in challenge we rediscover the courage and daring of a free people in victory we have show the noble aim and good heart of america and having come this far we sense that we live in a time set apart

 i have be witness to the character of the people of america who have show calm in time of danger compassion for one another and toughness for the long haul all of we have be partner in a great enterprise and even some of the young understand that we be live in historic time last month a girl in lincoln rhode island send i a letter it begin dear george w. bush if there be anything you know i ashley pearson age 10 can do to help anyone please send i a letter and tell i what i can do to save our country she add this p.s. if you can send a letter to the troop please put ` ashley pearson believe in you

vice president cheney mr. chief justice president carter president bush president clinton reverend clergy distinguished guest fellow citizen

 on this day prescribe by law and mark by ceremony we celebrate the durable wisdom of our constitution and recall the deep commitment that unite our country i be grateful for the honor of this hour mindful of the consequential time in which we live and determine to fulfill the oath that i have swear and you have witness

 at this second gathering our duty be define not by the word i use but by the history we have see together for a half century america defend our own freedom by stand watch on distant border after the shipwreck of communism come year of relative quiet year of repose year of sabbatical and then there come a day of fire

 we have see our vulnerability and we have see its deep source for as long as whole region of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny prone to ideology that feed hatred and excuse murder violence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most defended border and raise a mortal threat there be only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and expose the pretension of tyrant and reward the hope of the decent and tolerant and that be the force of human freedom

 we be lead by event and common sense to one conclusion the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depend on the success of liberty in other land the good hope for peace in our world be the expansion of freedom in all the world

 america 's vital interest and our deep belief be now one from the day of our founding we have proclaim that every man and woman on this earth have right and dignity and matchless value because they bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth across the generation we have proclaim the imperative of self government because no one be fit to be a master and no one deserve to be a slave advance these ideal be the mission that create our nation it be the honorable achievement of our father now it be the urgent requirement of our nation 's security and the calling of our time

 so it be the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movement and institution in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of end tyranny in our world

 this be not primarily the task of arm though we will defend ourselves and our friend by force of arm when necessary freedom by its nature must be choose and defend by citizen and sustain by the rule of law and the protection of minority and when the soul of a nation finally speak the institution that arise may reflect custom and tradition very different from our own america will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling our goal instead be to help other find their own voice attain their own freedom and make their own way

 the great objective of end tyranny be the concentrated work of generation the difficulty of the task be no excuse for avoid it america 's influence be not unlimited but fortunately for the oppress america 's influence be considerable and we will use it confidently in freedom 's cause

 my most solemn duty be to protect this nation and its people against further attack and emerge threat some have unwisely choose to test america 's resolve and have find it firm

 we will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation the moral choice between oppression which be always wrong and freedom which be eternally right america will not pretend that jail dissident prefer their chain or that woman welcome humiliation and servitude or that any human be aspire to live at the mercy of bully

 we will encourage reform in other government by make clear that success in our relation will require the decent treatment of their own people america 's belief in human dignity will guide our policy yet right must be more than the grudging concession of dictator they be secure by free dissent and the participation of the govern in the long run there be no justice without freedom and there can be no human right without human liberty

 some i know have question the global appeal of liberty though this time in history four decade define by the swift advance of freedom ever see be an odd time for doubt americans of all people should never be surprise by the power of our ideal eventually the call of freedom come to every mind and every soul we do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery liberty will come to those who love it

 today america speak anew to the people of the world

 all who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know the united states will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressor when you stand for your liberty we will stand with you

 democratic reformer face repression prison or exile can know america see you for who you be the future leader of your free country

 the ruler of outlaw regime can know that we still believe as abraham lincoln do those who deny freedom to other deserve it not for themselves and under the rule of a just god can not long retain it

 the leader of government with long habit of control need to know to serve your people you must learn to trust they start on this journey of progress and justice and america will walk at your side

 and all the ally of the united states can know we honor your friendship we rely on your counsel and we depend on your help division among free nation be a primary goal of freedom 's enemy the concerted effort of free nation to promote democracy be a prelude to our enemy defeat

 today i also speak anew to my fellow citizen

 from all of you i have ask patience in the hard task of secure america which you have grant in good measure our country have accept obligation that be difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon yet because we have act in the great liberating tradition of this nation ten of million have achieve their freedom and as hope kindle hope million more will find it by our effort we have light a fire as well a fire in the mind of man it warm those who feel its power it burn those who fight its progress and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the dark corner of our world

 a few americans have accept the hard duty in this cause in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy the idealistic work of help raise up free government the dangerous and necessary work of fight our enemy some have show their devotion to our country in death that honor their whole life and we will always honor their name and their sacrifice

 all americans have witness this idealism and some for the first time i ask our young citizen to believe the evidence of your eye you have see duty and allegiance in the determined face of our soldier you have see that life be fragile and evil be real and courage triumph make the choice to serve in a cause large than your want large than yourself and in your day you will add not just to the wealth of our country but to its character

 america have need of idealism and courage because we have essential work at home the unfinished work of american freedom in a world move toward liberty we be determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty

 in america 's ideal of freedom citizen find the dignity and security of economic independence instead of labor on the edge of subsistence this be the broad definition of liberty that motivate the homestead act the social security act and the g.i. bill of rights and now we will extend this vision by reform great institution to serve the need of our time to give every american a stake in the promise and future of our country we will bring the high standard to our school and build an ownership society we will widen the ownership of home and business retirement saving and health insurance prepare our people for the challenge of life in a free society by make every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny we will give our fellow americans great freedom from want and fear and make our society more prosperous and just and equal

 in america 's ideal of freedom the public interest depend on private character on integrity and tolerance toward other and the rule of conscience in our own life self government rely in the end on the governing of the self that edifice of character be build in family support by community with standard and sustain in our national life by the truth of sinai the sermon on the mount the word of the koran and the varied faith of our people american move forward in every generation by reaffirm all that be good and true that come before ideal of justice and conduct that be the same yesterday today and forever

 in america 's ideal of freedom the exercise of right be ennoble by service and mercy and a heart for the weak liberty for all do not mean independence from one another our nation rely on man and woman who look after a neighbor and surround the lose with love american at our good value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth and our country must abandon all the habit of racism because we can not carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time

 from the perspective of a single day include this day of dedication the issue and question before our country be many from the viewpoint of century the question that come to we be narrow and few do our generation advance the cause of freedom and do our character bring credit to that cause

 these question that judge we also unite we because americans of every party and background americans by choice and by birth be bind to one another in the cause of freedom we have know division which must be heal to move forward in great purpose and i will strive in good faith to heal they yet those division do not define america we feel the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom come under attack and our response come like a single hand over a single heart and we can feel that same unity and pride whenever america act for good and the victim of disaster be give hope and the unjust encounter justice and the captive be set free

 we go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom not because history run on the wheel of inevitability it be human choice that move event not because we consider ourselves a choose nation god move and choose as he will we have confidence because freedom be the permanent hope of mankind the hunger in dark place the longing of the soul when our founder declare a new order of the age when soldier die in wave upon wave for a union base on liberty when citizen march in peaceful outrage under the banner freedom now they be act on an ancient hope that be mean to be fulfil history have an ebb and flow of justice but history also have a visible direction set by liberty and the author of liberty

 when the declaration of independence be first read in public and the liberty bell be sound in celebration a witness say it ring as if it mean something in our time it mean something still america in this young century proclaim liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitant thereof renew in our strength test but not weary we be ready for the great achievement in the history of freedom

 may god bless you and may he watch over the united states of america

 we have see our vulnerability and we have see its deep source for as long as whole region of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny prone to ideology that feed hatred and excuse murder violence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most defended border and raise a mortal threat there be only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and expose the pretension of tyrant and reward the hope of the decent and tolerant and that be the force of human freedom
 we be lead by event and common sense to one conclusion the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depend on the success of liberty in other land the good hope for peace in our world be the expansion of freedom in all the world
 america 's vital interest and our deep belief be now one from the day of our founding we have proclaim that every man and woman on this earth have right and dignity and matchless value because they bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth across the generation we have proclaim the imperative of self government because no one be fit to be a master and no one deserve to be a slave advance these ideal be the mission that create our nation it be the honorable achievement of our father now it be the urgent requirement of our nation 's security and the calling of our time
 so it be the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movement and institution in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of end tyranny in our world this be not primarily the task of arm though we will defend ourselves and our friend by force of arm when necessary freedom by its nature must be choose and defend by citizen and sustain by the rule of law and the protection of minority and when the soul of a nation finally speak the institution that arise may reflect custom and tradition very different from our own america will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling our goal instead be to help other find their own voice attain their own freedom and make their own way
 the great objective of end tyranny be the concentrated work of generation the difficulty of the task be no excuse for avoid it america 's influence be not unlimited but fortunately for the oppress america 's influence be considerable and we will use it confidently in freedom 's cause
 my most solemn duty be to protect this nation and its people from further attack and emerge threat some have unwisely choose to test america 's resolve and have find it firm we will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation the moral choice between oppression which be always wrong and freedom which be eternally right
 america will not pretend that jail dissident prefer their chain or that woman welcome humiliation and servitude or that any human be aspire to live at the mercy of bully we will encourage reform in other government by make clear that success in our relation will require the decent treatment of their own people america 's belief in human dignity will guide our policy yet right must be more than the grudging concession of dictator they be secure by free dissent and the participation of the govern in the long run there be no justice without freedom and there can be no human right without human liberty
 some i know have question the global appeal of liberty though this time in history four decade define by the swift advance of freedom ever see be an odd time for doubt americans of all people should never be surprise by the power of our ideal eventually the call of freedom come to every mind and every soul we do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery liberty will come to those who love it
 today america speak anew to the people of the world all who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know the united states will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressor when you stand for your liberty we will stand with you
 democratic reformer face repression prison or exile can know america see you for who you be the future leader of your free country
 the ruler of outlaw regime can know that we still believe as abraham lincoln do those who deny freedom to other deserve it not for themselves and under the rule of a just god can not long retain it
 the leader of government with long habit of control need to know to serve your people you must learn to trust they start on this journey of progress and justice and america will walk at your side
 and all the ally of the united states can know we honor your friendship we rely on your counsel and we depend on your help division among free nation be a primary goal of freedom 's enemy the concerted effort of free nation to promote democracy be a prelude to our enemy defeat
 today i also speak anew to my fellow citizen from all of you i have ask patience in the hard task of secure america which you have grant in good measure our country have accept obligation that be difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon yet because we have act in the great liberating tradition of this nation ten of million have achieve their freedom and as hope kindle hope million more will find it by our effort we have light a fire as well a fire in the mind of man it warm those who feel its power it burn those who fight its progress and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the dark corner of our world
 a few americans have accept the hard duty in this cause in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy the idealistic work of help raise up free government the dangerous and necessary work of fight our enemy some have show their devotion to our country in death that honor their whole life and we will always honor their name and their sacrifice
 all americans have witness this idealism and some for the first time i ask our young citizen to believe the evidence of your eye you have see duty and allegiance in the determined face of our soldier you have see that life be fragile and evil be real and courage triumph make the choice to serve in a cause large than your want large than yourself and in your day you will add not just to the wealth of our country but to its character
 america have need of idealism and courage because we have essential work at home the unfinished work of american freedom in a world move toward liberty we be determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty
 in america 's ideal of freedom citizen find the dignity and security of economic independence instead of labor on the edge of subsistence this be the broad definition of liberty that motivate the homestead act the social security act and the gi bill of rights and now we will extend this vision by reform great institution to serve the need of our time to give every american a stake in the promise and future of our country we will bring the high standard to our school and build an ownership society we will widen the ownership of home and business retirement saving and health insurance prepare our people for the challenge of life in a free society by make every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny we will give our fellow americans great freedom from want and fear and make our society more prosperous and just and equal
 in america 's ideal of freedom the public interest depend on private character on integrity and tolerance toward other and the rule of conscience in our own life self government rely in the end on the governing of the self that edifice of character be build in family support by community with standard and sustain in our national life by the truth of sinai the sermon on the mount the word of the koran and the varied faith of our people american move forward in every generation by reaffirm all that be good and true that come before ideal of justice and conduct that be the same yesterday today and forever
 in america 's ideal of freedom the exercise of right be ennoble by service and mercy and a heart for the weak liberty for all do not mean independence from one another our nation rely on man and woman who look after a neighbor and surround the lose with love american at our good value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth and our country must abandon all the habit of racism because we can not carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time
 from the perspective of a single day include this day of dedication the issue and question before our country be many from the viewpoint of century the question that come to we be narrow and few do our generation advance the cause of freedom and do our character bring credit to that cause
 these question that judge we also unite we because americans of every party and background americans by choice and by birth be bind to one another in the cause of freedom we have know division which must be heal to move forward in great purpose and i will strive in good faith to heal they yet those division do not define america we feel the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom come under attack and our response come like a single hand over a single heart and we can feel that same unity and pride whenever america act for good and the victim of disaster be give hope and the unjust encounter justice and the captive be set free
 we go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom not because history run on the wheel of inevitability it be human choice that move event not because we consider ourselves a choose nation god move and choose as he will we have confidence because freedom be the permanent hope of mankind the hunger in dark place the longing of the soul when our founder declare a new order of the age when soldier die in wave upon wave for a union base on liberty when citizen march in peaceful outrage under the banner freedom now they be act on an ancient hope that be mean to be fulfil history have an ebb and flow of justice but history also have a visible direction set by liberty and the author of liberty
 when the declaration of independence be first read in public and the liberty bell be sound in celebration a witness say it ring as if it mean something in our time it mean something still america in this young century proclaim liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitant thereof renew in our strength test but not weary we be ready for the great achievement in the history of freedom
 may god bless you and may he watch over the united states of america

mr. speaker vice president cheney member of congress fellow citizen

 as a new congress gather all of we in the elect branch of government share a great privilege we have be place in office by the vote of the people we serve and tonight that be a privilege we share with newly elect leader of afghanistan the palestinian territory ukraine and a free and sovereign iraq

 two week ago i stand on the step of this capitol and renew the commitment of our nation to the guide ideal of liberty for all this evening i will set forth policy to advance that ideal at home and around the world

 tonight with a healthy grow economy with more americans go back to work with our nation an active force for good in the world the state of our union be confident and strong our generation have be bless by the expansion of opportunity by advance in medicine and by the security purchase by our parent sacrifice now as we see a little gray in the mirror or a lot of gray and we watch our child move into adulthood we ask the question what will be the state of their union

 members of congress the choice we make together will answer that question over the next several month on issue after issue let we do what americans have always do and build a well world for our child and grandchild

 first we must be good steward of this economy and renew the great institution on which million of our fellow citizen rely

 america 's economy be the fast growing of any major industrialized nation in the past four year we have provide tax relief to every person who pay income taxis overcome a recession open up new market abroad prosecute corporate criminal raise homeownership to the high level in history and in the last year alone the united states have add 2.3 million new job when action be need the congress deliver and the nation be grateful

 now we must add to these achievement by make our economy more flexible more innovative and more competitive we will keep america the economic leader of the world

 america 's prosperity require restrain the spending appetite of the federal government i welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spend discipline so next week i will send you a budget that hold the growth of discretionary spending below inflation make tax relief permanent and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009 my budget substantially reduce or eliminate more than 150 government program that be not get result or duplicate current effort or do not fulfill essential priority the principle here be clear a taxpayer dollar must be spend wisely or not at all

 to make our economy strong and more dynamic we must prepare a rise generation to fill the job of the 21st century under the no child leave behind act standard be high test score be on the rise and we be close the achievement gap for minority student now we must demand well result from our high school so every high school diploma be a ticket to success we will help an additional 200,000 worker to get training for a well career by reform our job training system and strengthen america 's community college and we will make it easy for americans to afford a college education by increase the size of pell grants

 to make our economy strong and more competitive america must reward not punish the effort and dream of entrepreneur small business be the path of advancement especially for woman and minority so we must free small business from needless regulation and protect honest job creator from junk lawsuit justice be distort and our economy be hold back by irresponsible class action and frivolous asbestos claim and i urge congress to pass legal reform this year

 to make our economy strong and more productive we must make health care more affordable and give family great access to good coverage and more control over their health decision i ask congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credit to help low income worker buy insurance a community health center in every poor county improve information technology to prevent medical error and needless cost association health plan for small business and their employee expand health saving account and medical liability reform that will reduce health care cost and make sure patient have the doctor and care they need

 to keep our economy grow we also need reliable supply of affordable environmentally responsible energy nearly four year ago i submit a comprehensive energy strategy that encourage conservation alternative source a modernized electricity grid and more production here at home include safe clean nuclear energy my clear skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizen and my budget provide strong funding for lead edge technology from hydrogen fuel car to clean coal to renewable source such as ethanol four year of debate be enough i urge congress to pass legislation that make america more secure and less dependent on foreign energy

 all these proposal be essential to expand this economy and add new job but they be just the beginning of our duty to build the prosperity of future generation we must update institution that be create to meet the need of an early time year after year americans be burden by an archaic incoherent federal tax code i have appoint a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom and when their recommendation be deliver you and i will work together to give this nation a tax code that be pro growth easy to understand and fair to all

 america 's immigration system be also outdate unsuited to the need of our economy and to the value of our country we should not be content with law that punish hardworke people who want only to provide for their family and deny business willing worker and invite chaos at our border it be time for an immigration policy that permit temporary guest worker to fill job americans will not take that reject amnesty that tell we who be enter and leave our country and that close the border to drug dealer and terrorist

 one of america 's most important institution a symbol of the trust between generation be also in need of wise and effective reform social security be a great moral success of the 20th century and we must honor its great purpose in this new century the system however on its current path be head toward bankruptcy and so we must join together to strengthen and save social security

 today more than 45 million americans receive social security benefit and million more be near retirement and for they the system be strong and fiscally sound i have a message for every american who be 55 or old do not let anyone mislead you for you the social security system will not change in any way

 for young worker the social security system have serious problem that will grow bad with time social security be create decade ago for a very different era in those day people do not live as long benefit be much low than they be today and a half century ago about 16 worker pay into the system for each person draw benefit our society have change in way the founder of social security could not have foresee in today 's world people be live long and therefore draw benefit long and those benefit be schedule to rise dramatically over the next few decade and instead of 16 worker pay in for every beneficiary right now it be only about three worker and over the next few decade that number will fall to just two worker per beneficiary with each pass year few worker be pay ever high benefit to an ever large number of retiree

 so here be the result thirteen year from now in 2018 social security will be pay out more than it take in and every year afterward will bring a new shortfall big than the year before for example in the year 2027 the government will somehow have to come up with an extra $ 200 billion to keep the system afloat and by 2033 the annual shortfall would be more than $ 300 billion by the year 2042 the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt if step be not take to avert that outcome the only solution would be drastically high taxis massive new borrowing or sudden and severe cut in social security benefit or other government program

 i recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem like a long way off but those date be not so distant as any parent will tell you if you have a 5 year old you be already concerned about how you will pay for college tuition 13 year down the road if you have get child in their 20 as some of we do the idea of social security collapse before they retire do not seem like a small matter and it should not be a small matter to the united states congress

 you and i share a responsibility we must pass reform that solve the financial problem of social security once and for all

 fix social security permanently will require an open candid review of the option some have suggest limit benefit for wealthy retiree former congressman tim penny have raise the possibility of indexing benefit to price rather than wage during the 1990 my predecessor president clinton speak of increase the retirement age former senator john breaux suggest discourage early collection of social security benefit the late senator daniel patrick moynihan recommend change the way benefit be calculate

 all these idea be on the table i know that none of these reform would be easy but we have to move ahead with courage and honesty because our child 's retirement security be more important than partisan politic i will work with member of congress to find the most effective combination of reform i will listen to anyone who have a good idea to offer we must however be guide by some basic principle we must make social security permanently sound not leave that task for another day we must not jeopardize our economic strength by increase payroll taxis we must ensure that low income americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement we must guarantee that there be no change for those now retire or near retirement and we must take care that any change in the system be gradual so young worker have year to prepare and plan for their future

 as we fix social security we also have the responsibility to make the system a well deal for young worker and the good way to reach that goal be through voluntary personal retirement account here be how the idea work right now a set portion of the money you earn be take out of your paycheck to pay for the social security benefit of today 's retiree if you be a young worker i believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account so you can build a nest egg for your own future

 here be why personal account be a well deal your money will grow over time at a great rate than anything the current system can deliver and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from social security in addition you will be able to pass along the money that accumulate in your personal account if you wish to your child or grandchild and well of all the money in the account be your and the government can never take it away

 the goal here be great security in retirement so we will set careful guideline for personal account we will make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bond and stock fund we will make sure that your earning be not eat up by hide wall street fee we will make sure there be good option to protect your investment from sudden market swing on the eve of your retirement we will make sure a personal account can not be empty out all at once but rather pay out over time as an addition to traditional social security benefit and we will make sure this plan be fiscally responsible by start personal retirement account gradually and raise the yearly limit on contribution over time eventually permit all worker to set aside four percentage point of their payroll taxis in their account

 personal retirement account should be familiar to federal employee because you already have something similar call the thrift savings plan which let worker deposit a portion of their paycheck into any of five different broadly base investment fund it be time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young americans

 our second great responsibility to our child and grandchild be to honor and to pass along the value that sustain a free society so many of my generation after a long journey have come home to family and faith and be determined to bring up responsible moral child government be not the source of these value but government should never undermine they

 because marriage be a sacred institution and the foundation of society it should not be re define by activist judge for the good of family child and society i support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage

 because a society be measure by how it treat the weak and vulnerable we must strive to build a culture of life medical research can help we reach that goal by develop treatment and cure that save life and help people overcome disability and i thank congress for double the funding of the national institutes of health to build a culture of life we must also ensure that scientific advance always serve human dignity not take advantage of some life for the benefit of other we should all be able to agree on some clear standard i will work with congress to ensure that human embryo be not create for experimentation or grow for body part and that human life be never buy and sell as a commodity america will continue to lead the world in medical research that be ambitious aggressive and always ethical

 because court must always deliver impartial justice judge have a duty to faithfully interpret the law not legislate from the bench as president i have a constitutional responsibility to nominate man and woman who understand the role of court in our democracy and be well qualified to serve on the bench and i have do so the constitution also give the senate a responsibility every judicial nominee deserve an up or down vote

 because one of the deep value of our country be compassion we must never turn away from any citizen who feel isolated from the opportunity of america our government will continue to support faith base and community group that bring hope to harsh place now we need to focus on give young people especially young man in our city well option than apathy or gang or jail tonight i propose a three year initiative to help organization keep young people out of gang and show young man an ideal of manhood that respect woman and reject violence take on gang life will be one part of a broad outreach to at risk youth which involve parent and pastor coach and community leader in program range from literacy to sport and i be proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our first lady laura bush

 because hiv aids bring suffering and fear into so many life i ask you to reauthorize the ryan white act to encourage prevention and provide care and treatment to the victim of that disease and as we update this important law we must focus our effort on fellow citizen with the high rate of new case african american man and woman

 because one of the main source of our national unity be our belief in equal justice we need to make sure americans of all race and background have confidence in the system that provide justice in america we must make doubly sure no person be hold to account for a crime he or she do not commit so we be dramatically expand the use of dna evidence to prevent wrongful conviction soon i will send to congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital case because people on trial for their life must have competent lawyer by their side

 our third responsibility to future generation be to leave they an america that be safe from danger and protect by peace we will pass along to our child all the freedom we enjoy and chief among they be freedom from fear

 in the three and a half year since september 11 2001 we have take unprecedented action to protect americans we have create a new department of government to defend our homeland focus the fbi on prevent terrorism begin to reform our intelligence agency break up terror cell across the country expand research on defense against biological and chemical attack improve border security and train more than a half million first responder police and firefighter air marshal researcher and so many other be work every day to make our homeland safe and we thank they all

 our nation work with ally and friend have also confront the enemy abroad with measure that be determine successful and continue the al qaeda terror network that attack our country still have leader but many of its top commander have be remove there be still government that sponsor and harbor terrorist but their number have decline there be still regime seek weapon of mass destruction but no long without attention and without consequence our country be still the target of terrorist who want to kill many and intimidate we all and we will stay on the offensive against they until the fight be win

 pursue our enemy be a vital commitment of the war on terror and i thank the congress for provide our servicemen and woman with the resource they have need during this time of war we must continue to support our military and give they the tool for victory

 other nation around the globe have stand with we in afghanistan an international force be help provide security in iraq 28 country have troop on the ground the united nations and the european union provide technical assistance for election and nato be lead a mission to help train iraqi officer we be cooperate with 60 government in the proliferation security initiative to detect and stop the transit of dangerous material we be work closely with government in asia to convince north korea to abandon its nuclear ambition pakistan saudi arabia and nine other country have capture or detain al qaeda terrorist in the next four year my administration will continue to build the coalition that will defeat the danger of our time

 in the long term the peace we seek will only be achieve by eliminate the condition that feed radicalism and ideology of murder if whole region of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred they will be the recruiting ground for terror and that terror will stalk america and other free nation for decade the only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror and replace hatred with hope be the force of human freedom our enemy know this and that be why the terrorist zarqawi recently declare war on what he call the evil principle of democracy and we have declare our own intention america will stand with the ally of freedom to support democratic movement in the middle east and beyond with the ultimate goal of end tyranny in our world

 the united states have no right no desire and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else that be one of the main difference between we and our enemy they seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression in which a tiny group of brutal self appoint ruler control every aspect of every life our aim be to build and preserve a community of free and independent nation with government that answer to their citizen and reflect their own culture and because democracy respect their own people and their neighbor the advance of freedom will lead to peace that advance have great momentum in our time show by woman vote in afghanistan and palestinians choose a new direction and the people of ukraine assert their democratic right and elect a president we be witness landmark event in the history of liberty and in the come year we will add to that story

 the beginning of reform and democracy in the palestinian territory be show the power of freedom to break old pattern of violence and failure tomorrow morning secretary of state rice depart on a trip that will take she to israel and the west bank for meeting with prime minister sharon and president abbas she will discuss with they how we and our friend can help the palestinian people end terror and build the institution of a peaceful independent democratic state to promote this democracy i will ask congress for $ 350 million to support palestinian political economic and security reform the goal of two democratic state israel and palestine live side by side in peace be within reach and america will help they achieve that goal

 to promote peace and stability in the broad middle east the united states will work with our friend in the region to fight the common threat of terror while we encourage a high standard of freedom hopeful reform be already take hold in an arc from morocco to jordan to bahrain the government of saudi arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expand the role of its people in determine their future and the great and proud nation of egypt which show the way toward peace in the middle east can now show the way toward democracy in the middle east

 to promote peace in the broad middle east we must confront regime that continue to harbor terrorist and pursue weapon of mass murder syria still allow its territory and part of lebanon to be use by terrorist who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region you have pass and we be apply the syrian accountability act and we expect the syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom today iran remain the world 's primary state sponsor of terror pursue nuclear weapon while deprive its people of the freedom they seek and deserve we be work with european ally to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium re processing and end its support for terror and to the iranian people i say tonight as you stand for your own liberty america stand with you

 our generational commitment to the advance of freedom especially in the middle east be now be test and honor in iraq that country be a vital front in the war on terror which be why the terrorist have choose to make a stand there our man and woman in uniform be fight terrorist in iraq so we do not have to face they here at home and the victory of freedom in iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror inspire democratic reformer from damascus to tehran bring more hope and progress to a troubled region and thereby lift a terrible threat from the life of our child and grandchild

 we will succeed because the iraqi people value their own liberty as they show the world last sunday across iraq often at great risk million of citizen go to the poll and elect 275 man and woman to represent they in a new transitional national assembly a young woman in baghdad tell of wake to the sound of mortar fire on election day and wonder if it might be too dangerous to vote she say hear those explosion it occur to i the insurgent be weak they be afraid of democracy they be lose so i get my husband and i get my parent and we all come out and vote together americans recognize that spirit of liberty because we share it in any nation cast your vote be an act of civic responsibility for million of iraqis it be also an act of personal courage and they have earn the respect of we all

 one of iraq 's lead democracy and human right advocate be safia taleb al suhail she say of her country we be occupy for 35 year by saddam hussein that be the real occupation thank you to the american people who pay the cost but most of all to the soldier eleven year ago safia 's father be assassinate by saddam 's intelligence service three day ago in baghdad safia be finally able to vote for the leader of her country and we be honor that she be with we tonight

 the terrorist and insurgent be violently oppose to democracy and will continue to attack it yet the terrorist most powerful myth be be destroy the whole world be see that the car bomber and assassin be not only fight coalition force they be try to destroy the hope of iraqis express in free election and the whole world now know that a small group of extremist will not overturn the will of the iraqi people

 we will succeed in iraq because iraqis be determined to fight for their own freedom and to write their own history as prime minister allawi say in his speech to congress last september ordinary iraqis be anxious to shoulder all the security burden of our country as quickly as possible this be the natural desire of an independent nation and it also be the state mission of our coalition in iraq the new political situation in iraq open a new phase of our work in that country at the recommendation of our commander on the ground and in consultation with the iraqi government we will increasingly focus our effort on help prepare more capable iraqi security force force with skilled officer and an effective command structure as those force become more self reliant and take on great security responsibility america and its coalition partner will increasingly be in a support role in the end iraqis must be able to defend their own country and we will help that proud new nation secure its liberty

 recently an iraqi interpreter say to a reporter tell america not to abandon we he and all iraqis can be certain while our military strategy be adapt to circumstance our commitment remain firm and unchanging we be stand for the freedom of our iraqi friend and freedom in iraq will make america safe for generation to come we will not set an artificial timetable for leave iraq because that would embolden the terrorist and make they believe they can wait we out we be in iraq to achieve a result a country that be democratic representative of all its people at peace with its neighbor and able to defend itself and when that result be achieve our man and woman serve in iraq will return home with the honor they have earn

 right now americans in uniform be serve at post across the world often take great risk on my order we have give they training and equipment and they have give we an example of idealism and character that make every american proud the volunteer of our military be unrelenting in battle unwavere in loyalty unmatched in honor and decency and every day they be make our nation more secure some of our servicemen and woman have survive terrible injury and this grateful country will do everything we can to help they recover and we have say farewell to some very good man and woman who die for our freedom and whose memory this nation will honor forever

 one name we honor be marine corps sergeant byron norwood of pflugerville texas who be kill during the assault on fallujah his mom janet send i a letter and tell i how much byron love be a marine and how proud he be to be on the front line against terror she write when byron be home the last time i say that i want to protect he like i have since he be bear he just hug i and say you have do your job mom now it be my turn to protect you lady and gentleman with grateful heart we honor freedom 's defender and our military family represent here this evening by sergeant norwood 's mom and dad janet and bill norwood

 in these four year americans have see the unfolding of large event we have know time of sorrow and hour of uncertainty and day of victory in all this history even when we have disagree we have see thread of purpose that unite we the attack on freedom in our world have reaffirm our confidence in freedom 's power to change the world we be all part of a great venture to extend the promise of freedom in our country to renew the value that sustain our liberty and to spread the peace that freedom bring

 as franklin roosevelt once remind americans each age be a dream that be die or one that be come to birth and we live in the country where the big dream be bear the abolition of slavery be only a dream until it be fulfil the liberation of europe from fascism be only a dream until it be achieve the fall of imperial communism be only a dream until one day it be accomplish our generation have dream of its own and we also go forward with confidence the road of providence be uneven and unpredictable yet we know where it lead it lead to freedom

 thank you

good evening i be speak to you from the city of new orleans nearly empty still partly under water and wait for life and hope to return eastward from lake pontchartrain across the mississippi coast to alabama into florida million of life be change in a day by a cruel and wasteful storm

 in the aftermath we have see fellow citizen leave stunned and uproot search for love one and grieve for the dead and look for meaning in a tragedy that seem so blind and random we have also witness the kind of desperation no citizen of this great and generous nation should ever have to know fellow americans call out for food and water vulnerable people leave at the mercy of criminal who have no mercy and the body of the dead lying uncover and untende in the street

 these day of sorrow and outrage have also be mark by act of courage and kindness that make all americans proud coast guard and other personnel rescue ten of thousand of people from flooded neighborhood religious congregation and family have welcome stranger as brother and sister and neighbor in the community of chalmette when two man try to break into a home the owner invite they to stay and take in 15 other people who have no place to go at tulane hospital for children doctor and nurse do not eat for day so patient could have food and eventually carry the patient on their back up eight flight of stair to helicopter

 many first responder be victim themselves wound healer with a sense of duty great than their own suffering when i meet steve scott of the biloxi fire department he and his colleague be conduct a house to house search for survivor steve tell i this i lose my house and i lose my car but i still get my family and i still get my spirit

 across the gulf coast among people who have lose much and suffer much and give to the limit of their power we be see that same spirit a core of strength that survives all hurt a faith in god no storm can take away and a powerful american determination to clear the ruin and build well than before

 tonight so many victim of the hurricane and the flood be far from home and friend and familiar thing you need to know that our whole nation care about you and in the journey ahead you be not alone to all who carry a burden of loss i extend the deep sympathy of our country to every person who have serve and sacrifice in this emergency i offer the gratitude of our country and tonight i also offer this pledge of the american people throughout the area hit by the hurricane we will do what it take we will stay as long as it take to help citizen rebuild their community and their life and all who question the future of the crescent city need to know there be no way to imagine america without new orleans and this great city will rise again

 the work of rescue be largely finish the work of recovery be move forward in nearly all of mississippi electric power have be restore trade be start to return to the port of new orleans and agricultural shipment be move down the mississippi river all major gasoline pipeline be now in operation prevent the supply disruption that many fear the break in the levee have be close the pump be run and the water here in new orleans be recede by the hour environmental official be on the ground take water sample identify and deal with hazardous debris and work to get drinking water and waste water treatment system operate again and some very sad duty be be carry out by professional who gather the dead treat they with respect and prepare they for their rest

 in the task of recovery and rebuilding some of the hard work be still ahead and it will require the creative skill and generosity of a united country

 our first commitment be to meet the immediate need of those who have to flee their home and leave all their possession behind for these americans every night bring uncertainty every day require new courage and in the month to come will bring more than their fair share of struggle

 the department of homeland security be register evacuee who be now in shelter and church or private home whether in the gulf region or far away i have sign an order provide immediate assistance to people from the disaster area as of today more than 500,000 evacuee family have get emergency help to pay for food clothing and other essential evacuee who have not yet register should contact fema or the red cross we need to know who you be because many of you will be eligible for broad assistance in the future many family be separate during the evacuation and we be work to help you reunite please call this number 1 877 568 3317 that be 1 877 568 3317 and we will work to bring your family back together and pay for your travel to reach they

 in addition we be take step to ensure that evacuee do not have to travel great distance or navigate bureaucracy to get the benefit that be there for they the department of health and human services have send more than 1,500 health professional along with over 50 ton of medical supply include vaccine and antibiotic and medicine for people with chronic condition such as diabetes the social security administration be deliver check the department of labor be help displace person apply for temporary job and unemployment benefit and the postal service be register new address so that people can get their mail

 to carry out the first stage of the relief effort and begin rebuild at once i have ask for and the congress have provide more than $ 60 billion this be an unprecedented response to an unprecedented crisis which demonstrate the compassion and resolve of our nation

 our second commitment be to help the citizen of the gulf coast to overcome this disaster put their life back together and rebuild their community along this coast for mile after mile the wind and water sweep the land clean in mississippi many thousand of house be damage or destroy in new orleans and surround parish more than a quarter million house be no long safe to live in hundred of thousand of people from across this region will need to find long term housing

 our goal be to get people out of the shelter by the middle of october so we be provide direct assistance to evacuee that allow they to rent apartment and many already be move into place of their own a number of state have take in evacuee and show they great compassion admit child to school and provide health care so i will work with the congress to ensure that state be reimburse for these extra expense

 in the disaster area and in city that have receive huge number of displace people we be begin to bring in mobile home and trailer for temporary use to relieve the burden on local health care facility in the region we be send extra doctor and nurse to these area we be also provide money that can be use to cover overtime pay for police and fire department while the city and town rebuild

 near new orleans and biloxi and other city housing be urgently need for police and firefighter other service provider and the many worker who be go to rebuild these city right now many be sleep on ship we have bring to the port of new orleans and more ship be on their way to the region and we will provide mobile home and supply they with basic service as close to construction area as possible so the rebuilding process can go forward as quickly as possible

 and the federal government will undertake a close partnership with the state of louisiana and mississippi the city of new orleans and other gulf coast city so they can rebuild in a sensible well plan way federal fund will cover the great majority of the cost of repair public infrastructure in the disaster zone from road and bridge to school and water system our goal be to get the work do quickly and taxpayer expect this work to be do honestly and wisely so we will have a team of inspector general review all expenditure

 in the rebuilding process there will be many important decision and many detail to resolve yet we be move forward accord to some clear principle the federal government will be fully engage in the mission but governor barbour governor blanco mayor nagin and other state and local leader will have the primary role in planning for their own future clearly community will need to move decisively to change zone law and building code in order to avoid a repeat of what we have see and in the work of rebuilding as many job as possible should go to the man and woman who live in louisiana mississippi and alabama

 our third commitment be this when community be rebuild they must be even well and strong than before the storm within the gulf region be some of the most beautiful and historic place in america as all of we see on television there be also some deep persistent poverty in this region as well that poverty have root in a history of racial discrimination which cut off generation from the opportunity of america we have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action so let we restore all that we have cherish from yesterday and let we rise above the legacy of inequality when the street be rebuild there should be many new business include minority own business along those street when the house be rebuild more family should own not rent those house when the regional economy revive local people should be prepare for the job be create

 americans want the gulf coast not just to survive but to thrive not just to cope but to overcome we want evacuee to come home for the good of reason because they have a real chance at a well life in a place they love

 when one resident of this city who lose his home be ask by a reporter if he would relocate he say naw i will rebuild but i will build high that be our vision for the future in this city and beyond we will not just rebuild we will build high and well to meet this goal i will listen to good idea from congress and state and local official and the private sector i believe we should start with three initiative that the congress should pass

 tonight i propose the creation of a gulf opportunity zone encompass the region of the disaster in louisiana and mississippi and alabama within this zone we should provide immediate incentive for job create investment tax relief for small business incentive to company that create job and loan and loan guarantee for small business include minority own enterprise to get they up and run again it be entrepreneurship that create job and opportunity it be entrepreneurship that help break the cycle of poverty and we will take the side of entrepreneur as they lead the economic revival of the gulf region

 i propose the creation of worker recovery accounts to help those evacuee who need extra help find work under this plan the federal government would provide account of up to $ 5,000 which these evacuee could draw upon for job training and education to help they get a good job and for child care expense during their job search

 and to help low income citizen in the hurricane region build new and well life i also propose that congress pass an urban homesteading act under this approach we will identify property in the region own by the federal government and provide building site to low income citizen free of charge through a lottery in return they would pledge to build on the lot with either a mortgage or help from a charitable organization like habitat for humanity home ownership be one of the great strength of any community and it must be a central part of our vision for the revival of this region

 in the long run the new orleans area have a particular challenge because much of the city lie below sea level the people who call it home need to have reassurance that their life will be safe in the year to come protect a city that sit low than the water around it be not easy but it can and have be do city and parish official in new orleans and state official in louisiana will have a large part in the engineering decision to come and the army corps of engineers will work at their side to make the flood protection system strong than it have ever be

 the work that have begin in the gulf coast region will be one of the large reconstruction effort the world have ever see when that job be do all americans will have something to be very proud of and all americans be need in this common effort it be the army of compassion charity and house of worship and idealistic man and woman that give our reconstruction effort its humanity they offer to those who hurt a friendly face an arm around the shoulder and the reassurance that in hard time they can count on someone who care by land by sea and by air good people want to make a difference deploy to the gulf coast and they have be work around the clock ever since

 the cash need to support the army of compassion be great and americans have give generously for example the private fundraising effort lead by former presidents bush and clinton have already receive pledge of more than $ 100 million some of that money be go to the governors to be use for immediate need within their state a portion will also be send to local house of worship to help reimburse they for the expense of help other this evening the need be still urgent and i ask the american people to continue donate to the salvation army the red cross other good charity and religious congregation in the region

 it be also essential for the many organization of our country to reach out to your fellow citizen in the gulf area so i have ask usa freedom corps to create an information clearinghouse available at usafreedomcorps.gov so that family anywhere in the country can find opportunity to help family in the region or a school can support a school and i challenge exist organization church and scout troop or labor union local to get in touch with their counterpart in mississippi louisiana or alabama and learn what they can do to help in this great national enterprise important work can be do by everyone and everyone should find their role and do their part

 the government of this nation will do its part as well our city must have clear and up to date plan for respond to natural disaster and disease outbreak or a terrorist attack for evacuate large number of people in an emergency and for provide the food and water and security they would need in a time of terror threat and weapon of mass destruction the danger to our citizen reach much wide than a fault line or a flood plain i consider detailed emergency planning to be a national security priority and therefore i have order the department of homeland security to undertake an immediate review in cooperation with local counterpart of emergency plan in every major city in america

 i also want to know all the fact about the government response to hurricane katrina the storm involve a massive flood a major supply and security operation and an evacuation order affect more than a million people it be not a normal hurricane and the normal disaster relief system be not equal to it many of the man and woman of the coast guard the federal emergency management agency the united states military the national guard homeland security and state and local government perform skillfully under the bad condition yet the system at every level of government be not well coordinate and be overwhelmed in the first few day it be now clear that a challenge on this scale require great federal authority and a broad role for the armed force the institution of our government most capable of massive logistical operation on a moment 's notice

 four year after the frightening experience of september the 11th americans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency when the federal government fail to meet such an obligation i as president be responsible for the problem and for the solution so i have order every cabinet secretary to participate in a comprehensive review of the government response to the hurricane this government will learn the lesson of hurricane katrina we be go to review every action and make necessary change so that we be well prepared for any challenge of nature or act of evil man that could threaten our people

 the united states congress also have an important oversight function to perform congress be prepare an investigation and i will work with member of both party to make sure this effort be thorough

 in the life of this nation we have often be remind that nature be an awesome force and that all life be fragile we be the heir of man and woman who live through those first terrible winter at jamestown and plymouth who rebuild chicago after a great fire and san francisco after a great earthquake who reclaim the prairie from the dust bowl of the 1930 every time the people of this land have come back from fire flood and storm to build anew and to build well than what we have before americans have never leave our destiny to the whim of nature and we will not start now

 these trial have also remind we that we be often strong than we know with the help of grace and one another they remind we of a hope beyond all pain and death a god who welcome the lose to a house not make with hand and they remind we that we be tie together in this life in this nation and that the despair of any touch we all

 i know that when you sit on the step of a porch where a home once stand or sleep on a cot in a crowded shelter it be hard to imagine a bright future but that future will come the street of biloxi and gulfport will again be fill with lovely home and the sound of child play the church of alabama will have their broken steeple mend and their congregation whole and here in new orleans the street car will once again rumble down st. charles and the passionate soul of a great city will return

 in this place there be a custom for the funeral of jazz musician the funeral procession parade slowly through the street follow by a band play a mournful dirge as it move to the cemetery once the casket have be lay in place the band break into a joyful second line symbolize the triumph of the spirit over death tonight the gulf coast be still come through the dirge yet we will live to see the second line

 thank you and may god bless america

good evening three day ago in large number iraqis go to the poll to choose their own leader a landmark day in the history of liberty in the come week the ballot will be count a new government form and a people who suffer in tyranny for so long will become full member of the free world

 this election will not mean the end of violence but it be the beginning of something new constitutional democracy at the heart of the middle east and this vote 6,000 mile away in a vital region of the world mean that america have an ally of grow strength in the fight against terror

 all who have a part in this achievement iraqis and americans and our coalition partner can be proud yet our work be not do there be more testing and sacrifice before we i know many americans have question about the cost and direction of this war so tonight i want to talk to you about how far we have come in iraq and the path that lie ahead

 from this office nearly three year ago i announce the start of military operation in iraq our coalition confront a regime that defy united nations security council resolution violate a cease fire agreement sponsor terrorism and possess we believe weapon of mass destruction after the swift fall of baghdad we find mass grave fill by a dictator we find some capacity to restart program to produce weapon of mass destruction but we do not find those weapon

 it be true that saddam hussein have a history of pursue and use weapon of mass destruction it be true that he systematically conceal those program and block the work of u.n. weapon inspector it be true that many nation believe that saddam have weapon of mass destruction but much of the intelligence turn out to be wrong as your president i be responsible for the decision to go into iraq yet it be right to remove saddam hussein from power

 he be give an ultimatum and he make his choice for war and the result of that war be to rid a the world of a murderous dictator who menace his people invade his neighbor and declare america to be his enemy saddam hussein capture and jail be still the same rage tyrant only now without a throne his power to harm a single man woman or child be go forever and the world be well for it

 since the removal of saddam this war like other war in our history have be difficult the mission of american troop in urban raid and desert patrol fight saddam loyalist and foreign terrorist have bring danger and suffering and loss this loss have cause sorrow for our whole nation and it have lead some to ask if we be create more problem than we be solve

 that be an important question and the answer depend on your view of the war on terror if you think the terrorist would become peaceful if only america would stop provoke they then it might make sense to leave they alone

 this be not the threat i see i see a global terrorist movement that exploit islam in the service of radical political aim a vision in which book be burn and woman be oppress and all dissent be crush terrorist operative conduct their campaign of murder with a set of declare and specific goal to de moralize free nation to drive we out of the middle east to spread an empire of fear across that region and to wage a perpetual war against america and our friend these terrorist view the world as a giant battlefield and they seek to attack we wherever they can this have attract al qaeda to iraq where they be attempt to frighten and intimidate america into a policy of retreat

 the terrorist do not merely object to american action in iraq and elsewhere they object to our deep value and our way of life and if we be not fight they in iraq in afghanistan in southeast asia and in other place the terrorist would not be peaceful citizen they would be on the offense and head our way

 september the 11th 2001 require we to take every emerge threat to our country seriously and it shatter the illusion that terrorist attack we only after we provoke they on that day we be not in iraq we be not in afghanistan but the terrorist attack we anyway and kill nearly 3,000 man woman and child in our own country my conviction come down to this we do not create terrorism by fight the terrorist we invite terrorism by ignore they and we will defeat the terrorist by capture and kill they abroad remove their safe haven and strengthen new ally like iraq and afghanistan in the fight we share

 the work in iraq have be especially difficult more difficult than we expect reconstruction effort and the training of iraqi security force start more slowly than we hope we continue to see violence and suffering cause by an enemy that be determined and brutal unconstraine by conscience or the rule of war

 some look at the challenge in iraq and conclude that the war be lose and not worth another dime or another day i do not believe that our military commander do not believe that our troop in the field who bear the burden and make the sacrifice do not believe that america have lose and not even the terrorist believe it we know from their own communication that they feel a tighten noose and fear the rise of a democratic iraq

 the terrorist will continue to have the coward 's power to plant roadside bomb and recruit suicide bomber and you will continue to see the grim result on the evening news this prove that the war be difficult it do not mean that we be lose behind the image of chaos that terrorist create for the camera we be make steady gain with a clear objective in view

 america our coalition and iraqi leader be work toward the same goal a democratic iraq that can defend itself that will never again be a safe haven for terrorist and that will serve as a model of freedom for the middle east

 we have put in place a strategy to achieve this goal a strategy i have be discuss in detail over the last few week this plan have three critical element

 first our coalition will remain on the offense find and clear out the enemy transfer control of more territory to iraqi unit and build up the iraqi security force so they can increasingly lead the fight at this time last year there be only a handful of iraqi army and police battalion ready for combat now there be more than 125 iraqi combat battalion fight the enemy more than 50 be take the lead and we have transfer more than a dozen military basis to iraqi control

 second we be help the iraqi government establish the institution of a unified and lasting democracy in which all of iraq 's people be include and represent here also the news be encouraging three day ago more than 10 million iraqis go to the poll include many sunni iraqis who have boycott national election last january iraqis of every background be recognize that democracy be the future of the country they love and they want their voice hear one iraqi after dip his finger in the purple ink as he cast his ballot stick his finger in the air and say this be a thorn in the eye of the terrorist another voter be ask be you sunni or shia and he respond i be iraqi

 third after a number of setback our coalition be move forward with a reconstruction plan to revive iraq 's economy and infrastructure and to give iraqis confidence that a free life will be a well life today in iraq seven in 10 iraqis say their life be go well and nearly two third expect thing to improve even more in the year ahead despite the violence iraqis be optimistic and that optimism be justify

 in all three aspect of our strategy security democracy and reconstruction we have learn from our experience and fix what have not work we will continue to listen to honest criticism and make every change that will help we complete the mission yet there be a difference between honest critic who recognize what be wrong and defeatist who refuse to see that anything be right

 defeatism may have its partisan use but it be not justify by the fact for every scene of destruction in iraq there be more scene of rebuilding and hope for every life lose there be countless more life reclaim and for every terrorist work to stop freedom in iraq there be many more iraqis and americans work to defeat they my fellow citizen not only can we win the war in iraq we be win the war in iraq

 it be also important for every american to understand the consequence of pull out of iraq before our work be do we would abandon our iraqi friend and signal to the world that america can not be trust to keep its word we would undermine the morale of our troop by betray the cause for which they have sacrifice we would cause the tyrant in the middle east to laugh at our fail resolve and tighten their repressive grip we would hand iraq over to enemy who have pledge to attack we and the global terrorist movement would be embolden and more dangerous than ever before to retreat before victory would be an act of recklessness and dishonor and i will not allow it

 we be approach a new year and there be certain thing all americans can expect to see we will see more sacrifice from our military their family and the iraqi people we will see a concerted effort to improve iraqi police force and fight corruption we will see the iraqi military gain strength and confidence and the democratic process move forward as these achievement come it should require few american troop to accomplish our mission i will make decision on troop level base on the progress we see on the ground and the advice of our military leader not base on artificial timetable set by politician in washington our force in iraq be on the road to victory and that be the road that will take they home

 in the month ahead all americans will have a part in the success of this war member of congress will need to provide resource for our military our man and woman in uniform who have do so much already will continue their brave and urgent work and tonight i ask all of you listen to carefully consider the stake of this war to realize how far we have come and the good we be do and to have patience in this difficult noble and necessary cause

 i also want to speak to those of you who do not support my decision to send troop to iraq i have hear your disagreement and i know how deeply it be feel yet now there be only two option before our country victory or defeat and the need for victory be large than any president or political party because the security of our people be in the balance i do not expect you to support everything i do but tonight i have a request do not give in to despair and do not give up on this fight for freedom

 americans can expect some thing of i as well my most solemn responsibility be to protect our nation and that require i to make some tough decision i see the consequence of those decision when i meet wounded servicemen and woman who can not leave their hospital bed but summon the strength to look i in the eye and say they would do it all over again i see the consequence when i talk to parent who miss a child so much but tell i he love be a soldier he believe in his mission and mr. president finish the job

 i know that some of my decision have lead to terrible loss and not one of those decision have be take lightly i know this war be controversial yet be your president require do what i believe be right and accept the consequence and i have never be more certain that america 's action in iraq be essential to the security of our citizen and will lay the foundation of peace for our child and grandchild

 next week americans will gather to celebrate christmas and hanukkah many family will be pray for love one spend this season far from home in iraq afghanistan and other dangerous place our nation join in those prayer we pray for the safety and strength of our troop we trust with they in a love that conquer all fear in a light that reach the dark corner of the earth and we remember the word of the christmas carol write during the civil war god be not dead nor do he sleep the wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to man

 thank you and good night

thank you all mr. speaker vice president cheney member of congress member of the supreme court and diplomatic corps distinguished guest and fellow citizen

 today our nation lose a beloved graceful courageous woman who call america to its found ideal and carry on a noble dream tonight we be comfort by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who be take so long ago and we be grateful for the good life of coretta scott king

 every time i be invite to this rostrum i be humble by the privilege and mindful of the history we have see together we have gather under this capitol dome in moment of national mourning and national achievement we have serve america through one of the most consequential period of our history and it have be my honor to serve with you

 in a system of two party two chamber and two elect branch there will always be difference and debate but even tough debate can be conduct in a civil tone and our difference can not be allow to harden into anger to confront the great issue before we we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another and i will do my part tonight the state of our union be strong and together we will make it strong

 in this decisive year you and i will make choice that determine both the future and the character of our country we will choose to act confidently in pursue the enemy of freedom or retreat from our duty in the hope of an easy life we will choose to build our prosperity by lead the world economy or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity in a complex and challenging time the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting yet it end in danger and decline the only way to protect our people the only way to secure the peace the only way to control our destiny be by our leadership so the united states of america will continue to lead

 abroad our nation be commit to an historic long term goal we seek the end of tyranny in our world some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism in reality the future security of america depend on it on september 11 2001 we find that problem originate in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 mile away could bring murder and destruction to our country dictatorship shelter terrorist and feed resentment and radicalism and seek weapon of mass destruction democracy replace resentment with hope respect the right of their citizen and their neighbor and join the fight against terror every step toward freedom in the world make our country safe so we will act boldly in freedom 's cause

 far from be a hopeless dream the advance of freedom be the great story of our time in 1945 there be about two dozen lonely democracy in the world today there be 122 and we be write a new chapter in the story of self government with woman line up to vote in afghanistan and million of iraqis mark their liberty with purple ink and man and woman from lebanon to egypt debate the right of individual and the necessity of freedom at the start of 2006 more than half the people of our world live in democratic nation and we do not forget the other half in place like syria and burma zimbabwe north korea and iran because the demand of justice and the peace of this world require their freedom as well

 no one can deny the success of freedom but some man rage and fight against it and one of the main source of reaction and opposition be radical islam the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death terrorist like bin laden be serious about mass murder and all of we must take their declare intention seriously they seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the middle east and arm themselves with weapon of mass murder

 their aim be to seize power in iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch attack against america and the world lack the military strength to challenge we directly the terrorist have choose the weapon of fear when they murder child at a school in beslan or blow up commuter in london or behead a bind captive the terrorist hope these horror will break our will allow the violent to inherit the earth but they have miscalculate we love our freedom and we will fight to keep it

 in a time of testing we can not find security by abandon our commitment and retreat within our border if we be to leave these vicious attacker alone they would not leave we alone they would simply move the battlefield to our own shore there be no peace in retreat and there be no honor in retreat by allow radical islam to work its will by leave an assaulted world to fend for itself we would signal to all that we no long believe in our own ideal or even in our own courage but our enemy and our friend can be certain the united states will not retreat from the world and we will never surrender to evil

 america reject the false comfort of isolationism we be the nation that save liberty in europe and liberate death camp and help raise up democracy and face down an evil empire once again we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace we remain on the offensive against terror network we have kill or capture many of their leader and for the other their day will come

 we remain on the offensive in afghanistan where a fine president and a national assembly be fight terror while build the institution of a new democracy we be on the offensive in iraq with a clear plan for victory

 first we be help iraqis build an inclusive government so that old resentment will be ease and the insurgency will be marginalize second we be continue reconstruction effort and help the iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy so all iraqis can experience the benefit of freedom and third we be strike terrorist target while we train iraqi force that be increasingly capable of defeat the enemy iraqis be show their courage every day and we be proud to be their ally in the cause of freedom

 our work in iraq be difficult because our enemy be brutal but that brutality have not stop the dramatic progress of a new democracy in less than three year the nation have go from dictatorship to liberation to sovereignty to a constitution to national election at the same time our coalition have be relentless in shut off terrorist infiltration clear out insurgent stronghold and turn over territory to iraqi security force i be confident in our plan for victory i be confident in the will of the iraqi people i be confident in the skill and spirit of our military fellow citizen we be in this fight to win and we be win

 the road of victory be the road that will take our troop home as we make progress on the ground and iraqi force increasingly take the lead we should be able to far decrease our troop level but those decision will be make by our military commander not by politician in washington d.c.

 our coalition have learn from our experience in iraq we have adjust our military tactic and change our approach to reconstruction along the way we have benefit from responsible criticism and counsel offer by member of congress of both party in the come year i will continue to reach out and seek your good advice yet there be a difference between responsible criticism that aim for success and defeatism that refuse to acknowledge anything but failure hindsight alone be not wisdom and second guessing be not a strategy

 with so much in the balance those of we in public office have a duty to speak with candor a sudden withdrawal of our force from iraq would abandon our iraqi ally to death and prison would put man like bin laden and zarqawi in charge of a strategic country and show that a pledge from america mean little member of congress however we feel about the decision and debate of the past our nation have only one option we must keep our word defeat our enemy and stand behind the american military in this vital mission

 our man and woman in uniform be make sacrifice and show a sense of duty strong than all fear they know what it be like to fight house to house in a maze of street to wear heavy gear in the desert heat to see a comrade kill by a roadside bomb and those who know the cost also know the stake marine staff sergeant dan clay be kill last month fight in fallujah he leave behind a letter to his family but his word could just as well be address to every american here be what dan write i know what honor be it have be an honor to protect and serve all of you i face death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to never falter do not hesitate to honor and support those of we who have the honor of protect that which be worth protect

 staff sergeant dan clay 's wife lisa and his mom and dad sara jo and bud be with we this evening welcome

 our nation be grateful to the fall who live in the memory of our country we be grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation 's uniform and as we honor our brave troop let we never forget the sacrifice of america 's military family

 our offensive against terror involve more than military action ultimately the only way to defeat the terrorist be to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offer the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change so the united states of america support democratic reform across the broad middle east election be vital but they be only the beginning raise up a democracy require the rule of law and protection of minority and strong accountable institution that last long than a single vote

 the great people of egypt have vote in a multiparty presidential election and now their government should open path of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism the palestinian people have vote in election and now the leader of hamas must recognize israel disarm reject terrorism and work for last peace saudi arabia have take the first step of reform now it can offer its people a well future by press forward with those effort democracy in the middle east will not look like our own because they will reflect the tradition of their own citizen yet liberty be the future of every nation in the middle east because liberty be the right and hope of all humanity

 the same be true of iran a nation now hold hostage by a small clerical elite that be isolate and repress its people the regime in that country sponsor terrorist in the palestinian territory and in lebanon and that must come to an end the iranian government be defy the world with its nuclear ambition and the nation of the world must not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapon america will continue to rally the world to confront these threat

 tonight let i speak directly to the citizen of iran america respect you and we respect your country we respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom and our nation hope one day to be the close of friend with a free and democratic iran

 to overcome danger in our world we must also take the offensive by encourage economic progress and fighting disease and spread hope in hopeless land isolationism would not only tie our hand in fight enemy it would keep we from help our friend in desperate need we show compassion abroad because americans believe in the god give dignity and worth of a villager with hiv aids or an infant with malaria or a refugee flee genocide or a young girl sell into slavery we also show compassion abroad because region overwhelm by poverty corruption and despair be source of terrorism and organized crime and human trafficking and the drug trade

 in recent year you and i have take unprecedented action to fight aids and malaria expand the education of girl and reward develop nation that be move forward with economic and political reform for people everywhere the united states be a partner for a well life shortchange these effort would increase the suffering and chaos of our world undercut our long term security and dull the conscience of our country i urge member of congress to serve the interest of america by show the compassion of america

 our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home the enemy have not lose the desire or capability to attack we fortunately this nation have superb professional in law enforcement intelligence the military and homeland security these man and woman be dedicate their life protect we all and they deserve our support and our thank they also deserve the same tool they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime so i ask you to reauthorize the patriot act

 it be say that prior to the attack of september 11 our government fail to connect the dot of the conspiracy we now know that two of the hijacker in the united states place telephone call to al qaeda operative overseas but we do not know about their plan until it be too late so to prevent another attack base on authority give to i by the constitution and by statute i have authorize a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communication of suspect al qaeda operative and affiliate to and from america previous president have use the same constitutional authority i have and federal court have approve the use of that authority appropriate member of congress have be keep inform the terrorist surveillance program have help prevent terrorist attack it remain essential to the security of america if there be people inside our country who be talk with al qaeda we want to know about it because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again

 in all these area from the disruption of terror network to victory in iraq to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled region we need the support of our friend and ally to draw that support we must always be clear in our principle and willing to act the only alternative to american leadership be a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world yet we also choose to lead because it be a privilege to serve the value that give we birth american leader from roosevelt to truman to kennedy to reagan reject isolation and retreat because they know that america be always more secure when freedom be on the march

 our own generation be in a long war against a determined enemy a war that will be fight by president of both party who will need steady bipartisan support from the congress and tonight i ask for your together let we protect our country support the man and woman who defend we and lead this world toward freedom

 here at home america also have a great opportunity we will build the prosperity of our country by strengthen our economic leadership in the world

 our economy be healthy and vigorous and grow fast than other major industrialize nation in the last two and a half year america have create 4.6 million new job more than japan and the european union combine even in the face of high energy price and natural disaster the american people have turn in an economic performance that be the envy of the world

 the american economy be preeminent but we can not afford to be complacent in a dynamic world economy we be see new competitor like china and india and this create uncertainty which make it easy to feed people 's fear so we be see some old temptation return protectionist want to escape competition pretend that we can keep our high standard of living while wall off our economy other say that the government need to take a large role in direct the economy centralize more power in washington and increase taxis we hear claim that immigrant be somehow bad for the economy even though this economy could not function without they all these be form of economic retreat and they lead in the same direction toward a stagnant and second rate economy

 tonight i will set out a well path an agenda for a nation that compete with confidence an agenda that will raise standard of living and generate new job americans should not fear our economic future because we intend to shape it

 keep america competitive begin with keep our economy grow and our economy grow when americans have more of their own money to spend save and invest in the last five year the tax relief you pass have leave $ 880 billion in the hand of american worker investor small business and family and they have use it to help produce more than four year of uninterrupted economic growth yet the tax relief be set to expire in the next few year if we do nothing american family will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome because america need more than a temporary expansion we need more than temporary tax relief i urge the congress to act responsibly and make the tax cut permanent

 keep america competitive require we to be good steward of tax dollar every year of my presidency we have reduce the growth of nonsecurity discretionary spending and last year you pass bill that cut this spending this year my budget will cut it again and reduce or eliminate more than 140 program that be perform poorly or not fulfil essential priority by pass these reform we will save the american taxpayer another $ 14 billion next year and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009

 i be pleased that member of congress be work on earmark reform because the federal budget have too many special interest project and we can tackle this problem together if you pass the line item veto

 we must also confront the large challenge of mandatory spending or entitlement this year the first of about 78 million baby boomer turn 60 include two of my dad 's favorite people i and president clinton laughter this milestone be more than a personal crisis—[laughter]—it be a national challenge the retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strain on the federal government by 2030 spend for social security medicare and medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget and that will present future congresses with impossible choice staggering tax increase immense deficit or deep cut in every category of spending congress do not act last year on my proposal to save social security yet the rise cost of entitlement be a problem that be not go away and every year we fail to act the situation get bad

 so tonight i ask you to join i in create a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirement on social security medicare and medicaid this commission should include member of congress of both party and offer bipartisan solution we need to put aside partisan politic and work together and get this problem solve

 keep america competitive require we to open more market for all that americans make and grow one out of every five factory job in america be relate to global trade and we want people everywhere to buy american with open market and a level playing field no one can outproduce or outcompete the american worker

 keep america competitive require an immigration system that uphold our law reflect our value and serve the interest of our economy our nation need orderly and secure border to meet this goal we must have strong immigration enforcement and border protection and we must have a rational humane guest worker program that reject amnesty allow temporary job for people who seek they legally and reduce smuggling and crime at the border

 keep america competitive require affordable health care our government have a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly and we be meet that responsibility for all americans we must confront the rise cost of care strengthen the doctor patient relationship and help people afford the insurance coverage they need

 we will make wide use of electronic record and other health information technology to help control cost and reduce dangerous medical error we will strengthen health saving account make sure individual and small business employee can buy insurance with the same advantage that people work for big business now get we will do more to make this coverage portable so worker can switch job without have to worry about lose their health insurance and because lawsuit be drive many good doctor out of practice leave woman in nearly 1,500 american county without a single ob gyn i ask the congress to pass medical liability reform this year

 keep america competitive require affordable energy and here we have a serious problem america be addict to oil which be often import from unstable part of the world the good way to break this addiction be through technology since 2001 we have spend nearly $ 10 billion to develop clean cheap and more reliable alternative energy source and we be on the threshold of incredible advance

 so tonight i announce the advanced energy initiative a 22 percent increase in clean energy research at the department of energy to push for breakthrough in two vital area to change how we power our home and office we will invest more in zero emission coal fire plant revolutionary solar and wind technology and clean safe nuclear energy

 we must also change how we power our automobile we will increase our research in well battery for hybrid and electric car and in pollution free car that run on hydrogen we will also fund additional research in cut edge method of produce ethanol not just from corn but from wood chip and stalk or switch grass our goal be to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six year

 breakthrough on this and other new technology will help we reach another great goal to replace more than 75 percent of our oil import from the middle east by 2025 by apply the talent and technology of america this country can dramatically improve our environment move beyond a petroleum base economy and make our dependence on middle eastern oil a thing of the past

 and to keep america competitive one commitment be necessary above all we must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity our great advantage in the world have always be our educated hard work ambitious people and we be go to keep that edge tonight i announce an american competitiveness initiative to encourage innovation throughout our economy and to give our nation 's child a firm grounding in math and science

 first i propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research program in the physical science over the next 10 year this funding will support the work of america 's most creative mind as they explore promise area such as nanotechnology supercomputing and alternative energy source

 second i propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit to encourage bold private sector initiative in technology with more research in both the public and private sector we will improve our quality of life and ensure that america will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for decade to come

 third we need to encourage child to take more math and science and to make sure those course be rigorous enough to compete with other nation we have make a good start in the early grade with the no child leave behind act which be raise standard and lift test score across our country tonight i propose to train 70,000 high school teacher to lead advanced placement course in math and science bring 30,000 math and science professional to teach in classroom and give early help to student who struggle with math so they have a well chance at good high wage job if we ensure that america 's child succeed in life they will ensure that america succeed in the world

 prepare our nation to compete in the world be a goal that all of we can share i urge you to support the american competitiveness initiative and together we will show the world what the american people can achieve

 america be a great force for freedom and prosperity yet our greatness be not measure in power or luxury but by who we be and how we treat one another so we strive to be a compassionate decent hopeful society

 in recent year america have become a more hopeful nation violent crime rate have fall to their low level since the 1970 welfare case have drop by more than half over the past decade drug use among youth be down 19 percent since 2001 there be few abortion in america than at any point in the last three decade and the number of child bear to teenage mother have be fall for a dozen year in a row

 these gain be evidence of a quiet transformation a revolution of conscience in which a rise generation be find that a life of personal responsibility be a life of fulfillment government have play a role wise policy such as welfare reform and drug education and support for abstinence and adoption have make a difference in the character of our country and everyone here tonight democrat and republican have a right to be proud of this record

 yet many americans especially parent still have deep concern about the direction of our culture and the health of our most basic institution they be concerned about unethical conduct by public official and discourage by activist court that try to redefine marriage they worry about child in our society who need direction and love and about fellow citizen still displace by natural disaster and about suffer cause by treatable disease

 as we look at these challenge we must never give in to the belief that america be in decline or that our culture be doom to unravel the american people know well than that we have prove the pessimist wrong before and we will do it again

 a hopeful society depend on court that deliver equal justice under the law the supreme court now have two superb new member on its bench chief justice john roberts and justice sam alito i thank the senate for confirm both of they i will continue to nominate man and woman who understand that judge must be servant of the law and not legislate from the bench

 today mark the official retirement of a very special american for 24 year of faithful service to our nation the united states be grateful to justice sandra day o'connor

 a hopeful society have institution of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corner and that recognize the matchless value of every life tonight i ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuse of medical research human cloning in all its form create or implant embryo for experiment create human animal hybrid and buy selling or patent human embryo human life be a gift from our creator and that gift should never be discard devalue or put up for sale

 a hopeful society expect elect official to uphold the public trust honorable people in both party be work on reform to strengthen the ethical standard of washington i support your effort each of we have make a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility and that be a pledge we must never forget never dismiss and never betray

 as we renew the promise of our institution let we also show the character of america in our compassion and care for one another

 a hopeful society give special attention to child who lack direction and love through the helping america 's youth initiative we be encourage care adult to get involve in the life of a child and this good work be be lead by our first lady laura bush this year we will add resource to encourage young people to stay in school so more of america 's youth can raise their sight and achieve their dream

 a hopeful society come to the aid of fellow citizen in time of suffering and emergency and stay at it until they be back on their foot so far the federal government have commit $ 85 billion to the people of the gulf coast and new orleans we be remove debris and repair highway and rebuild strong levee we be provide business loan and housing assistance yet as we meet these immediate need we must also address deep challenge that exist before the storm arrive

 in new orleans and in other place many of our fellow citizen have felt exclude from the promise of our country the answer be not only temporary relief but school that teach every child and job skill that bring upward mobility and more opportunity to own a home and start a business as we recover from a disaster let we also work for the day when all americans be protect by justice equal in hope and rich in opportunity

 a hopeful society act boldly to fight disease like hiv aids which can be prevent and treat and defeat more than a million americans live with hiv and half of all aids case occur among african americans i ask congress to reform and reauthorize the ryan white act and provide new funding to states so we end the waiting list for aids medicine in america we will also lead a nationwide effort work closely with african american church and faith base group to deliver rapid hiv test to million end the stigma of aids and come close to the day when there be no new infection in america

 fellow citizen we have be call to leadership in a period of consequence we have enter a great ideological conflict we do nothing to invite we see great change in science and commerce that will influence all our life sometimes it can seem that history be turn in a wide arc toward an unknown shore yet the destination of history be determine by human action and every great movement of history come to a point of choose

 lincoln could have accept peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery martin luther king could have stop at birmingham or at selma and achieve only half a victory over segregation the united states could have accept the permanent division of europe and be complicit in the oppression of other today having come far in our own historical journey we must decide will we turn back or finish well

 before history be write down in book it be write in courage like americans before we we will show that courage and we will finish well we will lead freedom 's advance we will compete and excel in the global economy we will renew the define moral commitment of this land and so we move forward optimistic about our country faithful to its cause and confident of the victory to come

 may god bless america

good afternoon congress have just pass and send to my desk two bill concern the use of stem cell in biomedical research these bill illustrate both the promise and peril we face in the age of biotechnology in this new era our challenge be to harness the power of science to ease human suffering without sanction the practice that violate the dignity of human life applause

 in 2001 i speak to the american people and set forth a new policy on stem cell research that strike a balance between the need of science and the demand of conscience when i take office there be no federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research under the policy i announce five year ago my administration become the first to make federal fund available for this research yet only on embryonic stem cell line derive from embryo that have already be destroy

 my administration have make available more than $ 90 million for research on these line this policy have allow important research to go forward without use taxpayer fund to encourage the further deliberate destruction of human embryo

 one of the bill congress have pass build on the progress we have make over the last five year so i sign it into law applause congress have also pass a second bill that attempt to overturn the balanced policy i set this bill would support the taking of innocent human life in the hope of find medical benefit for other it cross a moral boundary that our decent society need to respect so i veto it applause

 like all americans i believe our nation must vigorously pursue the tremendous possibility that science offer to cure disease and improve the life of million we have opportunity to discover cure and treatment that be unthinkable generation ago some scientist believe that one source of these cure might be embryonic stem cell research embryonic stem cell have the ability to grow into specialized adult tissue and this may give they the potential to replace damaged or defective cell or body part and treat a variety of disease

 yet we must also remember that embryonic stem cell come from human embryo that be destroy for their cell each of these human embryo be a unique human life with inherent dignity and matchless value we see that value in the child who be with we today each of these child begin his or her life as a frozen embryo that be create for in vitro fertilization but remain unused after the fertility treatment be complete each of these child be adopt while still an embryo and have be bless with the chance to grow up in a love family

 these boy and girl be not spare part applause they remind we of what be lose when embryo be destroy in the name of research they remind we that we all begin our life as a small collection of cell and they remind we that in our zeal for new treatment and cure america must never abandon our fundamental moral

 some people argue that find new cure for disease require the destruction of human embryo like the one that these family adopt i disagree i believe that with the right technique and the right policy we can achieve scientific progress while live up to our ethical responsibility that be what i seek in 2001 when i set forth my administration 's policy allow federal funding for research on embryonic stem cell line where the life and death decision have already be make

 this balanced approach have work under this policy 21 human embryonic stem cell line be currently in use in research that be eligible for federal funding each of these line can be replicate many time and as a result the national institutes of health have help make more than 700 shipment to researcher since 2001 there be no ban on embryonic stem cell research to the contrary even critic of my policy concede that these federally fund line be be use in research every day by scientist around the world my policy have allow we to explore the potential of embryonic stem cell and it have allow america to continue to lead the world in this area

 since i announce my policy in 2001 advance in scientific research have also show the great potential of stem cell that be derive without harm human embryo my administration have expand the funding of research into stem cell that can be draw from child adult and the blood in umbilical cord with no harm to the donor and these stem cell be already be use in medical treatment

 with we today be patient who have benefit from treatment with adult and umbilical cord blood stem cell and i want to thank you all for come applause

 they be live proof that effective medical science can also be ethical researcher be now also investigate new technique that could allow doctor and scientist to produce stem cell just as versatile as those derive from human embryo one technique scientist be explore would involve reprogramme an adult cell for example a skin cell to function like an embryonic stem cell science offer the hope that we may one day enjoy the potential benefit of embryonic stem cell without destroy human life

 we must continue to explore these hopeful alternative and advance the cause of scientific research while stay true to the ideal of a decent and humane society the bill i sign today uphold these humane ideal and draw an important ethical line to guide our research the fetus farming prohibition act be sponsor by senators santorum and brownback both who be here applause and by congressman dave weldon along with nathan deal thank you congressman applause this good law prohibit one of the most egregious abuse in biomedical research the trafficking in human fetus that be create with the sole intent of abort they to harvest their part human being be not a raw material to be exploit or a commodity to be buy or sell and this bill will help ensure that we respect the fundamental ethical line

 i be disappointed that congress fail to pass another bill that would have promote good research this bill be sponsor by senator santorum and senator arlen specter and congressman roscoe bartlett thank for come roscoe applause it would have authorize additional federal funding for promise new research that could produce cell with the ability of embryonic cell but without the destruction of human embryo this be an important piece of legislation this bill be unanimously approve by the senate it receive 273 vote in the house of representatives but be block by a minority in the house use procedural maneuver i be disappointed that the house fail to authorize funding for this vital and ethical research

 it make no sense to say that you be in favor of find cure for terrible disease as quickly as possible and then block a bill that would authorize funding for promising and ethical stem cell research at a moment when ethical alternative be become available we can not lose the opportunity to conduct research that would give hope to those suffer from terrible disease and help move our nation beyond the current controversy over embryonic stem cell research

 we must pursue this research and so i direct the secretary of health and human services secretary leavitt and the director of the national institutes of health to use all the tool at their disposal to aid the search for stem cell technique that advance promise medical science in an ethical and morally responsible way applause

 unfortunately congress have send i a bill that fail to meet this ethical test this legislation would overturn the balanced policy on embryonic stem cell research that my administration have follow for the past five year this bill would also undermine the principle that congress itself have follow for more than a decade when it have prohibit federal funding for research that destroy human embryo

 if this bill would have become law american taxpayer would for the first time in our history be compel to fund the deliberate destruction of human embryo and i be not go to allow it applause

 i make it clear to the congress that i will not allow our nation to cross this moral line i feel like cross this line would be a mistake and once cross we would find it almost impossible to turn back cross the line would needlessly encourage a conflict between science and ethic that can only do damage to both and to our nation as a whole if we be to find the right way to advance ethical medical research we must also be willing when necessary to reject the wrong way so today i be keep the promise i make to the american people by return this bill to congress with my veto

 as science bring we ever close to unlock the secret of human biology it also offer temptation to manipulate human life and violate human dignity our conscience and history as a nation demand that we resist this temptation america be found on the principle that we be all create equal and endow by our creator with the right to life we can advance the cause of science while uphold this found promise we can harness the promise of technology without become slave to technology and we can ensure that science serve the cause of humanity instead of the other way around

 america pursue medical advance in the name of life and we will achieve the great breakthrough we all seek with reverence for the gift of life i believe america 's scientist have the ingenuity and skill to meet this challenge and i look forward to work with congress and the scientific community to achieve these great and noble goal in the year ahead

 thank you all for come and may god bless applause

good evening tonight in iraq the armed forces of the united states be engage in a struggle that will determine the direction of the global war on terror and our safety here at home the new strategy i outline tonight will change america 's course in iraq and help we succeed in the fight against terror

 when i address you just over a year ago nearly 12 million iraqis have cast their ballot for a unified and democratic nation the election of 2005 be a stunning achievement we think that these election would bring the iraqis together and that as we train iraqi security force we could accomplish our mission with few american troop

 but in 2006 the opposite happen the violence in iraq particularly in baghdad overwhelm the political gain the iraqis have make al qaeda terrorist and sunni insurgent recognize the mortal danger that iraq 's election pose for their cause and they respond with outrageous act of murder aim at innocent iraqis they blow up one of the holy shrine in shia islam the golden mosque of samarra in a calculated effort to provoke iraq 's shia population to retaliate their strategy work radical shia element some support by iran form death squad and the result be a vicious cycle of sectarian violence that continue today

 the situation in iraq be unacceptable to the american people and it be unacceptable to i our troop in iraq have fight bravely they have do everything we have ask they to do where mistake have be make the responsibility rest with i

 it be clear that we need to change our strategy in iraq so my national security team military commander and diplomat conduct a comprehensive review we consult member of congress from both party our ally abroad and distinguish outside expert we benefit from the thoughtful recommendation of the iraq study group a bipartisan panel lead by former secretary of state james baker and former congressman lee hamilton in our discussion we all agree that there be no magic formula for success in iraq and one message come through loud and clear failure in iraq would be a disaster for the united states

 the consequence of failure be clear radical islamic extremist would grow in strength and gain new recruit they would be in a well position to topple moderate government create chaos in the region and use oil revenue to fund their ambition iran would be embolden in its pursuit of nuclear weapon our enemy would have a safe haven from which to plan and launch attack on the american people on september the 11th 2001 we see what a refuge for extremist on the other side of the world could bring to the street of our own city for the safety of our people america must succeed in iraq

 the most urgent priority for success in iraq be security especially in baghdad eighty percent of iraq 's sectarian violence occur within 30 mile of the capital this violence be split baghdad into sectarian enclave and shake the confidence of all iraqis only iraqis can end the sectarian violence and secure their people and their government have put forward an aggressive plan to do it

 our past effort to secure baghdad fail for two principal reason there be not enough iraqi and american troop to secure neighborhood that have be clear of terrorist and insurgent and there be too many restriction on the troop we do have our military commander review the new iraqi plan to ensure that it address these mistake they report that it do they also report that this plan can work

 now let i explain the main element of this effort the iraqi government will appoint a military commander and two deputy commander for their capital the iraqi government will deploy iraqi army and national police brigade across baghdad 's nine district when these force be fully deploy there will be 18 iraqi army and national police brigade commit to this effort along with local police these iraqi force will operate from local police station conduct patrol and set up checkpoint and go door to door to gain the trust of baghdad resident

 this be a strong commitment but for it to succeed our commander say the iraqis will need our help so america will change our strategy to help the iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of baghdad this will require increase american force level so i have commit more than 20,000 additional american troop to iraq the vast majority of they five brigade will be deploy to baghdad these troop will work alongside iraqi unit and be embed in their formation our troop will have a well define mission to help iraqis clear and secure neighborhood to help they protect the local population and to help ensure that the iraqi force leave behind be capable of provide the security that baghdad need

 many listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operation to secure baghdad do not well here be the difference in early operation iraqi and american force clear many neighborhood of terrorist and insurgent but when our force move on to other target the killer return this time we will have the force level we need to hold the area that have be clear in early operation political and sectarian interference prevent iraqi and american force from go into neighborhood that be home to those fuel the sectarian violence this time iraqi and american force will have a green light to enter those neighborhood and prime minister maliki have pledge that political or sectarian interference will not be tolerate

 i have make it clear to the prime minister and iraq 's other leader that america 's commitment be not open ended if the iraqi government do not follow through on its promise it will lose the support of the american people and it will lose the support of the iraqi people now be the time to act the prime minister understand this here be what he tell his people just last week the baghdad security plan will not provide a safe haven for any outlaw regardless of their sectarian or political affiliation

 this new strategy will not yield an immediate end to suicide bombing assassination or ied attack our enemy in iraq will make every effort to ensure that our television screen be fill with image of death and suffering yet over time we can expect to see iraqi troop chase down murderer few brazen act of terror and grow trust and cooperation from baghdad 's resident when this happen daily life will improve iraqis will gain confidence in their leader and the government will have the breathing space it need to make progress in other critical area most of iraq 's sunni and shia want to live together in peace and reduce the violence in baghdad will help make reconciliation possible

 a successful strategy for iraq go beyond military operation ordinary iraqi citizen must see that military operation be accompany by visible improvement in their neighborhood and community so america will hold the iraqi government to the benchmark it have announce

 to establish its authority the iraqi government plan to take responsibility for security in all of iraq 's province by november to give every iraqi citizen a stake in the country 's economy iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenue among all iraqis to show that it be commit to deliver a well life the iraqi government will spend $ 10 billion of its own money on reconstruction and infrastructure project that will create new job to empower local leader iraqis plan to hold provincial election later this year and to allow more iraqis to re enter their nation 's political life the government will reform de baathification law and establish a fair process for consider amendment to iraq 's constitution

 america will change our approach to help the iraqi government as it work to meet these benchmark in keep with the recommendation of the iraq study group we will increase the embedding of american adviser in iraqi army unit and partner a coalition brigade with every iraqi army division we will help the iraqis build a large and well equip army and we will accelerate the training of iraqi force which remain the essential u.s. security mission in iraq we will give our commander and civilian great flexibility to spend fund for economic assistance we will double the number of provincial reconstruction team these team bring together military and civilian expert to help local iraqi community pursue reconciliation strengthen the moderate and speed the transition to iraqi self reliance and secretary rice will soon appoint a reconstruction coordinator in baghdad to ensure well result for economic assistance be spend in iraq

 as we make these change we will continue to pursue al qaeda and foreign fighter al qaeda be still active in iraq its home base be anbar province al qaeda have help make anbar the most violent area of iraq outside the capital a capture al qaeda document describe the terrorist plan to infiltrate and seize control of the province this would bring al qaeda close to its goal of take down iraq 's democracy build a radical islamic empire and launch new attack on the united states at home and abroad

 our military force in anbar be kill and capture al qaeda leader and they be protect the local population recently local tribal leader have begin to show their willingness to take on al qaeda and as a result our commander believe we have an opportunity to deal a serious blow to the terrorist so i have give order to increase american force in anbar province by 4,000 troop these troop will work with iraqi and tribal force to keep up the pressure on the terrorist america 's man and woman in uniform take away al qaeda 's safe haven in afghanistan and we will not allow they to re establish it in iraq

 succeed in iraq also require defend its territorial integrity and stabilize the region in the face of extremist challenge this begin with address iran and syria these two regime be allow terrorist and insurgent to use their territory to move in and out of iraq iran be provide material support for attack on american troop we will disrupt the attack on our force we will interrupt the flow of support from iran and syria and we will seek out and destroy the network provide advanced weaponry and training to our enemy in iraq

 we be also take other step to bolster the security of iraq and protect american interest in the middle east i recently order the deployment of an additional carrier strike group to the region we will expand intelligence sharing and deploy patriot air defense system to reassure our friend and ally we will work with the government of turkey and iraq to help they resolve problem along their border and we will work with other to prevent iran from gain nuclear weapon and dominate the region

 we will use america 's full diplomatic resource to rally support for iraq from nation throughout the middle east country like saudi arabia egypt jordan and the gulf states need to understand that an american defeat in iraq would create a new sanctuary for extremist and a strategic threat to their survival these nation have a stake in a successful iraq that be at peace with its neighbor and they must step up their support for iraq 's unity government we endorse the iraqi government 's call to finalize an international compact that will bring new economic assistance in exchange for great economic reform and on friday secretary rice will leave for the region to build support for iraq and continue the urgent diplomacy require to help bring peace to the middle east

 the challenge play out across the broad middle east be more than a military conflict it be the decisive ideological struggle of our time on one side be those who believe in freedom and moderation on the other side be extremist who kill the innocent and have declare their intention to destroy our way of life in the long run the most realistic way to protect the american people be to provide a hopeful alternative to the hateful ideology of the enemy by advance liberty across a troubled region it be in the interest of the united states to stand with the brave man and woman who be risk their life to claim their freedom and to help they as they work to raise up just and hopeful society across the middle east

 from afghanistan to lebanon to the palestinian territories million of ordinary people be sick of the violence and want a future of peace and opportunity for their child and they be look at iraq they want to know will america withdraw and yield the future of that country to the extremist or will we stand with the iraqis who have make the choice for freedom

 the change i have outline tonight be aim at ensure the survival of a young democracy that be fight for its life in a part of the world of enormous importance to american security let i be clear the terrorist and insurgent in iraq be without conscience and they will make the year ahead bloody and violent even if our new strategy work exactly as plan deadly act of violence will continue and we must expect more iraqi and american casualty the question be whether our new strategy will bring we close to success i believe that it will

 victory will not look like the one our father and grandfather achieve there will be no surrender ceremony on the deck of a battleship but victory in iraq will bring something new in the arab world a function democracy that police its territory uphold the rule of law respect fundamental human liberty and answer to its people a democratic iraq will not be perfect but it will be a country that fight terrorist instead of harbor they and it will help bring a future of peace and security for our child and our grandchild

 this new approach come after consultation with congress about the different course we could take in iraq many be concerned that the iraqis be become too dependent on the united states and therefore our policy should focus on protect iraq 's border and hunt down al qaeda their solution be to scale back america 's effort in baghdad or announce the phase withdrawal of our combat force we carefully consider these proposal and we conclude that to step back now would force a collapse of the iraqi government tear the country apart and result in mass killing on an unimaginable scale such a scenario would result in our troop be force to stay in iraq even long and confront an enemy that be even more lethal if we increase our support at this crucial moment and help the iraqis break the current cycle of violence we can hasten the day our troop begin come home

 in the day ahead my national security team will fully brief congress on our new strategy if member have improvement that can be make we will make they if circumstance change we will adjust honorable people have different view and they will voice their criticism it be fair to hold our view up to scrutiny and all involve have a responsibility to explain how the path they propose would be more likely to succeed

 act on the good advice of senator joe lieberman and other key member of congress we will form a new bipartisan working group that will help we come together across party line to win the war on terror this group will meet regularly with i and my administration it will help strengthen our relationship with congress we can begin by work together to increase the size of the active army and marine corps so that america have the armed forces we need for the 21st century we also need to examine way to mobilize talented american civilian to deploy overseas where they can help build democratic institution in community and nation recover from war and tyranny

 in these dangerous time the united states be bless to have extraordinary and selfless man and woman willing to step forward and defend we these young americans understand that our cause in iraq be noble and necessary and that the advance of freedom be the calling of our time they serve far from their family who make the quiet sacrifice of lonely holiday and empty chair at the dinner table they have watch their comrade give their life to ensure our liberty we mourn the loss of every fall american and we owe it to they to build a future worthy of their sacrifice

 fellow citizen the year ahead will demand more patience sacrifice and resolve it can be tempting to think that america can put aside the burden of freedom yet time of testing reveal the character of a nation and throughout our history americans have always defy the pessimist and see our faith in freedom redeem now america be engage in a new struggle that will set the course for a new century we can and we will prevail

 we go forward with trust that the author of liberty will guide we through these try hour thank you and good night

thank you very much and tonight i have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own as the first president to begin the state of the union message with these word madam speaker

 in his day the late congressman thomas d'alesandro jr. from baltimore maryland see presidents roosevelt and truman at this rostrum but nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter nancy preside tonight as speaker of the house of representatives congratulation madam speaker

 two members of the house and senate be not with we tonight and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of senator tim johnson and congressman charlie norwood

 madam speaker vice president cheney member of congress distinguished guest and fellow citizen the rite of custom bring we together at a defining hour when decision be hard and courage be need we enter the year 2007 with large endeavor underway and other that be ours to begin in all of this much be ask of we we must have the will to face difficult challenge and determined enemy and the wisdom to face they together

 some in this chamber be new to the house and the senate and i congratulate the democrat majority congress have change but not our responsibility each of we be guide by our own conviction and to these we must stay faithful yet we be all hold to the same standard and call to serve the same good purpose to extend this nation 's prosperity to spend the people 's money wisely to solve problem not leave they to future generation to guard america against all evil and to keep faith with those we have send forth to defend we

 we be not the first to come here with a government divide and uncertainty in the air like many before we we can work through our difference and we can achieve big thing for the american people our citizen do not much care which side of the aisle we sit on as long as we be willing to cross that aisle when there be work to be do our job be to make life well for our fellow americans and to help they build a future of hope and opportunity and this be the business before we tonight

 a future of hope and opportunity begin with a grow economy and that be what we have we be now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth a recovery that have create 7.2 million new job so far unemployment be low inflation be low wage be rise this economy be on the move and our job be to keep it that way not with more government but with more enterprise

 next week i will deliver a full report on the state of our economy tonight i want to discuss three economic reform that deserve to be priority for this congress

 first we must balance the federal budget we can do so without raise taxis what we need be spend discipline in washington d.c. we set a goal of cut the deficit in half by 2009 and meet that goal three year ahead of schedule now let we take the next step in the come week i will submit a budget that eliminate the federal deficit within the next five year i ask you to make the same commitment together we can restrain the spending appetite of the federal government and we can balance the federal budget

 next there be the matter of earmark these special interest item be often slip into bill at the last hour when not even c span be watch in 2005 alone the number of earmark grow to over 13,000 and total nearly $ 18 billion even bad over 90 percent of the earmark never make it to the floor of the house and senate they be drop into committee report that be not even part of the bill that arrive on my desk you do not vote they into law i do not sign they into law yet they be treat as if they have the force of law the time have come to end this practice so let we work together to reform the budget process expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in congress and cut the number and cost of earmark at least in half by the end of this session

 and finally to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlement social security and medicare and medicaid be commitment of conscience and so it be our duty to keep they permanently sound yet we be fail in that duty and this failure will one day leave our child with three bad option huge tax increase huge deficit or huge and immediate cut in benefit everyone in this chamber know this to be true yet somehow we have not find it in ourselves to act so let we work together and do it now with enough good sense and good will you and i can fix medicare and medicaid and save social security

 spread opportunity and hope in america also require public school that give child the knowledge and character they need in life five year ago we rise above partisan difference to pass the no child leave behind act preserve local control raise standard and hold school accountable for result and because we act student be perform well in reading and math and minority student be close the achievement gap

 now the task be to build on the success without water down standard without take control from local community and without backslide and call it reform we can lift student achievement even high by give local leader flexibility to turn around fail school and by give family with child stick in fail school the right to choose someplace well we must increase fund for student who struggle and make sure these child get the special help they need and we can make sure our child be prepare for the job of the future and our country be more competitive by strengthen math and science skill the no child left behind act have work for america 's child and i ask congress to reauthorize this good law

 a future of hope and opportunity require that all our citizen have affordable and available health care when it come to health care government have an obligation to care for the elderly the disabled and poor child and we will meet those responsibility for all other americans private health insurance be the good way to meet their need

 but many americans can not afford a health insurance policy and so tonight i propose two new initiative to help more americans afford their own insurance first i propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependent family with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax or payroll taxis on $ 15,000 of their income single americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxis on $ 7,500 of their income with this reform more than 100 million man woman and child who be now cover by employer provide insurance will benefit from low tax bill at the same time this reform will level the play field for those who do not get health insurance through their job for americans who now purchase health insurance on their own this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings—$4,500 for a family of four make $ 60,000 a year and for the million of other americans who have no health insurance at all this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach change the tax code be a vital and necessary step to make health care affordable for more americans

 my second proposal be to help the state that be come up with innovative way to cover the uninsured state that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizen should receive federal fund to help they provide this coverage to the poor and the sick i have ask the secretary of health and human services to work with congress to take exist federal fund and use they to create affordable choices grant these grant would give our nation 's governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need

 there be many other way that congress can help we need to expand health saving account we need to help small business through association health plan we need to reduce cost and medical error with well information technology we will encourage price transparency and to protect good doctor from junk lawsuit we need to pass medical liability reform in all we do we must remember that the good health care decision be not make by government and insurance company but by patient and their doctor

 extend hope and opportunity in our country require an immigration system worthy of america with law that be fair and border that be secure when law and border be routinely violate this harm the interest of our country to secure our border we be double the size of the border patrol and fund new infrastructure and technology

 yet even with all these step we can not fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border and that require a temporary worker program we should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign worker to enter our country to work on a temporary basis as a result they will not have to try to sneak in and that will leave border agent free to chase down drug smuggler and criminal and terrorist we will enforce our immigration law at the worksite and give employer the tool to verify the legal status of their worker so there be no excuse leave for violate the law

 we need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcome and assimilate new arrival we need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrant who be already in our country without animosity and without amnesty conviction run deep in this capitol when it come to immigration let we have a serious civil and conclusive debate so that you can pass and i can sign comprehensive immigration reform into law

 extend hope and opportunity depend on a stable supply of energy that keep america 's economy run and america 's environment clean for too long our nation have be dependent on foreign oil and this dependence leave we more vulnerable to hostile regime and to terrorist who could cause huge disruption of oil shipment and raise the price of oil and do great harm to our economy

 it be in our vital interest to diversify america 's energy supply the way forward be through technology we must continue change the way america generate electric power by even great use of clean coal technology solar and wind energy and clean safe nuclear power we need to press on with battery research for plug in and hybrid vehicle and expand the use of clean diesel vehicle and biodiesel fuel we must continue invest in new method of produce ethanol use everything from wood chip to grass to agricultural waste

 we make a lot of progress thank to good policy here in washington and the strong response of the market and now even more dramatic advance be within reach tonight i ask congress to join i in pursue a great goal let we build on the work we have do and reduce gasoline usage in the united states by 20 percent in the next 10 year when we do that we will have cut our total import by the equivalent of three quarter of all the oil we now import from the middle east

 to reach this goal we must increase the supply of alternative fuel by set a mandatory fuel standard to require 35 billion gallon of renewable and alternative fuel in 2017 and that be nearly five time the current target at the same time we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standard for car the way we do for light truck and conserve up to eight and a half billion more gallon of gasoline by 2017

 achieve these ambitious goal will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil but it be not go to eliminate it and so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive way and to far protect america against severe disruption to our oil supply i ask congress to double the current capacity of the strategic petroleum reserve

 america be on the verge of technological breakthrough that will enable we to live our life less dependent on oil and these technology will help we be well steward of the environment and they will help we to confront the serious challenge of global climate change

 a future of hope and opportunity require a fair impartial system of justice the life of our citizen across our nation be affect by the outcome of case pende in our federal court we have a share obligation to ensure that the federal court have enough judge to hear those case and deliver timely ruling as president i have a duty to nominate qualified man and woman to vacancy on the federal bench and the united states senate have a duty as well to give those nominee a fair hearing and a prompt up or down vote on the senate floor

 for all of we in this room there be no high responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger five year have come and go since we see the scene and feel the sorrow that the terrorist can cause we have have time to take stock of our situation we have add many critical protection to guard the homeland we know with certainty that the horror of that september morning be just a glimpse of what the terrorist intend for we unless we stop they

 with the distance of time we find ourselves debate the cause of conflict and the course we have follow such debate be essential when a great democracy face great question yet one question have surely be settle that to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy

 from the start america and our ally have protect our people by stay on the offense the enemy know that the day of comfortable sanctuary easy movement steady financing and free flow communication be long over for the terrorist life since 9/11 have never be the same

 our success in this war be often measure by the thing that do not happen we can not know the full extent of the attack that we and our ally have prevent but here be some of what we do know we stop an al qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tall building on the west coast we break up a southeast asian terror cell groom operative for attack inside the united states we uncover an al qaeda cell develop anthrax to be use in attack against america and just last august british authority uncover a plot to blow up passenger plane bind for america over the atlantic ocean for each life save we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servant who devote their life to find the terrorist and stop they

 every success against the terrorist be a reminder of the shoreless ambition of this enemy the evil that inspire and rejoice in 9/11 be still at work in the world and so long as that be the case america be still a nation at war

 in the mind of the terrorist this war begin well before september 11 and will not end until their radical vision be fulfil and these past five year have give we a much clear view of the nature of this enemy al qaeda and its follower be sunni extremist possess by hatred and command by a harsh and narrow ideology take almost any principle of civilization and their goal be the opposite they preach with threat instruct with bullet and bomb and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent

 our enemy be quite explicit about their intention they want to overthrow moderate government and establish safe haven from which to plan and carry out new attack on our country by kill and terrorize americans they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty they would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology listen to this warning from the late terrorist zarqawi we will sacrifice our blood and body to put an end to your dream and what be come be even bad usama bin laden declare death be well than live on this earth with the unbeliever among we

 these man be not give to idle word and they be just one camp in the islamist radical movement in recent time it have also become clear that we face an escalating danger from shi'a extremist who be just as hostile to america and be also determined to dominate the middle east many be know to take direction from the regime in iran which be fund and arm terrorist like hezballah a group second only to al qaeda in the american life it have take

 the shi'a and sunni extremist be different face of the same totalitarian threat whatever slogan they chant when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purpose they want to kill americans kill democracy in the middle east and gain the weapon to kill on an even more horrific scale

 in the sixth year since our nation be attack i wish i could report to you that the danger have end they have not and so it remain the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence diplomacy law enforcement and military action to do our duty to find these enemy and to protect the american people

 this war be more than a clash of arm it be a decisive ideological struggle and the security of our nation be in the balance to prevail we must remove the condition that inspire blind hatred and drive 19 man to get onto airplane and to come and kill we what every terrorist fear most be human freedom society where man and woman make their own choice answer to their own conscience and live by their hope instead of their resentment free people be not draw to violent and malignant ideology and most will choose a well way when they be give a chance so we advance our own security interest by help moderate and reformer and brave voice for democracy the great question of our day be whether america will help man and woman in the middle east to build free society and share in the right of all humanity and i say for the sake of our own security we must

 in the last two year we have see the desire for liberty in the broad middle east and we have be sober by the enemy 's fierce reaction in 2005 the world watch as the citizen of lebanon raise the banner of the cedar revolution they drive out the syrian occupier and choose new leader in free election in 2005 the people of afghanistan defy the terrorist and elect a democratic legislature and in 2005 the iraqi people hold three national election choose a transitional government adopt the most progressive democratic constitution in the arab world and then elect a government under that constitution despite endless threat from the killer in their midst nearly 12 million iraqi citizen come out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget

 a thinking enemy watch all of these scene adjust their tactic and in 2006 they strike back in lebanon assassin take the life of pierre gemayel a prominent participant in the cedar revolution hizballah terrorist with support from syria and iran sow conflict in the region and be seek to undermine lebanon 's legitimately elect government in afghanistan taliban and al qaeda fighter try to regain power by regroup and engage afghan and nato force in iraq al qaeda and other sunni extremist blow up one of the most sacred place in shi'a islam the golden mosque of samarra this atrocity direct at a muslim house of prayer be design to provoke retaliation from iraqi shi'a and it succeed radical shi'a element some of whom receive support from iran form death squad the result be a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continue to this day

 this be not the fight we enter in iraq but it be the fight we be in every one of we wish this war be over and win yet it would not be like we to leave our promise unkept our friend abandon and our own security at risk lady and gentleman on this day at this hour it be still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle let we find our resolve and turn event toward victory

 we be carry out a new strategy in iraq a plan that demand more from iraq 's elect government and give our force in iraq the reinforcement they need to complete their mission our goal be a democratic iraq that uphold the rule of law respect the right of its people provide they security and be an ally in the war on terror

 in order to make progress toward this goal the iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital but the iraqis be not yet ready to do this on their own so we be deploy reinforcement of more than 20,000 additional soldier and marine to iraq the vast majority will go to baghdad where they will help iraqi force to clear and secure neighborhood and serve as adviser embed in iraqi army unit with iraqis in the lead our force will help secure the city by chase down the terrorist insurgent and the roam death squad and in anbar province where al qaeda terrorist have gather and local force have begin show a willingness to fight they we be send an additional 4,000 united states marine with order to find the terrorist and clear they out we do not drive al qaeda out of their safe haven in afghanistan only to let they set up a new safe haven in a free iraq

 the people of iraq want to live in peace and now it be time for their government to act iraq 's leader know that our commitment be not open ended they have promise to deploy more of their own troop to secure baghdad and they must do so they pledge that they will confront violent radical of any faction or political party and they need to follow through and lift needless restriction on iraqi and coalition force so these troop can achieve their mission of bring security to all of the people of baghdad iraq 's leader have commit themselves to a series of benchmark to achieve reconciliation to share oil revenue among all of iraq 's citizen to put the wealth of iraq into the rebuilding of iraq to allow more iraqis to reenter their nation 's civic life to hold local election and to take responsibility for security in every iraqi province but for all of this to happen baghdad must be secure and our plan will help the iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitment

 my fellow citizen our military commander and i have carefully weigh the option we discuss every possible approach in the end i choose this course of action because it provide the good chance for success many in this chamber understand that america must not fail in iraq because you understand that the consequence of failure would be grievous and far reaching

 if american force step back before baghdad be secure the iraqi government would be overrun by extremist on all side we could expect an epic battle between shi'a extremist back by iran and sunni extremist aid by al qaeda and supporter of the old regime a contagion of violence could spill out across the country and in time the entire region could be draw into the conflict

 for america this be a nightmare scenario for the enemy this be the objective chaos be the great ally their great ally in this struggle and out of chaos in iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe haven new recruit new resource and an even great determination to harm america to allow this to happen would be to ignore the lesson of september 11 and invite tragedy lady and gentleman nothing be more important at this moment in our history than for america to succeed in the middle east to succeed in iraq and to spare the american people from this danger

 this be where matter stand tonight in the here and now i have speak with many of you in person i respect you and the argument you have make we go into this largely united in our assumption and in our conviction and whatever you vote for you do not vote for failure our country be pursue a new strategy in iraq and i ask you to give it a chance to work and i ask you to support our troop in the field and those on their way

 the war on terror we fight today be a generational struggle that will continue long after you and i have turn our duty over to other and that be why it be important to work together so our nation can see this great effort through both party and both branch should work in close consultation it be why i have propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror make up of leader in congress from both political party we will share idea for how to position america to meet every challenge that confront we we will show our enemy abroad that we be unite in the goal of victory

 and one of the first step we can take together be to add to the rank of our military so that the american armed force be ready for all the challenge ahead tonight i ask the congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active army and marine corps by 92,000 in the next five year a second task we can take on together be to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corps such a corps would function much like our military reserve it would ease the burden on the armed force by allow we to hire civilian with critical skill to serve on mission abroad when america need they it would give people across america who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time

 americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we be not in this struggle alone we have a diplomatic strategy that be rally the world to join in the fight against extremism in iraq multinational force be operate under a mandate from the united nations we be work with jordan and saudi arabia and egypt and the gulf states to increase support for iraq 's government

 the united nations have impose sanction on iran and make it clear that the world will not allow the regime in tehran to acquire nuclear weapon with the other member of the quartet the u.n. the eu and russia we're pursue diplomacy to help bring peace to the holy land and pursue the establishment of a democratic palestinian state live side by side with israel in peace and security in afghanistan nato have take the lead in turn back the taliban and al qaeda offensive the first time the alliance have deploy force outside the north atlantic area together with our partner in china and japan russia and south korea we be pursue intensive diplomacy to achieve a korean peninsula free of nuclear weapon

 we will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in place like cuba belarus and burma and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of darfur

 american foreign policy be more than a matter of war and diplomacy our work in the world be also base on a timeless truth to whom much be give much be require we hear the call to take on the challenge of hunger and poverty and disease and that be precisely what america be do we must continue to fight hiv aids especially on the continent of africa because you fund the emergency plan for aids relief the number of people receive lifesave drug have grow from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short year i ask you to continue fund our effort to fight hiv aids and i ask you to provide $ 1.2 billion over five year so we can combat malaria in 15 african country

 i ask that you fund the millennium challenge account so that american aid reach the people who need it in nation where democracy be on the rise and corruption be in retreat and let we continue to support the expand trade and debt relief that be the good hope for lift life and eliminate poverty

 when america serve other in this way we show the strength and generosity of our country these deed reflect the character of our people the great strength we have be the heroic kindness and courage and self sacrifice of the american people you see this spirit often if you know where to look and tonight we need only look above to the gallery

 i go to a neighborhood that abut up against the border when i be here in may it be the place where a lot of people came charge across one or two agent would be try to do their job and stop a flood of folk charge into arizona and they could not do the job just physically impossible back at this site there be now infrastructure there be fencing and the amount of people try to cross the border at that spot be down significantly

 secure the border be a critical part of a strategy for comprehensive immigration reform it be an important part of a reform that be necessary so that the border patrol agent down here can do their job more effectively congress be go to take up the legislation on immigration it be a matter of national interest and it be a matter of deep conviction for i i have be work to bring republicans and democrats together to resolve outstanding issue so that congress can pass a comprehensive bill and i can sign it into law this year applause

 i hope by now the american people understand the need for comprehensive immigration reform be a clear need illegal immigration be a serious problem you know it well than anybody it put pressure on the public school and the hospital not only here in our border state but state around the country it drain the state and local budget i be talk to the governor about how it strain the budget incarceration of criminal who be here illegally strain the arizona budget but there be a lot of other way it strain the local and state budget it bring crime to our community

 it be a problem and we need to address it aggressively this problem have be grow for decade and past effort to address it have fail these failure help create a perception that america be not serious about enforce our immigration law and that they could be break without consequence past effort at reform do not do enough to secure our nation 's border as a result many people have be able to sneak into this country

 if you do not man your border and do not protect your border people be go to sneak in and that be what be be happen for a long time past effort at reform fail to address the underlie economic reason behind illegal immigration people will make great sacrifice to get into this country the find job and provide for their family

 when i be the governor of texas i use to say family value do not stop at the rio grande river people be come here to put food on the table and they be do job americans be not do and the farmer in this part of the world understand exactly what i be say but so do a lot of other folk around the country people be come to work and many of they have no lawful way to come to america and so they be sneak in

 past effort at reform also fail to provide sensible way for employer to verify the legal status of the worker they hire it be against the law to knowingly hire an illegal alien and as a result because they could not verify the legal status it be difficult for employer to comply it be difficult for the government to enforce the law at the work site and yet it be a necessary part of a comprehensive plan you see the lesson of all these experience the lesson of these experience be clear all element of the issue must be address together you can not address just one aspect and not be able to say to the american people that we be secure our border

 we need a comprehensive bill and that be what i be work with member of congress on a comprehensive immigration bill and now be the year to get it do the first element of course be to secure this border that be what i be down here for to remind the american people that we be spend their taxpayer their money taxpayer money on secure the border and we be make progress this border should be open to trade and lawful immigration and shut down to criminal and drug dealer and terrorist and coyote and smuggler people who prey on innocent life

 we more than double the funding for border security since i have be the president in other word it be one thing to hear people come down here and talk it be another thing for people to come down and do what they say they be go to do and i want to thank congress for work on this issue the funding be increase manpower the additional funding be increase infrastructure and it be increase technology

 when i land here at the airport the first thing i see be an unmanned aerial vehicle it be a sophisticated piece of equipment you can fly it from inside a truck and you can look at people move at night it be the most sophisticated technology we have and it be down here on the border to help the border patrol agent do their job we have expand the number of border patrol agent from about 9,000 to 13,000 and by the end of 2008 we be go to have a total of more than 18,000 agent

 i have the privilege of go to artesia new mexico to the training center it be a fantastic experience to see the young cadet get ready to come and wear the green of the border patrol by the time we be through we will have double the size of the border patrol in other word you can not do the job the american people expect unless you get enough manpower and we be increase the manpower down here

 this new technology be really important to basically leverage the manpower whether it be the technology of surveillance and communication we be go to make sure the agent have get what be necessary to be able to establish a common picture and get information out to the field as quickly as possible so that those 18,000 agent when they be finally on station can do the job the american people expect

 but manpower can not do it alone in other word there have to be some infrastructure along the border to be able to let these agent do their job and so i appreciate the fact that we have get double fencing all weather road new lighting mobile camera the american people have no earthly idea what be go on down here one of the reason i have come be to let you know let the taxpayer know the good folk down here be make progress

 we have work with our nation 's governor to deploy 6,000 national guard member to provide the border patrol with immediate reinforcement in other word it take time to train the border patrol and until they be fully train we have ask the guard to come down it be call operation jump start and the guard down here be serve nobly

 i have the chance to visit with some of the guard and mr. mayor you will be pleased to hear they like be down here in yuma arizona they like the people and they like the mission more than 600 member of the guard be serve here in the yuma sector and i thank the guard and equally importantly i thank their family for stand by the man and woman who wear the uniform during this particular mission you email they back home and tell they how much i appreciate the fact they be stand by you

 i appreciate very much the fact that illegal border crossing in this area be down in the month before operation jump start an average of more than 400 people a day be apprehend try to cross here the number have drop to few than 140 a day in other word one way that the border patrol can tell whether or not we be make progress be the number of apprehension when you be apprehend few people it mean few be try to come across and few be try to come across because we be deter people from attempt illegal border crossing in the first place

 i appreciate what colburn say he put it this way they be watch they see we watch they that be what he say and they have decide they just can not get across and that be part of the effort we be do we be say we be go to make it hard for you so do not try in the first place

 we be see similar result all across the southern border the number of people apprehend for illegally cross our southern border be down by nearly 30 percent this year we be make progress and thank for your hard work it be hard work but necessary work

 another important deterrent to illegal immigration be to end what be call catch and release i know how this discourage some of our border patrol agent i talk to they personally they work hard to find somebody sneak in the country they apprehend they the next thing they know they be back in society on our side of the border there be nothing more discouraging than have somebody risk their life or work hard and have the fruit of their labor undermine and that be what be happen with catch and release in other word we would catch people and we would say show up for your court date and they would not show up for their court date that should not surprise anybody but that be what be happen and the reason why that be happen be because we do not have enough bed to detain people

 now most of the people we apprehend down here be from mexico about 85 percent of the illegal immigrant catch cross into cross this border be mexicans cross the southern border be mexicans and they be send home within 24 hour it be the illegal immigrant from other country that be not that easy to send home

 for many year the government do not have enough space and so michael and i work with congress to increase the number of bed available so that excuse be eliminate the practice have be effectively end catch and release for every non mexican have be effectively end and i want to thank the border patrol and the leader of the border patrol for allow i to stand up and say that be the case

 the reason why be not only do we have bed we have expedite the legal process to cut the average deportation time now these be non mexican illegal alien that we have catch try to sneak into our country we be make it clear to foreign government that they must accept back their citizen who violate our immigration law i say we be go to effectively end catch and release and we have and i appreciate your hard work in do that

 the second element of a comprehensive immigration reform be a temporary worker program you can not fully secure the border until we take pressure off the border and that require a temporary worker program it seem to make sense to i that if you have get people come here to do job americans be not do we need to figure out a way that they can do so in a legal basis for a temporary period of time and that way our border patrol can chase the criminal and the drug runner potential terrorist and not have to try to chase people who be come here to do work americans be not do

 if you want to take the pressure off your border have a temporary worker program it will help not only reduce the number of people come across the border but it will do something about the inhumane treatment that these people be subject to there be a whole smuggling operation you know this well than i do there be a bunch of smuggler that use the individual as a piece of as a commodity and they make money off these poor people and they stuff they in the back of 18 wheeler and they find hovel for they to hide in and there be a whole industry that have spring up and it seem like to i that since this country respect human right and the human condition that it be a great contribution to eliminate this thuggery to free these people from this kind of extortion that they go through and one way to do so be to say you can come and work in our country for job americans be not do for a temporary period of time

 the third element of a comprehensive reform be to hold employer accountable for the worker they hire in other word if you want to make sure that we have get a system in which people be not violate the law then you have get to make sure we hold people to account like employer enforce immigration be a vital part of any successful reform and so chertoff and his department be crack down on employer who knowingly violate the law

 but not only be there coyote smuggle people in there be document forger that be make a living off these people so in other word people may want to comply with the law but it be very difficult at time to verify the legal status of their employee and so to make the work site enforcement practical on a large scale we have get to issue a tamper proof identification card for legal foreign worker

 we must create a well system for employer to verify the he legality of the worker in other word we get work to do and part of a comprehensive bill be to make sure work site enforcement be effective

 fourth we have get to resolve the status of million of illegal immigrant already here in the country people who enter our country illegally should not be give amnesty amnesty be the forgiveness of an offense without penalty i oppose amnesty and i think most people in the united states congress oppose amnesty people say why not have amnesty well the reason why be because 10 year from now you do not want to have a president have to address the next 11 million people who might be here illegally that be why you do not want amnesty and secondly we be a nation of law and we expect people to uphold the law

 so we be work closely with republicans and democrats to find a practical answer that lie between grant automatic citizenship to every illegal immigrant and deport every illegal immigrant

 it be impractical to take the position that oh we will just find the 11 million or 12 million people and send they home it be just an impractical position it be not go to work it may sound good it may make nice sound bite news it will not happen

 and therefore we need to work together to come up with a practical solution to this problem and i know people in congress be work hard on this issue illegal immigrant who have root in our country and want to stay should have to pay a meaningful penalty for break the law and pay their taxis and learn the english language and show work show that they have work in a job for a number of year people who meet a reasonable number of condition and pay a penalty of time and money should be able to apply for citizenship but approval would not be automatic and they would have to wait in line behind those who play by the rule and follow the law

 what i have describe be a way for those who have break the law to pay their debt to society and demonstrate the character that make a good citizen

 finally we have get to honor the tradition of the melting pot and help people assimilate into our society by learn our history our value and our language last june i create a new task force to look for way to help newcomer assimilate and succeed in our country many organization from church to business to civic association be work to answer this call and i be grateful for their service

 and so here be the outline for a comprehensive immigration reform bill it be an emotional issue as i be sure you can imagine people have get deep conviction and my hope be that we can have a serious and civil and conclusive debate and so we will continue to work with member of both political party i think the atmosphere up there be good right now i think people generally want to come together and put a good bill together one by the way that will make your job a lot easy

 it be important that we address this issue in good faith and it be important for people to listen to everybody 's position it be important for people not to give up no matter how hard it look from a legislative perspective it be important that we get a bill do we deserve a system that secure our border and honor our proud history as a nation of immigrant

 and so i can not think of a well place to come and to talk about the good work that be be do and the important work that need to be do in washington d.c. and that be right here in yuma arizona a place full of decent hardworking honorable people may god bless you all applause

madam speaker vice president cheney member of congress distinguished guest and fellow citizen

 seven year have pass since i first stand before you at this rostrum in that time our country have be test in way none of we could have imagine we face hard decision about peace and war rise competition in the world economy and the health and welfare of our citizen these issue call for vigorous debate and i think it be fair to say we have answer the call yet history will record that amid our difference we act with purpose and together we show the world the power and resilience of american self government

 all of we be send to washington to carry out the people 's business that be the purpose of this body it be the meaning of our oath it remain our charge to keep

 the action of the 110th congress will affect the security and prosperity of our nation long after this session have end in this election year let we show our fellow americans that we recognize our responsibility and be determined to meet they let we show they that republicans and democrats can compete for vote and cooperate for result at the same time

 from expand opportunity to protect our country we have make good progress yet we have unfinished business before we and the american people expect we to get it do

 in the work ahead we must be guide by the philosophy that make our nation great as americans we believe in the power of individual to determine their destiny and shape the course of history we believe that the most reliable guide for our country be the collective wisdom of ordinary citizen and so in all we do we must trust in the ability of free people to make wise decision and empower they to improve their life for their future

 to build a prosperous future we must trust people with their own money and empower they to grow our economy as we meet tonight our economy be undergo a period of uncertainty america have add job for a record 52 straight month but job be now grow at a slow pace wage be up but so be price for food and gas export be rise but the housing market have decline at kitchen table across our country there be a concern about our economic future

 in the long run americans can be confident about our economic growth but in the short run we can all see that that growth be slow so last week my administration reach agreement with speaker pelosi and republican leader boehner on a robust growth package that include tax relief for individual and family and incentive for business investment the temptation will be to load up the bill that would delay it or derail it and neither option be acceptable this be a good agreement that will keep our economy grow and our people work and this congress must pass it as soon as possible

 we have other work to do on taxis unless congress act most of the tax relief we have deliver over the past seven year will be take away some in washington argue that let tax relief expire be not a tax increase try explain that to 116 million american taxpayer who would see their taxis rise by an average of $ 1,800 other have say they would personally be happy to pay high taxis i welcome their enthusiasm i be pleased to report that the irs accept both check and money order

 most americans think their taxis be high enough with all the other pressure on their finance american family should not have to worry about their federal government take a big bite out of their paycheck there be only one way to eliminate this uncertainty make the tax relief permanent and member of congress should know if any bill raise taxis reach my desk i will veto it

 just as we trust americans with their own money we need to earn their trust by spend their tax dollar wisely next week i will send you a budget that terminate or substantially reduce 151 wasteful or bloated program total more than $ 18 billion the budget that i will submit will keep america on track for a surplus in 2012 american family have to balance their budget so should their government

 the people 's trust in their government be undermine by congressional earmark special interest project that be often sneak in at the last minute without discussion or debate last year i ask you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmark in half i also ask you to stop slip earmark into committee report that never even come to a vote unfortunately neither goal be meet so this time if you send i an appropriation bill that do not cut the number and cost of earmark in half i will send it back to you with my veto

 and tomorrow i will issue an executive order that direct federal agency to ignore any future earmark that be not vote on by congress if these item be truly worth funding congress should debate they in the open and hold a public vote

 our share responsibility extend beyond matter of taxis and spending on housing we must trust americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower they to weather turbulent time in the housing market my administration bring together the hope now alliance which be help many struggle homeowner avoid foreclosure and congress can help even more tonight i ask you to pass legislation to reform fannie mae and freddie mac modernize the federal housing administration and allow state housing agency to issue tax free bond to help homeowner refinance their mortgage these be difficult time for many american family and by take these step we can help more of they keep their home

 to build a future of quality health care we must trust patient and doctor to make medical decision and empower they with well information and well option we share a common goal make health care more affordable and accessible for all americans the good way to achieve that goal be by expand consumer choice not government control so i have propose end the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer this one reform would put private coverage within reach for million and i call on the congress to pass it this year

 the congress must also expand health saving account create association health plan for small business promote health information technology and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuit with all these step we will ensure that decision about your medical care be make in the privacy of your doctor 's office not in the hall of congress

 on education we must trust student to learn if give the chance and empower parent to demand result from our school in neighborhood across our country there be boy and girl with dream and a decent education be their only hope of achieve they

 six year ago we come together to pass the no child leave behind act and today no one can deny its result last year fourth and eighth grader achieve the high math score on record read score be on the rise african american and hispanic student post alltime high now we must work together to increase accountability add flexibility for state and district reduce the number of high school dropout provide extra help for struggle school

 members of congress the no child left behind act be a bipartisan achievement it be succeed and we owe it to america 's child their parent and their teacher to strengthen this good law

 we must also do more to help child when their school do not measure up thank to the dc opportunity scholarships you approve more than 2,600 of the poor child in our nation 's capital have find new hope at a faith base or other non public school sadly these school be disappear at an alarming rate in many of america 's inner city so i will convene a white house summit aim at strengthen these lifeline of learn and to open the door of these school to more child i ask you to support a new $ 300 million program call pell grants for kids we have see how pell grants help low income college student realize their full potential together we have expand the size and reach of these grant now let we apply the same spirit to help liberate poor child trap in fail public school

 on trade we must trust american worker to compete with anyone in the world and empower they by open up new market overseas today our economic growth increasingly depend on our ability to sell american good and crop and service all over the world so we be work to break down barrier to trade and investment wherever we can we be work for a successful doha round of trade talk and we must complete a good agreement this year at the same time we be pursue opportunity to open up new market by pass free trade agreement

 i thank the congress for approve a good agreement with peru and now i ask you to approve agreement with colombia and panama and south korea many product from these nation now enter america duty free yet many of our product face steep tariff in their market these agreement will level the playing field they will give we well access to nearly 100 million customer they will support good job for the fine worker in the world those whose product say make in the usa

 these agreement also promote america 's strategic interest the first agreement that will come before you be with colombia a friend of america that be confront violence and terror and fight drug trafficker if we fail to pass this agreement we will embolden the purveyor of false populism in our hemisphere so we must come together pass this agreement and show our neighbor in the region that democracy lead to a well life

 trade bring well job and well choice and well price yet for some americans trade can mean lose a job and the federal government have a responsibility to help i ask congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so we can help these displace worker learn new skill and find new job

 to build a future of energy security we must trust in the creative genius of american researcher and entrepreneur and empower they to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology our security our prosperity and our environment all require reduce our dependence on oil

 last year i ask you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade and you respond together we should take the next step let we fund new technology that can generate coal power while capture carbon emission let we increase the use of renewable power and emission free nuclear power let we continue invest in advanced battery technology and renewable fuel to power the car and truck of the future let we create a new international clean technology fund which will help develop nation like india and china make a great use of clean energy source and let we complete an international agreement that have the potential to slow stop and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gas

 this agreement will be effective only if it include commitment by every major economy and give none a free ride the united states be committed to strengthen our energy security and confront global climate change and the good way to meet these goal be for america to continue lead the way toward the development of clean and more energy efficient technology

 to keep america competitive into the future we must trust in the skill of our scientist and engineer and empower they to pursue the breakthrough of tomorrow last year congress pass legislation support the american competitiveness initiative but never follow through with the funding this funding be essential to keep our scientific edge so i ask congress to double federal support for critical basic research in the physical science and ensure america remain the most dynamic nation on earth

 on matter of life and science we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researcher and empower they to discover new treatment while respect moral boundary in november we witness a landmark achievement when scientist discover a way to reprogram adult skin cell to act like embryonic stem cell this breakthrough have the potential to move we beyond the divisive debate of the past by extend the frontier of medicine without the destruction of human life

 so we be expand funding for this type of ethical medical research and as we explore promising avenue of research we must also ensure that all life be treat with the dignity it deserve and so i call on congress to pass legislation that ban unethical practice such as the buying selling patenting or cloning of human life

 on matter of justice we must trust in the wisdom of our founders and empower judge who understand that the constitution mean what it say i have submit judicial nominee who will rule by the letter of the law not the whim of the gavel many of these nominee be be unfairly delay they be worthy of confirmation and the senate should give each of they a prompt up or down vote

 in community across our land we must trust in the good heart of the american people and empower they to serve their neighbor in need over the past seven year more of our fellow citizen have discover that the pursuit of happiness lead to the path of service americans have volunteer in record number charitable donation be high than ever faith base group be bring hope to pocket of despair with newfound support from the federal government and to help guarantee equal treatment of faith base organization when they compete for federal fund i ask you to permanently extend charitable choice

 tonight the army of compassion continue the march to a new day in the gulf coast america honor the strength and resilience of the people of this region we reaffirm our pledge to help they build strong and well than before and tonight i be pleased to announce that in april we will host this year 's north american summit of canada mexico and the united states in the great city of new orleans

 there be two other press challenge that i have raise repeatedly before this body and that this body have fail to address entitlement spending and immigration every member in this chamber know that spend on entitlement program like social security medicare and medicaid be grow fast than we can afford we all know the painful choice ahead if america stay on this path massive tax increase sudden and drastic cut in benefit or crippling deficit i have lay out proposal to reform these program now i ask member of congress to offer your proposal and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital program for our child and our grandchild

 the other press challenge be immigration america need to secure our border and with your help my administration be take step to do so we be increase worksite enforcement deploy fence and advanced technology to stop illegal crossing we have effectively end the policy of catch and release at the border and by the end of this year we will have double the number of border patrol agent yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign worker to come here and support our economy this will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean we harm

 we must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally illegal immigration be complicated but it can be resolve and it must be resolve in a way that uphold both our law and our high ideal

 this be the business of our nation here at home yet build a prosperous future for our citizen also depend on confront enemy abroad and advance liberty in troubled region of the world

 our foreign policy be base on a clear premise we trust that people when give the chance will choose a future of freedom and peace in the last seven year we have witness stir moment in the history of liberty we have see citizen in georgia and ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair election we have see people in lebanon take to the street to demand their independence we have see afghans emerge from the tyranny of the taliban and choose a new president and a new parliament we have see jubilant iraqis hold up ink stain finger and celebrate their freedom these image of liberty have inspire we

 in the past seven year we have also see the image that have sober we we have watch throng of mourner in lebanon and pakistan carry the casket of beloved leader take by the assassin 's hand we have see wedding guest in blood soak finery stagger from a hotel in jordan afghans and iraqis blow up in mosque and market and train in london and madrid rip apart by bomb on a clear september day we see thousand of our fellow citizen take from we in an instant these horrific image serve as a grim reminder the advance of liberty be oppose by terrorist and extremist evil man who despise freedom despise america and aim to subject million to their violent rule

 since 9/11 we have take the fight to these terrorist and extremist we will stay on the offense we will keep up the pressure and we will deliver justice to our enemy

 we be engage in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century the terrorist oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear yet in this war on terror there be one thing we and our enemy agree on in the long run man and woman who be free to determine their own destiny will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny and that be why the terrorist be fight to deny this choice to the people in lebanon iraq afghanistan pakistan and the palestinian territories and that be why for the security of america and the peace of the world we be spread the hope of freedom

 in afghanistan america our 25 nato ally and 15 partner nation be help the afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country thank to the courage of these military and civilian personnel a nation that be once a safe haven for al qaeda be now a young democracy where boy and girl be go to school new road and hospital be be build and people be look to the future with new hope these success must continue so we be add 3,200 marine to our force in afghanistan where they will fight the terrorist and train the afghan army and police defeat the taliban and al qaeda be critical to our security and i thank the congress for support america 's vital mission in afghanistan

 in iraq the terrorist and extremist be fight to deny a proud people their liberty and fight to establish safe haven for attack across the world one year ago our enemy be succeed in their effort to plunge iraq into chaos so we review our strategy and change course we launch a surge of american force into iraq we give our troop a new mission work with the iraqi force to protect the iraqi people pursue the enemy in its stronghold and deny the terrorist sanctuary anywhere in the country

 the iraqi people quickly realize that something dramatic have happen those who have worry that america be prepare to abandon they instead see ten of thousand of american force flow into their country they see our force move into neighborhood clear out the terrorist and stay behind to ensure the enemy do not return and they see our troop along with provincial reconstruction teams that include foreign service officer and other skilled public servant come in to ensure that improve security be follow by improvement in daily life our military and civilian in iraq be perform with courage and distinction and they have the gratitude of our whole nation

 the iraqis launch a surge of their own in the fall of 2006 sunni tribal leader grow tired of al qaeda 's brutality start a popular uprising call the anbar awakening over the past year similar movement have spread across the country and today the grassroots surge include more than 80,000 iraqi citizen who be fight the terrorist the government in baghdad have step forward as well add more than 100,000 new iraqi soldier and police during the past year

 while the enemy be still dangerous and more work remain the american and iraqi surge have achieve result few of we could have imagine just one year ago when we meet last year many say that contain the violence be impossible a year later high profile terrorist attack be down civilian death be down sectarian killing be down

 when we meet last year militia extremist some armed and train by iran be wreak havoc in large area of iraq a year later coalition and iraqi force have kill or capture hundred of militia fighter and iraqis of all background increasingly realize that defeat these militia fighter be critical to the future of their country

 when we meet last year al qaeda have sanctuary in many area of iraq and their leader have just offer american force safe passage out of the country today it be al qaeda that be search for safe passage they have be drive from many of the stronghold they once hold and over the past year we have capture or kill thousand of extremist in iraq include hundred of key al qaeda leader and operative

 last month osama bin laden release a tape in which he rail against iraqi tribal leader who have turn on al qaeda and admit that coalition force be grow strong in iraq lady and gentleman some may deny the surge be work but among the terrorist there be no doubt al qaeda be on the run in iraq and this enemy will be defeat

 when we meet last year our troop level in iraq be on the rise today because of the progress just describe we be implement a policy of return on success and the surge force we send to iraq be begin to come home

 this progress be a credit to the valor of our troop and the brilliance of their commander this evening i want to speak directly to our man and woman on the frontline soldier and sailor airmen marine and coast guardsman in the past year you have do everything we have ask of you and more our nation be grateful for your courage we be proud of your accomplishment and tonight in this hallowed chamber with the american people as our witness we make you a solemn pledge in the fight ahead you will have all you need to protect our nation and i ask congress to meet its responsibility to these brave man and woman by fully fund our troop

 our enemy in iraq have be hit hard they be not yet defeat and we can still expect tough fighting ahead our objective in the come year be to sustain and build on the gain we make in 2007 while transition to the next phase of our strategy american troop be shift from lead operation to partner with iraqi force and eventually to a protective overwatch mission as part of this transition one army brigade combat team and one marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replace in the come month four additional brigade and two marine battalion will follow suit take together this mean more than 20,000 of our troop be come home

 any further drawdown of u.s. troop will be base on condition in iraq and the recommendation of our commander general petraeus have warn that too fast a drawdown could result in quote the disintegration of the iraqi security force al qaeda iraq regain lose ground and a marked increase in violence member of congress having come so far and achieve so much we must not allow this to happen

 in the come year we will work with iraqi leader as they build on the progress they be make toward political reconciliation at the local level sunnis shi'a and kurds be begin to come together to reclaim their community and rebuild their life progress in the province must be match by progress in baghdad we be see some encouraging sign the national government be share oil revenue with the province the parliament recently pass both a pension law and de ba'athification reform they be now debate a provincial power law the iraqis still have a distance to travel but after decade of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence reconciliation be take place and the iraqi people be take control of their future

 the mission in iraq have be difficult and try for our nation but it be in the vital interest of the united states that we succeed a free iraq will deny al qaeda a safe haven a free iraq will show million across the middle east that a future of liberty be possible a free iraq will be a friend of america a partner in fight terror and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world

 by contrast a fail iraq would embolden the extremist strengthen iran and give terrorist a base from which to launch new attack on our friend our ally and our homeland the enemy have make its intention clear at a time when the momentum seem to favor they al qaeda 's top commander in iraq declare that they will not rest until they have attack we here in washington my fellow americans we will not rest either we will not rest until this enemy have be defeat we must do the difficult work today so that year from now people will look back and say that this generation rise to the moment prevail in a tough fight and leave behind a more hopeful region and a safe america

 we be also stand against the force of extremism in the holy land where we have new cause for hope palestinians have elect a president who recognize that confront terror be essential to achieve a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with israel israelis have leader who recognize that a peaceful democratic palestinian state will be a source of last security this month in ramallah and jerusalem i assure leader from both side that america will do and i will do everything we can to help they achieve a peace agreement that define a palestinian state by the end of this year the time have come for a holy land where a democratic israel and a democratic palestine live side by side in peace

 we be also stand against the force of extremism embody by the regime in tehran iran 's ruler oppress a good and talented people and wherever freedom advance in the middle east it seem the iranian regime be there to oppose it iran be fund and training militia group in iraq support hizballah terrorist in lebanon and back hamas effort to undermine peace in the holy land tehran be also develop ballistic missile of increase range and continue to develop its capability to enrich uranium which could be use to create a nuclear weapon

 our message to the people of iran be clear we have no quarrel with you we respect your tradition and your history we look forward to the day when you have your freedom our message to the leader of iran be also clear verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment so negotiation can begin and to rejoin the community of nation come clean about your nuclear intention and past action stop your oppression at home cease your support for terror abroad but above all know this america will confront those who threaten our troop we will stand by our ally and we will defend our vital interest in the persian gulf

 on the homefront we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country this be our most solemn duty we be grateful that there have not be another attack on our soil since 9/11 this be not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy in the past six year we have stop numerous attack include a plot to fly a plane into the tall building in los angeles and another to blow up passenger jet bind for america over the atlantic dedicated man and woman in our government toil day and night to stop the terrorist from carry out their plan these good citizen be save american life and everyone in this chamber owe they our thank

 and we owe they something more we owe they the tool they need to keep our people safe and one of the most important tool we can give they be the ability to monitor terrorist communication to protect america we need to know who the terrorist be talk to what they be say and what they be plan last year congress pass legislation to help we do that unfortunately congress set the legislation to expire on february 1 that mean if you do not act by friday our ability to track terrorist threat would be weaken and our citizen will be in great danger congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence be not disrupt congress must pass liability protection for company believe to have assist in the effort to defend america we have have ample time for debate the time to act be now

 protect our nation from the danger of a new century require more than good intelligence and a strong military it also require change the condition that breed resentment and allow extremist to prey on despair so america be use its influence to build a free more hopeful and more compassionate world this be a reflection of our national interest it be the calling of our conscience

 america oppose genocide in sudan we support freedom in country from cuba and zimbabwe to belarus and burma

 america be lead the fight against global poverty with strong education initiative and humanitarian assistance we have also change the way we deliver aid by launch the millennium challenge account this program strengthen democracy transparency and the rule of law in develop nation and i ask you to fully fund this important initiative

 america be lead the fight against global hunger today more than half the world 's food aid come from the united states and tonight i ask congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchase crop directly from farmer in the develop world so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine

 america be lead the fight against disease with your help we be work to cut by half the number of malaria relate death in 15 african nation and our emergency plan for aids relief be treat 1.4 million people we can bring healing and hope to many more so i ask you to maintain the principle that have change behavior and make this program a success and i call on you to double our initial commitment to fight hiv aids by approve an additional $ 30 billion over the next five year

 america be a force for hope in the world because we be a compassionate people and some of the most compassionate americans be those who have step forward to protect we we must keep faith with all who have risk life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace over the past seven year we have increase funding for veteran by more than 95 percent and as we increase funding we must also reform our veteran system to meet the need of a new war and a new generation i call on congress to enact the reform recommend by senator bob dole and secretary donna shalala so we can improve the system of care for our wound warrior and help they build life of hope and promise and dignity

 our military family also sacrifice for america they endure sleepless night and the daily struggle of provide for child while a love one be serve far from home we have a responsibility to provide for they so i ask you to join i in expand their access to child care create new hiring preference for military spouse across the federal government and allow our troop to transfer their unused education benefit to their spouse or child our military family serve our nation they inspire our nation and tonight our nation honor they

 the strength the secret of our strength the miracle of america be that our greatness lie not in our government but in the spirit and determination of our people when the federal convention meet in philadelphia in 1787 our nation be bind by the articles of confederation which begin with the word we the undersigned delegate when governor morris be ask to draft the preamble to our new constitution he offer an important revision and open with word that change the course of our nation and the history of the world we the people

 by trust the people our founder wager that a great and noble nation could be build on the liberty that reside in the heart of all man and woman by trust the people succeed generation transform our fragile young democracy into the most powerful nation on earth and a beacon of hope for million and so long as we continue to trust the people our nation will prosper our liberty will be secure and the state of our union will remain strong

thank you all deputy secretary england thank for the introduction one boss may not be here but the other one be laughter i appreciate your kind word i be pleased to be back here with the man and woman of the defense department
 on this day in 2003 the united states begin operation iraqi freedom as the campaign unfold ten and thousand of our troop pour across the iraqi border to liberate the iraqi people and remove a regime that threaten free nation
 five year into this battle there be an understandable debate over whether the war be worth fight whether the fight be worth win and whether we can win it the answer be clear to i remove saddam hussein from power be the right decision and this be a fight america can and must win
 the man and woman who cross into iraq 5 year ago remove a tyrant liberate a country and rescue million from unspeakable horror some of those troop be with we today and you need to know that the american people be proud of your accomplishment and so be the commander in chief
 i appreciate admiral mullen the joint chiefs who be here thank for come secretary donald winter of the navy deputy secretary of state john negroponte be with we admiral thad allen of the coast guard be with we ambassador from iraq be with we mr. ambassador we be proud to have you here soldier sailor marine airmen and coast man coast guard man thank for come thank for wear the uniform man and woman of the department of state be here as well
 operation iraqi freedom be a remarkable display of military effectiveness force from the uk australia poland and other ally join our troop in the initial operation as they advance our troop fight their way through sandstorm so intense that they blacken the daytime sky our troop engage in pitch battle with fedayeen saddam death squad act on the order of saddam hussein that obey neither the convention of war nor the dictate of conscience these death squad hide in school and they hide in hospital hope to draw fire against iraqi civilian they use woman and child as human shield they stop at nothing in their effort to prevent we from prevail but they could not stop the coalition advance
 aid by the most effective and precise air campaign in history coalition force race across 350 mile of enemy territory destroy republican guard division push through the karbala gap capture saddam international airport and liberate baghdad in less than 1 month
 along the way our troop add new chapter to the story of american military heroism during these first week of battle army sergeant first class paul ray smith and his troop come under a surprise attack by about a hundred republican guard force sergeant smith rally his man he lead a counterattack kill as many as 50 enemy soldier before be fatally wound his action save the life of more than a hundred american troop and earn he the medal of honor
 today in light of the challenge we have face in iraq some look back at this period as the easy part of the war yet there be nothing easy about it the liberation of iraq take incredible skill and amazing courage and the speed precision and brilliant execution of the campaign will be study by military historian for year to come
 what our troop find in iraq follow saddam 's removal be horrify they uncover child 's prison and torture chamber and rape room where iraqi woman be violate in front of their family they find video show regime thug mutilate iraqis deem disloyal to saddam and across the iraqi countryside they uncover mass grave of thousand execute by the regime
 because we act saddam hussein no long fill field with the remain of innocent man woman and child because we act saddam 's torture chamber and rape room and child 's prison have be close for good because we act saddam 's regime be no long invade its neighbor or attack they with chemical weapon and ballistic missile because we act saddam 's regime be no long pay the family of suicide bomber in the holy land because we act saddam 's regime be no long shoot at american and british aircraft patrol the no fly zone and defy the will of the united nations because we act the world be well and united states of america be safe
 when the iraqi regime be remove it do not lay down its arm and surrender instead former regime element take off their uniform and fade into the countryside to fight the emergence of a free iraq and then they be join by foreign terrorist who be seek to stop the advance of liberty in the middle east and seek to establish safe haven from which to plot new attack across the world
 the battle in iraq have be long and hard and more costly than we anticipate but it be a fight we must win so our troop have engage these enemy with courage and determination and as they have battle the terrorist and extremist in iraq they have help the iraqi people reclaim their nation and help a young democracy rise from the rubble of saddam hussein 's tyranny
 over the past 5 year we have see moment of triumph and moment of tragedy we have watch in admiration as 12 million iraqis defy the terrorist and go to the poll and choose their leader in free election we watch in horror as al qaida behead innocent captive and send suicide bomber to blow up mosque and market these action show the brutal nature of the enemy in iraq and they serve as a grim reminder the terrorist who murder the innocent in the street of baghdad want to murder the innocent in the street of america defeat this enemy in iraq will make it less likely that we will face the enemy here at home
 a little over a year ago the fight in iraq be falter extremist element be succeed in their effort to plunge iraq into chaos they have establish safe haven in many part of the country they be create division among the iraqis along sectarian line and their strategy of use violence in iraq to cause division in america be work as pressure build here in washington for withdrawal before the job be do
 my administration understand that america could not retreat in the face of terror and we know that if we do not act the violence that have be consume iraq would worsen and spread and could eventually reach genocidal level baghdad could have disintegrate into a contagion of killing and iraq could have descend into full blow sectarian warfare
 so we review the strategy and change course in iraq we send reinforcement into the country in a dramatic policy shift that be now know as the surge general david petraeus take command with a new mission work with iraqi force to protect the iraqi people pressure the enemy into stronghold and deny the terrorist sanctuary anywhere in the country and that be precisely what we have do
 in anbar sunni tribal leader have grow tired of al qaida 's brutality and start a popular uprising call the anbar awakening to take advantage of this opportunity we send 4,000 additional marine to help these brave iraqis drive al qaida from the province as this effort succeed it inspire other iraqis to take up the fight soon similar uprising begin to spread across the country today there be more than 90,000 concerned local citizen who be protect their community from the terrorist and insurgent and the extremist the government in baghdad have step forward with a surge of its own they have add more than 100,000 new iraqi soldier and police during the past year these iraqi troop have fight bravely and thousand have give their life in this struggle
 together these americans and iraqi force have drive the terrorist from many of the sanctuary they once hold now the terrorist have gather in and around the northern iraqi city of mosul and iraqi and american force be relentlessly pursue they there will be tough fighting in mosul and area of northern iraq in the week ahead but there be no doubt in my mind because of the courage of our troop and the bravery of the iraqis the al qaida terrorist in this region will suffer the same fate as al qaida suffer elsewhere in iraq
 as we have fight al qaida coalition and iraqi force have also take the fight to shi'a extremist group many of they back and finance and arm by iran a year ago these group be on the rise today they be increasingly isolate and iraqis of all faith be put their life on the line to stop these extremist from hijack their young democracy
 to ensure that military progress in iraq be quickly follow up with real improvement in daily life we have double the number of provincial reconstruction teams in iraq these team of civilian expert be serve all iraqi—18 iraqi provinces and they be help to strengthen responsible leader and build up local economy and bring iraqis together so that reconciliation can happen from the ground up they be very effective they be helping give ordinary iraqis confidence that by reject the extremist and reconcile with one another they can claim their place in a free iraq and build well life for their family
 there be still hard work to be do in iraq the gain we have make be fragile and reversible but on this anniversary the american people should know that since the surge begin the level of violence be significantly down civilian death be down sectarian killing be down attack on american force be down we have capture or kill thousand of extremist in iraq include hundred of key al qaida leader and operative our man and woman in uniform be perform with characteristic honor and valor the surge be work and as a return on our success in iraq we have begin bring some of our troop home
 the surge have do more than turn the situation in iraq around it have open the door to a major strategic victory in the broad war on terror for the terrorist iraq be suppose to be the place where al qaida rally arab masse to drive america out instead iraq have become the place where arabs join with americans to drive al qaida out in iraq we be witness the first large scale arab uprising against osama bin laden his grim ideology and his murderous network and the significance of this development can not be overstate
 the terrorist movement feed on a sense of inevitability and claim to rise on the tide of history the accomplishment of the surge in iraq be expose this myth and discredit the extremist when iraqi and american force finish the job the effect will reverberate far beyond iraq 's border usama bin laden once say when people see a strong horse and a weak horse by nature they will like the strong horse by defeat al qaida in iraq we will show the world that al qaida be the weak horse we will show that man and woman who love liberty can defeat the terrorist and we will show that the future of the middle east do not belong to terror the future of the middle east belong to freedom
 the challenge in this period ahead be to consolidate the gain we have make and seal the extremist defeat we have learn through hard experience what happen when we pull our force back too fast the terrorist and extremist step in they fill vacuum establish safe haven and use they to spread chaos and carnage general petraeus have warn that too fast a drawdown could result in such an unraveling with al qaida and insurgent and militia extremist regain lose ground and increase violence
 man and woman of the armed forces having come so far and achieve so much we be not go to let this to happen
 next month general petraeus and ambassador crocker will come to washington to testify before congress i will await their recommendation before make decision on our troop level in iraq any further drawdown will be base on condition on the ground and the recommendation of our commander and they must not jeopardize the hard fought gain our troop and civilian have make over the past year
 success we be see in iraq be undeniable yet some in washington still call for retreat war critic can no long credibly argue that we be lose in iraq so they now argue the war cost too much in recent month we have hear exaggerated amount of the cost of this war no one be would argue that this war have not come at a high cost in life and treasure but those cost be necessary when we consider the cost of a strategic victory for our enemy in iraq
 if we be to allow our enemy to prevail in iraq the violence that be now decline would accelerate and iraq would descend into chaos al qaida would regain its lost sanctuary and establish new one foment violence and terror that could spread beyond iraq 's border with serious consequence for the world 's economy
 out of such chaos in iraq the terrorist movement could emerge emboldened with new recruit new resource and an even great determination to dominate the region and harm america an emboldened al qaida with access to iraq 's oil resource could pursue its ambition to acquire weapon of mass destruction to attack america and other free nation iran would be embolden as well with a renew determination to develop nuclear weapon and impose its brand of hegemony across the middle east our enemy would see an america an american failure in iraq as evidence of weakness and a lack of resolve
 to allow this to happen would be to ignore the lesson of september the 11th and make it more likely that america would suffer another attack like the one we experience that day a day in which 19 armed man with box cutter kill nearly 3,000 people in our on our soil a day after which in the following of that attack more than a million americans lose work lose their job the terrorist intend even great harm to our country and we have no great responsibility than to defeat our enemy across the world so that they can not carry out such an attack
 as our coalition fight the enemy in iraq we have stay on the offensive on other front in the war on terror you know just a few week after commence operation iraqi freedom u.s. force capture khalid sheikh mohammed the mastermind behind the september the 11th terrorist attack we get he in pakistan about the same time as we launch operation iraqi freedom coalition force thousand of hundred of mile away launch an assault on the terrorist in the mountain of southern afghanistan in an operation call operation valiant strike
 throughout the war on terror we have bring the enemy we have fight the enemy on every single battlefront and so long as terrorist danger remain the united states of america will continue to fight the enemy wherever it make its stand
 we will stay on the offense but in the long run defeat the terrorist require an alternative to their murderous ideology and there we have another advantage we have get a singular advantage with our military when it come to find the terrorist and bring they to justice and we have another advantage in our strong belief in the transformative power of liberty
 so we be help the people of iraq establish a democracy in the heart of the middle east a free iraq will fight terrorist instead of harbor they a free iraq will be an example for other of the power of liberty to change the society and to displace despair with hope by spread the hope of liberty in the middle east we will help free society take root and when they do freedom will yield the peace that we all desire
 our troop on the frontline understand what be at stake they know that the mission in iraq have be difficult and have be try for our nation because they be the one who have carry most of the burden they be all volunteer who have step forward to defend america in a time of danger some of they have go out of their way to return to the fight
 one of these brave americans be a marine gunnery sergeant name william spanky gibson in may of 2006 in ramadi a terrorist sniper 's bullet rip through his left knee doctor then amputate his leg after month of difficult rehabilitation spanky be not only walk he be train for triathlon
 last year at the escape from alcatraz swim near san francisco he meet marine general james mattis who ask if there be anything he could do for he spanky have just one request he ask to redeploy to iraq today he be serve in fallujah the first full leg amputee to return to the frontline here be what he say about his decision to return the iraqis where be where we be 232 year ago as a nation now they be start a new nation and that be one of my big reason for come back here i want to tell the people of this country that i be back to help wherever i can
 when americans like spanky gibson serve on our side the enemy in iraq do not get a chance we be grateful to all the brave man and woman of our military who have serve the cause of freedom you have do the hard work far from home and far from your loved one we give thank for all our military family who love you and have support you in this mission
 we appreciate the fine civilian from many department who serve alongside you many of you serve in iraq and afghanistan and some have be on these front several time you will never forget the people who fight at your side you will always remember the comrade who serve with you in combat but do not make the journey home america remember they as well more than 4,400 man and woman have give their life in the war on terror we will pray for their family we will always honor their memory
 the good way we can honor they be by make sure that their sacrifice be not in vain five year ago tonight i promise the american people that in the struggle ahead we will accept no outcome but victory today stand before man and woman who help liberate a nation i reaffirm the commitment the battle in iraq be noble it be necessary and it be just and with your courage the battle in iraq will end in victory god bless

to chairman dean and my great friend dick durbin and to all my fellow citizen of this great nation

 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states

 let i express my thank to the historic slate of candidate who accompany i on this journey and especially the one who travel the farthest&mdash;a champion for work americans and an inspiration to my daughter and to yours&mdash;hillary rodham clinton to president clinton who last night make the case for change as only he can make it to ted kennedy who embody the spirit of service and to the next vice president of the united states joe biden i thank you i be grateful to finish this journey with one of the fine statesman of our time a man at ease with everyone from world leader to the conductor on the amtrak train he still take home every night

 to the love of my life our next first lady michelle obama and to sasha and malia&mdash;i love you so much and i&#39;m so proud of all of you

 four year ago i stand before you and tell you my story&mdash;of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who weren&#39;t well off or well know but share a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to

 it be that promise that have always set this country apart&mdash;that through hard work and sacrifice each of we can pursue our individual dream but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dream as well

 that&#39;s why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two year at each moment when that promise be in jeopardy ordinary man and women&mdash;student and soldier farmer and teacher nurse and janitors&mdash;found the courage to keep it alive

 we meet at one of those define moments&mdash;a moment when our nation be at war our economy be in turmoil and the american promise have be threaten once more

 tonight more americans be out of work and more be work hard for less more of you have lose your home and even more be watch your home value plummet more of you have car you can&#39;t afford to drive credit card bill you can&#39;t afford to pay and tuition that&#39;s beyond your reach

 these challenge be not all of government&#39; make but the failure to respond be a direct result of a broken politic in washington and the fail policy of george w. bush

 america we be well than these last eight year we be a well country than this

 this country be more decent than one where a woman in ohio on the brink of retirement find herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work

 this country be more generous than one where a man in indiana have to pack up the equipment he&#39;s work on for twenty year and watch it ship off to china and then choke up as he explain how he feel like a failure when he go home to tell his family the news

 we be more compassionate than a government that let veteran sleep on our street and family slide into poverty that sit on its hand while a major american city drown before our eye

 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independent across this great land&mdash;enough this moment&mdash;this election&mdash;is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that bring you two term of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we be here because we love this country too much to let the next four year look like the last eight on november 4th we must stand up and say eight be enough

 now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain have wear the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe he our gratitude and respect and next week we&#39;ll also hear about those occasion when he&#39;s break with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need

 but the record&#39; clear john mccain have vote with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain like to talk about judgment but really what do it say about your judgment when you think george bush have be right more than ninety percent of the time i don&#39;t know about you but i&#39;m not ready to take a ten percent chance on change

 the truth be on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives&mdash;on health care and education and the economy&mdash;senator mccain have be anything but independent he say that our economy have make great progress under this president he say that the fundamental of the economy be strong and when one of his chief advisors&mdash;the man who write his economic plan&mdash;wa talk about the anxiety americans be feel he say that we be just suffer from a mental recession and that we&#39;ve become and i quote a nation of whiner a nation of whiner tell that to the proud auto worker at a michigan plant who after they find out it be close keep show up every day and work as hard as ever because they know there be people who count on the brake that they make tell that to the military family who shoulder their burden silently as they watch their love one leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty these be not whiner they work hard and give back and keep go without complaint these be the americans that i know

 now i don&#39;t believe that senator mccain doesn&#39;t care what&#39; go on in the life of americans i just think he doesn&#39;t know why else would he define middle class as someone make under five million dollar a year how else could he propose hundred of billion in tax break for big corporation and oil company but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people&#39; benefit or an education plan that would do nothing to help family pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement

 it&#39;s not because john mccain doesn&#39;t care it&#39;s because john mccain doesn&#39;t get it

 for over two decade he&#39;s subscribe to that old discredit republican philosophy&mdash;give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickle down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really mean is&mdash;you&#39;re on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it bear into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps&mdash;even if you don&#39;t have boot you&#39;re on your own

 well it&#39;s time for they to own their failure it&#39;s time for we to change america

 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitute progress in this country

 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pay the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma we measure progress in the 23 million new job that be create when bill clinton be president&mdash;when the average american family see its income go up $ 7,500 instead of down $ 2,000 like it have under george bush

 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaire we have or the profit of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who live on tip can take a day off to look after a sick kid without lose her job&mdash;an economy that honor the dignity of work

 the fundamental we use to measure economic strength be whether we be live up to that fundamental promise that have make this country great&mdash;a promise that be the only reason i be stand here tonight

 because in the face of those young veteran who come back from iraq and afghanistan i see my grandfather who sign up after pearl harbor march in patton&#39;s army and be reward by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill

 in the face of that young student who sleep just three hour before work the night shift i think about my mom who raise my sister and i on her own while she work and earn her degree who once turn to food stamp but be still able to send we to the good school in the country with the help of student loan and scholarship

 when i listen to another worker tell i that his factory have shut down i remember all those man and woman on the south side of chicago who i stand by and fight for two decade ago after the local steel plant close

 and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulty of start her own business i think about my grandmother who work her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management despite year of be pass over for promotion because she be a woman she&#39;s the one who teach i about hard work she&#39;s the one who put off buy a new car or a new dress for herself so that i could have a well life she pour everything she have into i and although she can no long travel i know that she&#39;s watch tonight and that tonight be her night as well

 i don&#39;t know what kind of life john mccain think that celebrity lead but this have be mine these be my hero theirs be the story that shape i and it be on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states

 what be that promise

 it&#39;s a promise that say each of we have the freedom to make of our own life what we will but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect

 it&#39;s a promise that say the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that business should live up to their responsibility to create american job look out for american worker and play by the rule of the road

 ours be a promise that say government can not solve all our problem but what it should do be that which we can not do for ourselves&mdash;protect we from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toy safe invest in new school and new road and new science and technology

 our government should work for we not against we it should help we not hurt we it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american who&#39;s willing to work

 that&#39;s the promise of america&mdash;the idea that we be responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i be my brother&#39;s keeper i be my sister&#39;s keeper

 that&#39;s the promise we need to keep that&#39;s the change we need right now so let i spell out exactly what that change would mean if i be president

 change mean a tax code that doesn&#39;t reward the lobbyist who write it but the american worker and small business who deserve it

 unlike john mccain i will stop give tax break to corporation that ship job overseas and i will start give they to company that create good job right here in america

 i will eliminate capital gain taxis for the small business and the start up that will create the high wage high tech job of tomorrow

 i will cut taxes&mdash;cut taxes&mdash;for 95 percent of all work family because in an economy like this the last thing we should do be raise taxis on the middle class

 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten year we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east

 washington&#39;s been talk about our oil addiction for the last thirty year and john mccain have be there for twenty six of they in that time he&#39;s say no to high fuel efficiency standard for car no to investment in renewable energy no to renewable fuel and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain take office

 now be the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling be a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close

 as president i will tap our natural gas reserve invest in clean coal technology and find way to safely harness nuclear power i&#39;ll help our auto company re tool so that the fuel efficient car of the future be build right here in america i&#39;ll make it easy for the american people to afford these new car and i&#39;ll invest 150 billion dollar over the next decade in affordable renewable source of energy&mdash;wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuel an investment that will lead to new industry and five million new job that pay well and can&#39;t ever be outsource

 america now be not the time for small plan

 now be the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy michelle and i be only here tonight because we be give a chance at an education and i will not settle for an america where some kid don&#39;t have that chance i&#39;ll invest in early childhood education i&#39;ll recruit an army of new teacher and pay they high salary and give they more support and in exchange i&#39;ll ask for high standard and more accountability and we will keep our promise to every young american if you commit to serve your community or your country we will make sure you can afford a college education

 now be the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible health care for every single american if you have health care my plan will lower your premium if you don&#39;t you&#39;ll be able to get the same kind of coverage that member of congress give themselves and as someone who watch my mother argue with insurance company while she lie in bed die of cancer i will make certain those company stop discriminate against those who be sick and need care the most

 now be the time to help family with pay sick day and well family leave because nobody in america should have to choose between keep their job and care for a sick child or ail parent

 now be the time to change our bankruptcy law so that your pension be protect ahead of ceo bonus and the time to protect social security for future generation

 and now be the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day&#39;s work because i want my daughter to have exactly the same opportunity as your son

 now many of these plan will cost money which be why i&#39;ve lay out how i&#39;ll pay for every dime&mdash;by close corporate loophole and tax haven that don&#39;t help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminate program that no long work and make the one we do need work well and cost less&mdash;because we can not meet twenty first century challenge with a twentieth century bureaucracy

 and democrats we must also admit that fulfil america&#39;s promise will require more than just money it will require a renew sense of responsibility from each of we to recover what john f. kennedy call our intellectual and moral strength yes government must lead on energy independence but each of we must do our part to make our home and business more efficient yes we must provide more ladder to success for young man who fall into life of crime and despair but we must also admit that program alone can&#39;t replace parent that government can&#39;t turn off the television and make a child do her homework that father must take more responsibility for provide the love and guidance their child need

 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility&mdash;that&#39;s the essence of america&#39;s promise

 and just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home so must we keep america&#39;s promise abroad if john mccain want to have a debate about who have the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief that&#39;s a debate i&#39;m ready to have

 for while senator mccain be turn his sight to iraq just day after 9/11 i stand up and oppose this war know that it would distract we from the real threat we face when john mccain say we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argue for more resource and more troop to finish the fight against the terrorist who actually attack we on 9/11 and make clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenant if we have they in our sight john mccain like to say that he&#39;ll follow bin laden to the gates of hell&mdash;but he won&#39;t even go to the cave where he live

 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troop from iraq have be echo by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learn that iraq have a $ 79 billion surplus while we&#39;re wallow in deficit john mccain stand alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war

 that&#39; not the judgment we need that won&#39;t keep america safe we need a president who can face the threat of the future not keep grasp at the idea of the past

 you don&#39;t defeat a terrorist network that operate in eighty country by occupy iraq you don&#39;t protect israel and deter iran just by talk tough in washington you can&#39;t truly stand up for georgia when you&#39;ve strain our old alliance if john mccain want to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that be his choice&mdash;but it be not the change we need

 we be the party of roosevelt we be the party of kennedy so don&#39;t tell i that democrats won&#39;t defend this country don&#39;t tell i that democrats won&#39;t keep we safe the bush mccain foreign policy have squander the legacy that generation of americans&mdash;democrats and republicans&mdash;have build and we be here to restore that legacy

 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troop into harm&#39;s way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give they the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefit they deserve when they come home

 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflict but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtain nuclear weapon and curb russian aggression i will build new partnership to defeat the threat of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america be once again that last good hope for all who be call to the cause of freedom who long for life of peace and who yearn for a well future

 these be the policy i will pursue and in the week ahead i look forward to debate they with john mccain

 but what i will not do be suggest that the senator take his position for political purpose because one of the thing that we have to change in our politic be the idea that people can not disagree without challenge each other&#39;s character and patriotism

 the time be too serious the stake be too high for this same partisan playbook so let we agree that patriotism have no party i love this country and so do you and so do john mccain the man and woman who serve in our battlefield may be democrats and republicans and independent but they have fight together and bleed together and some die together under the same proud flag they have not serve a red america or a blue america&mdash;they have serve the united states of america

 so i&#39;ve get news for you john mccain we all put our country first

 america our work will not be easy the challenge we face require tough choice and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the wear out idea and politic of the past for part of what have be lose these past eight year can&#39;t just be measure by lose wage or big trade deficit what have also be lose be our sense of common purpose&mdash;our sense of high purpose and that&#39; what we have to restore

 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reduce the number of unwanted pregnancy in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunter in rural ohio than for those plague by gang violence in cleveland but don&#39;t tell i we can&#39;t uphold the second amendment while keep ak-47s out of the hand of criminal i know there be difference on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brother and sister deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live life free of discrimination passion fly on immigration but i don&#39;t know anyone who benefit when a mother be separate from her infant child or an employer undercut american wage by hire illegal worker this too be part of america&#39;s promise&mdash;the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divide and unite in common effort

 i know there be those who dismiss such belief as happy talk they claim that our insistence on something large something firm and more honest in our public life be just a trojan horse for high taxis and the abandonment of traditional value and that&#39;s to be expect because if you don&#39;t have any fresh idea then you use stale tactic to scare the voter if you don&#39;t have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from

 you make a big election about small thing

 and you know what&mdash;it&#39;s work before because it feed into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesn&#39;t work all its promise seem empty if your hope have be dash again and again then it&#39;s well to stop hope and settle for what you already know

 i get it i realize that i be not the likeli candidate for this office i don&#39;t fit the typical pedigree and i haven&#39;t spend my career in the hall of washington

 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something be stir what the nay sayer don&#39;t understand be that this election have never be about i it&#39;s be about you

 for eighteen long month you have stand up one by one and say enough to the politic of the past you understand that in this election the great risk we can take be to try the same old politic with the same old player and expect a different result you have show what history teach us&mdash;that at define moment like this one the change we need doesn&#39;t come from washington change come to washington change happen because the american people demand it&mdash;because they rise up and insist on new idea and new leadership a new politic for a new time

 america this be one of those moment

 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need be come because i&#39;ve see it because i&#39;ve live it i&#39;ve see it in illinois when we provide health care to more child and move more family from welfare to work i&#39;ve see it in washington when we work across party line to open up government and hold lobbyist more accountable to give well care for our veteran and keep nuclear weapon out of terrorist hand

 and i&#39;ve see it in this campaign in the young people who vote for the first time and in those who get involve again after a very long time in the republicans who never think they&#39;d pick up a democratic ballot but do i&#39;ve see it in the worker who would rather cut their hour back a day than see their friend lose their job in the soldier who re enlist after lose a limb in the good neighbor who take a stranger in when a hurricane strike and the floodwater rise

 this country of our have more wealth than any nation but that&#39;s not what make we rich we have the most powerful military on earth but that&#39;s not what make we strong our university and our culture be the envy of the world but that&#39;s not what keep the world come to our shore

 instead it be that american spirit&mdash;that american promise&mdash;that push we forward even when the path be uncertain that bind we together in spite of our difference that make we fix our eye not on what be see but what be unseen that well place around the bend

 that promise be our great inheritance it&#39;s a promise i make to my daughter when i tuck they in at night and a promise that you make to yours&mdash;a promise that have lead immigrant to cross ocean and pioneer to travel west a promise that lead worker to picket line and woman to reach for the ballot

 and it be that promise that forty five year ago today bring americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincoln&#39;s memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream

 the man and woman who gather there could&#39;ve hear many thing they could&#39;ve hear word of anger and discord they could&#39;ve be tell to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dream defer

 but what the people hear instead&mdash;people of every creed and color from every walk of life&mdash;is that in america our destiny be inextricably link that together our dream can be one

 we can not walk alone the preacher cry and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we can not turn back

 america we can not turn back not with so much work to be do not with so many child to educate and so many veteran to care for not with an economy to fix and city to rebuild and farm to save not with so many family to protect and so many life to mend america we can not turn back we can not walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let we keep that promise that american promise and in the word of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess

 thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america
a short time ago the house of representatives pass a bill that be essential to help america 's economy weather the financial crisis the senate pass the same legislation on wednesday night and when congress send i the final bill i be go to sign it into law

 there be moment this week when some think the federal government could not rise to the challenge but thank to the hard work of member of both party in both houses and a spirit of cooperation between capitol hill and my administration we complete this bill in a timely manner i be especially grateful for the contribution of speaker nancy pelosi minority leader john boehner majority leader steny hoyer minority whip roy blunt chairman barney frank ranking member spencer bachus

 by come together on this legislation we have act boldly to help prevent the crisis on wall street from become a crisis in community across our country we have show the world that the united states of america will stabilize our financial market and maintain a lead role in the global economy

 a major problem in our financial system be that bank have restrict the flow of credit to business and consumer many of the asset these bank be hold have lose value the legislation congress pass today address this problem head on by provide a variety of new tool to the government such as allow we to purchase some of the troubled asset and create a new government insurance program that will guarantee the value of other the bill also ensure that these new program be carry out in a way that protect taxpayer it prevent fail executive from receive windfall from taxpayer dollar it establish a bipartisan board to oversee the plan 's implementation

 take together these step represent decisive action to ease the credit crunch that be now threaten our economy with a smoother flow of credit more business will be able to stock their shelf and meet their payroll more family will be able to get loan for car and home and college education more state and local government will be able to fund basic service

 the bill include other provision to help american consumer and business it include tax incentive for business to invest and create job it temporarily expand federal insurance for bank and credit union deposit from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 a vital safeguard for consumer and small business it provide family with relief from the alternative minimum tax which would otherwise increase taxis for 26 million taxpayer by an average of $ 2,200

 i know some americans have concern about this legislation especially about the government 's role and the bill 's cost as a strong supporter of free enterprise i believe government intervention should occur only when necessary in this situation action be clearly necessary and ultimately the cost ultimately the cost to taxpayer will be far less than the initial outlay see the government will purchase troubled asset and once the market recover it be likely that many of the asset will go up in value and over time americans should expect that much if not all of the tax dollar we invest will be pay back

 americans should also expect that it will take some time for this legislation to have its full impact on our economy exercise the authority in this bill in a responsible way will require a careful analysis and deliberation this will be do as expeditiously as possible but it can not be accomplish overnight we will take the time necessary to design an effective program that achieve its objective and do not waste taxpayer dollar

 our economy continue to face serious challenge this morning we learn that america lose job again in september disappointing news that underscore the urgency of the bill that congress pass today it will take more time and determined effort to get through this difficult period but with confidence and leadership and bipartisan cooperation we will overcome the challenge we face return our nation to a path of growth and job creation and long term economic prosperity thank you

if there be anyone out there who still doubt that america be a place where all thing be possible who still wonder if the dream of our founder be alive in our time who still question the power of our democracy tonight be your answer

 it&#39;s the answer tell by line that stretch around school and church in number this nation have never see by people who wait three hour and four hour many for the very first time in their life because they believe that this time must be different that their voice could be that difference

 it&#39;s the answer speak by young and old rich and poor democrat and republican black white latino asian native american gay straight disabled and not disabled&mdash;american who send a message to the world that we have never be a collection of red states and blue states we be and always will be the united states of america

 it&#39;s the answer that lead those who have be tell for so long by so many to be cynical and fearful and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hand on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a well day

 it&#39;s be a long time come but tonight because of what we do on this day in this election at this defining moment change have come to america

 i just receive a very gracious call from senator mccain he fight long and hard in this campaign and he&#39;s fight even long and hard for the country he love he have endure sacrifice for america that most of we can not begin to imagine and we be well off for the service render by this brave and selfless leader i congratulate he and governor palin for all they have achieve and i look forward to work with they to renew this nation&#39; promise in the month ahead

 i want to thank my partner in this journey a man who campaign from his heart and speak for the man and woman he grow up with on the street of scranton and ride with on that train home to delaware the vice president elect of the united states joe biden

 i would not be stand here tonight without the unyielding support of my good friend for the last sixteen year the rock of our family and the love of my life our nation&#39; next first lady michelle obama sasha and malia i love you both so much and you have earn the new puppy that&#39;s come with we to the white house and while she&#39;s no long with we i know my grandmother be watch along with the family that make i who i be i miss they tonight and know that my debt to they be beyond measure

 to my campaign manager david plouffe my chief strategist david axelrod and the good campaign team ever assemble in the history of politics&mdash;you make this happen and i be forever grateful for what you&#39;ve sacrifice to get it do

 but above all i will never forget who this victory truly belong to&mdash;it belong to you
 i be never the likeli candidate for this office we didn&#39;t start with much money or many endorsement our campaign be not hatch in the hall of washington&mdash;it begin in the backyard of des moines and the live room of concord and the front porch of charleston

 it be build by work man and woman who dig into what little saving they have to give five dollar and ten dollar and twenty dollar to this cause it grow strength from the young people who reject the myth of their generation&#39; apathy who leave their home and their family for job that offer little pay and less sleep from the not so young people who brave the bitter cold and scorch heat to knock on the door of perfect stranger from the million of americans who volunteer and organize and prove that more than two century later a government of the people by the people and for the people have not perish from this earth this be your victory

 i know you didn&#39;t do this just to win an election and i know you didn&#39;t do it for i you do it because you understand the enormity of the task that lie ahead for even as we celebrate tonight we know the challenge that tomorrow will bring be the great of our lifetime&mdash;two war a planet in peril the bad financial crisis in a century even as we stand here tonight we know there be brave americans wake up in the desert of iraq and the mountain of afghanistan to risk their life for we there be mother and father who will lie awake after their child fall asleep and wonder how they&#39;ll make the mortgage or pay their doctor&#39;s bill or save enough for college there be new energy to harness and new job to be create new school to build and threat to meet and alliance to repair
 the road ahead will be long our climb will be steep we may not get there in one year or even one term but america&mdash;i have never be more hopeful than i be tonight that we will get there i promise you&mdash;we as a people will get there

 there will be setback and false start there be many who won&#39;t agree with every decision or policy i make as president and we know that government can&#39;t solve every problem but i will always be honest with you about the challenge we face i will listen to you especially when we disagree and above all i will ask you join in the work of remake this nation the only way it&#39;s be do in america for two hundred and twenty one years&mdash;block by block brick by brick calloused hand by calloused hand

 what begin twenty one month ago in the depth of winter must not end on this autumn night this victory alone be not the change we seek&mdash;it be only the chance for we to make that change and that can not happen if we go back to the way thing be it can not happen without you

 so let we summon a new spirit of patriotism of service and responsibility where each of we resolve to pitch in and work hard and look after not only ourselves but each other let we remember that if this financial crisis teach we anything it&#39;s that we can not have a thriving wall street while main street suffers&mdash;in this country we rise or fall as one nation as one people

 let we resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that have poison our politic for so long let we remember that it be a man from this state who first carry the banner of the republican party to the white house&mdash;a party found on the value of self reliance individual liberty and national unity those be value we all share and while the democratic party have win a great victory tonight we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divide that have hold back our progress as lincoln say to a nation far more divided than ours we be not enemy but friend though passion may have strain it must not break our bond of affection and to those americans whose support i have yet to earn&mdash;i may not have win your vote but i hear your voice i need your help and i will be your president too

 and to all those watch tonight from beyond our shore from parliament and palace to those who be huddle around radio in the forget corner of our world&mdash;our story be singular but our destiny be share and a new dawn of american leadership be at hand to those who would tear this world down&mdash;we will defeat you to those who seek peace and security&mdash;we support you and to all those who have wonder if america&#39;s beacon still burn as bright&mdash;tonight we prove once more that the true strength of our nation come not from our the might of our arm or the scale of our wealth but from the endure power of our ideal democracy liberty opportunity and unyielde hope

 for that be the true genius of america&mdash;that america can change our union can be perfect and what we have already achieve give we hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow

 this election have many first and many story that will be tell for generation but one that&#39;s on my mind tonight be about a woman who cast her ballot in atlanta she&#39;s a lot like the million of other who stand in line to make their voice hear in this election except for one thing&mdash;ann nixon cooper be 106 year old

 she be bear just a generation past slavery a time when there be no car on the road or plane in the sky when someone like her couldn&#39;t vote for two reasons&mdash;because she be a woman and because of the color of her skin

 and tonight i think about all that she&#39;s see throughout her century in america&mdash;the heartache and the hope the struggle and the progress the time we be tell that we can&#39;t and the people who press on with that american creed yes we can

 at a time when women&#39;s voice be silence and their hope dismiss she live to see they stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot yes we can

 when there be despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land she see a nation conquer fear itself with a new deal new job and a new sense of common purpose yes we can

 when the bomb fall on our harbor and tyranny threaten the world she be there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy be save yes we can

 she be there for the bus in montgomery the hose in birmingham a bridge in selma and a preacher from atlanta who tell a people that we shall overcome yes we can

 a man touch down on the moon a wall come down in berlin a world be connect by our own science and imagination and this year in this election she touch her finger to a screen and cast her vote because after 106 year in america through the good of time and the dark of hour she know how america can change yes we can

 america we have come so far we have see so much but there be so much more to do so tonight let we ask ourselves&mdash;if our child should live to see the next century if my daughter should be so lucky to live as long as ann nixon cooper what change will they see what progress will we have make

 this be our chance to answer that call this be our moment this be our time&mdash;to put our people back to work and open door of opportunity for our kid to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace to reclaim the american dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth&mdash;that out of many we be one that while we breathe we hope and where we be meet with cynicism and doubt and those who tell we that we can&#39;t we will respond with that timeless creed that sum up the spirit of a people

 we live in a world in which our economy be interconnect prosperity and progress have reach far than any time in our history unfortunately as we have see in recent month financial turmoil anywhere in the world affect economy everywhere in the world and so this weekend i be go to host a summit on financial markets and the world economy with leader from developed and develop nation that account for nearly 90 percent of the world economy leader of the world bank the international monetary fund the united nations and the financial stability forum be go to be there as well we will have dinner at the white house tomorrow night and we will meet most of the day on saturday

 the leader attend this weekend 's meeting agree on a clear purpose to address the current crisis and to lay the foundation for reform that will help prevent a similar crisis in the future we also agree that this undertaking be too large to be accomplish in a single session the issue be too complex the problem be too significant to try to solve or to come up with reasonable recommendation in just one meeting so this summit will be the first of a series of meeting

 it will focus on five key objective understand the cause of the global crisis review the effectiveness of our response thus far develop principle for reform our financial and regulatory system launch a specific action plan to implement those principle and reaffirm our conviction that free market principle offer the sure path to last prosperity applause

 first we be work toward a common understanding of the cause behind the global crisis different country will naturally bring different perspective but there be some point on which we can all agree

 over the past decade the world experience a period of strong economic growth nation accumulate huge amount of saving and look for safe place to invest they because of our attractive political legal and entrepreneurial climate the united states and other developed nation receive a large share of that money

 the massive inflow of foreign capital combine with low interest rate produce a period of easy credit and that easy credit especially affect the housing market flush with cash many lender issue mortgage and many borrower could not afford they financial institution then purchase these loan package they together and convert they into complex security design to yield large return these security be then purchase by investor and financial institution in the united states and europe and elsewhere often with little analysis of their true underlying value

 the financial crisis be ignite when booming housing market begin to decline as home value drop many borrower default on their mortgage and institution hold security back by those mortgage suffer serious loss because of outdated regulatory structure and poor risk management practice many financial institution in america and europe be too highly leveraged when capital run short many face severe financial jeopardy this lead to high profile failure of financial institution in america and europe lead to contraction and widespread anxiety all of which contribute to sharp decline in the equity market

 these development have place a heavy burden on hardworke people around the world stock market drop have erode the value of retirement account and pension fund the tightening of credit have make it hard for family to borrow money for car or home improvement or education of the child business have find it hard to get loan to expand their operation and create job many nation have suffer job loss and have serious concern about the worsen economy develop nation have be hit hard as nervous investor have withdraw their capital

 we be face with the prospect of a global meltdown and so we have respond with bold measure i be a market orient guy but not when i be face with the prospect of a global meltdown at saturday 's summit we be go to review the effectiveness of our action

 here in the united states we have take unprecedented step to boost liquidity recapitalize financial institution guarantee most new debt issue by insured bank and prevent the disorderly collapse of large interconnect enterprise these be historic action take necessary to make necessary so that the economy would not melt down and affect million of our fellow citizen

 in europe government be also purchase equity in bank and provide government guarantee for loan in asia nation like china and japan and south korea have lower interest rate and have launch significant economic stimulus plan in the middle east nation like kuwait and the uae have guarantee deposit and open up new government lending to bank

 in addition nation around the world have take unprecedented joint measure last month a number of central bank carry out a coordinate interest rate cut the federal reserve be extend need liquidity to central bank around the world the imf and world bank be work to ensure that develop nation can weather this crisis

 this crisis do not develop overnight and it be not go to be solve overnight but our action be have an impact credit market be begin to thaw business be gain access to essential short term financing a measure of stability be return to financial system here at home and around the world it be go to require more time for these improvement to fully take hold and there be go to be difficult day ahead but the united states and our partner be take the right step to get through this crisis

 in addition to address the current crisis we will also need to make broad reform to strengthen the global economy over the long term this weekend leader will establish principle for adapt our financial system to the reality of the 21st century marketplace we will discuss specific action we can take to implement these principle we will direct our finance minister to work with other expert and report back to we with detailed recommendation on further reasonable action

 one vital principle of reform be that our nation must make our financial market more transparent for example we should consider improve accounting rule for security so that investor around the world can understand the true value of the asset they purchase

 secondly we must ensure that market firm and financial product be properly regulate for example credit default swap financial product that insure against potential loss should be process through centralized clearinghouse instead of through unregulated over the counter market by bring great stability to this large and important financial sector we reduce the risk to our overall financial system

 third we must enhance the integrity of our financial market for example authority in every nation should take a fresh look at the rule govern market manipulation and fraud and ensure that investor be properly protect

 fourth we must strengthen cooperation among the world 's financial authority for example lead nation should well coordinate national law and regulation we should also reform international financial institution such as the imf and the world bank which be base largely on the economic order of 1944 to well reflect the reality of today 's global economy both the imf and world bank should modernize their governance structure they should consider extend great voter voting power to dynamic develop nation especially as they increase their contribution to these institution they should consider way to streamline their executive board and make they more representative

 in addition to these important to these management change we should move forward with other reform to make the imf and world bank more transparent accountable and effective for example the imf should agree to work more closely with member country to ensure that their exchange rate policy be market orient and fair and the world bank should ensure its development program reflect the priority of the people they be design to serve and focus on measurable result

 all these step require decisive action from government around the world at the same time we must recognize that government intervention be not a cure all for example some blame the crisis on insufficient regulation of the american mortgage market but many european country have much more extensive regulation and still experience problem almost identical to our own

 history have show that the great threat to economic prosperity be not too little government involvement in the market it be too much government involvement in the market applause we see this in the case of fannie mae and freddie mac because these firm be charter by the united states congress many believe they be back by the full faith and credit of the united states government investor put huge amount of money into fannie and freddie which they use to build up irresponsibly large portfolio of mortgage back security and when the housing market decline these security of course plummet in value it take a taxpayer fund rescue to keep fannie and freddie from collapse in a way that would have devastate the global financial system and there be a clear lesson our aim should not be more government it should be smart government

 all this lead to the most important principle that should guide our work while reform in the financial sector be essential the long term solution to today 's problem be sustain economic growth and the sure path to that growth be free market and free people applause

 this be a decisive moment for the global economy in the wake of the financial crisis voice from the left and right be equate the free enterprise system with greed and exploitation and failure it be true this crisis include failure by lender and borrower and by financial firm and by government and independent regulator but the crisis be not a failure of the free market system and the answer be not to try to reinvent that system it be to fix the problem we face make the reform we need and move forward with the free market principle that have deliver prosperity and hope to people all across the globe

 like any other system design by man capitalism be not perfect it can be subject to excess and abuse but it be by far the most efficient and just way of structure an economy at its most basic level capitalism offer people the freedom to choose where they work and what they do the opportunity to buy or sell product they want and the dignity that come with profit from their talent and hard work the free market system provide the incentive that lead to prosperity the incentive to work to innovate to save to invest wisely and to create job for other and as million of people pursue these incentive together whole society benefit

 free market capitalism be far more than economic theory it be the engine of social mobility the highway to the american dream it be what make it possible for a husband and wife to start their own business or a new immigrant to open a restaurant or a single mom to go back to college and to build a well career it be what allow entrepreneur in silicon valley to change the way the world sell product and search for information it be what transform america from a rugged frontier to the great economic power in history a nation that give the world the steamboat and the airplane the computer and the cat scan the internet and the ipod

 ultimately the good evidence for free market capitalism be its performance compare to other economic system free market allow japan an island with few natural resource to recover from war and grow into the world 's second large economy free market allow south korea to make itself into one of the most technologically advanced society in the world free market turn small area like singapore and hong kong and taiwan into global economic player today the success of the world 's large economy come from their embrace of free market

 meanwhile nation that have pursue other model have experience devastating result soviet communism starve million bankrupt an empire and collapse as decisively as the berlin wall cuba once know for its vast field of cane be now force to ration sugar and while iran sit atop giant oil reserve its people can not put enough gasoline in its in their car

 the record be unmistakable if you seek economic growth if you seek opportunity if you seek social justice and human dignity the free market system be the way to go applause and it would be a terrible mistake to allow a few month of crisis to undermine 60 year of success

 just as important as maintain free market within country be maintain the free movement of good and service between country when nation open their market to trade and investment their business and farmer and worker find new buyer for their product consumer benefit from more choice and well price entrepreneur can get their idea off the ground with funding from anywhere in the world thank in large part to open market the volume of global trade today be nearly 30 time great than it be six decade ago and some of the most dramatic gain have come in the develop world

 as president i have see the transformative power of trade up close i have be to a caterpillar factory in east peoria illinois where thousand of good pay american job be support by export i have walk the ground of a trade fair in ghana where i meet woman who support their family by export handmade dress and jewelry i have speak with a farmer in guatemala who decide to grow high value crop he could sell overseas and help create more than 1,000 job

 story like these show why it be so important to keep market open to trade and investment this openness be especially urgent during time of economic strain shortly after the stock market crash in 1929 congress pass the smoot hawley tariff a protectionist measure design to wall off america 's economy from global competition the result be not economic security it be economic ruin and leader around the world must keep this example in mind and reject the temptation of protectionism applause

 there be clear cut way for nation to demonstrate the commitment to open market the united states congress have an immediate opportunity by approve free trade agreement with colombia peru and south korea america and other wealthy nation must also ensure this crisis do not become an excuse to reverse our engagement with the develop world and develop nation should continue policy that foster enterprise and investment as well all nation should pledge to conclude a framework this year that lead to a successful doha agreement

 we be face this challenge together and we be go to get through it together the united states be determined to show the way back to economic growth and prosperity i know some may question whether america 's leadership in the global economy will continue the world can be confident that it will because our market be flexible and we can rebound from setback we see that resilience in the 1940 when america pull itself out of depression marshal a powerful army and help save the world from tyranny we see that resilience in the 1980 when americans overcome gas line turn stagflation into strong economic growth and win the cold war we see that resilience after september the 11th 2001 when our nation recover from a brutal attack revitalize our shake economy and rally the force of freedom in the great ideological struggle of the 21st century

 the world will see the resilience of america once again we will work with our partner to correct the problem in the global financial system we will rebuild our economic strength and we will continue to lead the world toward prosperity and peace

 thank for come and god bless applause

good morning for year america 's automaker have face serious challenge burdensome cost a shrink share of the market and decline profit in recent month the global financial crisis have make these challenge even more severe now some u.s. auto executive say that their company be near collapse and that the only way they can buy time to restructure be with help from the federal government

 this be a difficult situation that involve fundamental question about the proper role of government on the one hand government have a responsibility not to undermine the private enterprise system on the other hand government have a responsibility to safeguard the broad health and stability of our economy

 address the challenge in the auto industry require we to balance these two responsibility if we be to allow the free market to take its course now it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automaker under ordinary economic circumstance i would say this be the price that fail company must pay and i would not favor intervene to prevent the automaker from go out of business

 but these be not ordinary circumstance in the midst of a financial crisis and a recession allow the u.s. auto industry to collapse be not a responsible course of action the question be how we can well give it a chance to succeed some argue the wise path be to allow the auto company to reorganize through chapter 11 provision of our bankruptcy law and provide federal loan to keep they operate while they try to restructure under the supervision of a bankruptcy court but give the current state of the auto industry and the economy chapter 11 be unlikely to work for american automaker at this time

 american consumer understand why if you hear that a car company be suddenly go into bankruptcy you worry that part and servicing will not be available and you question the value of your warranty and with consumer hesitant to buy new car from struggle automaker it would be more difficult for auto company to recover

 additionally the financial crisis bring the auto company to the brink of bankruptcy much fast than they could have anticipate and they have not make the legal and financial preparation necessary to carry out an orderly bankruptcy proceeding that could lead to a successful restructuring

 the convergence of these factor mean there be too great a risk that bankruptcy now would lead to a disorderly liquidation of american auto company my economic advisor believe that such a collapse would deal an unacceptably painful blow to hardworke americans far beyond the auto industry it would worsen a weak job market and exacerbate the financial crisis it could send our suffering economy into a deep and long recession and it would leave the next president to confront the demise of a major american industry in his first day of office

 a more responsible option be to give the auto company an incentive to restructure outside of bankruptcy and a brief window in which to do it and that be why my administration work with congress on a bill to provide automaker with loan to stave off bankruptcy while they develop plan for viability this legislation earn bipartisan support from majority in both house of congress

 unfortunately despite extensive debate and agreement that we should prevent disorderly bankruptcy in the american auto industry congress be unable to get a bill to my desk before adjourn this year

 this mean the only way to avoid a collapse of the u.s. auto industry be for the executive branch to step in the american people want the auto company to succeed and so do i. so today i be announce that the federal government will grant loan to auto company under condition similar to those congress consider last week

 these loan will provide help in two way first they will give automaker three month to put in place plan to restructure into viable company which we believe they be capable of do second if restructuring can not be accomplish outside of bankruptcy the loan will provide time for company to make the legal and financial preparation necessary for an orderly chapter 11 process that offer a well prospect of long term success and give consumer confidence that they can continue to buy american car

 because congress fail to make fund available for these loan the plan i be announce today will be draw from the financial rescue package congress approve early this fall the term of the loan will require auto company to demonstrate how they would become viable they must pay back all their loan to the government and show that their firm can earn a profit and achieve a positive net worth this restructuring will require meaningful concession from all involve in the auto industry management labor union creditor bondholder dealer and supplier

 in particular automaker must meet condition that expert agree be necessary for long term viability include put their retirement plan on a sustainable footing persuade bondholder to convert their debt into capital the company need to address immediate financial shortfall and make their compensation competitive with foreign automaker who have major operation in the united states if a company fail to come up with a viable plan by march 31st it will be require to repay its federal loan

 the automaker and union must understand what be at stake and make hard decision necessary to reform these condition send a clear message to everyone involve in the future of american automaker the time to make the hard decision to become viable be now or the only option will be bankruptcy

 the action i be announce today represent a step that we wish be not necessary but give the situation it be the most effective and responsible way to address this challenge face our nation by give the auto company a chance to restructure we will shield the american people from a harsh economic blow at a vulnerable time and we will give american worker an opportunity to show the world once again they can meet challenge with ingenuity and determination and bounce back from tough time and emerge strong than before

 thank you

the president thank you tapper we have be through a lot together as i look through the room i see jake mike herman ann compton just seem like yesterday that that i be on the campaign trail and you be analyze my speech and my policy and i see a lot of face that travel with i around the world and to place like afghanistan and iraq and africa i see some new face which go to show there be some turnover in this business

 through it all it be be i have respect you sometimes do not like the story that you write or report on sometimes you misunderestimate i but always the relationship i have feel have be professional and i appreciate it

 i appreciate i do appreciate work with you my friend say what be it like to deal with the press corps i say these be just people try to do the good they possibly can

 and so here at the last press conference i be interested in answer some of your question but mostly i be interested in say thank you for the job

 ben

 q thank you for those comment mr. president here be a question i be wonder if you plan to ask congress for the remain $ 350 billion in bail money and in term of the timing if you do that before you leave office sir be you motivated in part to make life a little easy for president elect obama

 the president i have talk to the president elect about this subject and i tell he that if he feel that he need the $ 350 billion i would be willing to ask for it in other word if he feel it need to happen on my watch

 the good course of action of course be to convince enough member of the senate to vote positively for the for the request and you know that be all i can share with you because that be all i know

 q so you have not make the request yet

 the president well he have not ask i to make the request yet and i do not intend to make the request unless he specifically ask i to make it

 he be you know i have have my third conversation with he and i genuinely mean what i say i wish he all the very good i have find he to be a very smart and engaging person and that lunch the other day be interesting to have two guy who be nearly 85 two 62 year older and a 47 year old kind of the classic generational statement

 and one common area at least the four of we we all have different circumstance and experience but one thing be we have all experience what it mean to assume the responsibility of the presidency and president elect obama be fix to do that and he will get swear in and then they will have the lunch and all the you know all the deal up there on capitol hill and then he will come back and go through the inauguration and then he will walk in the oval office and there will be a moment when the responsibility of the president land squarely on his shoulder

 toby yes we will get everybody

 q thank you mr. president do you believe that the gaza conflict will have end by the time you leave office do you approve of the way that israel have conduct it and why be you unable to achieve the peace deal that you have seek

 the president remind i of the three point will you because i be get

 q will it end

 the president i be get a little old

 q will it end by the time you leave office do you approve of the

 the president i hope so i be for a sustainable cease fire and a definition of a sustainable cease fire be that hamas stop fire rocket into israel and there will not be a sustainable cease fire if they continue fire rocket i happen to believe the choice be hamas 's to make and we believe that the good way to ensure that there be a sustainable cease fire be to work with egypt to stop the smuggling of arm into the gaza that enable hamas to continue to fire rocket and so country that supply weapon to hamas have get to stop and the international community need to continue to pressure they to stop provide weapon

 hamas obviously if they be interested in a sustainable cease fire need to stop arm and then of course country contingent to the gaza need to work to stop the smuggling and it be a difficult difficult task i mean there be tunnel and you know great opportunity for people who want to continue to try to disrupt democracy to provide the weapon to do so

 second part of your question please ma'am

 q do you approve of the israeli conduct in this

 the president i think israel have a right to defend herself obviously in any of these kind of situation i would hope that she would continue to be mindful of innocent folk and that they help you know expedite the delivery of humanitarian aid

 and third why have not we achieve peace that be a good question it be be a long time since they have have peace in the middle east step one be to have a vision for what peace would look like and in 2002 on the step of the rose garden i give a speech about a two state solution two state two democracy live side by side in peace and we have work hard to advance that idea first thing be to convince all party that the two state be necessary for peace

 and one thing that be happen be be that most people in the middle east now accept the two state solution as the good way for peace most palestinians want their own state and most israelis understand there need to be a democracy on their border in order for there to be long last peace

 the challenge of course have be to lay out the condition so that a peaceful state can emerge in other word help the palestinians in the west bank develop security force which we have work hard to do over the past year and those security force be now become more efficient and prime minister fayyad be use they effectively the challenge be to develop help the palestinians develop a democracy i mean and a vibrant economy in their that will help lead to democracy

 and the challenge of course be always complicate by the fact that people be willing to murder to stop the advance of freedom and so the hamas or for that matter al qaeda or other extremist group be willing to use violence to prevent free state from emerge and that be the big challenge

 and so the answer be will this ever happen i think it will and i know we have advance the process

 yes suzanne finally get your name right after how many year six year

 q eight year laughter

 the president eight year you use to be know as suzanne now you be suz ahn

 q suz ahn thank you laughter

 the president i be gahge laughter

 q in your 2002 state of the union address you identify u.s. threat as an axis of evil iran iraq and north korea iraq be relatively calm north korea be no long on the terrorist threat list how would you define if in fact there be an axis of evil and what be the great and most urgent threat when it come to security that barack obama have to deal with

 the president the most urgent threat that he will have to deal with and other president after he will have to deal with be an attack on our homeland you know i wish i could report that be not the case but there be still an enemy out there that would like to inflict damage on america americans and that will be the major threat

 north korea be still a problem there be a debate in the intel community about how big a problem they be but one of my concern be that there might be a highly enriched uranium program and therefore it be really important that out of the six party talk come a strong verification regime in other word in order to advance our relation with north korea the north korean government must honor the commitment it make to allow for strong verification measure to be in place to ensure that they do not develop a highly enriched uranium program for example

 so they be still dangerous and iran be still dangerous

 yes

 q you say in an interview early this weekend one of these i guess exit interview that

 the president this be the ultimate exit interview

 q that you think the republican party need to be more inclusive who need to hear that message inside the republican party

 the president you see i be concerned that in the wake of the defeat that the temptation will be to look inward and to say well here be a litmus test you must adhere to

 this party will come back but the party 's message have get to be that different point of view be include in the party and take for example the immigration debate that be obviously a highly contentious issue and the problem with the outcome of the initial round of the debate be that some people say well republicans do not like immigrant now that may be fair or unfair but that be what that be the image that come out

 and you know if the image be we do not like immigrant then there be probably somebody else out there say well if they do not like the immigrant they probably do not like i as well and so my point be be that our party have get to be compassionate and broad minded

 i remember the 1964 election my dad happen to be run for the united state senate then and you know get landslide with the johnson landslide in the state of texas but it be not just george bush who get defeat the republican party be pretty well decimate at the time at least that be what they i think that be how the pundit view it and then 66 there be a resurgence and the same thing can happen this time but we just get to make sure our message be broad gauged and compassionate that we care about people 's life and we have get a plan to help they improve their life

 jake yes how you do

 q i be good how you do sir

 the president so what have you be do since 2000 never mind laughter

 q work my way to this chair

 the president so be you go to be here for president obama

 q i will i will

 the president that be a pretty cool job

 q it be not bad

 the president yes laughter

 q your might be well

 the president yes what retirement laughter

 q in the past when you have be ask to address bad poll number or your own popularity you have say that history will judge that you do the right thing that you think you do the right thing but without get into your motive or your goal i think a lot of people include republicans include some member of your own administration have be disappoint at the execution of some of your ideal whether iraq or katrina or the economy what would your closing message be to the american people about the execution of these goal

 the president well first of all hard thing do not happen overnight jake and when the history of iraq be write historian will analyze for example the decision on the surge the situation be look like it be go fine and then violence for a period of time begin to throw throw the progress of iraq into doubt and rather than accept the status quo and say oh it be not worth it or the politic make it difficult or you know the party may end up be you know not do well in the election because of the violence in iraq i decide to do something about it and send 30,000 troop in as oppose to withdraw

 and so that part of history be certain and the situation do change now the question be in the long run will this democracy survive and that be go to be the challenge for future president

 in term of the economy look i inherit a recession i be end on a recession in the meantime there be 52 month of uninterrupted job growth and i defend tax cut when i campaign i helped implement tax cut when i be president and i will defend they after my presidency as the right course of action and there be a fundamental philosophical debate about tax cut who well can spend your money the government or you and i have always side with the people on that issue

 now obviously these be very difficult economic time when people analyze the situation there will be this problem start before my presidency it obviously take place during my presidency the question face a president be not when the problem start but what do you do about it when you recognize the problem and i readily concede i chunk aside some of my free market principle when i be tell by chief economic advisor that the situation we be face could be bad than the great depression

 so i have tell some of my friend who say you know who have take an ideological position on this issue why do you do what you do i say well if you be sit there and hear that the depression could be great than the great depression i hope you would act too which i do and we have take extraordinary measure to deal with the frozen credit market which have affect the economy credit spread be begin to shrink lending be just begin to pick up the action we have take i believe have help thaw the credit market which be the first step toward recovery

 and so yes look there be plenty of critic in this business i understand that and i thank you for give i a chance to defend a record that i be go to continue to defend because i think it be a good strong record

 jim

 q thank you mr. president i would also like to ask you about your critic

 the president sure you know any laughter

 q well a couple year ago charles krauthammer columnist and harvard train psychiatrist coin a term bush derangement syndrome to talk about your critic who disagree with you most passionately not just your policy but seem to take an animosity towards you i be just wonder as you look back why you think you engender such passionate criticism animosity and do you have any message specifically to those to that particular part of the spectrum of your critic

 the president you know most people i see you know when i be move around the country for example they be not angry and they be not hostile people and they we never meet people who disagree that be just not true i have meet a lot of people who do not agree with the decision i make but they have be civil in their discourse

 and so i view those who get angry and yell and say bad thing and you know all that kind of stuff it be just a very few people in the country i do not know why they get angry i do not know why they get hostile it be not the first time however in history that people have express themselves in sometimes undignifie way i have be read you know a lot about abraham lincoln during my presidency and there be some pretty harsh discord when it come to the 16th president just like there be be harsh discord for the 43rd president

 you know president can try to avoid hard decision and therefore avoid controversy that be just not my nature i be the kind of person that you know be willing to take on hard task and in time of war people get emotional i understand that never really you know spend that much time frankly worry about the loud voice i of course hear they but they do not affect my policy nor do they affect affect how i make decision

 you know the president elect obama will find this too he will get in the oval office and there will be a lot of people that be real critical and harsh and he will be disappoint at time by the tone of the rhetoric and he be go to have to do what he think be right jim and if you do not then i do not see how you can live with yourself i do not see how i can get back home in texas and look in the mirror and be proud of what i see if i allow the loud voice the loud critic to prevent i from do what i think be necessary to protect this country

 mike

 q mr. president thank you very much since your philosophy be so different from president elect obama 's what concern you the most about what he may attempt to do

 the president you know michael i be not go to speculate about what he be go to do it be go to be you know he be go to get in the oval office he be go to analyze each situation and he be go to make the decision that he think be necessary

 and the other thing be when i get out of here i be get off the stage i believe there ought to be you know one person in the klieg light at a time and i have have my time in the klieg light you know i be confident you know you will catch i opine on occasion but i wish he all the good

 and people say oh you just that be just a throwaway line no it be not a throwaway line the stake be high there be an enemy that still be out there you know people can maybe try to write that off as you know he be try to set something up i be tell you there be an enemy that would like to attack america americans again there just be that be the reality of the world and i wish he all the very good

 and of course he be go to have his hand full with the economy i understand it be tough for a lot of work people out there the people be concerned about their economic future you know one of the very difficult part of the decision i make on the financial crisis be to use hardworke people 's money to help prevent there to be a crisis and in so doing some of that money go into wall street firm that cause the crisis in the first place i be not kid when i say wall street get drunk and we get the hangover and but nevertheless president elect obama will find the problem and the situation surround problem sometimes cause people to have to make decision that they you know be not initially comfortable with and there be such a decision when it come to wall street

 i mean i have a lot of people when i go out to midland that time say what the heck be you do those people up east cause the problem i say i know but if we have not work to fix the problem your situation would be bad and anyway i really do wish he all the good

 sheryl

 q thank you mr. president mr. president in recent day there be be a fair amount of discussion in legal circle about whether or not you might give preemptive pardon pardon in advance to official of your administration who engage in anything from harsh interrogation tactic to perhaps dismiss u.s. attorney i would like to know have you give any consideration to this and be you plan on it

 the president i will not be discuss pardon here at this press conference

 q can i have a follow up

 the president would you like to ask another question

 q yes i would sir thank you four year ago

 the president that be the spirit be not it laughter

 q i appreciate that

 the president thank you laughter

 q four year ago you be ask if you have make any mistake

 the president yes

 q and i be not try to play gotcha but i wonder when you look back over the long arc of your presidency do you think in retrospect that you have make any mistake and if so what be the single big mistake that you may have make

 the president gotcha i have often say that history will look back and determine that which could have be do well or you know mistake i make clearly put a mission accomplished on a aircraft carrier be a mistake it send the wrong message we be try to say something differently but nevertheless it convey a different message obviously some of my rhetoric have be a mistake

 i have think long and hard about katrina you know could i have do something differently like land air force one either in new orleans or baton rouge the problem with that and be that law enforcement would have be pull away from the mission and then your question i suspect would have be how could you possibly have fly air force one into baton rouge and police officer that be need to expedite traffic out of new orleans be take off the task to look after you

 i believe that run the social security idea right after the 04 election be a mistake i should have argue for immigration reform and the reason why be be that you know one of the lesson i learn as governor of texas by the way be legislative branch tend to be risk adverse in other word sometimes legislature have the tendency to ask why should i take on a hard task when a crisis be not imminent and the crisis be not imminent for social security as far as many member of congress be concern

 as an aside one thing i prove be that you can actually campaign on the issue and get elect in other word i do not believe talk about social security be the third rail of american politic i matter of fact think that in the future not talk about how you intend to fix social security be go to be the third rail of american politic

 one thing about the presidency be that you can make only make decision you know on the information at hand you do not get to have information after you have make the decision that be not the way it work and you stand by your decision and you do your good to explain why you make the decision you make

 there have be disappointment abu ghraib obviously be a huge disappointment during the presidency not have weapon of mass destruction be a significant disappointment i do not know if you want to call those mistake or not but they be thing do not go accord to plan let us put it that way

 anyway i think historian will look back and they will be able to have a well look at mistake after some time have pass along jake 's question there be no such thing as short term history i do not think you can possibly get the full breadth of an administration until time have pass where do a president 's do a president 's decision have the impact that he think they would or he think they would over time or how do this president compare to future president give a set of circumstance that may be similar or not similar i mean there be it be just impossible to do and i be comfortable with that

 yes mike

 q one of the major objective that the incoming administration have talk frequently about be restore america 's moral standing in the world and many of the ally of the new president i believe that the president elect himself have talk about the damage that gitmo that harsh interrogation tactic that they consider torture how go to war in iraq without a u.n. mandate have damage america 's moral standing in the world i be wonder basically what be your reaction to that do you think that be that something that the next president need to worry about

 the president i strongly disagree with the assessment that our moral standing have be damage it may be damage amongst some of the elite but people still understand america stand for freedom that america be a country that provide such great hope

 you go to africa you ask africans about america 's generosity and compassion go to india and ask about you know america 's their view of america go to china and ask now no question part of europe have say that we should not have go to war in iraq without a mandate but those be a few country most country in europe listen to what 1441 say which be disclose disarm or face serious consequence

 most people take those word seriously now some country do not even though they might have vote for the resolution i disagree with this assessment that you know people view america in a dim light i just do not agree with that and i understand that gitmo have create controversy but when it come time for those country that be criticize america to take some of those some of those detainee they be not willing to help out and so you know i just disagree with the assessment mike

 i will remind listen i tell people yes you can try to be popular in certain quarter in europe you can be popular by blame every middle eastern problem on israel or you can be popular by join the international criminal court i guess i could have be popular by accept kyoto which i feel be a flawed treaty and propose something different and more constructive

 and in term of the decision that i have make to protect the homeland i would not worry about popularity what i would worry about be the constitution of the united states and put plan in place that make it easy to find out what the enemy be think because all these debate will matter not if there be another attack on the homeland the question will not be you know be you critical of this plan or not the question be go to be why do not you do something

 do you remember what it be like right after september the 11th around here in press conference and opinion piece and in story that sometimes be news story and sometimes opinion piece people be say how come they do not see it how come they do not connect the dot do you remember what the environment be like in washington i do when people be haul up in front of congress and member of congress be ask question about how come you do not know this that or the other and then we start put policy in place legal policy in place to connect the dot and all of a sudden people be say how come you be connect the dot

 and so mike i have hear all that i have hear all that my view be be that most people around the world they respect america and some of they do not like i i understand that some of the writer and the you know opiner and all that that be fine that be part of the deal but i be more concerned about the country and our how people view the united states they view we as strong compassionate people who care deeply about the universality of freedom

 roger

 q thank you mr. president you speak a moment ago about use taxpayer money for the tarp program

 the president yes i do

 q the first $ 350 billion be out the door it be be spend be you satisfied that it be be spend wisely and for the second $ 350 billion that be under consideration do you think be you supportive of congress put some restriction on it

 the president i be supportive of the president elect work out a plan with congress that good suit he and congress that be what he be go to have to do he be go to have to go up there and he be go to have to make his case as to why the $ 350 billion be necessary and he know that this be nothing new

 and in term of the first $ 350 billion i be pleased with this aspect of the expenditure and that be that the financial market be begin to thaw in the fall i be concerned that the credit freeze would cause we to be head toward a depression great than the great depression that be what i be tell if we do not move and so therefore we have move aggressively

 and by the way it just be not with the tarp if you think about aig fannie and freddie a lot of the decision that be make in this administration be very aggressive decision all aim at prevent the financial system from cratere

 q mr. president you speak of the moment that the responsibility of the office would hit barack obama the world be a far different place than it be when it hit you when do you think he be go to feel the full impact and what if anything have you and the other president share with he about the effect of the sometimes isolation the so call bubble of the office

 the president yes that be a great question he will he will feel the effect the minute he walk in the oval office at least that be when i feel i do not know when he be go he may feel it the minute he be get swear in and the minute i get swear in i start think about the speech laughter and so but he be a well speech maker than i so he will be able to he will be able to i do not know how he be go to feel all i know be he be go to feel it there will be a moment when he feel it

 i have never feel isolated and i do not think he will one reason he will not feel isolated be because he be get a fabulous family and he care a lot about his family that be evident from my discussion with he he will be he be a 45 second commute away from a great wife and two little girl that love he dearly

 i believe this the phrase burden of the office be overstate you know it be kind of like why i oh the burden you know why do the financial collapse have to happen on my watch it be just it be pathetic be not it self pity and i do not believe that president elect obama will be full of self pity he will find you know your the people that do not like you the critic they be pretty predictable sometimes the big disappointment will come from your so call friend and there will be disappointment i promise you he will be disappoint on the other hand the job be so exciting and so profound that the disappointment will be clearly you know a minor irritant compare to the

 q it be never the lonely office in the world for you

 the president no not for i we have a people we i have a fabulous team around i of highly dedicated smart capable people and we have fun i tell people that you know some day happy some day not so happy every day have be joyous and people they say i just do not believe it to be the case well it be the case even in the dark moment of iraq you know there be and every day when i be read the report about soldier lose their life no question there be a lot of emotion but also there be time where we could be light hearted and support each other

 and i build a team of really capable people who be there not to serve i or there to serve the republicans they be there to serve the country and president elect obama will find as he make these tough call and tough decision that he will be support by a lot of really good people that care care about the country as well

 john

 q you have talk a lot about your concern over the rise of protectionism in the current

 the president yes

 q economic environment what do you think the future hold for that do you think the trend be a good one or a bad one

 the president i hope the trend be bad against protectionism a disappointment not a mistake but a disappointment be not get the three trade bill out of congress on colombia panama and south korea that be a disappointment i actually think we have a shot at one time and then i be disappoint that they do not move out of the house

 and i be concerned about protectionism in tough economic time the temptation be to say well let us just throw up barrier and protect our own and not compete that be the sentiment by the way that be in place during decent economic time after all we get cafta out of the congress by one vote and it would be a huge mistake if we become a protectionist nation

 and that might be a good thing for the bush center to do at smu be to remind people about the benefit of free and fair trade benefit for our own worker benefit for worker overseas and benefit when it come to promote development and help lift people out of poverty in particularly third world country the good way to enhance economic growth in a third world country and to give people a chance to realize a well future be through trade it be be prove it be a fact and i be hopeful that the country do not slip into protectionist policy

 april yes ma'am

 q thank you mr. president

 the president yes you be sound asleep back there so i decide laughter

 q no i be not there be a whole clear row before i i think you be go to go there but either way thank for the surprise

 mr. president on new orleans you basically talk about a moment ago about the photo opportunity but let us talk about what you could have do to change the situation for the city of new orleans to be far along in reconstruction than where it be now and also when you come or begin to run for the oval office about nine year ago or so the james byrd drag death be residue on your campaign and now at this time 2009 we have the first black president could you tell we what you have see on the issue of race as you see it from the oval office

 the president sure thank first of all we do get the $ 121 billion more or less pass and it be now be spend secondly the school system be improve dramatically thirdly people be begin to move back into home this storm be a devastating storm april that require a lot of energy a lot of focus and a lot of resource to get new orleans up and run

 and have the reconstruction be perfect no have thing happen fairly quickly absolutely and be there more to be do you bet there be

 q what more need to be do

 the president well more people need to get in their house more people need to have their own home there but the system be in place to continue the reconstruction of new orleans

 people say well the federal response be slow do not tell i the federal response be slow when there be 30,000 people pull off roof right after the storm pass i remember go to see those helicopter driver coast guard driver to thank they for their courageous effort to rescue people off roof thirty thousand people be pull off roof right after the storm move through it be a pretty quick response

 could thing have be do well absolutely absolutely but when i hear people say the federal response be slow then what be they go to say to those chopper driver or the 30,000 that get pull off the roof

 the other part of the look i be affect by the tv after the election when i see people say i never think i would see the day that a black person would be elect president and a lot of the people have tear stream down their cheek when they say it and so i be i be consider myself fortunate to have a front row seat on what be go to be an historic moment for the country president elect obama 's election do speak volume about how far this country have come when it come to racial relation but there be still work to do there be always go to be work to do to deal with people 's heart

 and so i be look forward to it really be i think it be go to be it be go to be an amazing amazing moment

 michael allen yes michael allen

 q mr. president

 the president who would be you

 q mr. president often president go leave here they say they be go to decompress and then pretty soon they be right back in their office i wonder how quickly you think you be go to be back at it whether it be write your book whether it be speak whether it be travel whether it be

 the president you know mike i do not know probably the next day i be a type a personality you know i just i just can not envision myself you know the big straw hat and hawaiian shirt sit on some beach laughter

 q no one else can either

 the president so laughter particularly since i quit drinking anyway so i predict to you that first of all i be not sure what to expect for the last eight year i have have a national security briefing every day but sunday and when you get a national security briefing it be a reminder of the responsibility of the job it be just a daily reminder about what may or may not happen

 the interesting thing about this job by the way be it be one thing to deal with the expect what you anticipate the real challenge be to be in a position to deal with the unexpected and that be why those intel briefing be so important because there be there be an awareness in the briefing by the analyst to try to help anticipate problem and of course you hope they do not arise but you well be prepare when they do

 and that in itself create a you know get your attention when you start think about what could happen and the key there of course be that to take these different analysis seriously and then have a structure so that your team will be in a position to analyze and then lay out potential avenue for the president from which the president can choose

 i say all that because that be this have be this notion about be brief and think about this issue or that issue have be just a part of my life for eight year people say well there you be in crawford on vacation you never escape the presidency it travel with you everywhere you go and there be not a moment where you do not think about be president unless you be ride mountain bike as hard as you possibly can try to forget for the moment

 and so i wake up in crawford tuesday morning i mean wednesday morning and i suspect i will make laura coffee and go get it for she and it be go to be a different feeling and i can not it be kind of like i will report back after i feel it

 last question ann since you have be there from day one

 q thank you and i want to ask you about day one you arrive here want to be a uniter not a divid do you think barack obama can be a uniter not a divider or be with the challenge for any president and the unpopular decision be it impossible for any president to be uniter not a divid

 the president i hope the tone be different for he than it have be for i i be disappoint by the tone in washington d.c. i try to do my part by not engage in the name calling and and by the way needless name calling i have work to be respectful of my opponent on different issue

 there we do find some good common ground on a variety of issue no child leave behind medicare prescription drug pepfar in the end the funding for troop in iraq tax cut to a certain extent get some bipartisan vote on they there have be area where we be able to work together it be just the rhetoric get out of control at time

 q why

 the president i do not know why you need to ask those who those who use the word they use as i say it be not the first time it be ever happen as i think i answer that to jim there it be happen throughout our history and i would hope that frankly for the sake of the system itself that if people disagree with president elect obama they treat he with respect i worry about people look at our system and say why would i want to go up there and work in that kind of environment

 and so i wish he all the good and no question he will be there will be critic and there should be we all should welcome criticism on different policy it be the great thing about our democracy people have a chance to express themselves i just hope the tone be respectful he deserve it and so do the country

 it have be a honor to work with you i mean what i say when i first get up here i wish you all the very good i wish you and your family all the good god bless you

fellow citizen
 for eight year it have be my honor to serve as your president the first decade of this new century have be a period of consequence a time set apart tonight with a thankful heart i have ask for a final opportunity to share some thought on the journey that we have travel together and the future of our nation
 five day from now the world will witness the vitality of american democracy in a tradition date back to our founding the presidency will pass to a successor choose by you the american people stand on the step of the capitol will be a man whose history reflect the endure promise of our land this be a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation and i join all americans in offer best wish to president elect obama his wife michelle and their two beautiful girl
 tonight i be fill with gratitude to vice president cheney and member of my administration to laura who bring joy to this house and love to my life to our wonderful daughter barbara and jenna to my parent whose example have provide strength for a lifetime and above all i thank the american people for the trust you have give i i thank you for the prayer that have lift my spirit and i thank you for the countless act of courage generosity and grace that i have witness these past eight year
 this evening my thought return to the first night i address you from this house september the 11th 2001 that morning terrorist take nearly 3,000 life in the bad attack on america since pearl harbor i remember stand in the rubble of the world trade center three day later surround by rescuer who have be work around the clock i remember talk to brave soul who charge through smoke fill corridor at the pentagon and to husband and wife whose love one become hero aboard flight 93 i remember arlene howard who give i her fallen son 's police shield as a reminder of all that be lose and i still carry his badge
 as the year pass most americans be able to return to life much as it have be before 9/11 but i never do every morning i receive a briefing on the threat to our nation i vow to do everything in my power to keep we safe
 over the past seven year a new department of homeland security have be create the military the intelligence community and the fbi have be transform our nation be equip with new tool to monitor the terrorist movement freeze their finance and break up their plot and with strong ally at our side we have take the fight to the terrorist and those who support they afghanistan have go from a nation where the taliban harbor al qaeda and stone woman in the street to a young democracy that be fight terror and encourage girl to go to school iraq have go from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of america to an arab democracy at the heart of the middle east and a friend of the united states
 there be legitimate debate about many of these decision but there can be little debate about the result america have go more than seven year without another terrorist attack on our soil this be a tribute to those who toil night and day to keep we safe law enforcement officer intelligence analyst homeland security and diplomatic personnel and the man and woman of the united states armed forces
 our nation be bless to have citizen who volunteer to defend we in this time of danger i have cherish meet these selfless patriot and their family and america owe you a debt of gratitude and to all our man and woman in uniform listen tonight there have be no high honor than serve as your commander in chief
 the battle wage by our troop be part of a broad struggle between two dramatically different system under one a small band of fanatic demand total obedience to an oppressive ideology condemn woman to subservience and mark unbeliever for murder the other system be base on the conviction that freedom be the universal gift of almighty god and that liberty and justice light the path to peace
 this be the belief that give birth to our nation and in the long run advance this belief be the only practical way to protect our citizen when people live in freedom they do not willingly choose leader who pursue campaign of terror when people have hope in the future they will not cede their life to violence and extremism so around the world america be promote human liberty human right and human dignity we be stand with dissident and young democracy provide aids medicine to die patient to bring die patient back to life and spare mother and baby from malaria and this great republic bear alone in liberty be lead the world toward a new age when freedom belong to all nation
 for eight year we have also strive to expand opportunity and hope here at home across our country student be rise to meet high standard in public school a new medicare prescription drug benefit be bring peace of mind to senior and the disabled every taxpayer pay low income taxis the addicted and suffering be find new hope through faith base program vulnerable human life be well protect funding for our veteran have nearly double america 's air and water and land be measurably clean and the federal bench include wise new member like justice sam alito and chief justice john roberts
 when challenge to our prosperity emerge we rise to meet they face the prospect of a financial collapse we take decisive measure to safeguard our economy these be very tough time for hardworke family but the toll would be far bad if we have not act all americans be in this together and together with determination and hard work we will restore our economy to the path of growth we will show the world once again the resilience of america 's free enterprise system
 like all who have hold this office before i i have experience setback there be thing i would do differently if give the chance yet i have always act with the good interest of our country in mind i have follow my conscience and do what i think be right you may not agree with some of the tough decision i have make but i hope you can agree that i be willing to make the tough decision
 the decade ahead will bring more hard choice for our country and there be some guide principle that should shape our course
 while our nation be safe than it be seven year ago the grave threat to our people remain another terrorist attack our enemy be patient and determine to strike again america do nothing to seek or deserve this conflict but we have be give solemn responsibility and we must meet they we must resist complacency we must keep our resolve and we must never let down our guard
 at the same time we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose in the face of threat from abroad it can be tempting to seek comfort by turn inward but we must reject isolationism and its companion protectionism retreat behind our border would only invite danger in the 21st century security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad if america do not lead the cause of freedom that cause will not be lead
 as we address these challenge and other we can not foresee tonight america must maintain our moral clarity i have often speak to you about good and evil and this have make some uncomfortable but good and evil be present in this world and between the two of they there can be no compromise murder the innocent to advance an ideology be wrong every time everywhere free people from oppression and despair be eternally right this nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth we must always be willing to act in their defense and to advance the cause of peace
 president thomas jefferson once write i like the dream of the future well than the history of the past as i leave the house he occupy two century ago i share that optimism america be a young country full of vitality constantly grow and renew itself and even in the tough time we lift our eye to the broad horizon ahead
 i have confidence in the promise of america because i know the character of our people this be a nation that inspire immigrant to risk everything for the dream of freedom this be a nation where citizen show calm in time of danger and compassion in the face of suffering we see example of america 's character all around we and laura and i have invite some of they to join we in the white house this evening
 we see america 's character in dr. tony recasner a principal who open a new charter school from the ruin of hurricane katrina we see it in julio medina a former inmate who lead a faith base program to help prisoner return to society we have see it in staff sergeant aubrey mcdade who charge into an ambush in iraq and rescue three of his fellow marines
 we see america 's character in bill krissoff a surgeon from california his son nathan a marine give his life in iraq when i meet dr. krissoff and his family he deliver some surprising news he tell i he want to join the navy medical corps in honor of his son this good man be 60 year old—18 year above the age limit but his petition for a waiver be grant and for the past year he have train in battlefield medicine lieutenant commander krissoff could not be here tonight because he will soon deploy to iraq where he will help save america 's wound warrior and uphold the legacy of his fall son
 in citizen like these we see the good of our country resilient and hopeful caring and strong these virtue give i an unshakable faith in america we have face danger and trial and there be more ahead but with the courage of our people and confidence in our ideal this great nation will never tire never falter and never fail
 it have be the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your president there have be good day and tough day but every day i have be inspire by the greatness of our country and uplifted by the goodness of our people i have be bless to represent this nation we love and i will always be honor to carry a title that mean more to i than any other citizen of the united states of america
 and so my fellow americans for the final time good night may god bless this house and our next president and may god bless you and our wonderful country thank you

i stand here today humble by the task before we grateful for the trust you have bestow mindful of the sacrifice bear by our ancestor i thank president bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he have show throughout this transition
 forty four americans have now take the presidential oath the word have be speak during rise tide of prosperity and the still water of peace yet every so often the oath be take amidst gather cloud and rage storm at these moment america have carry on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the people have remain faithful to the ideal of our forbearer and true to our found document
 so it have be so it must be with this generation of americans
 that we be in the midst of crisis be now well understand our nation be at war against a far reach network of violence and hatred our economy be badly weaken a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choice and prepare the nation for a new age home have be lose job shed business shutter our health care be too costly our school fail too many and each day bring further evidence that the way we use energy strengthen our adversary and threaten our planet
 these be the indicator of crisis subject to datum and statistic less measurable but no less profound be a sapping of confidence across our land a nagging fear that america 's decline be inevitable and that the next generation must lower its sight
 today i say to you that the challenge we face be real they be serious and they be many they will not be meet easily or in a short span of time but know this america they will be meet
 on this day we gather because we have choose hope over fear unity of purpose over conflict and discord
 on this day we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievance and false promise the recrimination and wear out dogma that for far too long have strangle our politic
 we remain a young nation but in the word of scripture the time have come to set aside childish thing the time have come to reaffirm our endure spirit to choose our well history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea pass on from generation to generation the god give promise that all be equal all be free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness
 in reaffirm the greatness of our nation we understand that greatness be never a given it must be earn our journey have never be one of short cut or settle for less it have not be the path for the faint hearted for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasure of rich and fame rather it have be the risk taker the doer the maker of thing some celebrated but more often man and woman obscure in their labor who have carry we up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom
 for we they pack up their few worldly possession and travel across ocean in search of a new life
 for we they toil in sweatshop and settle the west endure the lash of the whip and plow the hard earth
 for we they fight and die in place like concord and gettysburg normandy and khe sahn
 time and again these man and woman struggle and sacrifice and work till their hand be raw so that we might live a well life they see america as big than the sum of our individual ambition great than all the difference of birth or wealth or faction
 this be the journey we continue today we remain the most prosperous powerful nation on earth our worker be no less productive than when this crisis begin our mind be no less inventive our good and service no less need than they be last week or last month or last year our capacity remain undiminishe but our time of stand pat of protect narrow interest and put off unpleasant decision that time have surely pass start today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remake america
 for everywhere we look there be work to be do the state of the economy call for action bold and swift and we will act not only to create new job but to lay a new foundation for growth we will build the road and bridge the electric grid and digital line that feed our commerce and bind we together we will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology 's wonder to raise health care 's quality and lower its cost we will harness the sun and the wind and the soil to fuel our car and run our factory and we will transform our school and college and university to meet the demand of a new age all this we can do and all this we will do
 now there be some who question the scale of our ambition who suggest that our system can not tolerate too many big plan their memory be short for they have forget what this country have already do what free man and woman can achieve when imagination be join to common purpose and necessity to courage
 what the cynic fail to understand be that the ground have shift beneath they that the stale political argument that have consume we for so long no long apply the question we ask today be not whether our government be too big or too small but whether it work whether it help family find job at a decent wage care they can afford a retirement that be dignify where the answer be yes we intend to move forward where the answer be no program will end and those of we who manage the public 's dollar will be hold to account to spend wisely reform bad habit and do our business in the light of day because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government
 nor be the question before we whether the market be a force for good or ill its power to generate wealth and expand freedom be unmatched but this crisis have remind we that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control and that a nation can not prosper long when it favor only the prosperous the success of our economy have always depend not just on the size of our gross domestic product but on the reach of our prosperity on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart not out of charity but because it be the sure route to our common good
 as for our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideal our founding father face with peril we can scarcely imagine draft a charter to assure the rule of law and the right of man a charter expand by the blood of generation those ideal still light the world and we will not give they up for expedience 's sake and so to all other people and government who be watch today from the grand capital to the small village where my father be bear know that america be a friend of each nation and every man woman and child who seek a future of peace and dignity and that we be ready to lead once more
 recall that early generation face down fascism and communism not just with missile and tank but with sturdy alliance and endure conviction they understand that our power alone can not protect we nor do it entitle we to do as we please instead they know that our power grow through its prudent use our security emanate from the justness of our cause the force of our example the temper quality of humility and restraint
 we be the keeper of this legacy guide by these principle once more we can meet those new threat that demand even great effort even great cooperation and understanding between nation we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and forge a hard earn peace in afghanistan with old friend and former foe we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warm planet we will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense and for those who seek to advance their aim by induce terror and slaughter innocent we say to you now that our spirit be strong and can not be break you can not outlast we and we will defeat you
 for we know that our patchwork heritage be a strength not a weakness we be a nation of christians and muslims jews and hindus and non believer we be shape by every language and culture draw from every end of this earth and because we have taste the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerge from that dark chapter strong and more united we can not help but believe that the old hatred shall someday pass that the line of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grow small our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in usher in a new era of peace
 to the muslim world we seek a new way forward base on mutual interest and mutual respect to those leader around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society 's ill on the west know that your people will judge you on what you can build not what you destroy to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent know that you be on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you be willing to unclench your fist
 to the people of poor nation we pledge to work alongside you to make your farm flourish and let clean water flow to nourish starve body and feed hungry mind and to those nation like our that enjoy relative plenty we say we can no long afford indifference to suffer outside our border nor can we consume the world 's resource without regard to effect for the world have change and we must change with it
 as we consider the road that unfold before we we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who at this very hour patrol far off desert and distant mountain they have something to tell we today just as the fall hero who lie in arlington whisper through the age we honor they not only because they be guardian of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something great than themselves and yet at this moment a moment that will define a generation it be precisely this spirit that must inhabit we all
 for as much as government can do and must do it be ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation rely it be the kindness to take in a stranger when the levee break the selflessness of worker who would rather cut their hour than see a friend lose their job which see we through our dark hour it be the firefighter 's courage to storm a stairway fill with smoke but also a parent 's willingness to nurture a child that finally decide our fate
 our challenge may be new the instrument with which we meet they may be new but those value upon which our success depend hard work and honesty courage and fair play tolerance and curiosity loyalty and patriotism these thing be old these thing be true they have be the quiet force of progress throughout our history what be demand then be a return to these truth what be require of we now be a new era of responsibility a recognition on the part of every american that we have duty to ourselves our nation and the world duty that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly firm in the knowledge that there be nothing so satisfying to the spirit so define of our character than give our all to a difficult task
 this be the price and the promise of citizenship
 this be the source of our confidence the knowledge that god call on we to shape an uncertain destiny
 this be the meaning of our liberty and our creed why man and woman and child of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father less than sixty year ago might not have be serve at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath
 so let we mark this day with remembrance of who we be and how far we have travel in the year of america 's birth in the cold of month a small band of patriot huddle by die campfire on the shore of an icy river the capital be abandon the enemy be advance the snow be stain with blood at a moment when the outcome of our revolution be most in doubt the father of our nation order these word be read to the people
 let it be tell to the future world that in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survive that the city and the country alarm at one common danger come forth to meet it
 america in the face of our common danger in this winter of our hardship let we remember these timeless word with hope and virtue let we brave once more the icy current and endure what storm may come let it be say by our child 's child that when we be test we refuse to let this journey end that we do not turn back nor do we falter and with eye fix on the horizon and god 's grace upon we we carry forth that great gift of freedom and deliver it safely to future generation
 thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america

it be fitting that with the very first bill i sign the lilly ledbetter fair pay restoration act we be uphold one of this nation ’s first principle that we be all create equal and each deserve a chance to pursue our own version of happiness

 it be also fitting that we be join today by the woman after whom this bill be name someone michelle and i have have the privilege of get to know for ourselves lilly ledbetter do not set out to be a trailblazer or a household name she be just a good hard worker who do her job and do it well for nearly two decade before discover that for year she be pay less than her male colleague for the very same work over the course of her career she lose more than $ 200,000 in salary and even more in pension and social security benefit loss she still feel today

 now lilly could have accept her lot and move on she could have decide that it be not worth the hassle and harassment that would inevitably come with speak up for what she deserve but instead she decide that there be a principle at stake something worth fight for so she set out on a journey that would take more than ten year take she all the way to the supreme court and lead to this bill which will help other get the justice she be deny

 because while this bill bear her name lilly know this story be not just about she it ’ the story of woman across this country still earn just 78 cent for every dollar man earn woman of color even less which mean that today in the year 2009 countless woman be still lose thousand of dollar in salary income and retirement saving over the course of a lifetime

 but equal pay be by no mean just a woman ’s issue it ’ a family issue it ’ about parent who find themselves with less money for tuition or child care couple who wind up with less to retire on household where when one breadwinner be pay less than she deserve that ’s the difference between afford the mortgage or not between keep the heat on or pay the doctor ’s bill or not and in this economy when so many folk be already work hard for less and struggle to get by the last thing they can afford be lose part of each month ’s paycheck to simple discrimination

 so in sign this bill today i intend to send a clear message that make our economy work mean make sure it work for everyone that there be no second class citizen in our workplace and that it ’s not just unfair and illegal but bad for business to pay someone less because of their gender age race ethnicity religion or disability and that justice be n’t about some abstract legal theory or footnote in a casebook it ’s about how our law affect the daily reality of people ’s life their ability to make a living and care for their family and achieve their goal

 ultimately though equal pay be not just an economic issue for million of americans and their family it ’ a question of who we be and whether we ’re truly live up to our fundamental ideal whether we ’ll do our part as generation before we to ensure those word put to paper more than 200 year ago really mean something to breathe new life into they with the more enlightened understanding of our time

 that be what lilly ledbetter challenge we to do and today i sign this bill not just in her honor but in honor of those who come before she woman like my grandmother who work in a bank all her life and even after she hit that glass ceiling keep get up and give she good every day without complaint because she want something well for i and my sister

 and i sign this bill for my daughter and all those who will come after we because i want they to grow up in a nation that value their contribution where there be no limit to their dream and they have opportunity their mother and grandmother never could have imagine

 in the end that ’ why lilly stay the course she know it be too late for she that this bill would not undo the year of injustice she face or restore the earning she be deny but this grandmother from alabama keep on fighting because she be think about the next generation it ’ what we ’ve always do in america set our sight high for ourselves but even high for our child and grandchild

 now it ’ up to we to continue this work this bill be an important step a simple fix to ensure fundamental fairness to american worker and i want to thank this remarkable and bi partisan group of legislator who work so hard to get it pass and this be only the beginning i know that if we stay focused as lilly do and keep stand for what ’s right as lilly do we will close that pay gap and ensure that our daughter have the same right the same chance and the same freedom to pursue their dream as our son

 because we know we can not build our economic future on the transportation and information network of the past we be remake the american landscape with the large new investment in our nation 's infrastructure since eisenhower build an interstate highway system in the 1950s   applause   because of this investment nearly 400,000 man and woman will go to work rebuild our crumble road and bridge repair our faulty dam and levee bring critical broadband connection to business and home in nearly every community in america upgrade mass transit build high speed rail line that will improve travel and commerce throughout our nation

 in a place like new york city 14,000 teacher who be set to be let go may now be able to continue pursue their critical mission   it be an investment that will create a new $ 2,500 annual tax credit to put the dream of a college degree within reach for middle class family and make college affordable for 7 million student applause help more of our son and daughter aim higher reach far fulfill their god give potential   applause
 because we know that spiral health care cost be crush family and business alike we be take the most meaningful step in year towards modernize our health care system   it be an investment that will take the long overdue step of computerize america 's medical record to reduce the duplication and waste that cost billion of health care dollar and medical error that cost thousand of life each year
 far thank to the action we have take 7 million americans who lose their health care along the way will continue to get the coverage they need and roughly 20 million more americans can breathe a little easy know that their health care will not be cut due to a state budget shortfall   and a historic commitment to wellness initiative will keep million of americans from set foot in the doctor 's office in the first place because these be preventable disease and we be go to invest in prevention   applause
 so take together with the enactment early this month of a long delay law to extend health care to million more child of work family applause we have do more in 30 day to advance the cause of health care reform than this country have do in an entire decade   and that be something we should be proud of   applause
 because we know we can not power america 's future on energy that be control by foreign dictator we be take big step down the road to energy independence lay the groundwork for new green energy economy that can create countless well pay job   it be an investment that will double the amount of renewable energy produce over the next three year   think about that double the amount of renewable energy in three year   applause   provide tax credit and loan guarantee to company like namaste a company that will be expand instead of lay people off as a result of the plan that i be about to sign
 and in the process we will transform the way we use energy today the electricity we use be carry along a grid of line and wire that date back to thomas edison a grid that can not support the demand of this economy   this mean we be use 19th and 20th century technology to battle 21st century problem like climate change and energy security   it also mean that place like north dakota can that can produce a lot of wind energy can not deliver it to community that want it lead to a gap between how much clean energy we be use and how much we could be use
 the investment we be make today will create a new smart electric grid that will allow for broad use of alternative energy   we will build on the work that be be do in place like boulder a community that be on its that be on pace to be the world 's first smart grid city   applause   this investment will place smart meters in home to make our energy bill low make outage less likely and make it easy to use clean energy   it be an investment that will save taxpayer over $ 1 billion by slash energy cost in our federal building by 25 percent save work family hundred of dollar a year on their energy bill by weatherize over 1 million home   and it be an investment that take the important first step towards a national transmission superhighway that will connect our city to the windy plain of the dakotas and the sunny desert of the southwest
 even beyond energy from the national institutes of health to the national science foundation this recovery act represent the big increase in basic research funding in the long history of america 's noble endeavor to well understand our world   and just as president kennedy spark an explosion of innovation when he set america 's sight on the moon i hope this investment will ignite our imagination once more spur new discovery and breakthrough in science in medicine in energy to make our economy strong and our nation more secure and our planet safe for our child
 now while this package be compose mostly of critical investment it also include aid to state and local government to prevent layoff of firefighter or police recruit in applause recruit like the one in columbus ohio who be tell that instead of be swear in as officer they be about to be let go   it include help for those hard hit by our economic crisis like the nearly 18 million americans who will get large unemployment check in the mail   about a third of this package come in the form of tax cut by the way the most progressive in our history applause not only spur job creation but put money in the pocket of 95 percent of hardworke family in america   applause   so unlike the tax cut that we have see in recent year the vast majority of these tax benefit will go not to the wealthy americans but to the middle class applause with those worker who make the least benefit the most
 and it be a plan that reward responsibility lift two million americans from poverty by ensure that anyone who work hard do not have to raise a child below the poverty line   so as a whole this plan will help poor and work americans pull themselves into the middle class in a way we have not see in nearly 50 year
 what i be sign then be a balanced plan with a mix of tax cut and investment   it be a plan that be be put together without earmark or the usual pork barrel spending   it be a plan that will be implement with an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability
 with a recovery package of this size come a responsibility to assure every taxpayer that we be be careful with the money they work so hard to earn   and that be why i be assign a team of manager to ensure that the precious dollar we have invest be be spend wisely and well   we will applause governor ritter mayor hickenlooper we be go to hold governor and local official who receive the money to the same high standard   and we expect you the american people to hold we accountable for the result   and that be why we have create recovery.gov a web site so that every american can go online and see how this money be be spend and what kind of job be be create where those job be be create   we want transparency and accountability throughout this process   applause
 now as important as the step we take today be this legislation represent only the first part of the broad strategy we need to address our economic crisis   in the come day and week i will be launch other aspect of the plan   we will need to stabilize repair and reform our banking system and get credit flow again to family and business   we will need to end the culture where we ignore problem until they become full blow crisis instead of recognize that the only way to build a thrive economy be to set and enforce firm rule of the road
 we must stem the spread of foreclosure and fall home value for all americans and do everything we can to help responsible homeowner stay in their home something i will talk more about tomorrow   and we will need to do everything in the short term to get our economy move again while at the same time recognize that we have inherit a trillion dollar deficit and we need to begin restore fiscal discipline and tame our explode deficit over the long term
 none of this will be easy   the road to recovery will not be straight   we will make progress and there may be some slippage along the way   it will demand courage and discipline   it will demand a new sense of responsibility that be be miss from wall street all the way to washington   there will be hazard and reverse   but i have every confidence that if we be willing to continue do the critical work that must be do by each of we by all of we then we will leave this struggle economy behind we and come out on the other side more prosperous as a people
 for our american story be not and have never be about thing come easy   it be about rise to the moment when the moment be hard and convert crisis into opportunity and see to it that we emerge from whatever trial we face strong than we be before   it be about reject the notion that our fate be somehow write for we and instead lay claim to a destiny of our own making   that be what early generation of americans have do that be what we owe our child that be what we be do today
 thank you colorado   let us get to work   thank you


madam speaker mr. vice president members of congress the first lady of the united states she be around here somewhere
 i have come here tonight not only to address the distinguished man and woman in this great chamber but to speak frankly and directly to the man and woman who send we here
 i know that for many americans watch right now the state of our economy be a concern that rise above all other and rightly so if you have not be personally affect by this recession you probably know someone who have a friend a neighbor a member of your family you do not need to hear another list of statistic to know that our economy be in crisis because you live it every day it be the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless night it be the job you think you would retire from but now have lose the business you build your dream upon that be now hang by a thread the college acceptance letter your child have to put back in the envelope the impact of this recession be real and it be everywhere
 but while our economy may be weaken and our confidence shaken though we be live through difficult and uncertain time tonight i want every american to know this we will rebuild we will recover and the united states of america will emerge strong than before
 the weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation the answer to our problem do not lie beyond our reach they exist in our laboratory and our university in our field and our factory in the imagination of our entrepreneur and the pride of the hard work people on earth those quality that have make america the great force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure what be require now be for this country to pull together confront boldly the challenge we face and take responsibility for our future once more
 now if we be honest with ourselves we will admit that for too long we have not always meet these responsibility as a government or as a people i say this not to lay blame or to look backwards but because it be only by understand how we arrive at this moment that we will be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament
 the fact be our economy do not fall into decline overnight nor do all of our problem begin when the housing market collapse or the stock market sink we have know for decade that our survival depend on find new source of energy yet we import more oil today than ever before the cost of health care eat up more and more of our saving each year yet we keep delay reform our child will compete for job in a global economy that too many of our school do not prepare they for and though all these challenge go unsolved we still manage to spend more money and pile up more debt both as individual and through our government than ever before
 in other word we have live through an era where too often short term gain be prize over long term prosperity where we fail to look beyond the next payment the next quarter or the next election a surplus become an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future regulation be gutte for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market people buy home they know they could not afford from bank and lender who push those bad loan anyway and all the while critical debate and difficult decision be put off for some other time on some other day well that day of reckoning have arrive and the time to take charge of our future be here
 now be the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this economy but to build a new foundation for last prosperity now be the time to jumpstart job creation restart lending and invest in area like energy health care and education that will grow our economy even as we make hard choice to bring our deficit down that be what my economic agenda be design to do and that be what i would like to talk to you about tonight it be an agenda that begin with job
 as soon as i take office i ask this congress to send i a recovery plan by president 's day that would put people back to work and put money in their pocket not because i believe in big government i don't not because i be not mindful of the massive debt we have inherit i be i call for action because the failure to do so would have cost more job and cause more hardship in fact a failure to act would have worsen our long term deficit by assure weak economic growth for year and that be why i push for quick action and tonight i be grateful that this congress deliver and please to say that the american recovery and reinvestment act be now law
 over the next 2 year this plan will save or create 3.5 million job more than 90 percent of these job will be in the private sector job rebuild our road and bridge construct wind turbine and solar panel lay broadband and expand mass transit
 because of this plan there be teacher who can now keep their job and educate our kid health care professional can continue care for our sick there be 57 police officer who be still on the street of minneapolis tonight because this plan prevent the layoff their department be about to make because of this plan 95 percent of working household in america will receive a tax cut a tax cut that you will see in your paycheck begin on april 1st because of this plan family who be struggle to pay tuition cost will receive a $ 2,500 tax credit for all 4 year of college and americans who have lose their job in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefit and continued health care coverage to help they weather this storm
 now i know there be some in this chamber and watch at home who be skeptical of whether this plan will work and i understand that skepticism here in washington we have all see how quickly good intention can turn into broken promise and wasteful spending and with a plan of this scale come enormous responsibility to get it right
 and that be why i have ask vice president biden to lead a tough unprecedented oversight effort because nobody mess with joe i be i right they do not mess with he i have tell each of my cabinet as well as mayor and governors across the country that they will be hold accountable by i and the american people for every dollar they spend i have appoint a proven and aggressive inspector general to ferret out any and all case of waste and fraud and we have create a new web site call recovery.gov so that every american can find out how and where their money be be spend
 so the recovery plan we pass be the first step in get our economy back on track but it be just the first step because even if we manage this plan flawlessly there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that have severely weaken our financial system
 i want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight because every american should know that it directly affect you and your family 's well being you should also know that the money you have deposit in bank across the country be safe your insurance be secure you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system that be not the source of concern the concern be that if we do not restart lending in this country our recovery will be choke off before it even begin
 you see the flow of credit be the lifeblood of our economy the ability to get a loan be how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education how store stock their shelf farm buy equipment and business make payroll
 but credit have stop flow the way it should too many bad loan from the housing crisis have make their way onto the book of too many bank and with so much debt and so little confidence these bank be now fearful of lend out any more money to household to business or even to each other and when there be no lending family can not afford to buy home or car so business be force to make layoff our economy suffer even more and credit dry up even far that be why this administration be move swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle to restore confidence and restart lending and we will do so in several way
 first we be create a new lending fund that represent the large effort ever to help provide auto loan college loan and small business loan to the consumer and entrepreneur who keep this economy run
 second we have launch a housing plan that will help responsible family face the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payment and refinance their mortgage it be a plan that will not help speculator or that neighbor down the street who buy a house he could never hope to afford but it will help million of americans who be struggle with decline home value americans who will now be able to take advantage of the low interest rate that this plan have already help to bring about in fact the average family who refinance today can save nearly $ 2,000 per year on their mortgage
 third we will act with the full force of the federal government to ensure that the major bank that americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult time and when we learn that a major bank have serious problem we will hold accountable those responsible force the necessary adjustment provide the support to clean up their balance sheet and assure the continuity of a strong viable institution that can serve our people and our economy
 now i understand that on any give day wall street may be more comfort by an approach that give bank bailout with no string attach and that hold nobody accountable for their reckless decision but such an approach will not solve the problem and our goal be to quicken the day when we restart lend to the american people and american business and end this crisis once and for all
 and i intend to hold these bank fully accountable for the assistance they receive and this time they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollar result in more lending for the american taxpayer this time ceo will not be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paycheck or buy fancy drape or disappear on a private jet those day be over
 still this plan will require significant resource from the federal government and yes probably more than we have already set aside but while the cost of action will be great i can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far great for it could result in an economy that sputter along for not month or year but perhaps a decade that would be bad for our deficit bad for business bad for you and bad for the next generation and i refuse to let that happen
 now i understand that when the last administration ask this congress to provide assistance for struggle bank democrats and republicans alike be infuriate by the mismanagement and the result that follow so be the american taxpayer so be i. so i know how unpopular it be to be see as help bank right now especially when everyone be suffer in part from their bad decision i promise you i get it
 but i also know that in a time of crisis we can not afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politic of the moment my job our job be to solve the problem our job be to govern with a sense of responsibility i will not send i will not spend a single penny for the purpose of reward a single wall street executive but i will do whatever it take to help the small business that can not pay its worker or the family that have save and still can not get a mortgage that be what this be about it be not about help bank it be about help people—[applause
 it be not about help bank it be about help people because when credit be available again that young family can finally buy a new home and then some company will hire worker to build it and then those worker will have money to spend and if they can get a loan too maybe they will finally buy that car or open their own business investor will return to the market and american family will see their retirement secure once more slowly but surely confidence will return and our economy will recover
 so i ask this congress to join i in do whatever prove necessary because we can not consign our nation to an open ended recession and to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happen again i ask congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system it be time to put in place tough new commonsense rule of the road so that our financial market reward drive and innovation and punish shortcut and abuse
 the recovery plan and the financial stability plan be the immediate step we be take to revive our economy in the short term but the only way to fully restore america 's economic strength be to make the long term investment that will lead to new job new industry and a renew ability to compete with the rest of the world the only way this century will be another american century be if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care the school that be not prepare our child and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit that be our responsibility
 in the next few day i will submit a budget to congress so often we have come to view these document as simply number on a page or a laundry list of program i see this document differently i see it as a vision for america as a blueprint for our future
 my budget do not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue it reflect the stark reality of what we have inherit a trillion dollar deficit a financial crisis and a costly recession give these reality everyone in this chamber democrats and republicans will have to sacrifice some worthy priority for which there be no dollar and that include i but that do not mean we can afford to ignore our long term challenge i reject the view that say our problem will simply take care of themselves that say government have no role in lay the foundation for our common prosperity
 for history tell a different story history remind we that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation this nation have respond with bold action and big idea in the midst of civil war we lay railroad track from one coast to another that spur commerce and industry from the turmoil of the industrial revolution come a system of public high school that prepare our citizen for a new age in the wake of war and depression the gi bill send a generation to college and create the large middle class in history and a twilight struggle for freedom lead to a nation of highway an american on the moon and an explosion of technology that still shape our world in each case government do not supplant private enterprise it catalyze private enterprise it create the condition for thousand of entrepreneur and new business to adapt and to thrive
 we be a nation that have see promise amid peril and claim opportunity from ordeal now we must be that nation again and that be why even as it cut back on program we do not need the budget i submit will invest in the three area that be absolutely critical to our economic future energy health care and education
 it begin with energy we know the country that harness the power of clean renewable energy will lead the 21st century and yet it be china that have launch the large effort in history to make their economy energy efficient we invent solar technology but we have fall behind country like germany and japan in produce it new plug in hybrid roll off our assembly line but they will run on battery make in korea well i do not accept a future where the job and industry of tomorrow take root beyond our border and i know you do not either it be time for america to lead again
 thank to our recovery plan we will double this nation 's supply of renewable energy in the next 3 year we have also make the large investment in basic research funding in american history an investment that will spur not only new discovery in energy but breakthrough in medicine and science and technology
 we will soon lay down thousand of mile of power line that can carry new energy to city and town across this country and we will put americans to work make our home and building more efficient so that we can save billion of dollar on our energy bill
 but to truly transform our economy to protect our security and save our planet from the ravage of climate change we need to ultimately make clean renewable energy the profitable kind of energy so i ask this congress to send i legislation that place a market base cap on carbon pollution and drive the production of more renewable energy in america that be what we need and to support that innovation we will invest $ 15 billion a year to develop technology like wind power and solar power advanced biofuel clean coal and more efficient car and truck build right here in america
 speak of our auto industry everyone recognize that year of bad decisionmaking and a global recession have push our automaker to the brink we should not and will not protect they from their own bad practice but we be commit to the goal of a retool reimagine auto industry that can compete and win million of job depend on it score of community depend on it and i believe the nation that invent the automobile can not walk away from it
 now none of this will come without cost nor will it be easy but this be america we do not do what be easy we do what be necessary to move this country forward
 and for that same reason we must also address the crush cost of health care this be a cost that now cause a bankruptcy in america every 30 second by the end of the year it could cause 1.5 million americans to lose their home in the last 8 year premium have grow four time fast than wage and in each of these year 1 million more americans have lose their health insurance it be one of the major reason why small business close their door and corporation ship job overseas and it be one of the large and fast grow part of our budget give these fact we can no long afford to put health care reform on hold we can not afford to do it it be time
 already we have do more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last 30 day than we have do in the last decade when it be day old this congress pass a law to provide and protect health insurance for 11 million american child whose parent work full time our recovery plan will invest in electronic health record a new technology that will reduce error bring down cost ensure privacy and save life it will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that have touch the life of nearly every american include i by seek a cure for cancer in our time and it make the large investment ever in preventive care because that be one of the good way to keep our people healthy and our cost under control
 this budget build on these reform it include a historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform a down payment on the principle that we must have quality affordable health care for every american it be a commitment that be pay for in part by efficiency in our system that be long overdue and it be a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the year to come
 now there will be many different opinion and idea about how to achieve reform and that be why i be bring together business and worker doctor and health care provider democrats and republicans to begin work on this issue next week
 i suffer no illusion that this will be an easy process once again it will be hard but i also know that nearly a century after teddy roosevelt first call for reform the cost of our health care have weigh down our economy and our conscience long enough so let there be no doubt health care reform can not wait it must not wait and it will not wait another year
 the third challenge we must address be the urgent need to expand the promise of education in america in a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell be your knowledge a good education be no long just a pathway to opportunity it be a prerequisite right now three quarter of the fast grow occupation require more than a high school diploma and yet just over half of our citizen have that level of education we have one of the high high school dropout rate of any industrialized nation and half of the student who begin college never finish
 this be a prescription for economic decline because we know the country that out teach we today will out compete we tomorrow that be why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child have access to a complete and competitive education from the day they be bear to the day they begin a career that be a promise we have to make to the child of america
 already we have make historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan we have dramatically expand early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality because we know that the most formative learning come in those first year of life we have make college affordable for nearly 7 million more students—7 million and we have provide the resource necessary to prevent painful cut and teacher layoff that would set back our child 's progress
 but we know that our school do not just need more resource they need more reform and that be why this budget create new teacher new incentive for teacher performance pathway for advancement and reward for success we will invest in innovative program that be already help school meet high standard and close achievement gap and we will expand our commitment to charter school
 it be our responsibility as lawmaker and as educator to make this system work but it be the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it so tonight i ask every american to commit to at least 1 year or more of high education or career training this can be community college or a 4 year school vocational training or an apprenticeship but whatever the training may be every american will need to get more than a high school diploma
 and drop out of high school be no long an option it be not just quit on yourself it be quit on your country and this country need and value the talent of every american that be why we will support we will provide the support necessary for all young americans to complete college and meet a new goal by 2020 america will once again have the high proportion of college graduate in the world that be a goal we can meet that be a goal we can meet
 now i know that the price of tuition be high than ever which be why if you be willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country we will make sure that you can afford a high education and to encourage a renew spirit of national service for this and future generation i ask congress to send i the bipartisan legislation that bear the name of senator orrin hatch as well as an american who have never stop ask what he can do for his country senator edward kennedy
 these education policy will open the door of opportunity for our child but it be up to we to ensure they walk through they in the end there be no program or policy that can substitute for a parent for a mother or father who will attend those parent teacher conference or help with homework or turn off the tv put away the video game read to their child i speak to you not just as a president but as a father when i say that responsibility for our child 's education must begin at home that be not a democratic issue or a republican issue that be an american issue
 there be of course another responsibility we have to our child and that be the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to they a debt they can not pay that be critical applause i agree absolutely see i know we can get some consensus in here laughter with the deficit we inherit the cost of the crisis we face and the long term challenge we must meet it have never be more important to ensure that as our economy recover we do what it take to bring this deficit down that be critical
 now i be proud that we pass a recovery plan free of earmark and i want to pass a budget next year that ensure that each dollar we spend reflect only our most important national priority
 and yesterday i hold a fiscal summit where i pledge to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office my administration have also begin to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective program as you can imagine this be a process that will take some time but we have already identify $ 2 trillion in saving over the next decade
 in this budget we will end education program that do not work and end direct payment to large agribusiness that do not need they we will eliminate the no bid contract that have waste billion in iraq and reform our defense budget so that we be not pay for cold war era weapon system we do not use we will root out the waste and fraud and abuse in our medicare program that do not make our senior any healthier we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally end the tax break for corporation that ship our job overseas
 in order to save our child from a future of debt we will also end the tax break for the wealthy 2 percent of americans now let i be clear let i be absolutely clear because i know you will end up hear some of the same claim that roll back these tax break mean a massive tax increase on the american people if your family earn less than $ 250,000 a year a quarter million dollar a year you will not see your taxis increase a single dime i repeat not one single dime in fact not a dime in fact the recovery plan provide a tax cut that be right a tax cut for 95 percent of work family and by the way these check be on the way
 now to preserve our long term fiscal health we must also address the grow cost in medicare and social security comprehensive health care reform be the good way to strengthen medicare for year to come and we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for social security while create tax free universal saving account for all americans

 to relieve the strain on our force my budget increase the number of our soldier and marine and to keep our sacred trust with those who serve we will raise their pay and give our veteran the expand health care and benefit that they have earn
 to overcome extremism we must also be vigilant in uphold the value our troop defend because there be no force in the world more powerful than the example of america and that be why i have order the closing of the detention center at guantanamo bay and will seek swift and certain justice for capture terrorist because live our value do not make we weak it make we safe and it make we strong and that be why i can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the united states of america do not torture we can make that commitment here tonight

 i know that it be easy to lose sight of this truth to become cynical and doubtful consume with the petty and the trivial but in my life i have also learn that hope be find in unlikely place that inspiration often come not from those with the most power or celebrity but from the dream and aspiration of ordinary americans who be anything but ordinary
 i think of leonard abess a bank president from miami who reportedly cash out of his company take a $ 60 million bonus and give it out to all 399 people who work for he plus another 72 who use to work for he he do not tell anyone but when the local newspaper find out he simply say i know some of these people since i be 7 year old it do not feel right get the money myself
 i think about greensburg kansas a town that be completely destroy by a tornado but be be rebuild by its resident as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community how it can bring job and business to a place where pile of brick and rubble once lie the tragedy be terrible say one of the man who help they rebuild but the folk here know that it also provide an incredible opportunity
 i think about ty'sheoma bethea the young girl from that school i visit in dillon south carolina a place where the ceiling leak the paint peel off the wall and they have to stop teach six time a day because the train barrel by their classroom she have be tell that her school be hopeless but the other day after class she go to the public library and type up a letter to the people sit in this chamber she even ask her principal for the money to buy a stamp the letter ask we for help and say we be just student try to become lawyer doctor congressman like yourself and one day president so we can make a change to not just the state of south carolina but also the world we be not quitter that be what she say we be not quitter
 these word and these story tell we something about the spirit of the people who send we here they tell we that even in the most try time amid the most difficult circumstance there be a generosity a resilience a decency and a determination that persevere a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity their resolve must be our inspiration their concern must be our cause and we must show they and all our people that we be equal to the task before we
 i know look i know that we have not agree on every issue thus far laughter there be surely time in the future where we will part way but i also know that every american who be sit here tonight love this country and want it to succeed i know that that must be the starting point for every debate we have in the come month and where we return after those debate be do that be the foundation on which the american people expect we to build common ground
 and if we do if we come together and lift this nation from the depth of this crisis if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity if we confront without fear the challenge of our time and summon that endure spirit of an america that do not quit then someday year from now our child can tell their child that this be the time when we perform in the word that be carve into this very chamber something worthy to be remember
 thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america thank you

thank you   well i be excited too   laughter
 of the many responsibility grant to a president by our constitution few be more serious or more consequential than select a supreme court justice   the member of our high court be grant life tenure often serve long after the president who appoint they   and they be charge with the vital task of apply principle put to paper more than 20 sic century ago to some of the most difficult question of our time
 so i do not take this decision lightly   i have make it only after deep reflection and careful deliberation   while there be many quality that i admire in judge across the spectrum of judicial philosophy and that i seek in my own nominee there be few that stand out that i just want to mention
 first and foremost be a rigorous intellect a mastery of the law an ability to hone in on the key issue and provide clear answer to complex legal question   second be a recognition of the limit of the judicial role an understanding that a judge 's job be to interpret not make law to approach decision without any particular ideology or agenda but rather a commitment to impartial justice a respect for precedent and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the fact at hand
 these two quality be essential i believe for anyone who would sit on our nation 's high court   and yet these quality alone be insufficient   we need something more   for as supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes once say the life of the law have not be logic it have be experience   experience be test by obstacle and barrier by hardship and misfortune experience insist persist and ultimately overcome those barrier   it be experience that can give a person a common touch and a sense of compassion an understanding of how the world work and how ordinary people live   and that be why it be a necessary ingredient in the kind of justice we need on the supreme court
 the process of review and select a successor to justice souter have be rigorous and comprehensive not least because of the standard that justice souter himself have set with his formidable intellect and fair mindedness and decency   i have seek the advice of member of congress on both side of the aisle include every member of the senate judiciary committee my team have reach out to constitutional scholar advocacy organization and bar association represent an array of interest and opinion   and i want to thank member of my staff and administration who have work so hard and give so much of their time as part of this effort
 after complete this exhaustive process i have decide to nominate an inspire woman who i believe will make a great justice   judge sonia sotomayor of the great state of new york   applause
 over a distinguished career that span three decade judge sotomayor have work at almost every level of our judicial system provide she with a depth of experience and a breadth of perspective that will be invaluable as a supreme court justice
 it be a measure of her quality and her qualification that judge sotomayor be nominate to the u.s. district court by a republican president george h.w. bush and promote to the federal court of appeals by a democrat bill clinton   walk in the door she would bring more experience on the bench and more varied experience on the bench than anyone currently serve on the united states supreme court have when they be appoint

  judge sotomayor be a distinguished graduate of two of america 's lead university   she be be a big city prosecutor and a corporate litigator   she spend six year as a trial judge on the u.s. district court and would replace justice souter as the only justice with experience as a trial judge a perspective that would enrich the judgment of the court
 for the past 11 year she have be a judge on the court of appeals for the second circuit of new york one of the most demanding circuit in the country   there she have hand down decision on a range of constitutional and legal question that be notable for their careful reasoning earn the respect of colleague on the bench the admiration of many lawyer who argue case in her court and the adoration of her clerk who look to she as a mentor
 during her tenure on the district court she preside over roughly 450 case   one case in particular involve a matter of enormous concern to many americans include i   the baseball strike of 1994 1995   laughter   in a decision that reportedly take she just 15 minute to announce a swiftness much appreciate by baseball fan everywhere laughter she issue an injunction that help end the strike   some say that judge sotomayor save baseball   applause
 judge sotomayor come to the district court from a law firm where she be a partner focus on complex commercial litigation gain insight into the working of a global economy   before that she be a prosecutor in the manhattan da 's office serve under the legendary robert morgenthau an early mentor of sonia 's who still sing her praise today   there sonia learn what crime can do to a family and a community and what it take to fight it   it be a career that have give she not only a sweeping overview of the american judicial system but a practical understanding of how the law work in the everyday life of the american people
 but as impressive and meaningful as judge sotomayor 's sterling credential in the law be her own extraordinary journey bear in the south bronx she be raise in a housing project not far from yankee stadium make she a lifelong yankee 's fan   i hope this will not disqualify she laughter in the eye of the new englanders in the senate   laughter
 sonia 's parent come to new york from puerto rico during the second world war her mother as part of the women 's army corps   and in fact her mother be here today and i would like we all to acknowledge sonia 's mom   applause   sonia 's mom have be a little choke up   laughter   but she sonia 's mother begin a family tradition of give back to this country   sonia 's father be a factory worker with a 3rd grade education who do not speak english   but like sonia 's mother he have a willingness to work hard a strong sense of family and a belief in the american dream
 when sonia be nine her father pass away   and her mother work six day a week as a nurse to provide for sonia and her brother who be also here today be a doctor and a terrific success in his own right   but sonia 's mom buy the only set of encyclopedia in the neighborhood send her child to a catholic school call cardinal spellman out of the belief that with a good education here in america all thing be possible
 with the support of family friend and teacher sonia earn scholarship to princeton where she graduate at the top of her class and yale law school where she be an editor of the yale law journal step onto the path that lead she here today
 along the way she be face down barrier overcome the odd live out the american dream that bring her parent here so long ago   and even as she have accomplish so much in her life she have never forget where she begin never lose touch with the community that support she
 what sonia will bring to the court then be not only the knowledge and experience acquire over a course of a brilliant legal career but the wisdom accumulate from an inspire life 's journey
 it be my understanding that judge sotomayor 's interest in the law be spark as a young girl by read the nancy drew series laughter and that when she be diagnose with diabete at the age of eight she be inform that people with diabete can not grow up to be police officer or private investigator like nancy drew   and that be when she be tell she would have to scale back her dream
 well sonia what you have show in your life be that it do not matter where you come from what you look like or what challenge life throw your way no dream be beyond reach in the united states of america
 and when sonia sotomayor ascend those marble step to assume her seat on the high court of the land america will have take another important step towards realize the ideal that be etch above its entrance   equal justice under the law
 i hope the senate act in a bipartisan fashion as it have in confirm judge sotomayor twice before and as swiftly as possible so that she can take her seat on the court in september and participate in deliberation as the court choose which case it will hear this coming year
 and with that i would like all of you to give a warm greeting as i invite judge sotomayor to say a few word   applause


thank you so much good afternoon i be honor to be in the timeless city of cairo and to be host by two remarkable institution for over a thousand year al azhar have stand as a beacon of islamic learning and for over a century cairo university have be a source of egypt 's advancement and together you represent the harmony between tradition and progress i be grateful for your hospitality and the hospitality of the people of egypt and i be also proud to carry with i the good will of the american people and a greeting of peace from muslim community in my country as salaamu alaykum

 we meet at a time of great tension between the united states and muslims around the world tension root in historical force that go beyond any current policy debate the relationship between islam and the west include century of coexistence and cooperation but also conflict and religious war more recently tension have be feed by colonialism that deny right and opportunity to many muslims and a cold war in which muslim majority country be too often treat as proxy without regard to their own aspiration moreover the sweeping change bring by modernity and globalization lead many muslims to view the west as hostile to the tradition of islam

 violent extremist have exploit these tension in a small but potent minority of muslims the attack of september 11 2001 and the continue effort of these extremist to engage in violence against civilian have lead some in my country to view islam as inevitably hostile not only to america and western country but also to human right all this have breed more fear and more mistrust

 so long as our relationship be define by our difference we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity and this cycle of suspicion and discord must end

 i have come here to cairo to seek a new beginning between the united states and muslims around the world one base on mutual interest and mutual respect and one base upon the truth that america and islam be not exclusive and need not be in competition instead they overlap and share common principle principle of justice and progress tolerance and the dignity of all human being

 i do so recognize that change can not happen overnight i know there be be a lot of publicity about this speech but no single speech can eradicate year of mistrust nor can i answer in the time that i have this afternoon all the complex question that bring we to this point but i be convince that in order to move forward we must say openly to each other the thing we hold in our heart and that too often be say only behind close door there must be a sustained effort to listen to each other to learn from each other to respect one another and to seek common ground as the holy koran tell we be conscious of god and speak always the truth that be what i will try to do today to speak the truth as good i can humble by the task before we and firm in my belief that the interest we share as human being be far more powerful than the force that drive we apart

 now part of this conviction be root in my own experience i be a christian but my father come from a kenyan family that include generation of muslims as a boy i spend several year in indonesia and hear the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk as a young man i work in chicago community where many find dignity and peace in their muslim faith as a student of history i also know civilization 's debt to islam

 it be islam at place like al azhar that carry the light of learn through so many century pave the way for europe 's renaissance and enlightenment it be innovation in muslim community that develop the order of algebra our magnetic compass and tool of navigation our mastery of pen and printing our understanding of how disease spread and how it can be heal islamic culture have give we majestic arch and soar spire timeless poetry and cherished music elegant calligraphy and place of peaceful contemplation and throughout history islam have demonstrate through word and deed the possibility of religious tolerance and racial equality

 i also know that islam have always be a part of america 's story the first nation to recognize my country be morocco in sign the treaty of tripoli in 1796 our second president john adams write the united states have in itself no character of enmity against the law religion or tranquillity of muslims and since our founding american muslims have enrich the united states they have fight in our war they have serve in our government they have stand for civil right they have start business they have teach at our university they have excel in our sport arena they have win nobel prizes build our tall building and light the olympic torch and when the first muslim american be recently elect to congress he take the oath to defend our constitution use the same holy koran that one of our founding fathers thomas jefferson keep in his personal library

 so i have know islam on three continent before come to the region where it be first reveal that experience guide my conviction that partnership between america and islam must be base on what islam be not what it be not and i consider it part of my responsibility as president of the united states to fight against negative stereotype of islam wherever they appear

 but that same principle must apply to muslim perception of america just as muslims do not fit a crude stereotype america be not the crude stereotype of a self interested empire the united states have be one of the great source of progress that the world have ever know we be bear out of revolution against an empire we be found upon the ideal that all be create equal and we have shed blood and struggle for century to give meaning to those word within our border and around the world we be shape by every culture draw from every end of the earth and dedicate to a simple concept e pluribu unum—"out of many one

 now much have be make of the fact that an african american with the name barack hussein obama could be elect president but my personal story be not so unique the dream of opportunity for all people have not come true for everyone in america but its promise exist for all who come to our shore and that include nearly 7 million american muslims in our country today who by the way enjoy income and educational level that be high than the american average

 moreover freedom in america be indivisible from the freedom to practice one 's religion that be why there be a mosque in every state in our union and over 1,200 mosque within our border that be why the united states government have go to court to protect the right of woman and girl to wear the hijab and to punish those who would deny it

 so let there be no doubt islam be a part of america and i believe that america hold within she the truth that regardless of race religion or station in life all of we share common aspiration to live in peace and security to get an education and to work with dignity to love our family our community and our god these thing we share this be the hope of all humanity

 of course recognize our common humanity be only the beginning of our task word alone can not meet the need of our people these need will be meet only if we act boldly in the year ahead and if we understand that the challenge we face be share and our failure to meet they will hurt we all for we have learn from recent experience that when a financial system weaken in one country prosperity be hurt everywhere when a new flu infect one human being all be at risk when one nation pursue a nuclear weapon the risk of nuclear attack rise for all nation when violent extremist operate in one stretch of mountain people be endanger across an ocean when innocent in bosnia and darfur be slaughter that be a stain on our collective conscience that be what it mean to share this world in the 21st century that be the responsibility we have to one another as human being

 and this be a difficult responsibility to embrace for human history have often be a record of nation and tribe and yes religion subjugate one another in pursuit of their own interest yet in this new age such attitude be self defeating give our interdependence any world order that elevate one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail so whatever we think of the past we must not be prisoner to it our problem must be deal with through partnership our progress must be share

 now that do not mean we should ignore source of tension indeed it suggest the opposite we must face these tension squarely and so in that spirit let i speak as clearly and as plainly as i can about some specific issue that i believe we must finally confront together

 the first issue that we have to confront be violent extremism in all of its form in ankara i make clear that america be not and never will be at war with islam we will however relentlessly confront violent extremist who pose a grave threat to our security because we reject the same thing that people of all faith reject the killing of innocent man woman and child and it be my first duty as president to protect the american people

 the situation in afghanistan demonstrate america 's goal and our need to work together over 7 year ago the united states pursue al qaida and the taliban with broad international support we do not go by choice we go because of necessity i be aware that there be still some who would question or even justify the event of 9/11 but let we be clear al qaida kill nearly 3,000 people on that day the victim be innocent man woman and child from america and many other nation who have do nothing to harm anybody and yet al qaida choose to ruthlessly murder these people claim credit for the attack and even now state their determination to kill on a massive scale they have affiliate in many country and be try to expand their reach these be not opinion to be debate these be fact to be deal with

 make no mistake we do not want to keep our troop in afghanistan we see no we seek no military basis there it be agonize for america to lose our young man and woman it be costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict we would gladly bring every single one of our troop home if we could be confident that there be not violent extremist in afghanistan and now pakistan determine to kill as many americans as they possibly can but that be not yet the case

 and that be why we be partner with a coalition of 46 country and despite the cost involve america 's commitment will not weaken indeed none of we should tolerate these extremist they have kill in many country they have kill people of different faith but more than any other they have kill muslims their action be irreconcilable with the right of human being the progress of nation and with islam the holy koran teach that whoever kill an innocent be as—"it be as if he have kill all mankind and the holy koran also say whoever save a person it be as if he have save all mankind the endure faith of over a billion people be so much big than the narrow hatred of a few islam be not part of the problem in combat violent extremism it be an important part of promote peace

 now we also know that military power alone be not go to solve the problem in afghanistan and pakistan that be why we plan to invest $ 1.5 billion each year over the next 5 year to partner with pakistanis to build school and hospital road and business and hundred of million to help those who have be displace that be why we be provide more than $ 2.8 billion to help afghans develop their economy and deliver service that people depend on

 let i also address the issue of iraq unlike afghanistan iraq be a war of choice that provoke strong difference in my country and around the world although i believe that the iraqi people be ultimately well off without the tyranny of saddam hussein i also believe that event in iraq have remind america of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problem whenever possible indeed we can recall the word of thomas jefferson who say i hope that our wisdom will grow with our power and teach we that the less we use our power the great it will be

 today america have a dual responsibility to help iraq forge a well future and to leave iraq to iraqis and i have make it clear to the iraqi people that we pursue no basis and no claim on their territory or resource iraq 's sovereignty be its own and that be why i order the removal of our combat brigade by next august that be why we will honor our agreement with iraq 's democratically elect government to remove combat troop from iraqi city by july and to remove all of our troop from iraq by 2012 we will help iraq train its security force and develop its economy but we will support a secure and united iraq as a partner and never as a patron

 and finally just as america can never tolerate violence by extremist we must never alter or forget our principle nine eleven be an enormous trauma to our country the fear and anger that it provoke be understandable but in some case it lead we to act contrary to our tradition and our ideal we be take concrete action to change course i have unequivocally prohibit the use of torture by the united states and i have order the prison at guantanamo bay close by early next year

 so america will defend itself respectful of the sovereignty of nation and the rule of law and we will do so in partnership with muslim community which be also threaten the soon the extremist be isolate and unwelcome in muslim community the soon we will all be safe

 the second major source of tension that we need to discuss be the situation between israelis palestinians and the arab world america 's strong bond with israel be well know this bond be unbreakable it be base upon cultural and historical tie and the recognition that the aspiration for a jewish homeland be root in a tragic history that can not be deny

 around the world the jewish people be persecute for century and anti semitism in europe culminate in an unprecedented holocaust tomorrow i will visit buchenwald which be part of a network of camp where jews be enslave torture shot and gas to death by the third reich six million jews be kill more than the entire jewish population of israel today deny that fact be baseless it be ignorant and it be hateful threaten israel with destruction or repeat vile stereotype about jews be deeply wrong and only serve to evoke in the mind of israelis this most painful of memory while prevent the peace that the people of this region deserve

 on the other hand it be also undeniable that the palestinian people muslims and christians have suffer in pursuit of a homeland for more than 60 year they have endure the pain of dislocation many wait in refugee camp in the west bank gaza and neighboring land for a life of peace and security that they have never be able to lead they endure the daily humiliation large and small that come with occupation so let there be no doubt the situation for the palestinian people be intolerable and america will not turn our back on the legitimate palestinian aspiration for dignity opportunity and a state of their own

 for decade then there have be a stalemate two people with legitimate aspiration each with a painful history that make compromise elusive it be easy to point finger for palestinians to point to the displacement bring about by israel 's founding and for israelis to point to the constant hostility and attack throughout its history from within its border as well as beyond but if we see this conflict only from one side or the other then we will be blind to the truth the only resolution be for the aspiration of both side to be meet through two state where israelis and palestinians each live in peace and security

 that be in israel 's interest palestine 's interest america 's interest and the world 's interest and that be why i intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedication that the task require the obligation that the party have agree to under the road map be clear for peace to come it be time for they and all of we to live up to our responsibility

 palestinians must abandon violence resistance through violence and killing be wrong and it do not succeed for century black people in america suffer the lash of the whip as slave and the humiliation of segregation but it be not violence that win full and equal right it be a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideal at the center of america 's founding this same story can be tell by people from south africa to south asia from eastern europe to indonesia it be a story with a simple truth violence be a dead end it be a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rocket at sleep child or to blow up old woman on a bus that be not how moral authority be claim that be how it be surrender

 now be the time for palestinians to focus on what they can build the palestinian authority must develop its capacity to govern with institution that serve the need of its people hamas do have support among some palestinians but they also have to recognize they have responsibility to play a role in fulfil palestinian aspiration to unify the palestinian people hamas must put an end to violence recognize past agreement recognize israel 's right to exist

 at the same time israelis must acknowledge that just as israel 's right to exist can not be deny neither can palestine 's the united states do not accept the legitimacy of continue israeli settlement this construction violate previous agreement and undermine effort to achieve peace it be time for these settlement to stop

 and israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that palestinians can live and work and develop their society just as it devastate palestinian family the continue humanitarian crisis in gaza do not serve israel 's security neither do the continue lack of opportunity in the west bank progress in the daily life of the palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace and israel must take concrete step to enable such progress

 and finally the arab states must recognize that the arab peace initiative be an important beginning but not the end of their responsibility the arab israeli conflict should no long be use to distract the people of arab nation from other problem instead it must be a cause for action to help the palestinian people develop the institution that will sustain their state to recognize israel 's legitimacy and to choose progress over a self defeat focus on the past

 america will align our policy with those who pursue peace and we will say in public what we say in private to israelis and palestinians and arabs we can not impose peace but privately many muslims recognize that israel will not go away likewise many israelis recognize the need for a palestinian state it be time for we to act on what everyone know to be true

 too many tear have be shed too much blood have be shed all of we have a responsibility to work for the day when the mother of israelis and palestinians can see their child grow up without fear when the holy land of the three great faith be the place of peace that god intend it to be when jerusalem be a secure and last home for jews and christians and muslims and a place for all of the child of abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of isra when moses jesus and muhammed peace be upon they join in prayer

 the third source of tension be our share interest in the right and responsibility of nation on nuclear weapon this issue have be a source of tension between the united states and the islamic republic of iran for many year iran have define itself in part by its opposition to my country and there be in fact a tumultuous history between we in the middle of the cold war the united states play a role in the overthrow of a democratically elect iranian government since the islamic revolution iran have play a role in act of hostage taking and violence against u.s. troop and civilian this history be well know rather than remain trapped in the past i have make it clear to iran 's leader and people that my country be prepared to move forward the question now be not what iran be against but rather what future it want to build

 i recognize it will be hard to overcome decade of mistrust but we will proceed with courage rectitude and resolve there will be many issue to discuss between our two country and we be willing to move forward without precondition on the basis of mutual respect but it be clear to all concerned that when it come to nuclear weapon we have reach a decisive point this be not simply about america 's interest it be about prevent a nuclear arm race in the middle east that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path

 i understand those who protest that some country have weapon that other do not no single nation should pick and choose which nation hold nuclear weapon and that be why i strongly reaffirm america 's commitment to seek a world in which no nation hold nuclear weapon and any nation include iran should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it comply with its responsibility under the nuclear non proliferation treaty that commitment be at the core of the treaty and it must be keep for all who fully abide by it and i be hopeful that all country in the region can share in this goal

 the fourth issue that i will address be democracy i know there have be controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent year and much of this controversy be connect to the war in iraq so let i be clear no system of government can or should be impose by one nation by any other

 that do not lessen my commitment however to government that reflect the will of the people each nation give life to this principle in its own way ground in the tradition of its own people america do not presume to know what be good for everyone just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election but i do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain thing the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you be govern confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice government that be transparent and do not steal from the people the freedom to live as you choose these be not just american idea they be human right and that be why we will support they everywhere

 now there be no straight line to realize this promise but this much be clear government that protect these right be ultimately more stable successful and secure suppress idea never succeed in make they go away america respect the right of all peaceful and law abide voice to be hear around the world even if we disagree with they and we will welcome all elect peaceful government provide they govern with respect for all their people

 this last point be important because there be some who advocate for democracy only when they be out of power once in power they be ruthless in suppress the right of other so no matter where it take hold government of the people and by the people set a single standard for all who would hold power you must maintain your power through consent not coercion you must respect the right of minority and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise you must place the interest of your people and the legitimate working of the political process above your party without these ingredient election alone do not make true democracy

 audience member we love you

 the president thank you

 the fifth issue that we must address together be religious freedom islam have a proud tradition of tolerance we see it in the history of andalusia and cordoba during the inquisition i see it firsthand as a child in indonesia where devout christians worship freely in an overwhelmingly muslim country that be the spirit we need today people in every country should be free to choose and live their faith base upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul this tolerance be essential for religion to thrive but it be be challenge in many different way

 among some muslims there be a disturbing tendency to measure one 's own faith by the rejection of somebody else 's faith the richness of religious diversity must be uphold whether it be for maronites in lebanon or the copts in egypt and if we be be honest fault line must be close among muslims as well as the division between sunni and shi'a have lead to tragic violence particularly in iraq

 freedom of religion be central to the ability of people to live together we must always examine the way in which we protect it for instance in the united states rule on charitable giving have make it hard for muslims to fulfill their religious obligation that be why i be committed to work with american muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat

 likewise it be important for western country to avoid impede muslim citizen from practice religion as they see fit for instance by dictate what clothe a muslim woman should wear we can not disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretence of liberalism

 in fact faith should bring we together and that be why we be forge service project in america to bring together christians muslims and jews that be why we welcome effort like saudi arabian king abdallah 's interfaith dialog and turkey 's leadership in the alliance of civilizations around the world we can turn dialog into interfaith service so bridge between people lead to action whether it be combat malaria in africa or provide relief after a natural disaster

 the sixth issue that i want to address be woman 's right i know—[applause]—i know and you can tell from this audience that there be a healthy debate about this issue i reject the view of some in the west that a woman who choose to cover her hair be somehow less equal but i do believe that a woman who be deny an education be deny equality and it be no coincidence that country where woman be well educate be far more likely to be prosperous

 now let i be clear issue of woman 's equality be by no mean simply an issue for islam in turkey pakistan bangladesh indonesia we have see muslim majority country elect a woman to lead meanwhile the struggle for woman 's equality continue in many aspect of american life and in country around the world

 i be convinced that our daughter can contribute just as much to society as our son our common prosperity will be advance by allow all humanity man and woman to reach their full potential i do not believe that woman must make the same choice as man in order to be equal and i respect those woman who choose to live their life in traditional role but it should be their choice and that be why the united states will partner with any muslim majority country to support expand literacy for girl and to help young woman pursue employment through microfinance that help people live their dream

 finally i want to discuss economic development and opportunity i know that for many the face of globalization be contradictory the internet and television can bring knowledge and information but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home trade can bring new wealth and opportunity but also huge disruption and change in community in all nation include america this change can bring fear fear that because of modernity we lose control over our economic choice our politic and most importantly our identity those thing we most cherish about our community our family our tradition and our faith

 but i also know that human progress can not be deny there need not be contradiction between development and tradition country like japan and south korea grow their economy enormously while maintain distinct culture the same be true for the astonishing progress within muslim majority country from kuala lumpur to dubai in ancient time and in our time muslim community have be at the forefront of innovation and education

 and this be important because no development strategy can be base only upon what come out of the ground nor can it be sustain while young people be out of work many gulf states have enjoy great wealth as a consequence of oil and some be begin to focus it on broad development but all of we must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century and in too many muslim community there remain underinvestment in these area i be emphasize such investment within my own country and while america in the past have focus on oil and gas when it come to this part of the world we now seek a broad engagement

 on education we will expand exchange program and increase scholarship like the one that bring my father to america at the same time we will encourage more americans to study in muslim community and we will match promise muslim student with internship in america invest in online learning for teacher and child around the world and create a new online network so a young person in kansas can communicate instantly with a young person in cairo

 on economic development we will create a new corps of business volunteer to partner with counterpart in muslim majority country and i will host a summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen tie between business leader foundation and social entrepreneur in the united states and muslim community around the world

 on science and technology we will launch a new fund to support technological development in muslim majority country and to help transfer idea to mark to the marketplace so they can create more job we will open center of scientific excellence in africa the middle east and southeast asia and appoint new science envoy to collaborate on program that develop new source of energy create green job digitize record clean water grow new crop today i be announce a new global effort with the organization of the islamic conference to eradicate polio and we will also expand partnership with muslim community to promote child and maternal health

 all these thing must be do in partnership americans be ready to join with citizen and government community organization religious leader and business in muslim community around the world to help our people pursue a well life

 and the issue that i have describe will not be easy to address but we have a responsibility to join together on behalf of the world that we seek a world where extremist no long threaten our people and american troop have come home a world where israelis and palestinians be each secure in a state of their own and nuclear energy be use for peaceful purpose a world where government serve their citizen and the right of all god 's child be respect those be mutual interest that be the world we seek but we can only achieve it together

 i know there be many muslim and non muslim who question whether we can forge this new beginning some be eager to stoke the flame of division and to stand in the way of progress some suggest that it be not worth the effort that we be fate to disagree and civilization be doom to clash many more be simply skeptical that real change can occur there be so much fear so much mistrust that have build up over the year but if we choose to be bind by the past we will never move forward and i want to particularly say this to young people of every faith in every country you more than anyone have the ability to reimagine the world to remake this world

 all of we share this world for but a brief moment in time the question be whether we spend that time focus on what push we apart or whether we commit ourselves to an effort a sustained effort to find common ground to focus on the future we seek for our child and to respect the dignity of all human being

 it be easy to start war than to end they it be easy to blame other than to look inward it be easy to see what be different about someone than to find the thing we share but we should choose the right path not just the easy path there be one rule that lie at the heart of every religion that we do unto other as we would have they do unto we this truth transcend nation and people a belief that be not new that be not black or white or brown that be not christian or muslim or jew it be a belief that pulse in the cradle of civilization and that still beat in the heart of billion around the world it be a faith in other people and it be what bring i here today we have the power to make the world we seek but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning keep in mind what have be write

 the holy koran tell we o mankind we have create you male and a female and we have make you into nation and tribe so that you may know one another the talmud tell we the whole of the torah be for the purpose of promote peace the holy bible tell we blessed be the peacemaker for they shall be call son of god the people of the world can live together in peace we know that be god 's vision now that must be our work here on earth

 thank you and may god 's peace be upon you thank you very much thank you

madam speaker vice president biden members of congress and the american people

 when i speak here last winter this nation be face the bad economic crisis since the great depression we be lose an average of 700,000 job per month credit be frozen and our financial system be on the verge of collapse

 now as any american who be still look for work or a way to pay their bill will tell you we be by no mean out of the wood a full and vibrant recovery be still many month away and i will not let up until those americans who seek job can find they until those business that seek capital and credit can thrive until all responsible homeowner can stay in their home that be our ultimate goal but thank to the bold and decisive action we have take since january i can stand here with confidence and say that we have pull this economy back from the brink

 i want to thank the member of this body for your effort and your support in these last several month and especially those who have take the difficult vote that have put we on a path to recovery i also want to thank the american people for their patience and resolve during this try time for our nation but we do not come here just to clean up crisis we come here to build a future so tonight i return to speak to all of you about an issue that be central to that future and that be the issue of health care

 i be not the first president to take up this cause but i be determined to be the last it have now be nearly a century since theodore roosevelt first call for health care reform and ever since nearly every president and congress whether democrat or republican have attempt to meet this challenge in some way a bill for comprehensive health reform be first introduce by john dingell sr in 1943 sixty five year later his son continue to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session

 our collective failure to meet this challenge year after year decade after decade have lead we to the breaking point everyone understand the extraordinary hardship that be place on the uninsured who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy these be not primarily people on welfare these be middle class americans some can not get insurance on the job other be self employ and can not afford it since buy insurance on your own cost you three time as much as the coverage you get from your employer many other americans who be willing and able to pay be still deny insurance due to previous illness or condition that insurance company decide be too risky or too expensive to cover

 we be the only democracy the only advanced democracy on earth the only wealthy nation that allow such hardship for million of its people there be now more than 30 million american citizen who can not get coverage in just a 2 year period one in every three americans go without health care coverage at some point and every day 14,000 americans lose their coverage in other word it can happen to anyone

 but the problem that plague the health care system be not just a problem for the uninsured those who do have insurance have never have less security and stability than they do today more and more americans worry that if you move lose your job or change your job you will lose your health insurance too more and more americans pay their premium only to discover that their insurance company have drop their coverage when they get sick or will not pay the full cost of care it happen every day

 one man from illinois lose his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer find that he have not report gallstone that he do not even know about they delay his treatment and he die because of it another woman from texas be about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company cancel her policy because she forget to declare a case of acne by the time she have her insurance reinstate her breast cancer have more than double in size that be heart breaking it be wrong and no one should be treat that way in the united states of america

 then there be the problem of rise cost we spend one and a half time more per person on health care than any other country but we be not any healthier for it this be one of the reason that insurance premium have go up three time fast than wage it be why so many employer especially small business be force their employer employee to pay more for insurance or be drop their coverage entirely it be why so many aspire entrepreneur can not afford to open a business in the first place and why american business that compete internationally like our automaker be at a huge disadvantage and it be why those of we with health insurance be also pay a hidden and grow tax for those without it about $ 1,000 per year that pay for somebody else 's emergency room and charitable care

 finally our health care system be place an unsustainable burden on taxpayer when health care cost grow at the rate they have it put great pressure on program like medicare and medicaid if we do nothing to slow these skyrocket cost we will eventually be spend more on medicare and medicaid than every other government program combine put simply our health care problem be our deficit problem nothing else even come close nothing else

 now these be the fact nobody dispute they we know we must reform this system the question be how now there be those on the left who believe that the only way to fix the system be through a single payer system like canada 's where we would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the government provide coverage for everybody on the right there be those who argue that we should end employer base system and leave individual to buy health insurance on their own

 i have say i have to say that there be argument to be make for both these approach but either one would represent a radical shift that would disrupt the health care most people currently have since health care represent one sixth of our economy i believe it make more sense to build on what work and fix what do not rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch and that be precisely what those of you in congress have try to do over the several past several month

 during that time we have see washington at its good and at its bad we have see many in this chamber work tirelessly for the well part of this year to offer thoughtful idea about how to achieve reform of the five committee ask to develop bill four have complete their work and the senate finance committee announce today that it will move forward next week that have never happen before our overall effort have be support by an unprecedented coalition of doctor and nurse hospital senior group and even drug company many of whom oppose reform in the past and there be agreement in this chamber on about 80 percent of what need to be do put we close to the goal of reform than we have ever be

 but what we have also see in these last month be the same partisan spectacle that only harden the disdain many americans have towards their own government instead of honest debate we have see scare tactic some have dig into unyielde ideological camp that offer no hope of compromise too many have use this as an opportunity to score short term political point even if it rob the country of our opportunity to solve a long term challenge and out of this blizzard of charge and countercharge confusion have reign

 well the time for bickering be over the time for game have pass now be the season for action now be when we must bring the good idea of both party together and show the american people that we can still do what we be send here to do now be the time to deliver on health care now be the time to deliver on health care

 the plan i be announce tonight would meet three basic goal it will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance it will provide insurance for those who do not and it will slow the growth of health care cost for our family our business and our government it be a plan that ask everyone to take responsibility for meet this challenge not just government not just insurance company but everybody include employer and individual and it be a plan that incorporate idea from senators and congressmen from democrats and republicans and yes from some of my opponent in both the primary and general election

 here be the detail that every american need to know about this plan first if you be among the hundred of million of americans who already have health insurance through your job or medicare or medicaid or the va nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have let i repeat this nothing in our plan require you to change what you have

 what this plan will do be make the insurance you have work well for you under this plan it will be against the law for insurance company to deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition as soon as i sign this bill it will be against the law for insurance company to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it the most they will no long be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a give year or in a lifetime we will place a limit on how much you can be charge for out of pocket expense because in the united states of america no one should go broke because they get sick and insurance company will be require to cover with no extra charge routine checkup and preventive care like mammogram and colonoscopy because there be no reason we should not be catch disease like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get bad that make sense it save money and it save life

 now that be what americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan more security and more stability now if you be one of the ten of million of americans who do not currently have health insurance the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality affordable choice if you lose your job or you change your job you will be able to get coverage if you strike out on your own and start a small business you will be able to get coverage we will do this by create a new insurance exchange a marketplace where individual and small business will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive price insurance company will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it let they compete for million of new customer as one big group these customer will have great leverage to bargain with the insurance company for well price and quality coverage this be how large company and government employee get affordable insurance it be how everyone in this congress get affordable insurance and it be time to give every american the same opportunity that we give ourselves

 now for those individual and small business who still can not afford the lower price insurance available in the exchange we will provide tax credit the size of which will be base on your need and all insurance company that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protection i already mention this exchange will take effect in 4 year which will give we time to do it right in the meantime for those americans who can not get insurance today because they have preexist medical condition we will immediately offer low cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill this be a good idea when senator john mccain propose it in the campaign it be a good idea now and we should all embrace it

 now even if we provide these affordable option there may be those especially the young and the healthy who still want to take the risk and go without coverage there may still be company that refuse to do right by their worker by give they coverage the problem be such irresponsible behavior cost all the rest of we money if there be affordable option and people still do not sign up for health insurance it mean we pay for these people 's expensive emergency room visit if some business do not provide worker health care it force the rest of we to pick up the tab when their worker get sick and give those business an unfair advantage over their competitor and unless everybody do their part many of the insurance reform we seek especially require insurance company to cover preexist condition just can not be achieve

 and that be why under my plan individual will be require to carry basic health insurance just as most state require you to carry auto insurance likewise business will be require to either offer their worker health care or chip in to help cover the cost of their worker there will be a hardship waiver for those individual who still can not afford coverage and 95 percent of all small business because of their size and narrow profit margin would be exempt from these requirement but we can not have large business and individual who can afford coverage game the system by avoid responsibility to themselves or their employee improve our health care system only work if everybody do their part

 and while there remain some significant detail to be iron out i believe a broad consensus exist for the aspect of the plan i just outline consumer protection for those with insurance an exchange that allow individual and small business to purchase affordable coverage and a requirement that people who can afford insurance get insurance

 and i have no doubt that these reform would greatly benefit americans from all walk of life as well as the economy as a whole still give all the misinformation that be be spread over the past few month i realize that many americans have grow nervous about reform so tonight i want to address some of the key controversy that be still out there

 some of people 's concern have grow out of bogus claim spread by those whose only agenda be to kill reform at any cost the good example be the claim make not just by radio and cable talk show host but by prominent politician that we plan to set up panel of bureaucrat with the power to kill off senior citizen now such a charge would be laughable if it be not so cynical and irresponsible it be a lie plain and simple

 now there be also those who claim that our reform effort would insure illegal immigrant this too be false the reform i be propose would not apply to those who be here illegally

 representative joe wilson you lie

 the president it be not true and one more misunderstanding i want to clear up under our plan no federal dollar will be use to fund abortion and federal conscience law will remain in place

 now my health care proposal have also be attack by some who oppose reform as a government takeover of the entire health care system as proof critic point to a provision in our plan that allow the uninsured and small business to choose a publicly sponsor insurance option administer by the government just like medicaid or medicare

 so let i set the record straight here my guide principle be and always have be that consumer do well when there be choice and competition that be how the market work unfortunately in 34 states 75 percent of the insurance market be control by five or few company in alabama almost 90 percent be control by just one company and without competition the price of insurance go up and quality go down and it make it easy for insurance company to treat their customer badly by cherry pick the healthy individual and try to drop the sick by overcharge small business who have no leverage and by jack up rate

 insurance executive do not do this because they be bad people they do it because it be profitable as one former insurance executive testify before congress insurance company be not only encourage to find reason to drop the seriously ill they be reward for it all of this be in service of meet what this former executive call wall street 's relentless profit expectation

 now i have no interest in put insurance company out of business they provide a legitimate service and employ a lot of our friend and neighbor i just want to hold they accountable and the insurance reform that i have already mention would do just that but an additional step we can take to keep insurance company honest be by make a not for profit public option available in the insurance exchange now let i be clear let i be clear it would only be an option for those who do not have insurance no one would be force to choose it and it would not impact those of you who already have insurance in fact base on congressional budget office estimate we believe that less than 5 percent of americans would sign up

 despite all this the insurance company and their ally do not like this idea they argue that these private company can not fairly compete with the government and they would be right if taxpayer be subsidize this public insurance option but they will not be i have insist that like any private insurance company the public insurance option would have to be self sufficient and rely on the premium it collect but by avoid some of the overhead that get eat up at private company by profit and excessive administrative cost and executive salary it could provide a good deal for consumer and would also keep pressure on private insurer to keep their policy affordable and treat their customer well the same way public college and university provide additional choice and competition to student without in any way inhibit a vibrant system of private college and university

 now it be worth note that a strong majority of americans still favor a public insurance option of the sort i have propose tonight but its impact should not be exaggerate by the left or the right or the medium it be only one part of my plan and should not be use as a handy excuse for the usual washington ideological battle to my progressive friend i would remind you that for decade the drive idea behind reform have be to end insurance company abuse and make coverage available for those without it the public option be only a means to that end and we should remain open to other idea that accomplish our ultimate goal and to my republican friend i say that rather than make wild claim about a government takeover of health care we should work together to address any legitimate concern you may have

 now for example some have suggest that the public option go into effect only in those market where insurance company be not provide affordable policy other have propose a co op or another nonprofit entity to administer the plan these be all constructive idea worth explore but i will not back down on the basic principle that if americans can not find affordable coverage we will provide you with a choice and i will make sure that no government bureaucrat or insurance company bureaucrat get between you and the care that you need

 finally let i discuss an issue that be a great concern to i to member of this chamber and to the public and that be how we pay for this plan and here be what you need to know first i will not sign a plan that add one dime to our deficit either now or in the future i will not sign it if it add one dime to the deficit now or in the future period and to prove that i be serious there will be a provision in this plan that require we to come forward with more spending cut if the saving we have promise do not materialize now part of the reason i face a trillion dollar deficit when i walk in the door of the white house be because too many initiative over the last decade be not pay for from the iraq war to tax break for the wealthy i will not make that same mistake with health care

 second we have estimate that most of this plan can be pay for by find saving within the exist health care system a system that be currently full of waste and abuse right now too much of the hard earn saving and tax dollar we spend on health care do not make we any healthier that be not my judgment it be the judgment of medical professional across this country and this be also true when it come to medicare and medicaid

 in fact i want to speak directly to senior for a moment because medicare be another issue that be be subject to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate more than four decade ago this nation stand up for the principle that after a lifetime of hard work our senior should not be leave to struggle with a pile of medical bill in their later year that be how medicare be bear and it remain a sacred trust that must be pass down from one generation to the next and that be why not a dollar of the medicare trust fund will be use to pay for this plan

 the only thing this plan would eliminate be the hundred of billion of dollar in waste and fraud as well as unwarranted subsidy in medicare that go to insurance company subsidy that do everything to pad their profit but do not improve the care of senior and we will also create an independent commission of doctor and medical expert charge with identify more waste in the year ahead

 now these step will ensure that you america 's senior get the benefit you have be promise they will ensure that medicare be there for future generation and we can use some of the saving to fill the gap in coverage that force too many senior to pay thousand of dollar a year out of their own pocket for prescription drug that be what this plan will do for you so do not pay attention to those scary story about how your benefit will be cut especially since some of the same folk who be spread these tall tale have fight against medicare in the past and just this year support a budget that would essentially have turn medicare into a privatized voucher program that will not happen on my watch i will protect medicare

 now because medicare be such a big part of the health care system make the program more efficient can help usher in change in the way we deliver health care that can reduce cost for everybody we have long know that some place like the intermountain healthcare in utah or the geisinger health system in rural pennsylvania offer high quality care at cost below average so the commission can help encourage the adoption of these commonsense good practice by doctor and medical professional throughout the system everything from reduce hospital infection rate to encourage well coordination between team of doctor

 reduce the waste and inefficiency in medicare and medicaid will pay for most of this plan now much of the rest would be pay for with revenue from the very same drug and insurance company that stand to benefit from ten of million of new customer and this reform will charge insurance company a fee for their most expensive policy which will encourage they to provide great value for the money an idea which have the support of democratic and republican expert and accord to these same expert this modest change could help hold down the cost of health care for all of we in the long run

 now finally many in this chamber particularly on the republican side of the aisle have long insist that reform our medical malpractice law can help bring down the cost of health care now there you go there you go now i do not believe malpractice reform be a silver bullet but i have talk to enough doctor to know that defensive medicine may be contribute to unnecessary cost so i be propose that we move forward on a range of idea about how to put patient safety first and let doctor focus on practice medicine i know that the bush administration consider authorize demonstration project in individual states to test these idea i think it be a good idea and i be direct my secretary of health and human services to move forward on this initiative today

 now add it all up and the plan i be propose will cost around $ 900 billion over 10 year less than we have spend on the iraq and afghanistan war and less than the tax cut for the wealthy few americans that congress pass at the beginning of the previous administration now most of these cost will be pay for with money already be spend but spend badly in the exist health care system the plan will not add to our deficit the middle class will realize great security not high taxis and if we be able to slow the growth of health care cost by just one tenth of 1 percent each year one tenth of 1 percent it will actually reduce the deficit by $ 4 trillion over the long term

 now this be the plan i be propose it be a plan that incorporate idea from many of the people in this room tonight democrats and republicans and i will continue to seek common ground in the week ahead if you come to i with a serious set of proposal i will be there to listen my door be always open

 but know this i will not waste time with those who have make the calculation that it be well politic to kill this plan than to improve it i will not stand by while the special interest use the same old tactic to keep thing exactly the way they be if you misrepresent what be in this plan we will call you out and i will not accept the status quo as a solution not this time not now

 everyone in this room know what will happen if we do nothing our deficit will grow more family will go bankrupt more business will close more americans will lose their coverage when they be sick and need it the most and more will die as a result we know these thing to be true

 that be why we can not fail because there be too many americans count on we to succeed the one who suffer silently and the one who share their story with we at town hall in e mail and in letter i receive one of those letter a few day ago it be from our beloved friend and colleague ted kennedy he have write it back in may shortly after he be tell that his illness be terminal he ask that it be deliver upon his death

 in it he speak about what a happy time his last month be thank to the love and support of family and friend his wife vicki his amazing child who be all here tonight and he express confidence that this would be the year that health care reform that great unfinished business of our society he call it would finally pass he repeat the truth that health care be decisive for our future prosperity but he also remind i that it concern more than material thing what we face he write be above all a moral issue at stake be not just the detail of policy but fundamental principle of social justice and the character of our country

 i have think about that phrase quite a bit in recent day the character of our country one of the unique and wonderful thing about america have always be our self reliance our rugged individualism our fierce defense of freedom and our healthy skepticism of government and figure out the appropriate size and role of government have always be a source of rigorous and yes sometimes angry debate that be our history

 for some of ted kennedy 's critic his brand of liberalism represent an affront to american liberty in their mind his passion for universal health care be nothing more than a passion for big government but those of we who know teddy and work with he here people of both party know that what drive he be something more his friend orrin hatch he know that they work together to provide child with health insurance his friend john mccain know that they work together on a patient 's bill of right his friend chuck grassley know that they work together to provide health care to child with disability

 on issue like these ted kennedy 's passion be bear not of some rigid ideology but of his own experience it be the experience of have two child stricken with cancer he never forget the sheer terror and helplessness that any parent feel when a child be badly sick and he be able to imagine what it must be like for those without insurance what it would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or an age parent there be something that could make you well but i just can not afford it

 that large heartedness that concern and regard for the plight of other be not a partisan feeling it be not a republican or a democratic feeling it too be part of the american character our ability to stand in other people 's shoe a recognition that we be all in this together and when fortune turn against one of we other be there to lend a help hand a belief that in this country hard work and responsibility should be reward by some measure of security and fair play and an acknowledgment that sometimes government have to step in to help deliver on that promise

 this have always be the history of our progress in 1935 when over half of our senior could not support themselves and million have see their saving wipe away there be those who argue that social security would lead to socialism but the man and woman of congress stand fast and we be all the well for it in 1965 when some argue that medicare represent a government takeover of health care members of congress democrats and republicans do not back down they join together so that all of we could enter our golden year with some basic peace of mind

 you see our predecessor understand that government could not and should not solve every problem they understand that there be instance when the gain in security from government action be not worth the add constraint on our freedom but they also understand that the danger of too much government be match by the peril of too little that without the leaven hand of wise policy market can crash monopoly can stifle competition the vulnerable can be exploit and they know that when any government measure no matter how carefully craft or beneficial be subject to scorn when any effort to help people in need be attack as un american when fact and reason be throw overboard and only timidity pass for wisdom and we can no long even engage in a civil conversation with each other over the thing that truly matter that at that point we do not merely lose our capacity to solve big challenge we lose something essential about ourselves

 that be true then it remain true today i understand how difficult this health care debate have be i know that many in this country be deeply skeptical that government be look out for they i understand that the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down the road to defer reform one more year or one more election or one more term

 but that be not what the moment call for that be not what we come here to do we do not come to fear the future we come here to shape it i still believe we can act even when it be hard i still believe i still believe that we can act when it be hard i still believe we can replace acrimony with civility and gridlock with progress i still believe we can do great thing and that here and now we will meet history 's test because that be who we be that be our calling that be our character

 thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america

good evening   to the united states corps of cadets to the man and woman of our armed services and to my fellow americans   i want to speak to you tonight about our effort in afghanistan the nature of our commitment there the scope of our interest and the strategy that my administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion   it be an extraordinary honor for i to do so here at west point where so many man and woman have prepare to stand up for our security and to represent what be fine about our country

 to address these important issue it be important to recall why america and our ally be compel to fight a war in afghanistan in the first place   we do not ask for this fight on september 11 2001 19 man hijack four airplane and use they to murder nearly 3,000 people   they strike at our military and economic nerve center   they take the life of innocent man woman and child without regard to their faith or race or station   be it not for the heroic action of passenger onboard one of those flight they could have also strike at one of the great symbol of our democracy in washington and kill many more

 as we know these man belong to al qaeda a group of extremist who have distort and defile islam one of the world ’s great religion to justify the slaughter of innocent al qaeda ’s base of operation be in afghanistan where they be harbor by the taliban a ruthless repressive and radical movement that seize control of that country after it be ravage by year of soviet occupation and civil war and after the attention of america and our friend have turn elsewhere

 just day after 9/11 congress authorize the use of force against al qaeda and those who harbor they an authorization that continue to this day   the vote in the senate be 98 to nothing   the vote in the house be 420 to 1   for the first time in its history the north atlantic treaty organization invoke article 5 the commitment that say an attack on one member nation be an attack on all   and the united nations security council endorse the use of all necessary step to respond to the 9/11 attack   america our ally and the world be act as one to destroy al qaeda ’s terrorist network and to protect our common security

 under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy and only after the taliban refuse to turn over osama bin laden we send our troop into afghanistan   within a matter of month al qaeda be scatter and many of its operative be kill   the taliban be drive from power and push back on its heel   a place that have know decade of fear now have reason to hope   at a conference convene by the u.n. a provisional government be establish under president hamid karzai   and an international security assistance force be establish to help bring a last peace to a war tear country

 then in early 2003 the decision be make to wage a second war in iraq   the wrench debate over the iraq war be well know and need not be repeat here   it be enough to say that for the next six year the iraq war draw the dominant share of our troop our resource our diplomacy and our national attention and that the decision to go into iraq cause substantial rift between america and much of the world

 today after extraordinary cost we be bring the iraq war to a responsible end   we will remove our combat brigade from iraq by the end of next summer and all of our troop by the end of 2011   that we be do so be a testament to the character of the man and woman in uniform   applause   thank to their courage grit and perseverance we have give iraqis a chance to shape their future and we be successfully leave iraq to its people

 but while we have achieve hard earn milestone in iraq the situation in afghanistan have deteriorate   after escape across the border into pakistan in 2001 and 2002 al qaeda ’s leadership establish a safe haven there   although a legitimate government be elect by the afghan people it be be hamper by corruption the drug trade an under develop economy and insufficient security force

 over the last several year the taliban have maintain common cause with al qaeda as they both seek an overthrow of the afghan government   gradually the taliban have begin to control additional swath of territory in afghanistan while engage in increasingly brazen and devastating attack of terrorism against the pakistani people

 now throughout this period our troop level in afghanistan remain a fraction of what they be in iraq   when i take office we have just over 32,000 americans serve in afghanistan compare to 160,000 in iraq at the peak of the war   commander in afghanistan repeatedly ask for support to deal with the reemergence of the taliban but these reinforcement do not arrive   and that be why shortly after take office i approve a longstanding request for more troop   after consultation with our ally i then announce a strategy recognize the fundamental connection between our war effort in afghanistan and the extremist safe haven in pakistan   i set a goal that be narrowly define as disrupt dismantle and defeat al qaeda and its extremist ally and pledge to well coordinate our military and civilian effort

 since then we have make progress on some important objective   high rank al qaeda and taliban leader have be kill and we have step up the pressure on al qaeda worldwide in pakistan that nation 's army have go on its large offensive in year   in afghanistan we and our ally prevent the taliban from stop a presidential election and although it be mar by fraud that election produce a government that be consistent with afghanistan 's law and constitution

 yet huge challenge remain   afghanistan be not lose but for several year it have move backwards   there be no imminent threat of the government be overthrow but the taliban have gain momentum   al qaeda have not reemerge in afghanistan in the same number as before 9/11 but they retain their safe haven along the border   and our force lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with afghan security force and well secure the population   our new commander in afghanistan general mcchrystal have report that the security situation be more serious than he anticipate   in short   the status quo be not sustainable

 as cadet you volunteer for service during this time of danger   some of you fight in afghanistan   some of you will deploy there   as your commander in chief i owe you a mission that be clearly define and worthy of your service   and that be why after the afghan voting be complete i insist on a thorough review of our strategy   now let i be clear   there have never be an option before i that call for troop deployment before 2010 so there have be no delay or denial of resource necessary for the conduct of the war during this review period   instead the review have allow i to ask the hard question and to explore all the different option along with my national security team our military and civilian leadership in afghanistan and our key partner   and give the stake involve i owe the american people and our troop no less

 this review be now complete   and as commander in chief i have determine that it be in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 u.s. troop to afghanistan   after 18 month our troop will begin to come home   these be the resource that we need to seize the initiative while build the afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our force out of afghanistan

 i do not make this decision lightly   i oppose the war in iraq precisely because i believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force and always consider the long term consequence of our action   we have be at war now for eight year at enormous cost in life and resource   year of debate over iraq and terrorism have leave our unity on national security issue in tatter and create a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort   and having just experience the bad economic crisis since the great depression the american people be understandably focus on rebuild our economy and put people to work here at home

 most of all i know that this decision ask even more of you a military that along with your family have already bear the heavy of all burden   as president i have sign a letter of condolence to the family of each american who give their life in these war   i have read the letter from the parent and spouse of those who deploy   i visit our courageous wound warrior at walter reed   i have travel to dover to meet the flag drape casket of 18 americans return home to their final resting place   i see firsthand the terrible wage of war   if i do not think that the security of the united states and the safety of the american people be at stake in afghanistan i would gladly order every single one of our troop home tomorrow

 so no i do not make this decision lightly   i make this decision because i be convinced that our security be at stake in afghanistan and pakistan   this be the epicenter of violent extremism practice by al qaeda   it be from here that we be attack on 9/11 and it be from here that new attack be be plot as i speak   this be no idle danger no hypothetical threat   in the last few month alone we have apprehend extremist within our border who be send here from the border region of afghanistan and pakistan to commit new act of terror and this danger will only grow if the region slide backwards and al qaeda can operate with impunity   we must keep the pressure on al qaeda and to do that we must increase the stability and capacity of our partner in the region

 of course this burden be not ours alone to bear   this be not just america 's war   since 9/11 al qaeda ’s safe haven have be the source of attack against london and amman and bali   the people and government of both afghanistan and pakistan be endanger   and the stake be even high within a nuclear armed pakistan because we know that al qaeda and other extremist seek nuclear weapon and we have every reason to believe that they would use they

 these fact compel we to act along with our friend and ally   our overarching goal remain the same   to disrupt dismantle and defeat al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan and to prevent its capacity to threaten america and our ally in the future

 to meet that goal we will pursue the follow objective within afghanistan   we must deny al qaeda a safe haven   we must reverse the taliban 's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government   and we must strengthen the capacity of afghanistan 's security force and government so that they can take lead responsibility for afghanistan 's future

 we will meet these objective in three way   first we will pursue a military strategy that will break the taliban 's momentum and increase afghanistan 's capacity over the next 18 month

 the 30,000 additional troop that i be announce tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 the fast possible pace so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population center   they will increase our ability to train competent afghan security force and to partner with they so that more afghans can get into the fight   and they will help create the condition for the united states to transfer responsibility to the afghans

 because this be an international effort i have ask that our commitment be join by contribution from our ally   some have already provide additional troop and we be confident that there will be further contribution in the day and week ahead our friend have fight and bleed and die alongside we in afghanistan   and now we must come together to end this war successfully   for what be at stake be not simply a test of nato 's credibility what be at stake be the security of our ally and the common security of the world

 but take together these additional american and international troop will allow we to accelerate handing over responsibility to afghan force and allow we to begin the transfer of our force out of afghanistan in july of 2011   just as we have do in iraq we will execute this transition responsibly take into account condition on the ground   we will continue to advise and assist afghanistan 's security force to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul   but it will be clear to the afghan government and more importantly to the afghan people that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country

 second we will work with our partner the united nations and the afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy so that the government can take advantage of improved security

 this effort must be base on performance   the day of provide a blank check be over   president karzai 's inauguration speech send the right message about move in a new direction   and go forward we will be clear about what we expect from those who receive our assistance   we will support afghan ministry governor and local leader that combat corruption and deliver for the people   we expect those who be ineffective or corrupt to be hold accountable   and we will also focus our assistance in area such as agriculture that can make an immediate impact in the life of the afghan people

 the people of afghanistan have endure violence for decade they have be confront with occupation by the soviet union and then by foreign al qaeda fighter who use afghan land for their own purpose   so tonight i want the afghan people to understand america seek an end to this era of war and suffering   we have no interest in occupy your country   we will support effort by the afghan government to open the door to those taliban who abandon violence and respect the human right of their fellow citizen   and we will seek a partnership with afghanistan ground in mutual respect to isolate those who destroy to strengthen those who build to hasten the day when our troop will leave and to forge a last friendship in which america be your partner and never your patron

 third we will act with the full recognition that our success in afghanistan be inextricably link to our partnership with pakistan

 we be in afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spread through that country   but this same cancer have also take root in the border region of pakistan   that be why we need a strategy that work on both side of the border

 in the past there have be those in pakistan who have argue that the struggle against extremism be not their fight and that pakistan be well off do little or seek accommodation with those who use violence   but in recent year as innocent have be kill from karachi to islamabad it have become clear that it be the pakistani people who be the most endanger by extremism   public opinion have turn   the pakistani army have wage an offensive in swat and south waziristan   and there be no doubt that the united states and pakistan share a common enemy

 in the past we too often define our relationship with pakistan narrowly   those day be over   move forward we be commit to a partnership with pakistan that be build on a foundation of mutual interest mutual respect and mutual trust we will strengthen pakistan ’s capacity to target those group that threaten our country and have make it clear that we can not tolerate a safe haven for terrorist whose location be know and whose intention be clear   america be also provide substantial resource to support pakistan ’s democracy and development   we be the large international supporter for those pakistanis displace by the fighting   and go forward the pakistan people must know america will remain a strong supporter of pakistan ’s security and prosperity long after the gun have fall silent so that the great potential of its people can be unleash

 these be the three core element of our strategy   a military effort to create the condition for a transition a civilian surge that reinforce positive action and an effective partnership with pakistan

 i recognize there be a range of concern about our approach   so let i briefly address a few of the more prominent argument that i have hear and which i take very seriously

 first there be those who suggest that afghanistan be another vietnam   they argue that it can not be stabilize and we be well off cut our loss and rapidly withdraw   i believe this argument depend on a false reading of history   unlike vietnam we be join by a broad coalition of 43 nation that recognize the legitimacy of our action   unlike vietnam we be not face a broad base popular insurgency   and most importantly unlike vietnam the american people be viciously attack from afghanistan and remain a target for those same extremist who be plot along its border   to abandon this area now and to rely only on effort against al qaeda from a distance would significantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al qaeda and create an unacceptable risk of additional attack on our homeland and our ally

 second there be those who acknowledge that we can not leave afghanistan in its current state but suggest that we go forward with the troop that we already have   but this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through and permit a slow deterioration of condition there   it would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in afghanistan because we would never be able to generate the condition need to train afghan security force and give they the space to take over

 finally there be those who oppose identify a time frame for our transition to afghan responsibility   indeed some call for a more dramatic and open ended escalation of our war effort   one that would commit we to a nation build project of up to a decade   i reject this course because it set goal that be beyond what can be achieve at a reasonable cost and what we need to achieve to secure our interest   furthermore the absence of a time frame for transition would deny we any sense of urgency in work with the afghan government   it must be clear that afghans will have to take responsibility for their security and that america have no interest in fight an endless war in afghanistan

 as president i refuse to set goal that go beyond our responsibility our mean or our interest   and i must weigh all of the challenge that our nation face   i do not have the luxury of commit to just one   indeed i be mindful of the word of president eisenhower who in discuss our national security say each proposal must be weigh in the light of a broad consideration   the need to maintain balance in and among national program

 over the past several year we have lose that balance   we have fail to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy   in the wake of an economic crisis too many of our neighbor and friend be out of work and struggle to pay the bill   too many americans be worried about the future face our child   meanwhile competition within the global economy have grow more fierce   so we can not simply afford to ignore the price of these war

 all tell by the time i take office the cost of the war in iraq and afghanistan approach a trillion dollar   go forward i be committed to address these cost openly and honestly   our new approach in afghanistan be likely to cost we roughly $ 30 billion for the military this year and i will work closely with congress to address these cost as we work to bring down our deficit

 but as we end the war in iraq and transition to afghan responsibility we must rebuild our strength here at home   our prosperity provide a foundation for our power   it pay for our military   it underwrite our diplomacy   it tap the potential of our people and allow investment in new industry   and it will allow we to compete in this century as successfully as we do in the last   that be why our troop commitment in afghanistan can not be open ended because the nation that i be most interested in building be our own

 now let i be clear   none of this will be easy   the struggle against violent extremism will not be finish quickly and it extend well beyond afghanistan and pakistan   it will be an enduring test of our free society and our leadership in the world   and unlike the great power conflict and clear line of division that define the 20th century our effort will involve disorderly region fail state diffuse enemy

 so as a result america will have to show our strength in the way that we end war and prevent conflict not just how we wage war   we will have to be nimble and precise in our use of military power   where al qaeda and its ally attempt to establish a foothold whether in somalia or yemen or elsewhere they must be confront by grow pressure and strong partnership

 and we can not count on military might alone   we have to invest in our homeland security because we can not capture or kill every violent extremist abroad   we have to improve and well coordinate our intelligence so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy network

 we will have to take away the tool of mass destruction   and that be why i have make it a central pillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear material from terrorist to stop the spread of nuclear weapon and to pursue the goal of a world without they because every nation must understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever more destructive weapon true security will come for those who reject they

 we will have to use diplomacy because no one nation can meet the challenge of an interconnected world act alone   i have spend this year renew our alliance and forge new partnership   and we have forge a new beginning between america and the muslim world one that recognize our mutual interest in break a cycle of conflict and that promise a future in which those who kill innocent be isolate by those who stand up for peace and prosperity and human dignity

 and finally we must draw on the strength of our value for the challenge that we face may have change but the thing that we believe in must not   that be why we must promote our value by live they at home which be why i have prohibit torture and will close the prison at guantanamo bay   and we must make it clear to every man woman and child around the world who live under the dark cloud of tyranny that america will speak out on behalf of their human right and tend to the light of freedom and justice and opportunity and respect for the dignity of all people   that be who we be   that be the source the moral source of america ’s authority

 since the day of franklin roosevelt and the service and sacrifice of our grandparent and great grandparent our country have bear a special burden in global affair   we have spill american blood in many country on multiple continent   we have spend our revenue to help other rebuild from rubble and develop their own economy   we have join with other to develop an architecture of institution from the united nations to nato to the world bank that provide for the common security and prosperity of human being

 we have not always be thank for these effort and we have at time make mistake   but more than any other nation the united states of america have underwrite global security for over six decade a time that for all its problem have see wall come down and market open and billion lift from poverty unparalleled scientific progress and advance frontier of human liberty

 for unlike the great power of old we have not seek world domination   our union be found in resistance to oppression we do not seek to occupy other nation   we will not claim another nation ’s resource or target other people because their faith or ethnicity be different from ours   what we have fight for what we continue to fight for be a well future for our child and grandchild   and we believe that their life will be well if other people child and grandchild can live in freedom and access opportunity   applause

 as a country we be not as young and perhaps not as innocent as we be when roosevelt be president   yet we be still heir to a noble struggle for freedom   and now we must summon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenge of a new age

 in the end our security and leadership do not come solely from the strength of our arm   it derive from our people from the worker and business who will rebuild our economy from the entrepreneur and researcher who will pioneer new industry from the teacher that will educate our child and the service of those who work in our community at home from the diplomat and peace corps volunteer who spread hope abroad and from the man and woman in uniform who be part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that have make government of the people by the people and for the people a reality on this earth   applause
 this vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue nor should we   but i also know that we as a country can not sustain our leadership nor navigate the momentous challenge of our time if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor and cynicism and partisanship that have in recent time poison our national discourse

 it be easy to forget that when this war begin we be united bind together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack and by the determination to defend our homeland and the value we hold dear   i refuse to accept the notion that we can not summon that unity again   applause   i believe with every fiber of my be that we as americans can still come together behind a common purpose   for our value be not simply word write into parchment they be a creed that call we together and that have carry we through the darkest of storm as one nation as one people

 america we be pass through a time of great trial   and the message that we send in the midst of these storm must be clear   that our cause be just our resolve unwavering   we will go forward with the confidence that right make might and with the commitment to forge an america that be safe a world that be more secure and a future that represent not the deep of fear but the high of hope   applause

 thank you   god bless you   may god bless the united states of america   applause   thank you very much   thank you   applause

your majesties your royal highnesses distinguished member of the norwegian nobel committee citizen of america and citizen of the world

 i receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility   it be an award that speak to our high aspiration that for all the cruelty and hardship of our world we be not mere prisoner of fate   our action matter and can bend history in the direction of justice

 and yet i would be remiss if i do not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision have generate   laughter   in part this be because i be at the beginning and not the end of my labor on the world stage   compare to some of the giant of history who have receive this prize schweitzer and king marshall and mandela my accomplishment be slight   and then there be the man and woman around the world who have be jail and beat in the pursuit of justice those who toil in humanitarian organization to relieve suffering the unrecognized million whose quiet act of courage and compassion inspire even the most harden cynic   i can not argue with those who find these man and woman some know some obscure to all but those they help to be far more deserving of this honor than i.

 but perhaps the most profound issue surround my receipt of this prize be the fact that i be the commander in chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two war   one of these war be wind down   the other be a conflict that america do not seek one in which we be join by 42 other country include norway in an effort to defend ourselves and all nation from further attack

 still we be at war and i be responsible for the deployment of thousand of young americans to battle in a distant land   some will kill and some will be kill   and so i come here with an acute sense of the cost of armed conflict fill with difficult question about the relationship between war and peace and our effort to replace one with the other

 now these question be not new   war in one form or another appear with the first man   at the dawn of history its morality be not question it be simply a fact like drought or disease the manner in which tribe and then civilization seek power and settle their difference

 and over time as code of law seek to control violence within group so do philosopher and cleric and statesman seek to regulate the destructive power of war   the concept of a just war emerge suggest that war be justify only when certain condition be meet   if it be wage as a last resort or in self defense if the force use be proportional and if whenever possible civilian be spare from violence

 of course we know that for most of history this concept of just war be rarely observe   the capacity of human being to think up new way to kill one another prove inexhaustible as do our capacity to exempt from mercy those who look different or pray to a different god   war between army give way to war between nation total war in which the distinction between combatant and civilian became blur   in the span of 30 year such carnage would twice engulf this continent   and while it be hard to conceive of a cause more just than the defeat of the third reich and the axis power world war ii be a conflict in which the total number of civilian who die exceed the number of soldier who perish

 in the wake of such destruction and with the advent of the nuclear age it become clear to victor and vanquish alike that the world need institution to prevent another world war   and so a quarter century after the united states senate reject the league of nations an idea for which woodrow wilson receive this prize america lead the world in construct an architecture to keep the peace   a marshall plan and a united nations mechanism to govern the waging of war treaty to protect human right prevent genocide restrict the most dangerous weapon

 in many way these effort succeed   yes terrible war have be fight and atrocity commit   but there have be no third world war   the cold war end with jubilant crowd dismantle a wall   commerce have stitch much of the world together   billion have be lift from poverty   the ideal of liberty and self determination equality and the rule of law have haltingly advance   we be the heir of the fortitude and foresight of generation past and it be a legacy for which my own country be rightfully proud

 and yet a decade into a new century this old architecture be buckling under the weight of new threat   the world may no long shudder at the prospect of war between two nuclear superpower but proliferation may increase the risk of catastrophe   terrorism have long be a tactic but modern technology allow a few small man with outsized rage to murder innocent on a horrific scale

 moreover war between nation have increasingly give way to war within nation   the resurgence of ethnic or sectarian conflict the growth of secessionist movement insurgency and fail state all these thing have increasingly trap civilian in unending chaos   in today 's war many more civilian be kill than soldier the seed of future conflict be sown economy be wreck civil society tear asunder refugee amass child scar

 i do not bring with i today a definitive solution to the problem of war   what i do know be that meet these challenge will require the same vision hard work and persistence of those man and woman who act so boldly decade ago   and it will require we to think in new way about the notion of just war and the imperative of a just peace

 we must begin by acknowledge the hard truth   we will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetime   there will be time when nation act individually or in concert will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified

 i make this statement mindful of what martin luther king jr. say in this same ceremony year ago   violence never bring permanent peace   it solve no social problem   it merely create new and more complicated one   as someone who stand here as a direct consequence of dr. king 's life work i be live testimony to the moral force of non violence   i know there be nothing weak nothing passive nothing naïve in the creed and life of gandhi and king

 but as a head of state swear to protect and defend my nation i can not be guide by their example alone   i face the world as it be and can not stand idle in the face of threat to the american people   for make no mistake   evil do exist in the world   a non violent movement could not have halt hitler 's army   negotiation can not convince al qaeda 's leader to lay down their arm   to say that force may sometimes be necessary be not a call to cynicism it be a recognition of history the imperfection of man and the limit of reason

 i raise this point i begin with this point because in many country there be a deep ambivalence about military action today no matter what the cause   and at time this be join by a reflexive suspicion of america the world 's sole military superpower

 but the world must remember that it be not simply international institution not just treaty and declaration that bring stability to a post world war ii world   whatever mistake we have make the plain fact be this   the united states of america have help underwrite global security for more than six decade with the blood of our citizen and the strength of our arm   the service and sacrifice of our man and woman in uniform have promote peace and prosperity from germany to korea and enable democracy to take hold in place like the balkans   we have bear this burden not because we seek to impose our will   we have do so out of enlightened self interest because we seek a well future for our child and grandchild and we believe that their life will be well if other child and grandchild can live in freedom and prosperity

 so yes the instrument of war do have a role to play in preserve the peace   and yet this truth must coexist with another that no matter how justify war promise human tragedy   the soldier 's courage and sacrifice be full of glory express devotion to country to cause to comrade in arm   but war itself be never glorious and we must never trumpet it as such

 so part of our challenge be reconcile these two seemingly inreconcilable truth that war be sometimes necessary and war at some level be an expression of human folly   concretely we must direct our effort to the task that president kennedy call for long ago   let we focus he say on a more practical more attainable peace base not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institution   a gradual evolution of human institution

 what might this evolution look like   what might these practical step be

 to begin with i believe that all nation strong and weak alike must adhere to standard that govern the use of force   i like any head of state reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation   nevertheless i be convinced that adhere to standard international standard strengthen those who do and isolate and weaken those who do not

 the world rally around america after the 9/11 attack and continue to support our effort in afghanistan because of the horror of those senseless attack and the recognize principle of self defense   likewise the world recognize the need to confront saddam hussein when he invade kuwait a consensus that send a clear message to all about the cost of aggression

 furthermore america in fact no nation can insist that other follow the rule of the road if we refuse to follow they ourselves   for when we do not our action appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future intervention no matter how justified

 and this become particularly important when the purpose of military action extend beyond self defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor   more and more we all confront difficult question about how to prevent the slaughter of civilian by their own government or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region

 i believe that force can be justify on humanitarian ground as it be in the balkans or in other place that have be scar by war   inaction tear at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later   that be why all responsible nation must embrace the role that militarie with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace

 america 's commitment to global security will never waver   but in a world in which threat be more diffuse and mission more complex america can not act alone   america alone can not secure the peace   this be true in afghanistan   this be true in fail state like somalia where terrorism and piracy be join by famine and human suffering   and sadly it will continue to be true in unstable region for year to come

 the leader and soldier of nato country and other friend and ally demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage they have show in afghanistan   but in many country there be a disconnect between the effort of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broad public   i understand why war be not popular but i also know this   the belief that peace be desirable be rarely enough to achieve it   peace require responsibility   peace entail sacrifice   that be why nato continue to be indispensable   that be why we must strengthen u.n. and regional peacekeeping and not leave the task to a few country   that be why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to oslo and rome to ottawa and sydney to dhaka and kigali we honor they not as maker of war but of wager but as wager of peace

 let i make one final point about the use of force   even as we make difficult decision about go to war we must also think clearly about how we fight it   the nobel committee recognize this truth in award its first prize for peace to henry dunant the founder of the red cross and a drive force behind the geneva conventions

 where force be necessary we have a moral and strategic interest in bind ourselves to certain rule of conduct   and even as we confront a vicious adversary that abide by no rule i believe the united states of america must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war   that be what make we different from those whom we fight   that be a source of our strength   that be why i prohibit torture   that be why i order the prison at guantanamo bay close   and that be why i have reaffirm america 's commitment to abide by the geneva conventions   we lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideal that we fight to defend   applause   and we honor we honor those ideal by uphold they not when it be easy but when it be hard

 i have speak at some length to the question that must weigh on our mind and our heart as we choose to wage war   but let i now turn to our effort to avoid such tragic choice and speak of three way that we can build a just and last peace

 first in deal with those nation that break rule and law i believe that we must develop alternative to violence that be tough enough to actually change behavior for if we want a lasting peace then the word of the international community must mean something   those regime that break the rule must be hold accountable   sanction must exact a real price   intransigence must be meet with increase pressure and such pressure exist only when the world stand together as one

 one urgent example be the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapon and to seek a world without they   in the middle of the last century nation agree to be bind by a treaty whose bargain be clear   all will have access to peaceful nuclear power those without nuclear weapon will forsake they and those with nuclear weapon will work towards disarmament   i be committed to uphold this treaty   it be a centerpiece of my foreign policy   and i be work with president medvedev to reduce america and russia 's nuclear stockpile

 but it be also incumbent upon all of we to insist that nation like iran and north korea do not game the system   those who claim to respect international law can not avert their eye when those law be flout   those who care for their own security can not ignore the danger of an arm race in the middle east or east asia   those who seek peace can not stand idly by as nation arm themselves for nuclear war

 the same principle apply to those who violate international law by brutalize their own people   when there be genocide in darfur systematic rape in congo repression in burma there must be consequence   yes there will be engagement yes there will be diplomacy but there must be consequence when those thing fail   and the close we stand together the less likely we will be face with the choice between armed intervention and complicity in oppression

 this bring i to a second point the nature of the peace that we seek   for peace be not merely the absence of visible conflict   only a just peace base on the inherent right and dignity of every individual can truly be last

 it be this insight that drive drafter of the universal declaration of human rights after the second world war   in the wake of devastation they recognize that if human right be not protect peace be a hollow promise

 and yet too often these word be ignore   for some country the failure to uphold human right be excuse by the false suggestion that these be somehow western principle foreign to local culture or stage of a nation 's development   and within america there have long be a tension between those who describe themselves as realist or idealist a tension that suggest a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interest or an endless campaign to impose our value around the world

 i reject these choice   i believe that peace be unstable where citizen be deny the right to speak freely or worship as they please choose their own leader or assemble without fear   pent up grievance fester and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence   we also know that the opposite be true   only when europe become free do it finally find peace   america have never fight a war against a democracy and our close friend be government that protect the right of their citizen   no matter how callously define neither america 's interest nor the world 's be serve by the denial of human aspiration

 so even as we respect the unique culture and tradition of different country america will always be a voice for those aspiration that be universal   we will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformer like aung sang suu kyi to the bravery of zimbabweans who cast their ballot in the face of beating to the hundred of thousand who have march silently through the street of iran   it be tell that the leader of these government fear the aspiration of their own people more than the power of any other nation   and it be the responsibility of all free people and free nation to make clear that these movement these movement of hope and history they have we on their side

 let i also say this   the promotion of human right can not be about exhortation alone   at time it must be couple with painstaking diplomacy   i know that engagement with repressive regime lack the satisfying purity of indignation   but i also know that sanction without outreach condemnation without discussion can carry forward only a crippling status quo   no repressive regime can move down a new path unless it have the choice of an open door

 in light of the cultural revolution 's horror nixon 's meeting with mao appear inexcusable and yet it surely help set china on a path where million of its citizen have be lift from poverty and connect to open society   pope john paul 's engagement with poland create space not just for the catholic church but for labor leader like lech walesa   ronald reagan 's effort on arm control and embrace of perestroika not only improve relation with the soviet union but empower dissident throughout eastern europe   there be no simple formula here   but we must try as well we can to balance isolation and engagement pressure and incentive so that human right and dignity be advanced over time

 third a just peace include not only civil and political right it must encompass economic security and opportunity   for true peace be not just freedom from fear but freedom from want

 it be undoubtedly true that development rarely take root without security it be also true that security do not exist where human being do not have access to enough food or clean water or the medicine and shelter they need to survive   it do not exist where child can not aspire to a decent education or a job that support a family   the absence of hope can rot a society from within

 and that be why help farmer feed their own people or nation educate their child and care for the sick be not mere charity   it be also why the world must come together to confront climate change   there be little scientific dispute that if we do nothing we will face more drought more famine more mass displacement all of which will fuel more conflict for decade   for this reason it be not merely scientist and environmental activist who call for swift and forceful action it be military leader in my own country and other who understand our common security hang in the balance

 agreement among nation   strong institution   support for human right   investment in development   all these be vital ingredient in bring about the evolution that president kennedy speak about   and yet i do not believe that we will have the will the determination the staying power to complete this work without something more and that be the continue expansion of our moral imagination an insistence that there be something irreducible that we all share

 as the world grow small you might think it would be easy for human being to recognize how similar we be to understand that we be all basically seek the same thing that we all hope for the chance to live out our life with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for ourselves and our family

 and yet somehow give the dizzying pace of globalization the cultural leveling of modernity it perhaps come as no surprise that people fear the loss of what they cherish in their particular identity their race their tribe and perhaps most powerfully their religion   in some place this fear have lead to conflict   at time it even feel like we be move backwards   we see it in the middle east as the conflict between arabs and jews seem to harden   we see it in nation that be tear asunder by tribal line

 and most dangerously we see it in the way that religion be use to justify the murder of innocent by those who have distort and defile the great religion of islam and who attack my country from afghanistan   these extremist be not the first to kill in the name of god the cruelty of the crusade be amply record   but they remind we that no holy war can ever be a just war   for if you truly believe that you be carry out divine will then there be no need for restraint no need to spare the pregnant mother or the medic or the red cross worker or even a person of one 's own faith   such a warped view of religion be not just incompatible with the concept of peace but i believe it be incompatible with the very purpose of faith for the one rule that lie at the heart of every major religion be that we do unto other as we would have they do unto we

 adhere to this law of love have always be the core struggle of human nature   for we be fallible   we make mistake and fall victim to the temptation of pride and power and sometimes evil   even those of we with the good of intention will at time fail to right the wrong before we

 but we do not have to think that human nature be perfect for we to still believe that the human condition can be perfect   we do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideal that will make it a well place   the non violence practice by man like gandhi and king may not have be practical or possible in every circumstance but the love that they preach their fundamental faith in human progress that must always be the north star that guide we on our journey

 for if we lose that faith if we dismiss it as silly or naïve if we divorce it from the decision that we make on issue of war and peace then we lose what be good about humanity   we lose our sense of possibility   we lose our moral compass

 like generation have before we we must reject that future   as dr. king say at this occasion so many year ago i refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguity of history   i refuse to accept the idea that the isness of man 's present condition make he morally incapable of reach up for the eternal oughtness that forever confront he

 let we reach for the world that ought to be that spark of the divine that still stir within each of our soul   applause

 somewhere today in the here and now in the world as it be a soldier see he be outgunne but stand firm to keep the peace   somewhere today in this world a young protestor await the brutality of her government but have the courage to march on   somewhere today a mother face punish poverty still take the time to teach her child scrape together what few coin she have to send that child to school because she believe that a cruel world still have a place for that child 's dream

 let we live by their example   we can acknowledge that oppression will always be with we and still strive for justice   we can admit the intractability of depravation and still strive for dignity   clear eye we can understand that there will be war and still strive for peace   we can do that for that be the story of human progress that be the hope of all the world and at this moment of challenge that must be our work here on earth

 thank you very much

madam speaker vice president biden members of congress distinguished guest and fellow americans

 our constitution declare that from time to time the president shall give to congress information about the state of our union for 220 year our leader have fulfil this duty they have do so during period of prosperity and tranquility and they have do so in the midst of war and depression at moment of great strife and great struggle

 it be tempting to look back on these moment and assume that our progress be inevitable that america be always destine to succeed but when the union be turn back at bull run and the allies first land at omaha beach victory be very much in doubt when the market crash on black tuesday and civil right marcher be beat on bloody sunday the future be anything but certain these be the time that test the courage of our conviction and the strength of our union and despite all our division and disagreement our hesitation and our fear america prevail because we choose to move forward as one nation as one people again we be test and again we must answer history 's call

 one year ago i take office amid two war an economy rock by a severe recession a financial system on the verge of collapse and a government deeply in debt expert from across the political spectrum warn that if we do not act we might face a second depression so we act immediately and aggressively and 1 year later the bad of the storm have pass

 but the devastation remain one in 10 americans still can not find work many business have shutter home value have decline small town and rural community have be hit especially hard and for those who would already know poverty life 's become that much hard

 this recession have also compound the burden that america 's family have be deal with for decade the burden of work hard and long for less of be unable to save enough to retire or help kid with college

 so i know the anxiety that be out there right now they be not new these struggle be the reason i run for president these struggle be what i have witness for year in place like elkhart indiana galesburg illinois i hear about they in the letter that i read each night the tough to read be those write by child ask why they have to move from their home ask when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work

 for these americans and so many other change have not come fast enough some be frustrate some be angry they do not understand why it seem like bad behavior on wall street be reward but hard work on main street be not or why washington have be unable or unwilling to solve any of our problem they be tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness they know we can not afford it not now

 so we face big and difficult challenge and what the american people hope what they deserve be for all of we democrats and republicans to work through our difference to overcome the numb weight of our politic for while the people who send we here have different background different story different belief the anxiety they face be the same the aspiration they hold be share a job that pay the bill a chance to get ahead most of all the ability to give their child a well life

 and you know what else they share they share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity after one of the most difficult year in our history they remain busy build car and teaching kid start business and go back to school they be coach little league and help their neighbor one woman write to i and say we be strained but hopeful struggle but encourage

 it be because of this spirit this great decency and great strength that i have never be more hopeful about america 's future than i be tonight despite our hardship our union be strong we do not give up we do not quit we do not allow fear or division to break our spirit in this new decade it be time the american people get a government that match their decency that embody their strength and tonight i would like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise

 it begin with our economy our most urgent task upon take office be to shore up the same bank that helped cause this crisis it be not easy to do and if there be one thing that have unify democrats and republicans and everybody in between it be that we all hate the bank bailout i hate it i hate it you hate it it be about as popular as a root canal

 but when i run for president i promise i would not just do what be popular i would do what be necessary and if we have allow the meltdown of the financial system unemployment might be double what it be today more business would certainly have close more home would have surely be lose

 so i support the last administration 's effort to create the financial rescue program and when we take that program over we make it more transparent and more accountable and as a result the market be now stabilize and we have recover most of the money we spend on the bank most but not all

 to recover the rest i have propose a fee on the big bank now i know wall street be not keen on this idea but if these firm can afford to hand out big bonus again they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayer who rescue they in their time of need

 now as we stabilize the financial system we also take step to get our economy grow again save as many job as possible and help americans who have become unemployed that be why we extend or increase unemployment benefit for more than 18 million americans make health insurance 65 percent cheap for family who get their coverage through cobra and pass 25 different tax cut

 now let i repeat we cut taxis we cut taxis for 95 percent of work family we cut taxis for small business we cut taxis for first time home buyer we cut taxis for parent try to care for their child we cut taxis for 8 million americans pay for college i think i would get some applause on that one

 as a result million of americans have more to spend on gas and food and other necessity all of which help business keep more worker and we have not raise income taxis by a single dime on a single person not a single dime

 now because of the step we take there be about 2 million americans work right now who would otherwise be unemployed two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy three hundred thousand be teacher and other education worker ten of thousand be cop firefighter correctional officer first responder and we be on track to add another 1½ million job to this total by the end of the year

 the plan that have make all of this possible from the tax cut to the job be the recovery act that be right the recovery act also know as the stimulus bill economist on the left and the right say this bill have help save job and avert disaster but you do not have to take their word for it talk to the small business in phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the recovery act talk to the window manufacturer in philadelphia who say he use to be skeptical about the recovery act until he have to add two more work shift just because of the business it create talk to the single teacher raise two kid who be tell by her principal in the last week of school that because of the recovery act she would not be lay off after all

 there be story like this all across america and after 2 year of recession the economy be grow again retirement fund have start to gain back some of their value business be begin to invest again and slowly some be start to hire again

 but i realize that for every success story there be other story of man and woman who wake up with the anguish of not know where their next paycheck will come from who send out resume week after week and hear nothing in response that be why job must be our number one focus in 2010 and that be why i be call for a new job bill tonight

 now the true engine of job creation in this country will always be america 's business i agree absolutely but government can create the condition necessary for business to expand and hire more worker we should start where most new job do in small business company that begin when an entrepreneur take a chance on a dream or a worker decide it be time she become her own boss through sheer grit and determination these company have weather the recession and they be ready to grow but when you talk to small business owner in place like allentown pennsylvania or elyria ohio you find out that even though bank on wall street be lend again they be mostly lend to big company financing remain difficult for small business owner across the country even those that be make a profit

 so tonight i be propose that we take $ 30 billion of the money wall street bank have repay and use it to help community bank give small business the credit they need to stay afloat i be also propose a new small business tax credit one that will go to over 1 million small business who hire new worker or raise wage while we be at it let us also eliminate all capital gain taxis on small business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large business and all small business to invest in new plant and equipment

 next we can put americans to work today build the infrastructure of tomorrow from the first railroad to the interstate highway system our nation have always be build to compete there be no reason europe or china should have the fast train or the new factory that manufacture clean energy product tomorrow i will visit tampa florida where worker will soon break ground on a new high speed railroad fund by the recovery act there be project like that all across this country that will create job and help move our nation 's good service and information

 we should put more americans to work build clean energy facility and give rebate to americans who make their home more energy efficient which support clean energy job and to encourage these and other business to stay within our border it be time to finally slash the tax break for company that ship our job overseas and give those tax break to company that create job right here in the united states of america

 now the house have pass a job bill that include some of these step as the first order of business this year i urge the senate to do the same and i know they will they will people be out of work they be hurt they need our help and i want a job bill on my desk without delay

 but the truth be these step will not make up for the 7 million job that we have lose over the last 2 year the only way to move to full employment be to lay a new foundation for long term economic growth and finally address the problem that america 's family have confront for year

 we can not afford another so call economic expansion like the one from the last decade what some call the lost decade where job grow more slowly than during any prior expansion where the income of the average american household decline while the cost of health care and tuition reach record high where prosperity be build on a housing bubble and financial speculation

 from the day i take office i have be tell that address our large challenge be too ambitious such an effort would be too contentious i have be tell that our political system be too gridlocked and that we should just put thing on hold for a while for those who make these claim i have one simple question how long should we wait how long should america put its future on hold

 you see washington have be tell we to wait for decade even as the problem have grow bad meanwhile china 's not wait to revamp its economy germany 's not wait india 's not wait these nation be they're not stand still these nation be not play for second place they be put more emphasis on math and science they be rebuild their infrastructure they be make serious investment in clean energy because they want those job well i do not accept second place for the united states of america as hard as it may be as uncomfortable and contentious as the debate may become it be time to get serious about fix the problem that be hamper our growth

 now one place to start be serious financial reform look i be not interested in punish bank i be interested in protect our economy a strong healthy financial market make it possible for business to access credit and create new job it channel the saving of family into investment that raise income but that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly bring down our entire economy

 we need to make sure consumer and middle class family have the information they need to make financial decision we can not allow financial institution include those that take your deposit to take risk that threaten the whole economy

 now the house have already pass financial reform with many of these change and the lobbyist be try to kill it but we can not let they win this fight and if the bill that end up on my desk do not meet the test of real reform i will send it back until we get it right we have get to get it right

 next we need to encourage american innovation last year we make the large investment in basic research funding in history an investment that could lead to the world 's cheap solar cell or treatment that kill cancer cell but leave healthy one untouched and no area be more ripe for such innovation than energy you can see the result of last year 's investment in clean energy in the north carolina company that will create 1,200 job nationwide help to make advanced battery or in the california business that will put a thousand people to work make solar panel

 but to create more of these clean energy job we need more production more efficiency more incentive and that mean build a new generation of safe clean nuclear powerplant in this country it mean make tough decision about open new offshore area for oil and gas development it mean continued investment in advanced biofuel and clean coal technology and yes it mean pass a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentive that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in america now i be grateful to the house for pass such a bill last year and this year i be eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the senate

 i know there have be question about whether we can afford such change in a tough economy i know that there be those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change but here be the thing even if you doubt the evidence provide incentive for energy efficiency and clean energy be the right thing to do for our future because the nation that lead the clean energy economy will be the nation that lead the global economy and america must be that nation

 third we need to export more of our good because the more product we make and sell to other country the more job we support right here in america so tonight we set a new goal we will double our export over the next 5 year an increase that will support 2 million job in america to help meet this goal we be launch a national export initiative that will help farmer and small business increase their export and reform export control consistent with national security

 we have to seek new market aggressively just as our competitor be if america sit on the sideline while other nation sign trade deal we will lose the chance to create job on our shore but realize those benefit also mean enforce those agreement so our trading partner play by the rule and that be why we will continue to shape a doha trade agreement that open global market and why we will strengthen our trade relation in asia and with key partner like south korea and panama and colombia

 fourth we need to invest in the skill and education of our people now this year we have break through the stalemate between left and right by launch a national competition to improve our school and the idea here be simple instead of rewarding failure we only reward success instead of fund the status quo we only invest in reform reform that raise student achievement inspire student to excel in math and science and turn around fail school that steal the future of too many young americans from rural community to the inner city in the 21st century the good antipoverty program around be a world class education and in this country the success of our child can not depend more on where they live than on their potential when we renew the elementary and secondary education act we will work with congress to expand these reform to all 50 state

 still in this economy a high school diploma no long guarantee a good job that be why i urge the senate to follow the house and pass a bill that will revitalize our community college which be a career pathway to the child of so many work family

 to make college more affordable this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidy that go to bank for student loan instead let us take that money and give family a $ 10,000 tax credit for 4 year of college and increase pell grant and let us tell another 1 million student that when they graduate they will be require to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loan and all of their debt will be forgive after 20 year and forgive after 10 year if they choose a career in public service because in the united states of america no one should go broke because they choose to go to college and by the way it be time for college and university to get serious about cut their own cost because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem

 now the price of college tuition be just one of the burden face the middle class that be why last year i ask vice president biden to chair a task force on middle class family that be why we be nearly double the child care tax credit and make it easy to save for retirement by give access to every worker a retirement account and expand the tax credit for those who start a nest egg that be why we be work to lift the value of a family 's single large investment their home the step we take last year to shore up the housing market have allow million of americans to take out new loan and save an average of $ 1,500 on mortgage payment this year we will step up refinance so that homeowner can move into more affordable mortgage

 and it be precisely to relieve the burden on middle class family that we still need health insurance reform yes we do

 now let us clear a few thing up i do not choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt and by now it should be fairly obvious that i do not take on health care because it be good politic i take on health care because of the story i have hear from americans with preexist condition whose life depend on get coverage patient who have be deny coverage family even those with insurance who be just one illness away from financial ruin

 after nearly a century of try democratic administration republican administration we be close than ever to bring more security to the life of so many americans the approach we have take would protect every american from the bad practice of the insurance industry it would give small business and uninsured americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market it would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care

 and by the way i want to acknowledge our first lady michelle obama who this year be create a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kid healthy thank you honey she get embarrassed

 our approach would preserve the right of americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan it would reduce cost and premium for million of family and business and accord to the congressional budget office the independent organization that both party have cite as the official scorekeeper for congress our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $ 1 trillion over the next two decade

 still this be a complex issue and the long it be debate the more skeptical people become i take my share of the blame for not explain it more clearly to the american people and i know that with all the lobbying and horse trading the process leave most americans wonder what be in it for i

 but i also know this problem be not go away by the time i be finish speak tonight more americans will have lose their health insurance million will lose it this year our deficit will grow premium will go up patient will be deny the care they need small business owner will continue to drop coverage altogether i will not walk away from these americans and neither should the people in this chamber

 so as temperature cool i want everyone to take another look at the plan we have propose there be a reason why many doctor nurse and health care expert who know our system well consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo but if anyone from either party have a well approach that will bring down premium bring down the deficit cover the uninsured strengthen medicare for senior and stop insurance company abuse let i know let i know let i know i be eager to see it

 here be what i ask congress though do not walk away from reform not now not when we be so close let we find a way to come together and finish the job for the american people let us get it do let us get it do

 now even as health care reform would reduce our deficit it be not enough to dig we out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves it be a challenge that make all other that much hard to solve and one that be be subject to a lot of political posturing so let i start the discussion of government spending by set the record straight

 at the beginning of the last decade the year 2000 america have a budget surplus of over $ 200 billion by the time i take office we have a 1 year deficit of over $ 1 trillion and project deficit of $ 8 trillion over the next decade most of this be the result of not pay for two war two tax cut and an expensive prescription drug program on top of that the effect of the recession put a $ 3 trillion hole in our budget all this be before i walk in the door

 now just state the fact now if we have take office in ordinary time i would have like nothing more than to start bring down the deficit but we take office amid a crisis and our effort to prevent a second depression have add another $ 1 trillion to our national debt that too be a fact

 i be absolutely convinced that be the right thing to do but family across the country be tighten their belt and make tough decision the federal government should do the same so tonight i be propose specific step to pay for the trillion dollar that it take to rescue the economy last year

 start in 2011 we be prepared to freeze government spending for 3 year spending relate to our national security medicare medicaid and social security will not be affect but all other discretionary government program will like any cash strap family we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we do not and if i have to enforce this discipline by veto i will

 we will continue to go through the budget line by line page by page to eliminate program that we can not afford and do not work we have already identify $ 20 billion in saving for next year to help work family we will extend our middle class tax cut but at a time of record deficit we will not continue tax cut for oil company for investment fund manager and for those make over $ 250,000 a year we just can not afford it

 now even after pay for what we spend on my watch we will still face the massive deficit we have when i take office more importantly the cost of medicare medicaid and social security will continue to skyrocket that be why i have call for a bipartisan fiscal commission model on a proposal by republican judd gregg and democrat kent conrad this can not be one of those washington gimmick that let we pretend we solve a problem the commission will have to provide a specific set of solution by a certain deadline

 now yesterday the senate block a bill that would have create this commission so i will issue an executive order that will allow we to go forward because i refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of americans and when the vote come tomorrow the senate should restore the pay as you go law that be a big reason for why we have record surplus in the 1990s

 now i know that some in my own party will argue that we can not address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many be still hurt and i agree which be why this freeze will not take effect until next year when the economy be strong that be how budgeting work but understand if we do not take meaningful step to rein in our debt it could damage our market increase the cost of borrowing and jeopardize our recovery all of which would have an even bad effect on our job growth and family income

 from some on the right i expect we will hear a different argument that if we just make few investment in our people extend tax cut include those for the wealthy americans eliminate more regulation maintain the status quo on health care our deficit will go away the problem be that be what we do for 8 year that be what help we into this crisis it be what help lead to these deficit we can not do it again

 rather than fight the same tired battle that have dominate washington for decade it be time to try something new let us invest in our people without leave they a mountain of debt let us meet our responsibility to the citizen who send we here let us try common sense a novel concept

 now to do that we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollar right now we face a deficit of trust deep and corrosive doubt about how washington work that have be grow for year to close that credibility gap we have to take action on both end of pennsylvania avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyist to do our work openly to give our people the government they deserve

 now that be what i come to washington to do that be why for the first time in history my administration post on our white house visitor online that be why we have exclude lobbyist from policymake job or seat on federal board and commission but we can not stop there it be time to require lobbyist to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with congress it be time to put strict limit on the contribution that lobbyist give to candidate for federal office

 with all due deference to separation of power last week the supreme court reverse a century of law that i believe will open the floodgate for special interest include foreign corporation to spend without limit in our election i do not think american election should be bankroll by america 's most powerful interest or bad by foreign entity they should be decide by the american people and i would urge democrats and republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problem

 i be also call on congress to continue down the path of earmark reform democrats and republicans democrats and republicans look you have trim some of this spending you have embrace some meaningful change but restore the public trust demand more for example some member of congress post some earmark request online tonight i be call on congress to publish all earmark request on a single web site before there be a vote so that the american people can see how their money be be spend

 of course none of these reform will even happen if we do not also reform how we work with one another now i be not naive i never think that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and some postpartisan era i know that both party have feed division that be deeply entrenched and on some issue there be simply philosophical difference that will always cause we to part way these disagreement about the role of government in our life about our national priority and our national security they have be take place for over 200 year they be the very essence of our democracy

 but what frustrate the american people be a washington where every day be election day we can not wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal be to see who can get the most embarrassing headline about the other side a belief that if you lose i win neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can the confirmation of i'm speak to both party now the confirmation of well qualify public servant should not be hold hostage to the pet project or grudge of a few individual senator

 washington may think that say anything about the other side no matter how false no matter how malicious be just part of the game but it be precisely such politic that have stop either party from help the american people worse yet it be sow further division among our citizen far distrust in our government so no i will not give up on try to change the tone of our politic i know it be an election year and after last week it be clear that campaign fever have come even early than usual but we still need to govern

 to democrats i would remind you that we still have the large majority in decade and the people expect we to solve problem not run for the hill and if the republican leadership be go to insist that 60 vote in the senate be require to do any business at all in this town a supermajority then the responsibility to govern be now your as well just say no to everything may be good short term politic but it be not leadership we be send here to serve our citizen not our ambition so let us show the american people that we can do it together

 this week i will be address a meeting of the house republicans i would like to begin monthly meeting with both democratic and republican leadership i know you can not wait

 now throughout our history no issue have unite this country more than our security sadly some of the unity we feel after 9/11 have dissipate and we can argue all we want about who be to blame for this but i be not interested in relitigate the past i know that all of we love this country all of we be commit to its defense so let us put aside the schoolyard taunt about who be tough let us reject the false choice between protect our people and uphold our value let us leave behind the fear and division and do what it take to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future for america and for the world

 that be the work we begin last year since the day i take office we have renew our focus on the terrorist who threaten our nation we have make substantial investment in our homeland security and disrupt plot that threaten to take american life we be fill unacceptable gap reveal by the fail christmas attack with well airline security and swifter action on our intelligence we have prohibit torture and strengthen partnership from the pacific to south asia to the arabian peninsula and in the last year hundred of al qaida 's fighter and affiliate include many senior leader have be capture or kill far more than in 2008

 and in afghanistan we be increase our troop and train afghan security force so they can begin to take the lead in july of 2011 and our troop can begin to come home we will reward good governance work to reduce corruption and support the right of all afghans man and woman alike we be join by ally and partner who have increase their own commitment and who will come together tomorrow in london to reaffirm our common purpose there will be difficult day ahead but i be absolutely confident we will succeed

 as we take the fight to al qaida we be responsibly leave iraq to its people as a candidate i promise that i would end this war and that be what i be do as president we will have all of our combat troop out of iraq by the end of this august we will support the iraqi government as they hold election and we will continue to partner with the iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity but make no mistake this war be end and all of our troop be come home

 tonight all of our man and woman in uniform in iraq in afghanistan and around the world they have to know that we that they have our respect our gratitude our full support and just as they must have the resource they need in war we all have a responsibility to support they when they come home that be why we make the large increase in investment for veteran in decade last year that be why we be build a 21st century va and that be why michelle have join with jill biden to forge a national commitment to support military family

 now even as we prosecute two war we be also confront perhaps the great danger to the american people the threat of nuclear weapon i have embrace the vision of john f. kennedy and ronald reagan through a strategy that reverse the spread of these weapon and seek a world without they to reduce our stockpile and launcher while ensure our deterrent the united states and russia be complete negotiation on the farth reach arm control treaty in nearly two decade and at april 's nuclear security summit we will bring 44 nation together here in washington dc behind a clear goal secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in 4 year so that they never fall into the hand of terrorist

 now these diplomatic effort have also strengthen our hand in deal with those nation that insist on violate international agreement in pursuit of nuclear weapon that be why north korea now face increase isolation and strong sanction sanction that be be vigorously enforce that be why the international community be more united and the islamic republic of iran be more isolated and as iran 's leader continue to ignore their obligation there should be no doubt they too will face grow consequence that be a promise

 that be the leadership we be provide engagement that advance the common security and prosperity of all people we be work through the g-20 to sustain a last global recovery we be work with muslim community around the world to promote science and education and innovation we have go from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change we be help develop country to feed themselves and continue the fight against hiv aids and we be launch a new initiative that will give we the capacity to respond fast and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease a plan that will counter threat at home and strengthen public health abroad

 as we have for over 60 year america take these action because our destiny be connect to those beyond our shore but we also do it because it be right that be why as we meet here tonight over 10,000 americans be work with many nation to help the people of haiti recover and rebuild that be why we stand with the girl who yearn to go to school in afghanistan why we support the human right of the woman march through the street of iran why we advocate for the young man deny a job by corruption in guinea for america must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity always

 abroad america 's great source of strength have always be our ideal the same be true at home we find unity in our incredible diversity draw on the promise enshrine in our constitution the notion that we be all create equal that no matter who you be or what you look like if you abide by the law you should be protect by it if you adhere to our common value you should be treat no different than anyone else

 we must continually renew this promise my administration have a civil rights division that be once again prosecute civil right violation and employment discrimination we finally strengthen our law to protect against crime drive by hate this year i will work with congress and our military to finally repeal the law that deny gay americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they be it be the right thing to do

 we be go to crackdown on violation of equal pay law so that woman get equal pay for an equal day 's work and we should continue the work of fix our broken immigration system to secure our border and enforce our law and ensure that everyone who play by the rule can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation

 in the end it be our ideal our value that build america value that allow we to forge a nation make up of immigrant from every corner of the globe value that drive our citizen still every day americans meet their responsibility to their family and their employer time and again they lend a hand to their neighbor and give back to their country they take pride in their labor and be generous in spirit these be not republican value or democratic value that they be live by business value or labor value they be american value

 unfortunately too many of our citizen have lose faith that our big institution our corporation our medium and yes our government still reflect these same value each of these institution be full of honorable man and woman do important work that help our country prosper but each time a ceo reward himself for failure or a banker put the rest of we at risk for his own selfish gain people 's doubt grow each time lobbyist game the system or politician tear each other down instead of lift this country up we lose faith the more that tv pundit reduce serious debate to silly argument big issue into sound bite our citizen turn away no wonder there be so much cynicism out there no wonder there be so much disappointment

 i campaign on the promise of change change we can believe in the slogan go and right now i know there be many americans who be not sure if they still believe we can change or that i can deliver it

 but remember this i never suggest that change would be easy or that i could do it alone democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated and when you try to do big thing and make big change it stir passion and controversy that be just how it be

 those of we in public office can respond to this reality by play it safe and avoid tell hard truth and point finger we can do what be necessary to keep our poll number high and get through the next election instead of do what be good for the next generation

 but i also know this if people have make that decision 50 year ago or 100 year ago or 200 year ago we would not be here tonight the only reason we be here be because generation of americans be unafraid to do what be hard to do what be need even when success be uncertain to do what it take to keep the dream of this nation alive for their child and their grandchild

 now our administration have have some political setback this year and some of they be deserve but i wake up every day know that they be nothing compare to the setback that familie all across this country have face this year and what keep i go what keep i fight be that despite all these setback that spirit of determination and optimism that fundamental decency that have always be at the core of the american people that live on

 it live on in the struggle small business owner who write to i of his company none of we he say be willing to consider even slightly that we might fail it live on in the woman who say that even though she and her neighbor have feel the pain of recession we be strong we be resilient we be american it live on in the 8 year old boy in louisiana who just send i his allowance and ask if i would give it to the people of haiti and it live on in all the americans who have drop everything to go someplace they have never be and pull people they have never know from the rubble prompt chant of u.s.a. u.s.a. u.s.a when another life be save

 the spirit that have sustain this nation for more than two century live on in you its people we have finish a difficult year we have come through a difficult decade but a new year have come a new decade stretch before we we do not quit i do not quit let us seize this moment to start anew to carry the dream forward and to strengthen our union once more

 thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america

the president   hello everybody   i be glad to see that all of you brave the weather to be here   a little while ago i have a meeting with the democratic and republican congressional leader and it go very well   in fact i understand that mcconnell and reid be out do snow angel on the south lawn together   laughter   can you picture that chuck   not really

 the meeting do go well and i appreciate they make the trek   we have a good and frank conversation and it be one that i hope we can continue on a more regular basis

 we all understand that there be legitimate and genuine difference between the party but despite the political posturing that often paralyze this town there be many issue upon which we can and should agree   that be what the american people be demand of we   i think they be tired of every day be election day in washington   and at this critical time in our country the people send we here expect a seriousness of purpose that transcend petty politic

 that be why i be go to continue to seek the good idea from either party as we work to tackle the press challenge ahead   i be confident for example that when one in 10 of our fellow citizen can not work we should be able to come together and help business create more job   we ought to be able to agree on provide small business with additional tax credit and much need line of credit   we ought to agree on investment in crumble road and bridge and we should agree on tax break for make home more energy efficient all of which will put more americans to work   many of the job proposal that i have lay out have pass the house and be soon go to be debate in the senate   we spend a lot of time in this meeting discuss a job package and how we could move forward on that   and if there be additional idea i will consider they as well   what i will not consider be do nothing in the face of a lot of hardship across the country

 we also talk about restore fiscal responsibility   there be few matter on which there be as much vigorous bipartisan agreement at least in public but unfortunately there be also a lot of partisan wrangling behind closed door   this be what we know for sure   for we to solve this extraordinary problem that be so many year in the making it be go to take the cooperation of both party   it be not go to happen in any other way

 i be pleased that congress support my request to restore the pay as you go rule which be instrumental in turn deficit into surplus during the 1990s   i have also call for a bipartisan fiscal commission   unfortunately this measure which originally have receive the support of a bipartisan majority of the senate and be cosponsor by senators conrad and gregg democrats and republicans be block there   so i be go to be create this commission by executive order   and during our meeting i ask the leadership of both party to join in this serious effort to address our long term deficit because when the politic be put aside the reality of our fiscal challenge be not subject to interpretation   math be not partisan   there ought to be a debate about how to close our deficit   what we can not accept be business as usual and we can not afford grandstand at the expense of actually get something do

 during our meeting we also touch briefly on how we can move forward on health reform   i have already announce that in two week i will be hold a meeting with people from both party and as i tell the congressional leadership i be look forward to a constructive debate with plan that need to be measure against this test   do it bring down cost for all americans as well as for the federal government which spend a huge amount on health care   do it provide adequate protection against abuse by the insurance industry   do it make coverage affordable and available to the ten of million of work americans who do not have it right now   and do it help we get on a path of fiscal sustainability

 we also talk about why this be so urgent   just this week there be a report that anthem blue cross which be the large insurer in the large state california be plan on raise premium for many individual policyholder by as much as 39 percent   if we do not act this be just a preview of come attraction   premium will continue to rise for folk with insurance million more will lose their coverage altogether our deficit will continue to grow large   and we have an obligation both party to tackle this issue in a serious way

 now bipartisanship depend on a willingness among both democrats and republicans to put aside matter of party for the good of the country   i will not hesitate to embrace a good idea from my friend in the minority party but i also will not hesitate to condemn what i consider to be obstinacy that be root not in substantive disagreement but in political expedience   we talk about this as well particularly when it come to the confirmation process   i respect the senate 's role to advise and consent but for month qualified non- controversial nominee for critical position in government often position relate to our national security have be hold up despite have overwhelming support   my nominee for one important job the head of general services administration which help run the government be deny a vote for nine month   when she finally get a vote on her nomination she be confirm 96 to nothing   that be not advise and consent that be delay and obstruct

 one senator as you all be aware have put a hold on every single nominee that we have put forward due to a dispute over a couple of earmark in his state   in our meeting i ask the congressional leadership to put a stop to these hold in which nominee for critical job be deny a vote for month   surely we can set aside partisanship and do what be traditionally be do to confirm these nomination   if the senate do not act and i make this very clear if the senate do not act to confirm these nominee i will consider make several recess appointment during the upcoming recess because we can not afford to allow politic to stand in the way of a well function government

 my hope be that this will be the first of a series of meeting that i have with leadership of both party in congress   we have get to get past the tired debate that have plague our politic and leave behind nothing but soar debt and mount challenge great hardship among the american people and extraordinary frustration among the american people   those frustration be what lead i to run for president and as long as i be here in washington i intend to try to make this government work on their behalf

 so you know i be go to take a couple of question guy

 major

 q     after meet with you john boehner come out and tell we the house can not pass the health care bill it once pass the senate can not pass the health care bill it once pass   why would we have a conversation about legislation that can not pass   as a part of that he say you and your white house and congressional democrats should start over entirely from scratch on health care reform   how do you respond   be you willing to do that

 the president   well here be how i respond to john in the meeting and i have say this publicly before   there be some core goal that have to be meet   we have get to control cost both for family and business but also for our government   everybody out there who talk about deficit have to acknowledge that the single big driver of our deficit be health care spending   we can not deal with our deficit and debt long term unless we get a handle on that   so that have to be part of a package

 number two we have get to deal with insurance abuse that affect million of americans who have get health insurance   and number three we have get to make health insurance more available to folk in the individual market as i just mention in california who be suddenly see their premium go up 39 percent   that apply to the majority of small business as well as sole proprietor   they be struggle

 so i have get these goal   now we have a package as we work through the difference between the house and the senate and we will put it up on a web site for all to see over a long period of time that meet those criterion meet those goal   but when i be in baltimore talk to the house republicans they indicate we can accomplish some of these goal at no cost   and i say great let i see it   and i have no interest in do something that be more expensive and hard to accomplish if somebody else have an easy way to do it

 so i be go to be start from scratch in the sense that i will be open to any idea that help promote these goal   what i will not do what i do not think make sense and i do not think the american people want to see would be another year of partisan wrangle around these issue another six month or eight month or nine month worth of hearing in every single committee in the house and the senate in which there be a lot of posturing   let us get the relevant party together let us put the good idea on the table   my hope be that we can find enough overlap that we can say this be the right way to move forward even if i do not get every single thing that i want

 but here be the point that i make to john boehner and mitch mcconnell   bipartisanship can not be that i agree to all the thing that they believe in or want and they agree to none of the thing i believe in and want and that be the price of bipartisanship right   but that be sometimes the way it get present   mitch mcconnell say something very nice in the meeting about how he support our goal on nuclear energy and clean coal technology and more drilling to increase oil production   well of course he like that that be part of the republican agenda for energy which i accept   and i be willing to move off some of the preference of my party in order to meet they halfway   but there be get to be some give from their side as well   that be true on health care that be true on energy that be true on financial reform   that be what i be hope get accomplish at the summit

 q     do you agree the house and senate bill can not pass anymore

 the president   what i agree with be that the public have sour on the process that they see over the last year   i think that actually contaminate how they view the substance of the bill   i think it be important for all of these issue to be air so that people have confidence if we be move forward on such a significant part of the economy as health care that there be complete transparency and all of these issue have be adequately vet and adequately debate

 and this give an opportunity not just for democrats to say here be what we think we should do but it also give republicans a showcase before the entire country to say here be our plan here be why we think this will work   and one of the thing that john boehner and mitch mcconnell both say be they do not think that the status quo be acceptable and that be right there promise   that indicate that if all side agree that we can not just continue with business as usual then maybe we can actually get something do

 q     mr. president one of the reason anthem say anthem blue cross say that it be raise its premium be because so many people be drop out of individual coverage because the economy be so bad and that leave the people in the pool who be people who need medical care drive up cost   one of the reason why business be not expand right now in addition to some of the credit issue you have talk about at least accord to business leader be they say there be an uncertainty of what they need to plan for because of the energy bill because of health care   that be what they say   i be not say it be true or not but that be what they say   what do you say when you hear that

 the president   well i think that the big uncertainty have be we just go through the bad recession since the great depression and people be not sure whether the financial system be go to melt down and whether we be go to tip into a endless recession   so let us be clear about the source of uncertainty in term of business investment over the last several year   a huge contraction trillion of dollar of loss in people 's 401(k)s people have a lot of debt come out of the previous decade that they still have not work out the housing market lose a whole bunch of value

 so the good news be that where we be contract by 6 percent the economy be now grow by 6 percent   the ceo i talk to be say they be now make investment and i anticipate that they be go to start hire at a more rapid clip   what i have also hear be they say that we would like to feel like washington be work and able to get some thing do
 there be two way of interpret the issue of uncertainty   one way would be to say well you know what we will just go back to what we be do before on let us say the financial market   we will not have the regulation that we need we will not make any change in term of too big to fail   that will provide certainty until the next financial crisis

 that be not the kind of certainty i think that the financial market need   the kind of certainty they need be for we to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rule of the road in place so that consumer be protect in the financial market so that we do not have bank that be too big to fail that we have way of wind they down and protect the overall system without taxpayer bailout   that require legislation   the soon we can get that do the well

 the same would be true when it come to health care   a lot of ceo i hear from will say boy we would like you to get health care settle one way or another but they will acknowledge that when they open up their late invoice for their premium and they find out that those premium have go up 20 percent or 25 percent that be the kind of uncertainty that also tamp down business investment

 so i guess my answer would be this   the soon the business community have a sense that we have get our act together here in washington and can move forward on big serious issue in a substantive way without a lot of posturing and partisan wrangling i think the well off the entire country be go to be   i absolutely agree on that

 what i think be important be not to buy into this notion that be perpetrate by some of the business interest that get a stake in this who be fight financial reform for example to say boy we would be do fine if we just do not try to regulate the bank   that i think would be a mistake

 q     just to play devil 's advocate on that a small business let us say not somebody who be go to be affect by the regulatory reform small business you have propose you would acknowledge a bold agenda   and a small business might wonder i do not know how the energy bill be go to affect i i do not know how the health care reform bill be go to affect i i would well hold off on hire

 the president   the small business i talk to and i have be talk to a lot of they as i have be travel around the country over the last several month their big problem be right now they can not get credit out of their bank so they be uncertain about that   and they be still uncertain about order do they just have enough customer to justify they do more

 it be look well at this point   but that be not the rationale for people say i be not hire   let i put it this way   most small business right now if they have get enough customer to make a profit and they can get the bank loan require to boost their payroll boost their inventory and sell to those customer they will do so   okay

 let us see let us get a print guy here   david

 q     you hear mcconnell talk about nuclear power offshore drilling free trade that be a lot of republican stuff   be your party go to go for that if you decide to support that

 the president   you know i think that on energy there should be a bipartisan agreement that we have to take a both and approach rather than an either or approach   what do i mean by that i be very firm in my conviction that the country that lead the way in clean energy solar wind biodiesel geothermal that country be go to win the race in the 21st century global economy   so we have to move in that direction

 what be also true be that give our energy need in order to continue economic growth produce job make sure our business be competitive around the world that we be go to need some of the old traditional energy source as we be develop these new one and ramp they up   so we can not overnight convert to an all solar or an all wind economy   that just can not happen   we be go to have need in these traditional source

 and so the question then be be we go to be able to put together a package that include safe secure nuclear power that include new technology so that we can use coal which we have in abundance and be very cheap but often be add to our greenhouse gas can we find sequestration technology that clean that up can we identify opportunity to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that be environmentally sustainable   and that should be part of a package with our development of clean energy

 and my hope be that my republican friend but also democrats say to themselves let us be practical and let us do both   let us not just do one or the other let us do both   over time i think the transition be go to be more and more clean energy and over time fossil fuel become less prominent in our overall energy mix   but we have get to do both

 q     how confident be you there will be that kind of consensus for that double edged approach

 the president   i be just a eternal optimist laughter and so it be the right thing to do   and all i can do be just to keep on make the argument about what be right for the country and assume that over time people regardless of party regardless of their particular political position be go to gravitate towards the truth   okay

 i be go to take two more   let us see

 q     how about the back   laughter

 the president   well i just want to make sure that i be get a balance here so go ahead chuck

 q     awwww

 the president   why be everybody moan about todd

 q     he be too good   his question be too precise   laughter

 q     iran we get the news today that they be do more of these try to enhance this uranium even more   obviously secretary gates today in paris be quote as say basically the dialogue seem to be over and now the question be sanction   where be we on sanction   how close be this   i know you have sort of an end of the year deadline when you stand up there with sarkozy and brown   it be now february   how quickly be this move along

 the president   well it be move along fairly quickly   i think that we have bend over backwards to say to the islamic republic of iran that we be willing to have a constructive conversation about how they can align themselves with international norm and rule and reenter as full member of the international community

 the most obvious attempt be when we give they an offer that say we be go to provide the conversion of some of the low enrich uranium that they already have into the isotope that they need for their medical research and for hospital that would serve up to a million iranian citizen   they reject it although one of the difficulty in deal with iran over the last several month be it be not always clear who be speak on behalf of the government and we get a lot of different mixed signal   but what be clear be be that they have not say yes to an agreement that russia china germany france great britain and the united states all say be a good deal and that the director of the iaea say be the right thing to do and that iran should accept

 that indicate to we that despite their posturing that their nuclear power be only for civilian use that they in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization   and that be not acceptable to the international community not just to the united states   so what we have say from the start be we be move on dual track   if you want to accept the kind of agreement with the international community that lead you down a path of be a member of good standing then we welcome you   if not

 q     have not they respond though   i mean by decide to do what they do with these

 the president   well i be get to that

 q     okay

 the president   and if not then the next step be sanction   they have make their choice so far although the door be still open   and what we be go to be work on over the next several week be develop a significant regime of sanction that will indicate to they how isolated they be from the international community as a whole

 q     what do you mean by regime of sanction

 the president   well mean that there be go to be a

 q     some will be u.n. and some will be

 the president   we be go to be look at a variety of way in which country indicate to iran that their approach be unacceptable   and the u.n. will be one aspect of that broad effort

 q     china will be there   you be confident

 the president   well the we be confident right now that the international community be unify around iran 's misbehavior in this area   how china operate at the security council as we pursue sanction be something that we be go to have to see   one thing i be pleased about be to see how forward lean the russians have be on this issue   i think they clearly have see that iran have not be serious about solve what be a solvable dispute between iran and the international community

 all right   i be go to make this the last question   and i will take somebody from the back yes

 q     i

 the president   yes

 q     thank for do this   it be be a while   laughter   on health care the republicans be ask whether the february 25th session will include economist and public interest group and people support your side or will it just be the member of congress   and on anthem blue cross do you have the authority to go in and tell a private company they can not charge that how will you stop they

 the president   well i do not have the authority as i understand it i can not simply issue an executive order lower everybody 's rate   if i could i would have do that already and save myself a lot of grief on capitol hill   that be why reform be so important   that be why the status quo be unacceptable

 but there be no shortcut in deal with this issue   i know the american people get frustrated in debate something like health care because you get a whole bunch of different claim be make by different group and different interest   it be a big complicated tough issue   but what be also true be that without some action on the part of congress it be very unlikely that we see any improvement over the current trajectory   and the current trajectory be premium keep on go up 10 15 20 30 percent   the current trajectory be more and more people be lose health care

 i do not know if people note because during the health care debate everybody be say the president be try to take over a government takeover of health care   i do not know if anybody notice that for the first time this year you see more people get health care from government than you do from the private sector not because of anything we do but because more and more people be lose their health care from their employer   it be become unaffordable   that be what we be try to prevent

 we want people to be able to get health care from their employer   but we also understand that you have get to fix the system so that people be able to get it at affordable rate and small business can afford to give their employee insurance at an affordable rate   and that be not happen right now

 to your question about the 25th my hope be that this do not end up be political theater as i think some of you have phrase it   i want a substantive discussion   we have not refine exactly how the agenda be go to go that day   we want to talk with both the democratic and republican leader to find out what they think would be most useful   i do want to make sure that there be some people like the congressional budget office for example that be consider non partisan who can answer question

 in this whole health care debate i be remind of the story that be tell about senator moynihan who be i guess in an argument with one of his colleague and his colleague be lose the argument so he get a little flustered and say to senator moynihan well i be entitled to my own opinion   and senator moynihan say well you be entitled to your own opinion but you be not entitle to your own fact   i think that be the key to a successful dialogue on the 25th or on health care

 let us establish some common fact   let us establish what the issue be what the problem be and let us test out in front of the american people what idea work and what idea do not   and if we can establish that factual accuracy about how different approach would work then i think we can make some progress   and it may be that some of the fact that come up be one that make my party a little bit uncomfortable   so if it be establish that by work seriously on medical malpractice and tort reform that we can reduce some of those cost i have say from the beginning of this debate i would be willing to work on that   on the other hand if i be tell that that be only a fraction of the problem and that be not the big driver of health care cost then i be also go to insist okay let us look at that as one aspect of it but what else be we willing to do

 and this be where it get back to the point i be make early   bipartisanship can not mean simply that democrats give up everything that they believe in find the handful of thing that republicans have be advocate for and we do those thing and then we have bipartisanship   that be not how it work in any other realm of life   that be certainly not how it work in my marriage with michelle although i usually do give in most of the time   laughter   but the there be get to be some give and take and that be what i be hope can be accomplish   and i be confident that be what the american people be look for

 so all right

 q     jobs question

 the president   okay since there be not a job question

 q     well i just

 the president   i will make this the last one job question

 q     at the stakeout the republicans be say well the job package we have see it be not really ready yet we be a little worried about the cost   be you satisfied that there be something that can be quickly move through congress on job

 the president   well my understanding be first of all the house have move forward a job package that have some good element in it   my understanding be be that there be bipartisan talk take place as we speak on the senate side about some element of a package

 i think there be some thing that a lot of people agree on   just to give you an example the idea of eliminate capital gain for small business something we can all agree on   i talk about it at the state of the union address   my hope would be that we would all agree on a mechanism to get community bank who be lend to small business more capital because that be something that i keep on hearing be one of the big problem that small business have out there

 so i think that it be realistic for we to get a package move quickly that may not include all the thing i think need to be do and it may be that that first package build some trust and confidence that democrats and republicans on capitol hill can work together and then we move on to the next aspect of the package and so forth   it may take a series of incremental step but the one thing i be absolutely clear about be be that we have get an economy that be grow right now a huge boost in productivity that be the good news   the bad news be be that company still have not take that final step in actually put people on their payroll full time

 we be see an increase in temporary worker but they have not yet take on that full time worker   and so provide some additional impetus to they right as the economy be move in a positive direction i think can end up yield some good result

 all right   thank you guy   that be pretty good thank

 i want to thank mayor tom perciak here in strongsville   please mr. mayor you ’re on   applause   that be a good bunch of folk we get here in ohio work hard   which be why i be glad to be back and let ’s face it it ’ nice to be out of washington once in a while   laughter

 i want to thank connie i want to thank connie who introduce i   i want to thank she and her family for be here on behalf of her sister natoma   i do not know if everybody understand that natoma be in the hospital right now so connie be fill in   it ’ not easy to share such a personal story when your sister who you love so much be sick   and so i appreciate connie be willing to do so here today and applause and i want everybody to understand that connie and her sister be the reason that i ’m here today   applause

 see connie feel it be important that her sister ’s story be tell   but i want to just repeat what happen here   last month i get a letter from connie ’s sister natoma   she ’ self employ she ’s try to make end meet and for year she ’s do the responsible thing just like most of you have   she buy insurance she do not have a big employer who provide her insurance so she buy her health insurance through the individual market

 and it be important for she to have insurance because 16 year ago she be diagnose with a treatable form of cancer   and even though she have be cancer free for more than a decade the insurance company keep on jack up her rate year after year   so she increase her out of pocket expense   she raise her deductible   she do everything she could to maintain her health insurance that would be there just in case she get sick because she figure i do not want to be she do not want to be in a position where if she do get sick somebody else would have to pick up the tab that she ’d have to go to the emergency room that the cost would be shift onto folk through their high insurance premium or hospital charge high rate   so she try to do the right thing

 and she up her deductible last year to the minimum sic the high possible deductible   but despite that natoma ’s insurance company raise her premium by more than 25 percent   and over the past year she pay more than $ 6,000 in monthly premium

 audience   boo

 the president   she pay more than $ 4,000 in out of pocket medical cost for co pay and medical care and prescription   so all together this woman pay $ 10,000 one year   but because she never hit her deductible her insurance company only spend $ 900 on her care   so the insurance company be make get $ 10,000 pay out $ 900   now what come in the mail at the end of last year

 audience member   a bill

 audience member   a rate hike

 the president   it ’ a letter tell natoma that her premium would go up again by more than 40 percent

 audience   boo

 the president   so here ’ what happen   she just could not afford it   she do not have the money   she realize that if she pay those health insurance premium that have be jack up by 40 percent she could not make her mortgage   and despite her desire to keep her coverage despite her fear that she would get sick and lose the home that her parent build she finally surrender she finally give up her health insurance   she stop pay it she could not make end meet

 so january be she last month of be insure   like so many responsible americans folk who work hard every day who try to do the right thing she be force to hang her fortune on chance   to take a chance that ’s all she could do   she hope against hope that she would stay healthy   she fear terribly that she might not stay healthy

 that be the letter that i read to the insurance company include the person responsible for raise her rate   now i understand natoma be pretty surprised when she find out that i have read it to these ceo   but i think it be important for they to understand the human dimension of this problem   her rate have be hike more than 40 percent

 and this be less than two week ago   unfortunately natoma ’s bad fear be realize   and just last week she be work on a nearby farm walk outside apparently chase after a cow laughter when she collapse   and she be rush to the hospital   she be very sick   she need two blood transfusion   doctor perform a battery of test   and on saturday natoma be diagnose with leukemia

 now the reason natoma be not here today be that she ’s lie on a hospital bed suddenly face with this emergency suddenly face with the fight of her life   she expect to face more than a month of aggressive chemotherapy   she be rack with worry not only about her illness but about the cost of the test and the treatment that she ’s surely go to need to beat it

 so you want to know why i ’m here ohio   i ’m here because of natoma   applause    i ’m here because of the countless other who have be force to face the most terrifying challenge in their life with the add burden of medical bill they can not pay   i do not think that ’ right   applause    neither do you   that ’ why we need health insurance right now   health insurance reform right now   applause

 audience   obama   obama   obama   obama

 the president   i ’m here because of my own mother ’s story   she die of cancer and in the last six month of her life she be on the phone in her hospital room argue with insurance company instead of focus on get well and spend time with her family

 i ’m here because of the million who be deny coverage because of preexist condition or drop from coverage when they get sick   applause

 i ’m here because of the small business who be force to choose between health care and hiring   applause

 i ’m here because of the senior unable to afford the prescription that they need   applause

 i ’m here because of the folk see their premium go up 20 and 30 and 40 and 50 and 60 percent in a year   applause

 ohio i be here because that be not the america i believe in and that ’ not the america that you believe in

 audience member   what ’s your plan

 the president   so when you hear people say start over

 audience   no

 the president   i want you to think about natoma   when you hear people say that this be n’t the right time you think about what she ’s go through   when you hear people talk about well what do this mean for the democrats   what do this mean for the republicans   i do not know how the poll be do   when you hear people more worried about the politic of it than what ’s right and what ’ wrong i want you to think about natoma and the million of people all across this country who be look for some help and look for some relief   that ’ why we need health insurance reform right now   applause

 part of what make this issue difficult be most of we do have health insurance we still do   and so and so we kind of feel like well i do n’t know it ’s kind of work for i i ’m not worry too much   but what we have to understand be that what ’s happen to natoma there but for the grace of god go any one of we   applause   anybody here if you lose your job right now and after the cobra run out

 audience member faint

 the president   it look like we ’ve get somebody who might ’ve faint down there so if we ’ve get a medic   no no no   hold on   i ’m talk about there ’s somebody who might ’ve faint right down here so if we can get a medic just back here   they ’re probably okay   just give she or he some space

 audience member   hope you have insurance   laughter

 the president   so let ’s just think about think about if you lose your job right now   how many people here might have have a preexisting condition that would mean it ’d be very hard to get health insurance on the individual market   think about if you want to change job   think about if you want to start your own business but you suddenly have to give up your health insurance on your job   think about what happen if a child of your heaven forbid get diagnose with something that make it hard for they to insure
 for so many people it may not be a problem right now but it ’s go to be a problem later at any point   and even if you ’ve get good health insurance what ’s happen to your premium   what ’s happen to your co payment   what ’s happen to your deductible   they ’re all go up   that ’ money straight out of your pocket
 so the bottom line be this   the status quo on health care be simply unsustainable   applause   we can not have we can not have a system that work well for the insurance company than it do for the american people   applause
 and we know what will happen if we fail to act   we know that our government will be plunge deeply into debt   we know that million more people will lose their coverage   we know that rise cost will saddle million more family with unaffordable expense   and a lot of small business be just go to drop their coverage altogether   that ’ already what ’s be happen
 a study come out just yesterday this be a nonpartisan study it ’s find that without reform premium could more than double for individual and family over the next decade   family policy could go to an average of $ 25,000 or more   can you afford that
 audience   no
 the president   you think your employer can afford that
 audience   no
 the president   your employer can not sustain that   so what ’s go to happen be they ’re basically more and more of they be just go to say you know what   you ’re on your own on this
 we have debate this issue now for more than a year   every proposal have be put on the table   every argument have be make   i know a lot of people view this as a partisan issue but look the fact be both party have a lot of area where we agree it ’s just politic be get in the way of actually get it do   applause

 somebody ask what ’s our plan   let i describe exactly what we ’re do because we ’ve end up with a proposal that incorporate the good idea from democrats and republicans even though republicans do not give we any credit   laughter   that ’ all right

 you know if you think about the debate around health care reform there be some who want to scrap the system of private insurance and replace it with government run care   and look that work in a number of place but i do not see that be practical to help right away for people who really need it

 and on the other end of the spectrum and this be what a lot of the republicans be say right now there be those who simply believe that the answer be to unleash the insurance industry to deregulate they far provide they less oversight and few rule

 audience   boo

 the president   this be call the fox guard the henhouse approach to health insurance reform   laughter   so what it would do be it would give insurance company more leeway to raise premium more leeway to deny care   it would segment the market far   it would be good if you be rich and healthy   you ’d save money   but if you ’re an ordinary person if you get old if you get a little sicker you ’d be pay more

 now i do not believe we should give the government or insurance company more control over health care in america   i believe it ’ time to give you the american people more control over your own health insurance   applause

 and that ’ what our proposal do   our proposal build on the current system where most americans get their health insurance from their employer   so if you like your plan you can keep your plan   if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor   i do not want to interfere with people ’s relationship between they and their doctor

 essentially here ’s what my proposal would change   three thing about the current health care system but three important thing

 number one it would end the bad practice of the insurance company   applause   all right   this be like a patient ’s bill of right on steroid   laughter   within the first year of sign health care reform thousand of uninsured americans with preexist condition will be able to purchase health insurance for the first time in their life or the first time since they get sick   applause   this year insurance company will be ban forever from deny coverage to child with preexist condition   so parent can have a little bit of security   applause   this year under this legislation insurance company will be ban from drop your coverage when you get sick   those practice would end   applause

 with this reform package all new insurance plan would be require to offer free preventive care to their customer start this year so free check up to catch preventable disease on the front end   that ’ a smart thing to do   applause   start this year if you buy a new plan there will not be lifetime or restrictive annual limit on the amount of care you receive from your insurance company so you will not be surprise by the fine print that say suddenly they ’ve stop pay and you now suddenly be $ 50,000 or $ 100,000 or $ 200,000 out of pocket   that will n’t that will not happen if this become law this year   applause
 i see i see some young people in the audience   applause   if you ’re an uninsured young adult you will be able to stay on your parent policy until you ’re 26 year old under this law   applause
 so number one number one be insurance reform   the second thing that this plan would change about the current system be this   for the first time uninsured individual small business they ’d have the same kind of choice of private health insurance that member of congress get for themselves   applause   understand if this reform become law member of congress they ’ll be get their insurance from the same place that the uninsured get theirs because if it ’ good enough for the american people it ’ good enough for the people who send we to washington   applause
 so basically what would happen be we ’d set up a pool of people million of people across the country would all buy into these pool that give they more negotiating power   if you work for a big company you ’ve get a well insurance deal because you ’ve get more bargaining power as a whole   we want you to have all the bargaining power that the federal employee have that big company have so you ’ll be able to buy in or a small business will be able to buy into this pool   and that will lower rate it ’s estimate by up to 14 to 20 percent over what you ’re currently get   that ’ money out of pocket
 and what my proposal say be if you still can not afford the insurance in this new marketplace then we ’re go to offer you tax credit to do so   and that will add up to the large middle class tax cut for health care in history   that ’ what we ’re go to do   applause
 now when i be talk about this at that health care summit some of you see it i sit there for about seven hour i know you guy watch the whole thing   laughter   but some of these folk say well we just that ’ a nice idea but we just can not afford to do that   look i want everybody to understand the wealthy among we can already buy the good insurance there be   the least well among we the poor among we they get their health care through medicaid   so it ’ the middle class it ’ work people that be getting squeeze and that ’ who we have to help and we can afford to do it   applause

 now it be true that provide these tax credit to middle class family and small business that ’s go to cost some money   it ’s go to cost about $ 100 billion per year   but most of this come from the nearly $ 2.5 trillion a year that americans already spend on health care   it ’ just right now a lot of that money be be spend badly

 so with this plan we ’re go to make sure the dollar we make the dollar that we spend on health care be go to make insurance more affordable and more secure   and we ’re go to eliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidy that currently go to insurance company   insurance company be make billion of dollar on subsidy from you the taxpayer   and if we take those subsidy away we can use they to help folk like natoma get health insurance so she do not lose her house   applause

 and yes we will set a new fee on insurance company because they stand to gain million more customer who be buy insurance   there ’ nothing wrong with they give something back   but here ’ the bottom line   our proposal be pay for which by the way be more than can be say for our colleague on the other side of the aisle when they pass that big prescription drug plan that cost about as much as my health care plan and they do not pay for any of it and it go straight to the deficit   and now they ’re up there on their high horse talk about well we do not want to expand the deficit   this plan do not expand the deficit   their plan expand the deficit   that ’ why we pay for what we do   that ’ the responsible thing to do   applause
 now so let i talk about the third thing which be my proposal would bring down the cost of health care for family for business and for the federal government   so americans buy comparable coverage to what they have today i already say this would see premium fall by 14 to 20 percent that ’s not my number that ’ what the nonpartisan congressional budget office say for americans who get their insurance through the workplace   how many people be get insurance through their job right now   raise your hand   all right   well a lot of those folk your employer it ’s estimate would see premium fall by as much as 3,000 percent sic which mean they could give you a raise   applause
 we have incorporate most of the serious idea from across the political spectrum about how to contain the rise cost of health care   we go after waste and abuse in the system especially in medicare   our cost cut measure would reduce most people ’s premium and bring down our deficit by up to a   trillion dollar over the next two decade   those be n’t my number   those be the number determine by the congressional budget office   they ’re the referee   that ’ what they say not what i say

 now the opponent of reform they ’ve try to make a lot of different argument to stop these change   you remember   first they say well there ’ a government takeover of health care   well that be n’t true   well that be n’t true   then they say well what about death panel   well that turn out that do not turn out to be true

 you know the most insidious argument they ’re make be the idea that somehow this would hurt medicare   i know we ’ve get some senior here with we today i could not tell you guy look great   laughter   i would not have guess   but want to tell you directly   this proposal add almost a decade of solvency to medicare   applause   this proposal would close the gap in prescription drug coverage call the doughnut hole you know something about that that stick senior with thousand of dollar in drug cost   this proposal will over time help to reduce the cost of medicare that you pay every month   this proposal would make preventive care free so you do not have to pay out of pocket for test to keep you healthy   applause

 so yes we ’re go after the waste the fraud the abuse in medicare   we be eliminate some of the insurance subsidy that should be go to your care   that ’s because these dollar should be spend on care for senior not on the care and feeding of the insurance company through sweetheart deal   and every senior should know there be no cutting of your guarantee medicare benefit   period   no if and or but   applause   this proposal make medicare strong it make the coverage well and it make the finance more secure   and anybody who say otherwise be either misinformed or they ’re try to misinform you   do not let they hoodwink you   they ’re try to hoodwink you   laughter

 so look ohio that ’s the proposal   and i believe congress owe the american people a final up or down vote   applause   we need an up or down vote   it ’ time to vote   and now as we get close to the vote there be a lot of hand wringing go on   we hear a lot of people in washington talk about politic talk about what this mean in november talk about the poll number for democrats and republicans
 audience member   we need courage
 the president   we need courage   applause   do you hear what somebody just say   applause   that ’ what we need   that ’ why i come here today   we need courage   applause
 we need courage   you know in the end this debate be about far more than politic   it come down to what kind of country do we want to be   it ’ about the million of life that would be touch and in some case save by make health insurance more secure and more affordable   applause   it ’ about a woman who ’s lie in a hospital bed who just want to be able to pay for the care she need   and the truth be what ’ at stake in this debate it ’ not just our ability to solve this problem it ’ about our ability to solve any problem

 i be talk to dennis kucinich on the way over here about this   i say you know what   it ’s be such a long time since we make government on the side of ordinary working folk applause where we do something for they that relieve some of their struggle that make folk who work hard every day and be do the right thing and who be look out for the family and contribute to their community that just give they a little bit of a well chance to live out their american dream
 the american people want to know if it ’ still possible for washington to look out for these interest for their future   so what they ’re look for be some courage   they ’re wait for we to act   they ’re wait for we to lead   they do not want we put our finger out to the wind   they do not want we read poll   they want we to look and see what be the good thing for america and then do what ’s right   applause   and as long as i hold this office i intend to provide that leadership   and i know these member of congress be go to provide that leadership   i do not know about the politic but i know what ’s the right thing to do   and so i ’m call on congress to pass these reform and i ’m go to sign they into law   i want some courage   i want we to do the right thing ohio   and with your help we ’re go to make it happen

 god bless you and god bless the united states of america   applause

thank you everybody thank you applause thank you so much thank you everybody please have a seat thank you

 i want to thank senator bill nelson and nasa administrator charlie bolden for their extraordinary leadership i want to recognize dr. buzz aldrin as well who ’s in the house applause four decade ago buzz become a legend but in the four decade since he ’s also be one of america ’s lead visionary and authority on human space flight

 few people present company exclude can claim the expertise of buzz and bill and charlie when it come to space exploration i have to say that few people be as singularly unimpressed by air force one as those three laughter sure it ’ comfortable but it can not even reach low earth orbit and that obviously be in strike contrast to the falcon 9 rocket we just see on the launch pad which will be test for the very first time in the come week

 a couple of other acknowledgment i want to make we ’ve get congresswoman sheila jackson lee from texas visit we a big supporter of the space program applause my director office of science and technology policy in other word my chief science advisor john holdren be here applause and most of all i want to acknowledge your congresswoman suzanne kosmas because every time i meet with she include the flight down here she remind i of how important our nasa program be and how important this facility be and she be fight for every single one of you and for her district and for the job in her district and you should know that you ’ve get a great champion in congresswoman kosmas please give she a big round of applause applause

 i also want to thank everybody for participate in today ’s conference and gather here be scientist engineer business leader public servant and a few more astronaut as well last but not least i want to thank the man and woman of nasa for welcome i to the kennedy space center and for your contribution not only to america but to the world

 here at the kennedy space center we be surround by monument and milestone of those contribution it be from here that nasa launch the mission of mercury and gemini and apollo it be from here that space shuttle discovery pilot by charlie bolden carry the hubble telescope into orbit allow we to plumb the deep recess of our galaxy and i should point out by the way that in my private office just off the oval i ’ve get the picture of jupiter from the hubble so thank you charlie for help to decorate my office laughter it be from here that man and woman propel by sheer nerve and talent set about push the boundary of humanity ’s reach

 that ’ the story of nasa and it ’ a story that start a little more than half a century ago far from the space coast in a remote and desolate region of what be now call kazakhstan because it be from there that the soviet union launch sputnik the first artificial satellite to orbit the earth which be little more than a few piece of metal with a transmitter and a battery strap to the top of a missile but the world be stun americans be dumbfound the soviets it be perceive have take the lead in a race for which we be not yet fully prepare

 but we catch up very quick president eisenhower sign legislation to create nasa and to invest in science and math education from grade school to graduate school in 1961 president kennedy boldly declare before a joint session of congress that the united states would send a man to the moon and return he safely to the earth within the decade and as a nation we set about meet that goal reap reward that have in the decade since touch every facet of our life nasa be at the forefront many give their career to the effort and some have give far more

 in the year that have follow the space race inspire a generation of scientist and innovator include i ’m sure many of you it ’s contribute to immeasurable technological advance that have improve our health and well being from satellite navigation to water purification from aerospace manufacturing to medical imaging although i have to say during a meeting right before i come out on stage somebody say you know it ’ more than just tang and i have to point out i actually really like tang laughter i think that be very cool

 and lead the world to space help america achieve new height of prosperity here on earth while demonstrate the power of a free and open society to harness the ingenuity of its people

 and on a personal note i have be part of that generation so inspire by the space program 1961 be the year of my birth the year that kennedy make his announcement and one of my early memory be sit on my grandfather ’s shoulder wave a flag as astronaut arrive in hawaii for i the space program have always capture an essential part of what it mean to be an american reach for new height stretch beyond what previously do not seem possible and so as president i believe that space exploration be not a luxury it ’ not an afterthought in america ’s quest for a bright future it be an essential part of that quest

 so today i ’d like to talk about the next chapter in this story the challenge face our space program be different and our imperative for this program be different than in decade past we ’re no long race against an adversary we ’re no long compete to achieve a singular goal like reach the moon in fact what be once a global competition have long since become a global collaboration but while the measure of our achievement have change a great deal over the past 50 year what we do or fail to do in seek new frontier be no less consequential for our future in space and here on earth

 so let i start by be extremely clear i be 100 percent committed to the mission of nasa and its future applause because broaden our capability in space will continue to serve our society in way that we can scarcely imagine because exploration will once more inspire wonder in a new generation spark passion and launch career and because ultimately if we fail to press forward in the pursuit of discovery we be cede our future and we be cede that essential element of the american character

 i know there have be a number of question raise about my administration ’s plan for space exploration especially in this part of florida where so many rely on nasa as a source of income as well as a source of pride and community and these question come at a time of transition as the space shuttle near its schedule retirement after almost 30 year of service and understandably this add to the worry of folk concern not only about their own future but about the future of the space program to which they ’ve devote their life

 but i also know that underlie these concern be a deep worry one that precede not only this plan but this administration it stem from the sense that people in washington drive sometimes less by vision than by politic have for year neglect nasa ’s mission and undermine the work of the professional who fulfill it we ’ve see that in the nasa budget which have rise and fall with the political wind

 but we can also see it in other way in the reluctance of those who hold office to set clear achievable objective to provide the resource to meet those objective and to justify not just these plan but the large purpose of space exploration in the 21st century

 all that have to change and with the strategy i ’m outline today it will we start by increase nasa ’s budget by $ 6 billion over the next five year even applause i want people to understand the context of this this be happen even as we have institute a freeze on discretionary spending and seek to make cut elsewhere in the budget

 so nasa from the start several month ago when i issue my budget be one of the area where we do not just maintain a freeze but we actually increase funding by $ 6 billion by do that we will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system include a probe of the sun ’s atmosphere new scout mission to mars and other destination and an advanced telescope to follow hubble allow we to peer deeply into the universe than ever before

 we will increase earth base observation to improve our understanding of our climate and our world science that will garner tangible benefit help we to protect our environment for future generation

 and we will extend the life of the international space station likely by more than five year while actually use it for its intend purpose conduct advanced research that can help improve the daily life of people here on earth as well as test and improve upon our capability in space this include technology like more efficient life support system that will help reduce the cost of future mission and in order to reach the space station we will work with a grow array of private company compete to make get to space easy and more affordable applause

 now i recognize that some have say it be unfeasible or unwise to work with the private sector in this way i disagree the truth be nasa have always rely on private industry to help design and build the vehicle that carry astronaut to space from the mercury capsule that carry john glenn into orbit nearly 50 year ago to the space shuttle discovery currently orbit overhead by buy the service of space transportation rather than the vehicle themselves we can continue to ensure rigorous safety standard be meet but we will also accelerate the pace of innovation as company from young startup to established leader compete to design and build and launch new mean of carry people and material out of our atmosphere

 in addition as part of this effort we will build on the good work already do on the orion crew capsule i ’ve direct charlie bolden to immediately begin develop a rescue vehicle use this technology so we be not force to rely on foreign provider if it become necessary to quickly bring our people home from the international space station and this orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be use in future deep space mission in fact orion will be readie for flight right here in this room applause

 next we will invest more than $ 3 billion to conduct research on an advanced heavy lift rocket a vehicle to efficiently send into orbit the crew capsule propulsion system and large quantity of supply need to reach deep space in develop this new vehicle we will not only look at revise or modify old model we want to look at new design new material new technology that will transform not just where we can go but what we can do when we get there and we will finalize a rocket design no later than 2015 and then begin to build it applause and i want everybody to understand that ’ at least two year early than previously plan and that ’ conservative give that the previous program be behind schedule and over budget

 at the same time after decade of neglect we will increase investment right away in other groundbreaking technology that will allow astronaut to reach space soon and more often to travel far and fast for less cost and to live and work in space for long period of time more safely that mean tackle major scientific and technological challenge how do we shield astronaut from radiation on long mission how do we harness resource on distant world how do we supply spacecraft with energy need for these far reach journey these be question that we can answer and will answer and these be the question whose answer no doubt will reap untold benefit right here on earth

 so the point be what we ’re look for be not just to continue on the same path we want to leap into the future we want major breakthrough a transformative agenda for nasa applause

 now yes pursue this new strategy will require that we revise the old strategy in part this be because the old strategy include the constellation program be not fulfil its promise in many way that ’s not just my assessment that ’s also the assessment of a panel of respected non partisan expert charge with look at these issue closely now despite this some have have harsh word for the decision we ’ve make include some individual who i ’ve get enormous respect and admiration for

 but what i hope be be that everybody will take a look at what we be plan consider the detail of what we ’ve lay out and see the merit as i ’ve describe they the bottom line be nobody be more committed to man space flight to human exploration of space than i be applause but we ’ve get to do it in a smart way and we can not just keep on do the same old thing that we ’ve be do and think that somehow be go to get we to where we want to go

 some have say for instance that this plan give up our leadership in space by fail to produce plan within nasa to reach low earth orbit instead of rely on company and other country but we will actually reach space fast and more often under this new plan in way that will help we improve our technological capacity and lower our cost which be both essential for the long term sustainability of space flight in fact through our plan we ’ll be send many more astronaut to space over the next decade applause

 there be also those who criticize our decision to end part of constellation as one that will hinder space exploration below sic low earth orbit but it ’ precisely by invest in groundbreake research and innovative company that we will have the potential to rapidly transform our capability even as we build on the important work already complete through project like orion for future mission and unlike the previous program we be set a course with specific and achievable milestone

 early in the next decade a set of crew flight will test and prove the system require for exploration beyond low earth orbit applause and by 2025 we expect new spacecraft design for long journey to allow we to begin the first ever crew mission beyond the moon into deep space applause so we ’ll start we ’ll start by send astronaut to an asteroid for the first time in history applause by the mid-2030 i believe we can send human to orbit mars and return they safely to earth and a landing on mars will follow and i expect to be around to see it applause

 but i want to repeat i want to repeat this critical to deep space exploration will be the development of breakthrough propulsion system and other advanced technology so i ’m challenge nasa to break through these barrier and we ’ll give you the resource to break through these barrier and i know you will with ingenuity and intensity because that ’ what you ’ve always do applause

 now i understand that some believe that we should attempt a return to the surface of the moon first as previously plan but i just have to say pretty bluntly here we ’ve be there before buzz have be there there ’ a lot more of space to explore and a lot more to learn when we do so i believe it ’ more important to ramp up our capability to reach and operate at a series of increasingly demand target while advance our technological capability with each step forward and that ’ what this strategy do and that ’ how we will ensure that our leadership in space be even strong in this new century than it be in the last applause

 finally i want to say a few word about job suzanne point out to i that the last time i be here i make a very clear promise that i would help in the transition into a new program to make sure that people who be already go through a tough time here in this region be help and despite some report to the contrary my plan will add more than 2,500 job along the space coast in the next two year compare to the plan under the previous administration so i want to make that point applause

 we ’re go to modernize the kennedy space center create job as we upgrade launch facility and there ’ potential for even more job as company in florida and across america compete to be part of a new space transportation industry and some of those industry leader be here today this hold the promise of generate more than 10,000 job nationwide over the next few year and many of these job will be create right here in florida because this be an area prime to lead in this competition

 now it ’ true there be floridians who will see their work on the shuttle end as the program wind down this be base on a decision that be make six year ago not six month ago but that do not make it any less painful for family and community affect as this decision become reality

 so i ’m propose in part because of strong lobbying by bill and by suzanne as well as charlie i ’m propose a $ 40 million initiative lead by a high level team from the white house nasa and other agency to develop a plan for regional economic growth and job creation and i expect this plan to reach my desk by august 15th applause it ’ an effort that will help prepare this already skilled workforce for new opportunity in the space industry and beyond

 so this be the next chapter that we can write together here at nasa we will partner with industry we will invest in cutting edge research and technology we will set far reach milestone and provide the resource to reach those milestone and step by step we will push the boundary not only of where we can go but what we can do

 fifty year after the creation of nasa our goal be no long just a destination to reach our goal be the capacity for people to work and learn and operate and live safely beyond the earth for extended period of time ultimately in way that be more sustainable and even indefinite and in fulfil this task we will not only extend humanity ’s reach in space we will strengthen america ’s leadership here on earth

 now i ’ll close by say this i know that some americans have ask a question that ’s particularly apt on tax day why spend money on nasa at all why spend money solve problem in space when we do n’t lack for problem to solve here on the ground and obviously our country be still reel from the bad economic turmoil we ’ve know in generation we have massive structural deficit that have to be close in the come year

 but you and i know this be a false choice we have to fix our economy we need to close our deficit but for penny on the dollar the space program have fuel job and entire industry for penny on the dollar the space program have improve our life advance our society strengthen our economy and inspire generation of americans and i have no doubt that nasa can continue to fulfill this role applause but that be why but i want to say clearly to those of you who work for nasa but to the entire community that have be so supportive of the space program in this area that be exactly why it ’ so essential that we pursue a new course and that we revitalize nasa and its mission not just with dollar but with clear aim and a large purpose

 now little more than 40 year ago astronaut descend the nine rung ladder of the lunar module call eagle and allow their foot to touch the dusty surface of the earth ’s only moon this be the culmination of a daring and perilous gambit of an endeavor that push the boundary of our knowledge of our technological prowess of our very capacity as human being to solve problem it be not just the great achievement in nasa ’s history it be one of the great achievement in human history

 and the question for we now be whether that be the beginning of something or the end of something i choose to believe it be only the beginning

 so thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america thank you applause

thank you very much   everybody please have a seat   thank you very much   well thank you   it be good to be back   applause   it be good to be back in new york it be good to be back in the great hall at cooper union   applause

 we ’ve get some special guest here that i want to acknowledge   congresswoman carolyn maloney be here in the house   applause   governor david paterson be here   applause   attorney general andrew cuomo   applause   state comptroller thomas dinapoli be here   applause   the mayor of new york city michael bloomberg   applause   dr. george campbell jr. president of cooper union   applause   and all the citywide elect official who be here   thank you very much for your attendance

 it be wonderful to be back in cooper union where generation of leader and citizen have come to defend their idea and contest their difference   it ’ also good to be back in lower manhattan a few block from wall street   laughter   it really be good to be back because wall street be the heart of our nation ’s financial sector

 now since i last speak here two year ago our country have be through a terrible trial   more than 8 million people have lose their job   countless small business have have to shut their door   trillion of dollar in saving have be lose force senior to put off retirement young people to postpone college entrepreneur to give up on the dream of start a company   and as a nation we be force to take unprecedented step to rescue the financial system and the broad economy

 and as a result of the decision we make some of which let ’s face it be very unpopular we be see hopeful sign   a little more than one year ago we be lose an average of 750,000 job each month   today america be add job again   one year ago the economy be shrink rapidly   today the economy be grow   in fact we ’ve see the fast turnaround in growth in nearly three decade

 but you ’re here and i ’m here because we ’ve get more work to do   until this progress be feel not just on wall street but on main street we can not be satisfied   until the million of our neighbor who be look for work can find a job and wage be grow at a meaningful pace we may be able to claim a technical recovery but we will not have truly recover   and even as we seek to revive this economy it ’s also incumbent on we to rebuild it strong than before   we do not want an economy that have the same weakness that lead to this crisis   and that mean address some of the underlie problem that lead to this turmoil and devastation in the first place
 now one of the most significant contributor to this recession be a financial crisis as dire as any we ’ve know in generation at least since the 30   and that crisis be bear of a failure of responsibility from wall street all the way to washington that bring down many of the world ’s large financial firm and nearly drag our economy into a second great depression

 it be that failure of responsibility that i speak about when i come to new york more than two year ago before the bad of the crisis have unfold   it be back in 2007   and i take no satisfaction in note that my comment then have largely be bear out by the event that follow   but i repeat what i say then because it be essential that we learn the lesson from this crisis so we do n’t doom ourselves to repeat it   and make no mistake that be exactly what will happen if we allow this moment to pass and that ’ an outcome that be unacceptable to i and it ’ unacceptable to you the american people   applause

 as i say on this stage two year ago i believe in the power of the free market   i believe in a strong financial sector that help people to raise capital and get loan and invest their saving   that ’ part of what have make america what it be   but a free market be never mean to be a free license to take whatever you can get however you can get it   that ’ what happen too often in the year lead up to this crisis   some and let i be clear not all but some on wall street forget that behind every dollar trade or leverage there ’s family look to buy a house or pay for an education open a business save for retirement   what happen on wall street have real consequence across the country across our economy

 i ’ve speak before about the need to build a new foundation for economic growth in the 21st century   and give the importance of the financial sector wall street reform be an absolutely essential part of that foundation   without it our house will continue to sit on shift sand and our family business and the global economy will be vulnerable to future crisis   that ’ why i feel so strongly that we need to enact a set of updated commonsense rule to ensure accountability on wall street and to protect consumer in our financial system   applause

 now here ’s the good news   a comprehensive plan to achieve these reform have already pass the house of representatives   applause   a senate version be currently be debate draw on idea from democrats and republicans   both bill represent significant improvement on the flawed rule that we have in place today despite the furious effort of industry lobbyist to shape this legislation to their special interest

 and for those of you in the financial sector i be sure that some of these lobbyist work for you and they ’re do what they be be pay to do   but i ’m here today specifically when i speak to the titan of industry here because i want to urge you to join we instead of fight we in this effort   applause   i ’m here because i believe that these reform be in the end not only in the good interest of our country but in the good interest of the financial sector   and i ’m here to explain what reform will look like and why it matter

 now first the bill be consider in the senate would create what we do not have before and that be a way to protect the financial system and the broad economy and american taxpayer in the event that a large financial firm begin to fail   if there ’ a lehmans or an aig how can we respond in a way that do n’t force taxpayer to pick up the tab or alternatively could bring down the whole system

 in an ordinary local bank when it approach insolvency we ’ve get a process an orderly process through the fdic that ensure that depositor be protect maintain confidence in the banking system and it work   customer and taxpayer be protect and owner and management lose their equity   but we do not have that kind of process design to contain the failure of a lehman brothers or any of the large and most interconnect financial firm in our country

      that ’ why when this crisis begin crucial decision about what would happen to some of the world ’s big company company employ ten of thousand of people and hold hundred of billion of dollar in asset have to take place in hurried discussion in the middle of the night   and that ’ why to save the entire economy from an even bad catastrophe we have to deploy taxpayer dollar   now much of that money have now be pay back and my administration have propose a fee to be pay by large financial firm to recover all the money every dime because the american people should never have be put in that position in the first place   applause

 but this be why we need a system to shut these firm down with the least amount of collateral damage to innocent people and innocent business   and from the start i ’ve insist that the financial industry not taxpayer shoulder the cost in the event that a large financial company should falter   the goal be to make certain that taxpayer be never again on the hook because a firm be deem too big to fail

 now there ’ a legitimate debate take place about how good to ensure taxpayer be hold harmless in this process   and that ’ a legitimate debate and i encourage that debate   but what ’ not legitimate be to suggest that somehow the legislation be propose be go to encourage future taxpayer bailout as some have claim   that make for a good sound bite but it ’ not factually accurate   it be not true   applause   in fact the system as it stand the system as it stand be what lead to a series of massive costly taxpayer bailout   and it ’ only with reform that we can avoid a similar outcome in the future   in other word a vote for reform be a vote to put a stop to taxpayer fund bailout   that ’ the truth   end of story   and nobody should be fool in this debate   applause

 by the way these change have the add benefit of create incentive within the industry to ensure that no one company can ever threaten to bring down the whole economy

 to that end the bill would also enact what ’s know as the volcker rule and there ’ a tall guy sit in the front row here paul volcker applause who we name it after   and it do something very simple   it place some limit on the size of bank and the kind of risk that banking institution can take   this will not only safeguard our system against crisis this will also make our system strong and more competitive by instill confidence here at home and across the globe   market depend on that confidence   part of what lead to the turmoil of the past two year be that in the absence of clear rule and sound practice people do not trust that our system be one in which it be safe to invest or lend   as we ’ve see that harm all of we

 so by enact these reform we ’ll help ensure that our financial system and our economy continue to be the envy of the world   that ’ the first thing make sure that we can wind down one firm if it get into trouble without bring the whole system down or force taxpayer to fund a bailout

 number two reform would bring new transparency to many financial market   as you know part of what lead to this crisis be firm like aig and other who be make huge and risky bet use derivative and other complicated financial instrument in way that defy accountability or even common sense   in fact many practice be so opaque so confusing so complex that the people inside the firm do not understand they   much less those who be charge with oversee they   they be not fully aware of the massive bet that be be place   that ’ what lead warren buffett to describe derivative that be buy and sell with little oversight as financial weapon of mass destruction   that ’ what he call they   and that ’ why reform will rein in excess and help ensure that these kind of transaction take place in the light of day

      now there ’s be a great deal of concern about these change   so i want to reiterate   there be a legitimate role for these financial instrument in our economy   they can help allay risk and spur investment   and there be a lot of company that use these instrument to that legitimate end they be manage exposure to fluctuate price or currency fluctuate market   for example a business might hedge against rise oil price by buy a financial product to secure stable fuel cost so an airline might have an interest in lock in a decent price   that ’ how market be suppose to work   the problem be these market operate in the shadow of our economy invisible to regulator invisible to the public   so reckless practice be rampant   risk accrue until they threaten our entire financial system

 and that ’ why these reform be design to respect legitimate activity but prevent reckless risk taking   that ’ why we want to ensure that financial product like standardized derivative be trade out in the open in the full view of business investor and those charge with oversight

 and i be encourage to see a republican senator join with democrats this week in move forward on this issue   that be a good sign   applause   that be a good sign   for without action we ’ll continue to see what amount to highly leverage loosely monitor gambling in our financial system put taxpayer and the economy in jeopardy   and the only people who ought to fear the kind of oversight and transparency that we be propose be those whose conduct will fail this scrutiny

 third this plan would enact the strong consumer financial protection ever   applause and that be absolutely necessary because this financial crisis be not just the result of decision make in the executive suite on wall street it be also the result of decision make around kitchen table across america by folk who take on mortgage and credit card and auto loan   and while it ’ true that many americans take on financial obligation that they know or should have know they could not have afford million of other be frankly dupe   they be mislead by deceptive term and condition bury deep in the fine print

 and while a few company make out like bandit by exploit their customer our entire economy be make more vulnerable   million of people have now lose their home   ten of million more have lose value in their home   just about every sector of our economy have feel the pain whether you ’re pave driveway in arizona or sell house in ohio or you be do home repair in california or you ’re use your home equity to start a small business in florida

 that ’ why we need to give consumer more protection and more power in our financial system   this be not about stifle competition stifle innovation it ’ just the opposite   with a dedicated agency set ground rule and look out for ordinary people in our financial system we will empower consumer with clear and concise information when they ’re make financial decision   so instead of compete to offer confusing product company will compete the old fashioned way by offer well product   and that will mean more choice for consumer more opportunity for business and more stability in our financial system   and unless your business model depend on bilk people there be little to fear from these new rule   applause

 number four the last key component of reform   these wall street reform will give shareholder new power in the financial system   they will get what we call a say on pay a voice with respect to the salary and bonus award to top executive   and the sec will have the authority to give shareholder more say in corporate election so that investor and pension holder have a strong role in determine who manage the company in which they ’ve place their saving

 now americans do n’t begrudge anybody for success when that success be earn   but when we read in the past and sometimes in the present about enormous executive bonus at firm even as they ’re rely on assistance from taxpayer or they ’re take huge risk that threaten the system as a whole or their company be do badly it offend our fundamental value

 not only that some of the salary and bonus that we ’ve see create perverse incentive to take reckless risk that contribute to the crisis   it ’ what help lead to a relentless focus on a company ’s next quarter to the detriment of its next year or its next decade   and it lead to a situation in which folk with the most to lose stock and pension holder have the least to say in the process   and that have to change   applause

 let i close by say this   i have lay out a set of wall street reform   these be reform that would put an end to taxpayer bailout that would bring complex financial dealing out of the shadow that would protect consumer and that would give shareholder more power in the financial system   but let ’s face it we also need reform in washington   applause   and the debate the debate over these change be a perfect example

 i mean we have see battalion of financial industry lobbyist descend on capitol hill firm spend million to influence the outcome of this debate   we ’ve see mislead argument and attack that be design not to improve the bill but to weaken or to kill it   we ’ve see a bipartisan process buckle under the weight of these wither force even as we‘ve produce a proposal that by all account be a commonsense reasonable non ideological approach to target the root problem that lead to the turmoil in our financial sector and ultimately in our entire economy

      so we ’ve see business as usual in washington but i believe we can and must put this kind of cynical politic aside   we ’ve get to put an end to it   that ’ why i ’m here today   applause   that ’ why i ’m here today

 and to those of you who be in the financial sector let i say this we will not always see eye to eye   we will not always agree   but that do not mean that we ’ve get to choose between two extreme   we do not have to choose between market that be unfettere by even modest protection against crisis or market that be stymie by onerous rule that suppress enterprise and innovation   that be a false choice   and we need no more proof than the crisis that we ’ve just be through

 you see there have always be a tension between the desire to allow market to function without interference and the absolute necessity of rule to prevent market from fall out of kilter   but manage that tension one that we ’ve debate since the founding of this nation be what have allow our country to keep up with a change world   for in take up this debate in figure out how to apply well wear principle with each new age we ensure that we do n’t tip too far one way or the other that our democracy remain as dynamic and our economy remain as dynamic as it have in the past   so yes this debate can be contentious   it can be heat   but in the end it serve only to make our country strong   it have allow we to adapt and to thrive

 and i read a report recently that i think fairly illustrate this point   it ’ from time magazine   i ’m go to quote   through the great banking house of manhattan last week run wild eyed alarm   big banker stare at one another in anger and astonishment   a bill just pass would rivet upon their institution what they consider a monstrous system such a system they feel would not only rob they of their pride of profession but would reduce all u.s. banking to its low level   that appear in time magazine in june of 1933   laughter and applause   the system that cause so much consternation so much concern be the federal deposit insurance corporation also know as the fdic an institution that have successfully secure the deposit of generation of americans

 in the end our system only work our market be only free when there be basic safeguard that prevent abuse that check excess that ensure that it be more profitable to play by the rule than to game the system   and that be what the reform we ’ve be propose be design to achieve no more no less   and because that be how we will ensure that our economy work for consumer that it work for investor and that it work for financial institution in other word that it work for all of we that ’ why we ’re work so hard to get this stuff pass

 this be the central lesson not only of this crisis but of our history   it ’ what i say when i speak here two year ago   because ultimately there be no dividing line between main street and wall street   we will rise or we will fall together as one nation   applause   and that be why i urge all of you to join i   i urge all of you to join i to join those who be seek to pass these commonsense reform   and for those of you in the financial industry i urge you to join i not only because it be in the interest of your industry but also because it ’ in the interest of your country

 thank you so much   god bless you and god bless the united states of america   thank you   applause

good evening   as we speak our nation face a multitude of challenge   at home our top priority be to recover and rebuild from a recession that have touch the life of nearly every american   abroad our brave man and woman in uniform be take the fight to al qaeda wherever it exist   and tonight i ’ve return from a trip to the gulf coast to speak with you about the battle we ’re wage against an oil spill that be assault our shore and our citizen

 on april 20th an explosion rip through bp deepwater horizon drilling rig about 40 mile off the coast of louisiana   eleven worker lose their life   seventeen other be injure   and soon nearly a mile beneath the surface of the ocean oil begin spew into the water

 because there have never be a leak this size at this depth stop it have test the limit of human technology   that ’ why just after the rig sink i assemble a team of our nation ’s good scientist and engineer to tackle this challenge a team lead by dr. steven chu a nobel prize win physicist and our nation ’s secretary of energy   scientist at our national lab and expert from academia and other oil company have also provide idea and advice

 as a result of these effort we ’ve direct bp to mobilize additional equipment and technology   and in the come week and day these effort should capture up to 90 percent of the oil leak out of the well   this be until the company finish drill a relief well later in the summer that ’s expect to stop the leak completely

 already this oil spill be the bad environmental disaster america have ever face   and unlike an earthquake or a hurricane it ’ not a single event that do its damage in a matter of minute or day   the million of gallon of oil that have spill into the gulf of mexico be more like an epidemic one that we will be fight for month and even year

 but make no mistake   we will fight this spill with everything we ’ve get for as long as it take   we will make bp pay for the damage their company have cause   and we will do whatever ’s necessary to help the gulf coast and its people recover from this tragedy

 tonight i ’d like to lay out for you what our battle plan be go forward   what we ’re do to clean up the oil what we ’re do to help our neighbor in the gulf and what we ’re do to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happen again

 first the cleanup   from the very beginning of this crisis the federal government have be in charge of the large environmental cleanup effort in our nation ’s history an effort lead by admiral thad allen who have almost 40 year of experience respond to disaster   we now have nearly 30,000 personnel who be work across four state to contain and clean up the oil   thousand of ship and other vessel be respond in the gulf   and i ’ve authorize the deployment of over 17,000 national guard member along the coast   these serviceman and woman be ready to help stop the oil from come ashore they ’re ready to help clean the beach train response worker or even help with processing claim and i urge the governor in the affected state to activate these troop as soon as possible

 because of our effort million of gallon of oil have already be remove from the water through burning skimming and other collection method   over five and a half million foot of boom have be lay across the water to block and absorb the approach oil   we ’ve approve the construction of new barrier island in louisiana to try to stop the oil before it reach the shore and we ’re work with alabama mississippi and florida to implement creative approach to their unique coastline

 as the cleanup continue we will offer whatever additional resource and assistance our coastal state may need   now a mobilization of this speed and magnitude will never be perfect and new challenge will always arise   i see and hear evidence of that during this trip   so if something be not work we want to hear about it   if there be problem in the operation we will fix they

 but we have to recognize that despite our good effort oil have already cause damage to our coastline and its wildlife   and sadly no matter how effective our response be there will be more oil and more damage before this siege be do   that ’ why the second thing we ’re focus on be the recovery and restoration of the gulf coast

 you know for generation man and woman who call this region home have make their living from the water   that living be now in jeopardy   i ’ve talk to shrimper and fisherman who do not know how they ’re go to support their family this year   i ’ve see empty dock and restaurant with few customer even in area where the beach be not yet affect   i ’ve talk to owner of shop and hotel who wonder when the tourist might start come back   the sadness and the anger they feel be not just about the money they ’ve lose   it ’ about a wrench anxiety that their way of life may be lose

 i refuse to let that happen   tomorrow i will meet with the chairman of bp and inform he that he be to set aside whatever resource be require to compensate the worker and business owner who have be harm as a result of his company ’s recklessness   and this fund will not be control by bp   in order to ensure that all legitimate claim be pay out in a fair and timely manner the account must and will be administer by an independent third party

 beyond compensate the people of the gulf in the short term it ’s also clear we need a long term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region   the oil spill represent just the late blow to a place that ’s already suffer multiple economic disaster and decade of environmental degradation that have lead to disappear wetland and habitat   and the region still have n’t recover from hurricanes katrina and rita   that ’ why we must make a commitment to the gulf coast that go beyond respond to the crisis of the moment

 i make that commitment tonight   early i ask ray mabus the secretary of the navy who be also a former governor of mississippi and a son of the gulf coast to develop a long term gulf coast restoration plan as soon as possible   the plan will be design by state local community tribe fisherman business conservationist and other gulf resident   and bp will pay for the impact this spill have have on the region

 the third part of our response plan be the step we ’re take to ensure that a disaster like this do not happen again   a few month ago i approve a proposal to consider new limited offshore drill under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precaution would be take

 that obviously be not the case in the deepwater horizon rig and i want to know why   the american people deserve to know why   the family i meet with last week who lose their love one in the explosion these family deserve to know why   and so i ’ve establish a national commission to understand the cause of this disaster and offer recommendation on what additional safety and environmental standard we need to put in place   already i ’ve issue a six month moratorium on deepwater drilling   i know this create difficulty for the people who work on these rig but for the sake of their safety and for the sake of the entire region we need to know the fact before we allow deepwater drilling to continue   and while i urge the commission to complete its work as quickly as possible i expect they to do that work thoroughly and impartially

 one place we ’ve already begin to take action be at the agency in charge of regulate drilling and issuing permit know as the minerals management service   over the last decade this agency have become emblematic of a fail philosophy that view all regulation with hostility a philosophy that say corporation should be allow to play by their own rule and police themselves   at this agency industry insider be put in charge of industry oversight   oil company shower regulator with gift and favor and be essentially allow to conduct their own safety inspection and write their own regulation

 when ken salazar become my secretary of the interior one of his very first act be to clean up the bad of the corruption at this agency   but it ’ now clear that the problem there run much deep and the pace of reform be just too slow   and so secretary salazar and i be bring in new leadership at the agency michael bromwich who be a tough federal prosecutor and inspector general   and his charge over the next few month be to build an organization that act as the oil industry ’s watchdog not its partner

 so one of the lesson we ’ve learn from this spill be that we need well regulation well safety standard and well enforcement when it come to offshore drilling   but a large lesson be that no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry drill for oil these day entail great risk   after all oil be a finite resource   we consume more than 20 percent of the world ’s oil but have less than 2 percent of the world ’s oil reserve   and that ’ part of the reason oil company be drill a mile beneath the surface of the ocean because we ’re run out of place to drill on land and in shallow water

 for decade we have know the day of cheap and easily accessible oil be number   for decade we ’ve talk and talk about the need to end america ’s century long addiction to fossil fuel   and for decade we have fail to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge require   time and again the path forward have be block not only by oil industry lobbyist but also by a lack of political courage and candor

 the consequence of our inaction be now in plain sight   country like china be invest in clean energy job and industry that should be right here in america   each day we send nearly $ 1 billion of our wealth to foreign country for their oil   and today as we look to the gulf we see an entire way of life be threaten by a menacing cloud of black crude

 we can not consign our child to this future   the tragedy unfold on our coast be the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future be now   now be the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash america ’s innovation and seize control of our own destiny

 this be not some distant vision for america   the transition away from fossil fuel be go to take some time but over the last year and a half we ’ve already take unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry   as we speak old factory be reopen to produce wind turbine people be go back to work instal energy efficient window and small business be make solar panel   consumer be buy more efficient car and truck and family be make their home more energy efficient   scientist and researcher be discover clean energy technology that someday will lead to entire new industry

 each of we have a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of we   as we recover from this recession the transition to clean energy have the potential to grow our economy and create million of job but only if we accelerate that transition   only if we seize the moment   and only if we rally together and act as one nation worker and entrepreneur scientist and citizen the public and private sector
 when i be a candidate for this office i lay out a set of principle that would move our country towards energy independence   last year the house of representatives act on these principle by pass a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill a bill that finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy for america ’s business

 now there be cost associate with this transition   and there be some who believe that we can not afford those cost right now   i say we can not afford not to change how we produce and use energy because the long term cost to our economy our national security and our environment be far great

 so i ’m happy to look at other idea and approach from either party as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuel   some have suggest raise efficiency standard in our building like we do in our car and truck   some believe we should set standard to ensure that more of our electricity come from wind and solar power   other wonder why the energy industry only spend a fraction of what the high tech industry do on research and development and want to rapidly boost our investment in such research and development

 all of these approach have merit and deserve a fair hearing in the month ahead   but the one approach i will not accept be inaction   the one answer i will not settle for be the idea that this challenge be somehow too big and too difficult to meet   you know the same thing be say about our ability to produce enough plane and tank in world war ii   the same thing be say about our ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon   and yet time and again we have refuse to settle for the paltry limit of conventional wisdom   instead what have define we as a nation since our founding be the capacity to shape our destiny our determination to fight for the america we want for our child   even if we ’re unsure exactly what that look like   even if we do not yet know precisely how we ’re go to get there   we know we ’ll get there

 it ’ a faith in the future that sustain we as a people   it be that same faith that sustain our neighbor in the gulf right now

 each year at the beginning of shrimp season the region ’s fisherman take part in a tradition that be bring to america long ago by fishing immigrant from europe   it ’s call the blessing of the fleet and today it ’ a celebration where clergy from different religion gather to say a prayer for the safety and success of the man and woman who will soon head out to sea some for week at a time
 the ceremony go on in good time and in bad   it take place after katrina and it take place a few week ago at the beginning of the most difficult season these fisherman have ever face

 and still they come and they pray   for as a priest and former fisherman once say of the tradition the blessing be not that god have promise to remove all obstacle and danger   the blessing be that he be with we always a blessing that ’s grant even in the midst of the storm

 the oil spill be not the last crisis america will face   this nation have know hard time before and we will surely know they again   what see we through what have always see we through be our strength our resilience and our unyielde faith that something well await we if we summon the courage to reach for it

 tonight we pray for that courage   we pray for the people of the gulf   and we pray that a hand may guide we through the storm towards a bright day   thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america

good evening   tonight i ’d like to talk to you about the end of our combat mission in iraq the ongoing security challenge we face and the need to rebuild our nation here at home

 i know this historic moment come at a time of great uncertainty for many americans   we ’ve now be through nearly a decade of war   we ’ve endure a long and painful recession   and sometimes in the midst of these storm the future that we ’re try to build for our nation a future of last peace and long term prosperity may seem beyond our reach

 but this milestone should serve as a reminder to all americans that the future be ours to shape if we move forward with confidence and commitment   it should also serve as a message to the world that the united states of america intend to sustain and strengthen our leadership in this young century

 from this desk seven and a half year ago president bush announce the beginning of military operation in iraq   much have change since that night   a war to disarm a state become a fight against an insurgency   terrorism and sectarian warfare threaten to tear iraq apart   thousand of americans give their life ten of thousand have be wound   our relation abroad be strained   our unity at home be test

 these be the rough water encounter during the course of one of america ’s long war   yet there have be one constant amidst these shifting tide   at every turn america ’s man and woman in uniform have serve with courage and resolve   as commander in chief i be incredibly proud of their service   and like all americans i ’m awe by their sacrifice and by the sacrifice of their family

 the americans who have serve in iraq complete every mission they be give   they defeat a regime that have terrorize its people   together with iraqis and coalition partner who make huge sacrifice of their own our troop fight block by block to help iraq seize the chance for a well future   they shift tactic to protect the iraqi people train iraqi security forces and take out terrorist leader   because of our troop and civilian and because of the resilience of the iraqi people iraq have the opportunity to embrace a new destiny even though many challenge remain

 so tonight i be announce that the american combat mission in iraq have end   operation iraqi freedom be over and the iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country

      this be my pledge to the american people as a candidate for this office   last february i announce a plan that would bring our combat brigade out of iraq while redouble our effort to strengthen iraq ’s security forces and support its government and people

 that ’ what we ’ve do   we ’ve remove nearly 100,000 u.s. troop from iraq   we ’ve close or transfer to the iraqis hundred of basis   and we have move million of piece of equipment out of iraq

 this complete a transition to iraqi responsibility for their own security   u.s. troop pull out of iraq ’s city last summer and iraqi force have move into the lead with considerable skill and commitment to their fellow citizen   even as iraq continue to suffer terrorist attack security incident have be near the low on record since the war begin   and iraqi force have take the fight to al qaeda remove much of its leadership in iraqi lead operation

 this year also see iraq hold credible election that draw a strong turnout   a caretaker administration be in place as iraqis form a government base on the result of that election   tonight i encourage iraq ’s leader to move forward with a sense of urgency to form an inclusive government that be just representative and accountable to the iraqi people   and when that government be in place there should be no doubt   the iraqi people will have a strong partner in the united states   our combat mission be end but our commitment to iraq ’s future be not

 go forward a transitional force of u.s. troop will remain in iraq with a different mission   advise and assist iraq ’s security forces support iraqi troop in target counterterrorism mission and protect our civilian   consistent with our agreement with the iraqi government all u.s. troop will leave by the end of next year   as our military draw down our dedicated civilian diplomat aid worker and advisor be move into the lead to support iraq as it strengthen its government resolve political dispute resettle those displace by war and build tie with the region and the world   that ’ a message that vice president biden be deliver to the iraqi people through his visit there today

      this new approach reflect our long term partnership with iraq one base upon mutual interest and mutual respect   of course violence will not end with our combat mission   extremist will continue to set off bomb attack iraqi civilian and try to spark sectarian strife   but ultimately these terrorist will fail to achieve their goal   iraqis be a proud people   they have reject sectarian war and they have no interest in endless destruction   they understand that in the end only iraqis can resolve their difference and police their street   only iraqis can build a democracy within their border   what america can do and will do be provide support for the iraqi people as both a friend and a partner

      end this war be not only in iraq ’s interest it ’s in our own   the united states have pay a huge price to put the future of iraq in the hand of its people   we have send our young man and woman to make enormous sacrifice in iraq and spend vast resource abroad at a time of tight budget at home   we ’ve persevere because of a belief we share with the iraqi people a belief that out of the ashe of war a new beginning could be bear in this cradle of civilization   through this remarkable chapter in the history of the united states and iraq we have meet our responsibility   now it ’ time to turn the page

 as we do i ’m mindful that the iraq war have be a contentious issue at home   here too it ’ time to turn the page   this afternoon i speak to former president george w. bush   it ’s well know that he and i disagree about the war from its outset   yet no one can doubt president bush ’s support for our troop or his love of country and commitment to our security   as i ’ve say there be patriot who support this war and patriot who oppose it   and all of we be unite in appreciation for our servicemen and woman and our hope for iraqis future

      the greatness of our democracy be ground in our ability to move beyond our difference and to learn from our experience as we confront the many challenge ahead   and no challenge be more essential to our security than our fight against al qaeda

      americans across the political spectrum support the use of force against those who attack we on 9/11   now as we approach our 10th year of combat in afghanistan there be those who be understandably ask tough question about our mission there   but we must never lose sight of what ’ at stake   as we speak al qaeda continue to plot against we and its leadership remain anchor in the border region of afghanistan and pakistan   we will disrupt dismantle and defeat al qaeda while prevent afghanistan from again serve as a base for terrorist   and because of our drawdown in iraq we be now able to apply the resource necessary to go on offense   in fact over the last 19 month nearly a dozen al qaeda leader and hundred of al qaeda ’s extremist ally have be kill or capture around the world

 within afghanistan i ’ve order the deployment of additional troop who under the command of general david petraeus be fight to break the taliban ’s momentum
 as with the surge in iraq these force will be in place for a limited time to provide space for the afghans to build their capacity and secure their own future   but as be the case in iraq we can not do for afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves   that ’ why we ’re train afghan security forces and support a political resolution to afghanistan ’s problem   and next august we will begin a transition to afghan responsibility   the pace of our troop reduction will be determine by condition on the ground and our support for afghanistan will endure   but make no mistake   this transition will begin because open ended war serve neither our interest nor the afghan people ’s

      indeed one of the lesson of our effort in iraq be that american influence around the world be not a function of military force alone   we must use all element of our power include our diplomacy our economic strength and the power of america ’s example to secure our interest and stand by our ally   and we must project a vision of the future that ’s base not just on our fear but also on our hope a vision that recognize the real danger that exist around the world
 but also the limitless possibility of our time

      today old adversary be at peace and emerge democracy be potential partner   new market for our good stretch from asia to the americas   a new push for peace in the middle east will begin here tomorrow   billion of young people want to move beyond the shackle of poverty and conflict   as the leader of the free world america will do more than just defeat on the battlefield those who offer hatred and destruction we will also lead among those who be willing to work together to expand freedom and opportunity for all people

      now that effort must begin within our own border   throughout our history america have be willing to bear the burden of promote liberty and human dignity overseas understand its link to our own liberty and security   but we have also understand that our nation ’s strength and influence abroad must be firmly anchor in our prosperity at home   and the bedrock of that prosperity must be a grow middle class

      unfortunately over the last decade we ’ve not do what ’s necessary to shore up the foundation of our own prosperity   we spend a trillion dollar at war often finance by borrow from overseas   this in turn have short change investment in our own people and contribute to record deficit   for too long we have put off tough decision on everything from our manufacture base to our energy policy to education reform   as a result too many middle class family find themselves work hard for less while our nation ’s long term competitiveness be put at risk

      and so at this moment as we wind down the war in iraq we must tackle those challenge at home with as much energy and grit and sense of common purpose as our man and woman in uniform who have serve abroad   they have meet every test that they face   now it ’ our turn   now it ’ our responsibility to honor they by come together all of we and work to secure the dream that so many generation have fight for the dream that a well life await anyone who be willing to work for it and reach for it

      our most urgent task be to restore our economy and put the million of americans who have lose their job back to work   to strengthen our middle class we must give all our child the education they deserve and all our worker the skill that they need to compete in a global economy   we must jumpstart industry that create job and end our dependence on foreign oil   we must unleash the innovation that allow new product to roll off our assembly line and nurture the idea that spring from our entrepreneur   this will be difficult   but in the day to come it must be our central mission as a people and my central responsibility as president

      part of that responsibility be make sure that we honor our commitment to those who have serve our country with such valor   as long as i be president we will maintain the fine fighting force that the world have ever know and we will do whatever it take to serve our veteran as well as they have serve we   this be a sacred trust   that ’ why we ’ve already make one of the large increase in funding for veteran in decade   we ’re treat the signature wound of today ’s war post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury while provide the health care and benefit that all of our veteran have earn   and we ’re fund a post-9/11 gi bill that help our veteran and their family pursue the dream of a college education   just as the gi bill help those who fight world war ii include my grandfather become the backbone of our middle class so today ’s servicemen and woman must have the chance to apply their gift to expand the american economy   because part of end a war responsibly be stand by those who have fight it

      two week ago america ’s final combat brigade in iraq the army ’s fourth stryker brigade journey home in the pre dawn darkness   thousand of soldier and hundred of vehicle make the trip from baghdad the last of they pass into kuwait in the early morning hour   over seven year before american troop and coalition partner have fight their way across similar highway but this time no shot be fire   it be just a convoy of brave americans make their way home

      of course the soldier leave much behind   some be teenager when the war begin   many have serve multiple tour of duty far from family who bear a heroic burden of their own endure the absence of a husband ’s embrace or a mother ’s kiss   most painfully since the war begin 55 member of the fourth stryker brigade make the ultimate sacrifice part of over 4,400 americans who have give their life in iraq   as one staff sergeant say i know that to my brother in arm who fight and die this day would probably mean a lot

      those americans give their life for the value that have live in the heart of our people for over two century   along with nearly 1.5 million americans who have serve in iraq they fight in a faraway place for people they never know   they stare into the darkest of human creation war and help the iraqi people seek the light of peace

      in an age without surrender ceremony we must earn victory through the success of our partner and the strength of our own nation   every american who serve join an unbroken line of hero that stretch from lexington to gettysburg from iwo jima to inchon from khe sanh to kandahar americans who have fight to see that the life of our child be well than our own   our troop be the steel in our ship of state   and though our nation may be travel through rough water they give we confidence that our course be true and that beyond the pre dawn darkness well day lie ahead

      thank you   may god bless you   and may god bless the united states of america and all who serve she

the president   mr. president mr. secretary general my fellow delegate lady and gentleman   it be a great honor to address this assembly for the second time nearly two year after my election as president of the united states

 we know this be no ordinary time for our people   each of we come here with our own problem and priority   but there be also challenge that we share in common as leader and as nation

 we meet within an institution build from the rubble of war design to unite the world in pursuit of peace   and we meet within a city that for century have welcome people from across the globe demonstrate that individual of every color faith and station can come together to pursue opportunity build a community and live with the blessing of human liberty

 outside the door of this hall the block and neighborhood of this great city tell the story of a difficult decade   nine year ago the destruction of the world trade center signal a threat that respect no boundary of dignity or decency   two year ago this month a financial crisis on wall street devastate american family on main street   these separate challenge have affect people around the globe   man and woman and child have be murder by extremist from casablanca to london from jalalabad to jakarta   the global economy suffer an enormous blow during the financial crisis crippling market and defer the dream of million on every continent   underneath these challenge to our security and prosperity lie deep fear   that ancient hatred and religious divide be once again ascendant that a world which have grow more interconnected have somehow slip beyond our control

 these be some of the challenge that my administration have confront since we come into office   and today i ’d like to talk to you about what we ’ve do over the last 20 month to meet these challenge what our responsibility be to pursue peace in the middle east and what kind of world we be try to build in this 21st century

 let i begin with what we have do   i have have no great focus as president than rescue our economy from potential catastrophe   and in an age when prosperity be share we could not do this alone   so america have join with nation around the world to spur growth and the renew demand that could restart job creation

 we be reform our system of global finance begin with wall street reform here at home so that a crisis like this never happen again   and we make the g20 the focal point for international coordination because in a world where prosperity be more diffuse we must broaden our circle of cooperation to include emerge economy economy from every corner of the globe

 there be much to show for our effort even as there be much work to be do   the global economy have be pull back from the brink of a depression and be grow once more   we have resist protectionism and be explore way to expand trade and commerce among nation   but we can not and will not rest until these seed of progress grow into a broad prosperity not only for all americans but for people around the globe

 as for our common security america be wage a more effective fight against al qaeda while wind down the war in iraq   since i take office the united states have remove nearly 100,000 troop from iraq   we have do so responsibly as iraqis have transition to lead responsibility for the security of their country

 we be now focused on build a last partnership with the iraqi people while keep our commitment to remove the rest of our troop by the end of next year

 while draw down in iraq we have refocus on defeat al qaeda and deny its affiliate a safe haven   in afghanistan the united states and our ally be pursue a strategy to break the taliban ’s momentum and build the capacity of afghanistan ’s government and security force so that a transition to afghan responsibility can begin next july   and from south asia to the horn of africa we be move toward a more targeted approach one that strengthen our partner and dismantle terrorist network without deploy large american army

 as we pursue the world ’s most dangerous extremist we ’re also deny they the world ’s most dangerous weapon and pursue the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapon

 early this year 47 nation embrace a work plan to secure all vulnerable nuclear material within four year   we have join with russia to sign the most comprehensive arm control treaty in decade   we have reduce the role of nuclear weapon in our security strategy   and here at the united nations we come together to strengthen the nuclear non proliferation treaty

 as part of our effort on non proliferation i offer the islamic republic of iran an extended hand last year and underscore that it have both right and responsibility as a member of the international community   i also say in this hall that iran must be hold accountable if it fail to meet those responsibility   and that be what we have do

 iran be the only party to the npt that can not demonstrate the peaceful intention of its nuclear program and those action have consequence   through u.n. security council resolution 1929 we make it clear that international law be not an empty promise

 now let i be clear once more   the united states and the international community seek a resolution to our difference with iran and the door remain open to diplomacy should iran choose to walk through it   but the iranian government must demonstrate a clear and credible commitment and confirm to the world the peaceful intent of its nuclear program

 as we combat the spread of deadly weapon we ’re also confront the specter of climate change   after make historic investment in clean energy and efficiency at home we help forge an accord in copenhagen that for the first time commit all major economy to reduce their emission   we be keenly aware this be just a first step   and go forward we will support a process in which all major economy meet our responsibility to protect the planet while unleash the power of clean energy to serve as an engine of growth and development

 america have also embrace unique responsibility with come that come with our power   since the rain come and the floodwater rise in pakistan we have pledge our assistance and we should all support the pakistani people as they recover and rebuild   and when the earth shake and haiti be devastate by loss we join a coalition of nation in response   today we honor those from the u.n. family who lose their life in the earthquake and commit ourselves to stand with the people of haiti until they can stand on their own two foot

 amidst this upheaval we have also be persistent in our pursuit of peace   last year i pledge my good effort to support the goal of two state israel and palestine live side by side in peace and security as part of a comprehensive peace between israel and all of its neighbor   we have travel a wind road over the last 12 month with few peak and many valley   but this month i be pleased that we have pursue direct negotiation between israelis and palestinians in washington sharm el sheikh and jerusalem

 now i recognize many be pessimistic about this process   the cynic say that israelis and palestinians be too distrustful of each other and too divide internally to forge last peace   rejectionist on both side will try to disrupt the process with bitter word and with bomb and with gunfire   some say that the gap between the party be too big the potential for talk to break down be too great and that after decade of failure peace be simply not possible

 i hear those voice of skepticism   but i ask you to consider the alternative   if an agreement be not reach palestinians will never know the pride and dignity that come with their own state   israelis will never know the certainty and security that come with sovereign and stable neighbor who be commit to coexistence   the hard reality of demography will take hold   more blood will be shed   this holy land will remain a symbol of our difference instead of our common humanity

 i refuse to accept that future   and we all have a choice to make   each of we must choose the path of peace   of course that responsibility begin with the party themselves who must answer the call of history   early this month at the white house i be strike by the word of both the israeli and palestinian leader   prime minister netanyahu say i come here today to find a historic compromise that will enable both people to live in peace security and dignity   and president abbas say we will spare no effort and we will work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these negotiation achieve their cause

 these word must now be follow by action and i believe that both leader have the courage to do so   but the road that they have to travel be exceedingly difficult which be why i call upon israelis and palestinians and the world to rally behind the goal that these leader now share   we know that there will be test along the way and that one test be fast approach   israel ’s settlement moratorium have make a difference on the ground and improve the atmosphere for talk

 and our position on this issue be well know   we believe that the moratorium should be extend   we also believe that talk should press on until complete   now be the time for the party to help each other overcome this obstacle   now be the time to build the trust and provide the time for substantial progress to be make   now be the time for this opportunity to be seize so that it do not slip away

 now peace must be make by israelis and palestinians but each of we have a responsibility to do our part as well   those of we who be friend of israel must understand that true security for the jewish state require an independent palestine one that allow the palestinian people to live with dignity and opportunity   and those of we who be friend of the palestinians must understand that the right of the palestinian people will be win only through peaceful mean include genuine reconciliation with a secure israel

 i know many in this hall count themselves as friend of the palestinians   but these pledge of friendship must now be support by deed   those who have sign on to the arab peace initiative should seize this opportunity to make it real by take tangible step towards the normalization that it promise israel

 and those who speak on behalf of palestinian self government should help the palestinian authority politically and financially and in do so help the palestinians build the institution of their state

 those who long to see an independent palestine must also stop try to tear down israel   after thousand of year jews and arabs be not stranger in a strange land   after 60 year in the community of nation israel ’s existence must not be a subject for debate

 israel be a sovereign state and the historic homeland of the jewish people   it should be clear to all that effort to chip away at israel ’s legitimacy will only be meet by the unshakeable opposition of the united states   and effort to threaten or kill israelis will do nothing to help the palestinian people   the slaughter of innocent israelis be not resistance it ’ injustice   and make no mistake   the courage of a man like president abbas who stand up for his people in front of the world under very difficult circumstance be far great than those who fire rocket at innocent woman and child

 the conflict between israelis and arabs be as old as this institution   and we can come back here next year as we have for the last 60 year and make long speech about it   we can read familiar list of grievance   we can table the same resolution   we can far empower the force of rejectionism and hate   and we can waste more time by carry forward an argument that will not help a single israeli or palestinian child achieve a well life   we can do that

 or we can say that this time will be different that this time we will not let terror or turbulence or posturing or petty politic stand in the way   this time we will think not of ourselves but of the young girl in gaza who want to have no ceiling on her dream or the young boy in sderot who want to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire

 this time we should draw upon the teaching of tolerance that lie at the heart of three great religion that see jerusalem ’s soil as sacred   this time we should reach for what ’s good within ourselves   if we do when we come back here next year we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the united nations an independent sovereign state of palestine live in peace with israel   applause

 it be our destiny to bear the burden of the challenge that i ’ve address recession and war and conflict   and there be always a sense of urgency even emergency that drive most of our foreign policy   indeed after millennia mark by war this very institution reflect the desire of human being to create a forum to deal with emergency that will inevitably come

 but even as we confront immediate challenge we must also summon the foresight to look beyond they and consider what we be try to build over the long term   what be the world that await we when today ’s battle be bring to an end   and that be what i would like to talk about with the remainder of my time today

 one of the first action of this general assembly be to adopt a universal declaration of human rights in 1948 that declaration begin by state that recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable right of all member of the human family be the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world

 the idea be a simple one that freedom justice and peace for the world must begin with freedom justice and peace in the life of individual human being   and for the united states this be a matter of moral and pragmatic necessity   as robert kennedy say the individual man the child of god be the touchstone of value and all society group the state exist for his benefit   so we stand up for universal value because it ’s the right thing to do   but we also know from experience that those who defend these value for their people have be our close friend and ally while those who have deny those right whether terrorist group or tyrannical government have choose to be our adversary

 human right have never go unchallenged not in any of our nation and not in our world   tyranny be still with we whether it manifest itself in the taliban kill girl who try to go to school a north korean regime that enslave its own people or an armed group in congo kinshasa that use rape as a weapon of war

 in time of economic unease there can also be an anxiety about human right   today as in past time of economic downturn some put human right aside for the promise of short term stability or the false notion that economic growth can come at the expense of freedom   we see leader abolish term limit   we see crackdown on civil society   we see corruption smothering entrepreneurship and good governance   we see democratic reform defer indefinitely

 as i say last year each country will pursue a path root in the culture of its own people   yet experience show we that history be on the side of liberty that the strong foundation for human progress lie in open economy open society and open government   to put it simply democracy more than any other form of government deliver for our citizen   and i believe that truth will only grow strong in a world where the border between nation be blur

 america be work to shape a world that foster this openness for the rot of a closed or corrupt economy must never eclipse the energy and innovation of human being   all of we want the right to educate our child to make a decent wage to care for the sick and to be carry as far as our dream and our deed will take we   but that depend upon economy that tap the power of our people include the potential of woman and girl   that mean let entrepreneur start a business without pay a bribe and government that support opportunity instead of steal from their people   and that mean reward hard work instead of reckless risk taking

 yesterday i put forward a new development policy that will pursue these goal recognize that dignity be a human right and global development be in our common interest   america will partner with nation that offer their people a path out of poverty   and together we must unleash growth that power by individual and emerge market in all part of the globe

 there be no reason why africa should not be an exporter of agriculture which be why our food security initiative be empower farmer   there be no reason why entrepreneur should not be able to build new market in every society which be why i host a summit on entrepreneurship early this spring because the obligation of government be to empower individual not to impede they

 the same hold true for civil society   the arc of human progress have be shape by individual with the freedom to assemble and by organization outside of government that insist upon democratic change and by free medium that hold the powerful accountable   we have see that from the south africans who stand up to apartheid to the poles of solidarity to the mother of the disappear who speak out against the dirty war to americans who march for the right of all race include my own

 civil society be the conscience of our community and america will always extend our engagement abroad with citizen beyond the hall of government   and we will call out those who suppress idea and serve as a voice for those who be voiceless   we will promote new tool of communication so people be empower to connect with one another and in repressive society to do so with security   we will support a free and open internet so individual have the information to make up their own mind   and it be time to embrace and effectively monitor norm that advance the right of civil society and guarantee its expansion within and across border

 open society support open government but it can not substitute for it   there be no right more fundamental than the ability to choose your leader and determine your destiny   now make no mistake   the ultimate success of democracy in the world will not come because the united states dictate it it will come because individual citizen demand a say in how they be govern

 there be no soil where this notion can not take root just as every democracy reflect the uniqueness of a nation   later this fall i will travel to asia   and i will visit india which peacefully throw off colonialism and establish a thriving democracy of over a billion people

 i ’ll continue to indonesia the world ’s large muslim majority country which bind together thousand of island through the glue of representative government and civil society   i ’ll join the g20 meeting on the korean peninsula which provide the world ’s clear contrast between a society that be dynamic and open and free and one that be imprison and close   and i will conclude my trip in japan an ancient culture that find peace and extraordinary development through democracy

 each of these country give life to democratic principle in their own way   and even as some government roll back reform we also celebrate the courage of a president in colombia who willingly step aside or the promise of a new constitution in kenya

 the common thread of progress be the principle that government be accountable to its citizen   and the diversity in this room make clear no one country have all the answer but all of we must answer to our own people

 in all part of the world we see the promise of innovation to make government more open and accountable   and now we must build on that progress   and when we gather back here next year we should bring specific commitment to promote transparency to fight corruption to energize civic engagement to leverage new technology so that we strengthen the foundation of freedom in our own country while live up to the ideal that can light the world

 this institution can still play an indispensable role in the advance of human right   it ’ time to welcome the effort of u.n. women to protect the right of woman around the globe   applause

 it ’ time for every member state to open its election to international monitor and increase the u.n. democracy fund   it ’ time to reinvigorate u.n. peacekeeping so that mission have the resource necessary to succeed and so atrocity like sexual violence be prevent and justice be enforce because neither dignity nor democracy can thrive without basic security

 and it ’ time to make this institution more accountable as well because the challenge of a new century demand new way of serve our common interest

 the world that america seek be not one we can build on our own   for human right to reach those who suffer the boot of oppression we need your voice to speak out   in particular i appeal to those nation who emerge from tyranny and inspire the world in the second half of the last century from south africa to south asia from eastern europe to south america   do not stand idly by do not be silent when dissident elsewhere be imprison and protester be beat   recall your own history   because part of the price of our own freedom be stand up for the freedom of other

 that belief will guide america ’s leadership in this 21st century   it be a belief that have see we through more than two century of trial and it will see we through the challenge we face today be it war or recession conflict or division

 so even as we have come through a difficult decade i stand here before you confident in the future a future where iraq be govern by neither tyrant nor a foreign power and afghanistan be free from the turmoil of war a future where the child of israel and palestine can build the peace that be not possible for their parent a world where the promise of development reach into the prison of poverty and disease a future where the cloud of recession give way to the light of renewal and the dream of opportunity be available to all

 this future will not be easy to reach   it will not come without setback nor will it be quickly claim   but the founding of the united nations itself be a testament to human progress   remember in time that be far more try than our own our predecessor choose the hope of unity over the ease of division and make a promise to future generation that the dignity and equality of human being would be our common cause

 it fall to we to fulfill that promise   and though we will be meet by dark force that will test our resolve americans have always have cause to believe that we can choose a well history that we need only to look outside the wall around we   for through the citizen of every conceivable ancestry who make this city their own we see live proof that opportunity can be access by all that what unite we as human being be far great than what divide we and that people from every part of this world can live together in peace

 thank you very much   applause

the president good afternoon everybody   last night i have a chance to speak to the leader of the house and the senate and reach out to those who have both win and lose in both party   i tell john boehner and mitch mcconnell that i look forward to work with they   and i thank nancy pelosi and harry reid for their extraordinary leadership over the last two year

 after what i be sure be a long night for a lot of you and needless to say it be for i i can tell you that some election night be more fun than other   some be exhilarate some be humble   but every election regardless of who win and who lose be a reminder that in our democracy power rest not with those of we in elect office but with the people we have the privilege to serve

 over the last few month i have have the opportunity to travel around the country and meet people where they live and where they work from backyard to factory floor   i do some talk but mostly i do a lot of listening   and yesterday ’s vote confirm what i have hear from folk all across america   people be frustrate they ’re deeply frustrated with the pace of our economic recovery and the opportunity that they hope for their child and their grandchild   they want job to come back fast they want paycheck to go far and they want the ability to give their child the same chance and opportunity as they ’ve have in life

 the man and woman who send we here do not expect washington to solve all their problem   but they do expect washington to work for they not against they   they want to know that their tax dollar be be spend wisely not waste and that we be not go to leave our child a legacy of debt   they want to know that their voice be n’t be drown out by a sea of lobbyist and special interest and partisan bickering   they want business to be do here openly and honestly

 now i run for this office to tackle these challenge and give voice to the concern of everyday people   over the last two year we ’ve make progress   but clearly too many americans have not feel that progress yet and they tell we that yesterday and as president i take responsibility for that

 what yesterday also tell we be that no one party will be able to dictate where we go from here that we must find common ground in order to set in order to make progress on some uncommonly difficult challenge   and i tell john boehner and mitch mcconnell last night i be very eager to sit down with member of both party and figure out how we can move forward together

 i ’m not suggest this will be easy   i will not pretend that we will be able to bridge every difference or solve every disagreement   there ’ a reason we have two party in this country and both democrats and republicans have certain belief and certain principle that each feel can not be compromise   but what i think the american people be expect and what we owe they be to focus on those issue that affect their job their security and their future   reduce our deficit promote a clean energy economy make sure that our child be the well educate in the world make sure that we ’re make the investment in technology that will allow we to keep our competitive edge in the global economy

 because the most important contest we face be not the contest between democrats and republicans   in this century the most important competition we face be between america and our economic competitor around the world   to win that competition and to continue our economic leadership we ’re go to need to be strong and we ’re go to need to be unite

 none of the challenge we face lend themselves to simple solution or bumper sticker slogan   nor be the answer find in any one particular philosophy or ideology   as i ’ve say before no person no party have a monopoly on wisdom   and that ’ why i ’m eager to hear good idea wherever they come from whoever propose they and that ’ why i believe it ’ important to have an honest and civil debate about the choice that we face   that ’ why i want to engage both democrats and republicans in serious conversation about where we ’re go as a nation

 and with so much at stake what the american people do not want from we especially here in washington be to spend the next two year refighte the political battle of the last two   we just have a tough election   we will have another in 2012   i ’m not so naïve as to think that everybody will put politic aside until then but i do hope to make progress on the very serious problem face we right now and that ’s go to require all of we include i to work hard at build consensus

 you know a little over a month ago we hold a town hall meeting in richmond virginia   and one of the most telling question come from a small business owner who run a tree care firm   he tell i how hard he work and how busy he be how he do not have time to pay attention to all the back and forth in washington   and he ask be there hope for we return to civility in our discourse to a healthy legislative process so as i strap on the boot again tomorrow i know that you guy get it under control   it ’ hard to have a faith in that right now he say

 i do believe there be hope for civility   i do believe there ’ hope for progress   and that ’ because i believe in the resiliency of a nation that ’s bounce back from much bad than what we ’re go through right now a nation that be overcome war and depression that have be make more perfect in our struggle for individual right and individual freedom

 each time progress have come slowly and even painfully but progress have always come because we ’ve work at it and because we ’ve believe in it and most of all because we remember that our first allegiance as citizen be not to party or region or faction but to country because while we may be proud democrats or proud republicans we be prouder to be americans

 and that be something that we all need to remember right now and in the come month   and if we do i have no doubt that we will continue this nation ’s long journey towards a well future

 so with that let i take some question   i ’m go to start off with ben feller at ap

 q     thank you mr. president   be you willing to concede at all that what happen last night be not just an expression of frustration about the economy but a fundamental rejection of your agenda   and give the result who do you think speak to the true voice of the american people right now   you or john boehner

 the president   i think that there be no doubt that people ’s number one concern be the economy   and what they be express great frustration about be the fact that we have not make enough progress on the economy   we ’ve stabilize the economy we ’ve get job growth in the private sector   but people all across america be not feel that progress   they do not see it   and they understand that i ’m the president of the united states and that my core responsibility be make sure that we ’ve get an economy that be grow a middle class that feel secure that job be be create   and so i think i have get to take direct responsibility for the fact that we have not make as much progress as we need to make

 now move forward i think the question be go to be can democrats and republicans sit down together and come up with a set of idea that address those core concern   i be confident that we can

 i think that there be some area where it ’s go to be very difficult for we to agree on but i think there be go to be a whole bunch of area where we can agree on   i do not think there ’ anybody in america who think that we ’ve get an energy policy that work the way it need to that think that we should not be work on energy independence   and that give opportunity for democrats and republicans to come together and think about whether it ’ natural gas or energy efficiency or how we can build electric car in this country how do we move forward on that agenda

 i think everybody in this country think that we ’ve get to make sure our kid be equip in term of their education their science background their math background to compete in this new global economy   and that ’s go to be an area where i think there ’ potential common ground

 so on a whole range of issue there be go to be area where we disagree   i think the overwhelming message that i hear from the voter be that we want everybody to act responsibly in washington   we want you to work hard to arrive at consensus   we want you to focus completely on job and the economy and grow it so that we ’re ensure a well future for our child and our grandchild

 and i think that there ’ no doubt that as i reflect on the result of the election it underscore for i that i have get to do a well job just like everybody else in washington do
 q     inaudible
 the president   well i think john boehner and i and mitch mcconnell and harry reid and nancy pelosi be go to have to sit down and work together because i suspect that if you talk to any individual voter yesterday they ’d say there be some thing i agree with democrats on there be some thing i agree with republicans on   i do not think people carry around with they a fixed ideology   i think the majority of people they ’re go about their business go about their life   they just want to make sure that we ’re make progress   and that ’s go to be my top priority over the next couple of year

 savannah guthrie

 q     just follow up on what ben just talk about you do not seem to be reflect or second guess any of the policy decision you ’ve make instead say the message the voter be send be about frustration with the economy or maybe even chalk it up to a failure on your part to communicate effectively if you ’re not reflect on your policy agenda be it possible voter can conclude you ’re still not get it

 the president   well savannah that be just the first question so we ’re go to have a few more here   i ’m do a whole lot of reflect and i think that there be go to be area in policy where we ’re go to have to do a well job i think that over the last two year we have make a series of very tough decision but decision that be right in term of move the country forward in an emergency situation where we have the risk of slip into a second great depression

 but what be absolutely true be that with all that stuff come at folk fast and furious a recovery package what we have to do with respect to the bank what we have to do with respect to the auto company i think people start look at all this and it feel as if government be get much more intrusive into people ’s life than they be accustom to

 now the reason be it be an emergency situation   but i think it ’ understandable that folk say to themselves you know maybe this be the agenda as oppose to a response to an emergency   and that ’ something that i think everybody in the white house understand be a danger   we think it be necessary but i ’m sympathetic to folk who look at it and say this be look like potential overreach

 in addition there be a bunch of price tag that go with that   and so even though these be emergency situation people rightly say gosh we already have all this debt we already have these big deficit this be potentially go to compound it and at what point be we go to get back to a situation where we ’re do what family all around the country do which be make sure that if you spend something you know how to pay for it as oppose to rack up the credit card for the next generation

 and i think that the other thing that happen be that when i win election in 2008 one of the reason i think that people be excited about the campaign be the prospect that we would change how business be do in washington   and we be in such a hurry to get thing do that we do not change how thing get do   and i think that frustrated people

 i ’m a strong believer that the earmarking process in congress be n’t what the american people really want to see when it come to make tough decision about how taxpayer dollar be spend   and i in the rush to get thing do have to sign a bunch of bill that have earmark in they which be contrary to what i have talk about   and i think folk look at that and they say gosh this feel like the same partisan squabbling this seem like the same way of do business as happen before

 and so one of the thing that i ’ve get to take responsibility for be not having move enough on those front   and i think there be an opportunity to move forward on some of those issue   my understanding be eric cantor today say that he want to see a moratorium on earmark continue   that ’ something i think we can we can work on together

 q     would you still resist the notion that voter reject the policy choice you make

 the president   well savannah i think that what i think be absolutely true be voter be not satisfied with the outcome   if right now we have 5 percent unemployment instead of 9.6 percent unemployment then people would have more confidence in those policy choice   the fact be be that for most folk proof of whether they work or not be have the economy get back to where it need to be   and it have n’t

 and so my job be to make sure that i ’m look at all idea that be on the table   when it come to job creation if republicans have good idea for job growth that can drive down the unemployment rate and we have not think of they we have not look at they but we think they have a chance of working we want to try some

 so on the policy front i think the most important thing be to say that we ’re not go to rule out idea because they ’re democrat or republican we want to just see what work   and ultimately i ’ll be judge as president as to the bottom line result

 mike emanuel

 q     thank you mr. president   health care as you ’re well aware obviously a lot of republicans run against your health care law   some have call for repeal the law   i ’m wonder sir if you believe that health care reform that you work so hard on be in danger at this point and whether there ’ a threat as a result of this election

 the president   well i know that there ’ some republican candidate who win last night who feel very strongly about it   i ’m sure that this will be an issue that come up in discussion with the republican leadership   as i say before though i think we ’d be misread the election if we think that the american people want to see we for the next two year relitigate argument that we have over the last two year

 with respect to the health care law generally and this may go to some of the question that savannah be raise you know when i talk to a woman from new hampshire who do n’t have to mortgage her house because she get cancer and be seek treatment but now be able to get health insurance when i talk to parent who be relieve that their child with a preexisting condition can now stay on their policy until they ’re 26 year old and give they time to transition to find a job that will give they health insurance or the small business that be now take advantage of the tax credit that be provide then i say to myself this be the right thing to do

 now if the republicans have idea for how to improve our health care system if they want to suggest modification that would deliver fast and more effective reform to a health care system that have be wildly expensive for too many family and business and certainly for our federal government i ’m happy to consider some of those idea

 you know for example i know one of the thing that ’s come up be that the 1099 provision in the health care bill appear to be too burdensome for small business   it just involve too much paperwork too much filing   it ’ probably counterproductive it be design to make sure that revenue be raise to help pay for some of the other provision but if it end up just be so much trouble that small business find it difficult to manage that be something that we should take a look at

 so there be go to be example where i think we can tweak and make improvement on the progress that we ’ve make   that be true for any significant piece of legislation

 but i do not think that if you ask the american people should we stop try to close the doughnut hole that will help senior citizen get prescription drug should we go back to a situation where people with preexist condition can not get health insurance should we allow insurance company to drop your coverage when you get sick even though you ’ve be pay premium i do not think that you ’d have a strong vote for people say those be provision i want to eliminate

 q     accord to some exit poll sir about one out of two voter apparently say that they would like to either see it overturn or repeal   be you concerned that that may embolden voter who be from the other party perhaps

 the president   well it also mean one out of two voter think it be the right thing to do   and obviously this be an issue that have be contentious   but as i say i think what be go to be useful be for we to go through the issue that republicans have issue on not sort of talk generally but let ’s talk specific   do this particular provision when it come to preexist condition be this something you ’re for or you ’re against   help senior get their prescription drug do that make sense or not

 and if we take that approach which be different from campaign i mean this be now govern then i think that we can continue to make some progress and find some common ground

 chip reid

 q     thank you mr. president   republicans say more than anything else what this election be about be spend   and they say it will be when hell freeze over that they will accept anything remotely like a stimulus bill or any kind of a proposal you have out there to stimulate job growth through spending   do you accept the fact that any kind of spending to create job be dead at this point   and if so what else can government do to create job which be the number one issue

 the president   well i think this be go to be an important question for democrats and republicans i think the american people be absolutely concerned about spending and debt and deficit   and i ’m go to have a deficit commission that be put forward its idea   it ’ a bipartisan group that include republican and democratic member of congress   hopefully they be able to arrive at some consensus on some area where we can eliminate program that do n’t work cut back on government spending that be inefficient can streamline government but be n’t cut into the core investment that be go to make sure that we be a competitive economy that be grow and provide opportunity for year to come

 so the question i think that my republican friend and i and democratic leader be go to have answer be what be our priority   what do we care about   and that ’s go to be a tough debate because there be some tough choice here

 we already have a big deficit that i inherit and that have be make bad because of the recession   as we bring it down i want to make sure that we ’re not cut into education that be go to help define whether or not we can compete around the world   i do not think we should be cut back on research and development because if we can develop new technology in area like clean energy that could make all the difference in term of job creation here at home

 i think the proposal that i put forward with respect to infrastructure be one that historically we ’ve have bipartisan agreement about   and we should be able to agree now that it make no sense for china to have well rail system than we and singapore have well airport than we   and we just learn that china now have the fast supercomputer on earth that use to be we   they ’re make investment because they know those investment will pay off over the long term

 and so in these budget discussion the key be to be able to distinguish between stuff that be n’t add to our growth be n’t an investment in our future and those thing that be absolutely necessary for we to be able to increase job growth in the future as well

 now the single most important thing i think we need to do economically and this be something that have to be do during the lame duck session be make sure that taxis do n’t go up on middle class family next year   and so we ’ve get some work to do on that front to make sure that family not only be not see a high tax burden which will automatically happen if congress do not act but also make sure that business provision that historically we have extend each year that for example provide tax break for company that be invest here in the united states in research and development that those be extend   i think it make sense for we to extend unemployment insurance because there be still a lot of folk out there hurt

 so there be some thing that we can do right now that will help sustain the recovery and advance it even as we ’re also sit down and figure out okay over the next several year what kind of budget cut can we make that be intelligent that be smart that will not be undermine our recovery but in fact will be encourage job growth

 q     but most of those thing that you just call investment they call wasteful spending and they say it ’ dead on arrival   it sound like without their support you can not get any of it through

 the president   well what be absolutely true be be that without any republican support on anything then it ’s go to be hard to get thing do   but i ’m not go to anticipate that they ’re not go to support anything   i think that part of the message send to republicans be we want to see strong job growth in this country   and if there be good idea about put people to work that traditionally have garner republican support and that do not add to the deficit then my hope be and expectation be be that that ’s something they ’re willing to have a serious conversation about

 when it come to for example the proposal we put forward to accelerate depreciation for business so that if they ’re build a plant or invest in new equipment next year that they can take a complete write off next year get a huge tax break next year and that would then encourage a lot of business to get off the sideline that be not historically consider a liberal idea   that be actually an idea that business group and republicans i think have support for a very long time

 so again the question be go to be do we all come to the table with an open mind and say to ourselves what do we think be actually go to make a difference for the american people that be how we ’re go to be judge over the next couple of year

 peter baker

 q     thank you mr. president   after your election two year ago when you meet with republicans you say that in discuss what policy might go forward that election have consequence and that you point out that you have win   i wonder what consequence you think this election should have then in term of your policy   be there area that you ’re willing can you name today area that you would be willing to compromise on that you might not have be willing to compromise on in the past

 the president   well i think i ’ve be willing to compromise in the past and i be go to be willing to compromise go forward on a whole range of issue   let i give you an example the issue of energy that i just mention

 i think there be a lot of republicans that run against the energy bill that pass in the house last year   and so it ’ doubtful that you could get the vote to pass that through the house this year or next year or the year after   but that do not mean there be not agreement that we should have a well energy policy   and so let ’s find those area where we can agree

 we ’ve get i think broad agreement that we ’ve get terrific natural gas resource in this country   be we do everything we can to develop those   there be a lot of agreement around the need to make sure that electric car be develop here in the united states that we do not fall behind other country   be there thing that we can do to encourage that   and there be already be bipartisan interest on those issue

 there be be discussion about how we can restart our nuclear industry as a means of reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reduce greenhouse gas   be that an area where we can move forward

 we be able over the last two year to increase for the first time in 30 year fuel efficiency standard on car and truck   we do not even need legislation   we just need the cooperation of automaker and autoworker and investor and other shareholder   and that be go to move we forward in a serious way

 so i think when it come to something like energy what we ’re probably go to have to do be say here be some area where there be just too much disagreement between democrats and republicans we can not get this do right now but let ’s not wait   let ’s go ahead and start make some progress on the thing that we do agree on and we can continue to have a strong and healthy debate about those area where we do n’t

 q     be there anything in the pledge to america that you think you can support

 the president   you know i ’m sure there be go to be area particularly around for example reform how washington work that i ’ll be interested in   i think the american people want to see more transparency more openness   as i say in the midst of economic crisis i think one of the thing i take responsibility for be not having push hard on some of those issue   and i think if you take republicans and democrats at their word this be an area that they want to deliver on for the american people i want to be supportive of that effort

 jake tapper

 q     thank you mr. president   i have a policy question and a personal one   the policy question be you talk about how the immediate goal be the bush tax cut and make sure that they do not expire for those who earn under $ 200,000 $ 250,000   republicans disagree with that strongly   they want all of the bush tax cut extend   be you willing to compromise on that be you willing to negotiate at all for instance allow they to expire for everyone over $ 1 million   where be you willing to budge on that

 and the second one be president bush when he go through a similar thing come out and he say this be a thumpin   you talk about how it be humble or you allude to it perhaps be humble   and i ’m wonder when you call your friend like congressman perriello or governor strickland and you see 19 state legislature go to the other side governorship in swing state the democratic party set back what do it feel like

 the president   it feel bad   laughter   you know the tough thing over the last couple of day be see really terrific public servant not have the opportunity to serve anymore at least in the short term   and you mention there be just some terrific member of congress who take really tough vote because they think it be the right thing even though they know this could cause they political problem and even though a lot of they come from really tough swing district or majority republican district   and the amount of courage that they show and conviction that they show be something that i admire so much   i can not overstate it

 and so there be a not only sadness about see they go but there ’s also a lot of questioning on my part in term of could i have do something differently or do something more so that those folk would still be here

 it ’ hard   and i take responsibility for it in a lot of way

 i will tell you they ’ve be incredibly gracious when i have conversation with they   and what they ’ve tell i be you know we do not have regret because i feel like we be do the right thing   and they may be just say that to make i feel well which again be a sign of their character and their class   and i hope a lot of they continue to pursue public service because i think they ’re terrific public servant

 with respect to the tax cut issue my goal be to make sure that we do not have a huge spike in taxis for middle class family   not only would that be a terrible burden on family who be already go through tough time it would be bad for our economy   it be very important that we ’re not take a whole bunch of money out of the system from people who be most likely to spend that money on good service grocery buy a new winter coat for the kid

 that ’s also why i think unemployment insurance be important not only be it the right thing to do for folk who be still look for work and struggle in this really tough economy but it ’s the right thing to do for the economy as a whole

 so my goal be to sit down with speaker elect boehner and mitch mcconnell and harry and nancy sometime in the next few week and see where we can move forward in a way that first of all do no harm that extend those tax cut that be very important for middle class family also extend those provision that be important to encourage business to invest and provide business some certainty over the next year or two

 and how that negotiation work itself out i think be too early to say   but this be go to be one of my top priority and my hope be be that give we all have an interest in grow the economy and encourage job growth that we ’re not go to play brinksmanship but instead we ’re go to act responsibly

 q     so you ’re willing to negotiate

 the president   absolutely

 laura meckler

 q     thank you mr. president   you say early that it be clear that congress be reject the idea of a cap and trade program and that you would not be able to move forward with that look ahead do you feel the same way about epa regulate carbon emission   would you be open to they do essentially the same thing through an administrative action or be that off the table as well

 and secondly just to follow up on what you say about change the way washington work do you think that you say you do not do enough to change the way thing be handle in this city   some of in order to get your health care bill pass you need to make some of those deal   do you wish in retrospect you have not make those deal even if it mean the collapse of the program

 the president   i think that make sure that family have security and be on a trajectory to lower health care cost be absolutely critical for this country   but you be absolutely right that when you be navigate through a house and a senate in this kind of pretty partisan environment that it ’ a ugly mess when it come to process   and i think that be something that really affect how people view the outcome   that be something that i regret that we could not have make the process more healthy than it end up be   but i think the outcome be a good one

 with respect to the epa i think the smart thing for we to do be to see if we can get democrats and republicans in a room who be serious about energy independence and be serious about keep our air clean and our water clean and deal with the issue of greenhouse gas and see be there way that we can make progress in the short term and invest in technology in the long term that start give we the tool to reduce greenhouse gas and solve this problem

 the epa be under a court order that say greenhouse gas be a pollutant that fall under their jurisdiction and i think one of the thing that be very important for i be not to have we ignore the science but rather to find way that we can solve these problem that do not hurt the economy that encourage the development of clean energy in this country that in fact may give we opportunity to create entire new industry and create job that and that put we in a competitive posture around the world

 so i think it ’ too early to say whether or not we can make some progress on that front   i think we can   cap and trade be just one way of skin the cat it be not the only way   it be a means not an end   and i ’m go to be look for other mean to address this problem

 and i think epa want help from the legislature on this   i do not think that the desire be to somehow be protective of their power here   i think what they want to do be make sure that the issue be be deal with

 ed henry

 q     thank you mr. president   i want to do a personal and policy one as well   on personal you have a lot of fun on the campaign trail by say that the republicans be drink a slurpee and sit on the sideline while you be try to pull the car out of the ditch   but the point of the story be that you say if you want to go forward you put the car in d if you want to go backwards you put it in r.   now that there be least 60 house district that seem to have reject that message be it possible that there be a majority of americans who think your policy be take we in reverse   and what specific change will you make to your approach to try to fix that and well connect with the american people

 and just on a policy front do n’t ask do n’t tell be something that you promise to end   and when you have 60 vote and 59 vote in the senate it ’ a tough issue you have n’t be able to do it   do you now have to tell your liberal base that with maybe 52 or 53 vote in the senate you ’re just not go to be able to get it do in the next two year

 the president   well let i take the second issue first   i ’ve be a strong believer in the notion that if somebody be willing to serve in our military in uniform put their life on the line for our security that they should not be prevent from do so because of their sexual orientation   and since there ’s be a lot of discussion about poll over the last 48 hour i think it ’ worth note that the overwhelming majority of americans feel the same way   it ’ the right thing to do

 now as commander in chief i ’ve say that make this change need to be do in an orderly fashion   i ’ve work with the pentagon work with secretary gates work with admiral mullen to make sure that we be look at this in a systemic way that maintain good order and discipline but that we need to change this policy

 there ’s go to be a review that come out at the beginning of the month that will have survey attitude and opinion within the armed force   i will expect that secretary of defense gates and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff admiral mullen will have something to say about that review   i will look at it very carefully   but that will give we time to act in potentially during the lame duck session to change this policy

 keep in mind we ’ve get a bunch of court case that be out there as well   and something that would be very disruptive to good order and discipline and unit cohesion be if we ’ve get this issue bounce around in the court as it already have over the last several week where the pentagon and the chain of command do not know at any give time what rule they ’re work under
 we need to provide certainty and it ’ time for we to move this policy forward   and this should not be a partisan issue   this be an issue as i say where you ’ve get a sizable portion of the american people squarely behind the notion that folk who be willing to serve on our behalf should be treat fairly and equally

 now in term of how we move forward i think that the american people understand that we ’re still dig our way out of a pretty big mess   so i do not think anybody deny they think we ’re in a ditch   i just do not think they feel like we ’ve get all the way out of the ditch yet   and to move the analogy forward that i use in the campaign i think what they want right now be the democrats and the republicans both push some more to get the car on level ground   and we have not do that

 if you think i be engage in too much campaign rhetoric say the republicans be just sit on the side of the road watch we get that car out of the ditch at the very least we be push in opposite direction   and so

 q     the idea that your policy be take the country in reverse   you just reject that idea altogether that your policy could be go in reverse

 the president   yes   and i think look here ’s the bottom line   when i come into office this economy be in a freefall and the economy have stabilize   the economy be grow   we ’ve see nine month of private sector job growth   so i think it would be hard to argue that we ’re go backwards   i think what you can argue be we ’re stick in neutral   we be not move the way we need to to make sure that folk have the job have the opportunity be see economic growth in their community the way they need to   and that be go to require democrats and republicans to come together and look for the good idea to move thing forward

 it will not be easy not just because democrats and republicans may have different priority as we be just discuss when it come to how we structure tax cut but because these issue be hard

 the republicans throughout the campaign say they ’re very concerned about debt and deficit   well one of the most important thing we can do for debt and deficit be economic growth   so what other proposal do they have to grow the economy if in fact they ’re reject some of the proposal i ’ve make i want to hear from they what affirmative policy can make a difference in term of encourage job growth and promote the economy because i do not think that tax cut alone be go to be a recipe for the kind of expansion that we need

 from 2001 to 2009 we cut taxis pretty significantly and we just do not see the kind of expansion that be go to be necessary in term of drive the unemployment rate down significantly

 so i think what we ’re go to need to do and what the american people want be for we to mix and match idea figure out those area where we can agree on move forward on those disagree without be disagreeable on those area that we can not agree on   if we accomplish that then there will be time for politic later but over the next year i think we can solidify this recovery and give people a little more confidence out there

 q     thank you mr. president   i want to ask if you ’re go to have john boehner over for a slurpee but i actually have a serious question

 the president   i might serve they ’re delicious drink   laughter

 q     the slurpee summit

 the president   the slurpee summit that ’ good chuck   i like that   laughter

 q     since you seem to be in a reflective mood do you think you need to hit the reset button with business   how do you plan to set that reset button with business would that would you include anything beyond your cleveland speech those proposal to get they off the sideline get they off the cash they ’re hoard and start hire again   thank you

 the president   yes i think this be an important question that we ’ve be ask ourselves for several month now   you ’re right as i reflect on what ’s happen over the last two year one of the thing that i think have not be manage by i as well as it need to be be find the right balance in make sure that business have rule of the road and be treat customer fairly and whether it ’ their credit card or insurance or their mortgage but also make absolutely clear that the only way america succeed be if business be succeed

 the reason we ’ve get a unparalleled standard of live in the history of the world be because we ’ve get a free market that be dynamic and entrepreneurial and that free market have to be nurture and cultivate   and there ’ no doubt that when you have the financial crisis on wall street the bonus controversy the battle around health care the battle around financial reform and then you have bp you just have a successive set of issue in which i think business take the message that well gosh it seem like we may be always paint at the bad guy

 and so i ’ve get to take responsibility in term of make sure that i make clear to the business community as well as to the country that the most important thing we can do be to boost and encourage our business sector and make sure that they ’re hire and so we do have specific plan in term of how we can structure that outreach

 now keep in mind over the last two year we ’ve be talk to ceo constantly   and as i plan for my trip later this week to asia the whole focus be on how be we go to open up market so that american business can prosper and we can sell more good and create more job here in the united states   and a whole bunch of corporate executive be go to be join we so that i can help they open up those market and allow they to sell their product

 so there ’s be a lot of strong interaction behind the scene   but i think set the right tone publicly be go to be important and could end up make a difference at the margin in term of how business make investment decision

 q     but do you have new specific proposal to get they off the sideline and start hire

 the president   well i already discuss a couple with chip that have not be act on yet you ’re right that i make these proposal two month ago but or three month ago but it be in the midst of a campaign season where it be doubtful that they be go to get a full hearing just because there be so much political noise go on

 i think as we move forward sit down and talk to business figure out what exactly would help you make more investment that could create more job here in the united states and listen hard to they in a context where maybe democrats and republicans be together so we ’re receive the same message at the same time and then act on that agenda could make a big difference

 matt spetalnick of reuters

 q     thank you mr. president   how do you respond to those who say the election outcome at least in part be voter say that they see you as out of touch with their personal economic pain   and be you willing to make any change in your leadership style

 the president   there be a inherent danger in be in the white house and be in the bubble   i mean folk do not have any complaint about my leadership style when i be run around iowa for a year   and they get a pretty good look at i up close and personal and they be able to lift the hood and kick the tire and i think they understand that my story be theirs i might have a funny name i might have live in some different place but the value of hard work and responsibility and honesty and look out for one another that have be instill in they by their parent those be the same value that i take from my mom and my grandparent

 and so the track record have be that when i ’m out of this place that be not an issue   when you ’re in this place it be hard not to seem remove   and one of the challenge that we ’ve get to think about be how do i meet my responsibility here in the white house which require a lot of hour and a lot of work but still have that opportunity to engage with the american people on a day to day basis and know give they confidence that i ’m listen to they

 those letter that i read every night some of they just break my heart   some of they provide i encouragement and inspiration   but nobody be film i read those letter   and so it ’ hard i think for people to get a sense of well how be he take in all this information

 so i think there be more thing that we can do to make sure that i ’m get out of here   but i mean i think it ’ important to point out as well that a couple of great communicator ronald reagan and bill clinton be stand at this podium two year into their presidency get very similar question because the economy be not work the way it need to be and there be a whole range of factor that make people concerned that maybe the party in power be n’t listen to they
 this be something that i think every president need to go through because the responsibility of this office be so enormous and so many people be depend on what we do and in the rush of activity sometimes we lose track of the way that we connect with folk that get we here in the first place

 and that ’ something that now i ’m not recommend for every future president that they take a shellacking like they like i do last night   laughter   i ’m sure there be easy way to learn these lesson   but i do think that this be a growth process and an evolution   and the relationship that i ’ve have with the american people be one that build slowly peak at this incredible high and then during the course of the last two year as we ’ve together go through some very difficult time have get rockier and tough   and it ’s go to i ’m sure have some more up and down during the course of i be in this office

 but the one thing that i just want to end on be get out of here be good for i too because when i travel around the country even in the tough of these debate in the midst of health care last year during the summer when there be protester about and when i ’m meet family who ’ve lose love one in afghanistan or iraq i always come away from those interaction just feel so much more optimistic about this country

 we have such good and decent people who on a day to day basis be find all kind of way to live together and educate kid and grow their community and improve their community and create business and work together to create great new product and service   the american people always make i optimistic

 and that ’ why during the course of the last two year as tough as it ’s be as many sometimes scary moment as we ’ve go through i ’ve never doubt that we ’re go to emerge strong than we be before   and i think that remain true and i ’m just go to be look forward to play my part in help that journey along

 all right   thank you very much everybody


thank you   applause   thank you very much   please please be seat   applause

 these man and woman remind we that heroism be find not only on the field of battle   they remind we that heroism do not require special training or physical strength   heroism be here in the heart of so many of our fellow citizen all around we just wait to be summon as it be on saturday morning their action their selflessness pose a challenge to each of we   it raise a question of what beyond prayer and expression of concern be require of we go forward   how can we honor the fall   how can we be true to their memory

 you see when a tragedy like this strike it be part of our nature to demand explanation to try and pose some order on the chaos and make sense out of that which seem senseless   already we ’ve see a national conversation commence not only about the motivation behind these killing but about everything from the merit of gun safety law to the adequacy of our mental health system   and much of this process of debate what might be do to prevent such tragedy in the future be an essential ingredient in our exercise of self government

 but at a time when our discourse have become so sharply polarize at a time when we be far too eager to lay the blame for all that ail the world at the foot of those who happen to think differently than we do it ’ important for we to pause for a moment and make sure that we ’re talk with each other in a way that heal not in a way that wound   applause

 scripture tell we that there be evil in the world and that terrible thing happen for reason that defy human understanding in the word of job when i look for light then come darkness   bad thing happen and we have to guard against simple explanation in the aftermath

 for the truth be none of we can know exactly what trigger this vicious attack   none of we can know with any certainty what might have stop these shot from be fire or what thought lurk in the inner recess of a violent man ’s mind   yes we have to examine all the fact behind this tragedy   we can not and will not be passive in the face of such violence   we should be willing to challenge old assumption in order to lessen the prospect of such violence in the future   applause   but what we can not do be use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other   applause   that we can not do   applause   that we can not do

 as we discuss these issue let each of we do so with a good dose of humility   rather than point finger or assign blame let ’s use this occasion to expand our moral imagination to listen to each other more carefully to sharpen our instinct for empathy and remind ourselves of all the way that our hope and dream be bind together   applause

 after all that ’ what most of we do when we lose somebody in our family especially if the loss be unexpected   we ’re shake out of our routine   we ’re force to look inward   we reflect on the past   do we spend enough time with an age parent we wonder   do we express our gratitude for all the sacrifice that they make for we   do we tell a spouse just how desperately we love they not just once in a while but every single day

 so sudden loss cause we to look backward but it also force we to look forward to reflect on the present and the future on the manner in which we live our life and nurture our relationship with those who be still with we   applause

 we may ask ourselves if we ’ve show enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our life   perhaps we question whether we be do right by our child or our community whether our priority be in order

 we recognize our own mortality and we be remind that in the fleeting time we have on this earth what matter be not wealth or status or power or fame but rather how well we have love applause)-- and what small part we have play in make the life of other people well   applause

 and that process that process of reflection of make sure we align our value with our action that i believe be what a tragedy like this require

 for those who be harm those who be kill they be part of our family an american family 300 million strong applause   we may not have know they personally but surely we see ourselves in they   in george and dot in dorwan and mavy we sense the abide love we have for our own husband our own wife our own life partner   phyllis she ’ our mom or our grandma gabe our brother or son   applause   in judge roll we recognize not only a man who prize his family and do his job well but also a man who embody america ’s fidelity to the law applause

 and in gabby in gabby we see a reflection of our public spiritedness that desire to participate in that sometimes frustrating sometimes contentious but always necessary and never end process to form a more perfect union   applause

 and in christina in christina we see all of our child so curious so trust so energetic so full of magic   so deserving of our love   and so deserving of our good example

 if this tragedy prompt reflection and debate as it should let ’s make sure it ’ worthy of those we have lose   applause   let ’s make sure it ’ not on the usual plane of politic and point scoring and pettiness that drift away in the next news cycle

 the loss of these wonderful people should make every one of we strive to be well   to be well in our private life to be well friend and neighbor and coworker and parent   and if as have be discuss in recent day their death help usher in more civility in our public discourse let we remember it be not because a simple lack of civility cause this tragedy it do not but rather because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help we face up to the challenge of our nation in a way that would make they proud   applause

 we should be civil because we want to live up to the example of public servant like john roll and gabby giffords who know first and foremost that we be all americans and that we can question each other ’s idea without question each other ’s love of country and that our task work together be to constantly widen the circle of our concern so that we bequeath the american dream to future generation   applause

 they believe they believe and i believe that we can be well   those who die here those who save life here they help i believe   we may not be able to stop all evil in the world but i know that how we treat one another that ’s entirely up to we   applause

 and i believe that for all our imperfection we be full of decency and goodness and that the force that divide we be not as strong as those that unite we   applause

 that ’ what i believe in part because that ’ what a child like christina taylor green believe   applause

 imagine imagine for a moment here be a young girl who be just become aware of our democracy just begin to understand the obligation of citizenship just start to glimpse the fact that some day she too might play a part in shape her nation ’s future   she have be elect to her student council   she see public service as something exciting and hopeful   she be off to meet her congresswoman someone she be sure be good and important and might be a role model   she see all this through the eye of a child undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adult all too often just take for grant

 i want to live up to her expectation   applause   i want our democracy to be as good as christina imagine it   i want america to be as good as she imagine it   applause   all of we we should do everything we can to make sure this country live up to our child ’s expectation   applause

 as have already be mention christina be give to we on september 11th 2001 one of 50 baby bear that day to be picture in a book call face of hope   on either side of her photo in that book be simple wish for a child ’s life   i hope you help those in need read one   i hope you know all the word to the national anthem and sing it with your hand over your heart   applause   i hope you jump in rain puddle

 if there be rain puddle in heaven christina be jump in they today   applause   and here on this earth here on this earth we place our hand over our heart and we commit ourselves as americans to forge a country that be forever worthy of her gentle happy spirit

 may god bless and keep those we ’ve lose in restful and eternal peace   may he love and watch over the survivor   and may he bless the united states of america   applause

mr. speaker mr. vice president member of congress distinguished guest and fellow americans

       tonight i want to begin by congratulate the man and woman of the 112th congress as well as your new speaker john boehner   applause   and as we mark this occasion we ’re also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber and we pray for the health of our colleague and our friend gabby giffords   applause

       it ’ no secret that those of we here tonight have have our difference over the last two year   the debate have be contentious we have fight fiercely for our belief   and that ’ a good thing   that ’ what a robust democracy demand   that ’ what helps set we apart as a nation

       but there ’ a reason the tragedy in tucson give we pause amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate tucson remind we that no matter who we be or where we come from each of we be a part of something great something more consequential than party or political preference

       we be part of the american family   we believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be find we be still bind together as one people that we share common hope and a common creed that the dream of a little girl in tucson be not so different than those of our own child and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfil

       that too be what set we apart as a nation   applause

       now by itself this simple recognition will not usher in a new era of cooperation   what come of this moment be up to we   what come of this moment will be determine not by whether we can sit together tonight but whether we can work together tomorrow   applause

       i believe we can   and i believe we must   that ’ what the people who send we here expect of we   with their vote they ’ve determine that governing will now be a share responsibility between party   new law will only pass with support from democrats and republicans   we will move forward together or not at all for the challenge we face be big than party and big than politic

       at stake right now be not who win the next election after all we just have an election   at stake be whether new job and industry take root in this country or somewhere else   it ’s whether the hard work and industry of our people be reward   it ’s whether we sustain the leadership that have make america not just a place on a map but the light to the world

       we be poise for progress   two year after the bad recession most of we have ever know the stock market have come roar back   corporate profit be up   the economy be grow again

       but we have never measure progress by these yardstick alone   we measure progress by the success of our people   by the job they can find and the quality of life those job offer   by the prospect of a small business owner who dream of turn a good idea into a thriving enterprise   by the opportunity for a well life that we pass on to our child

       that ’ the project the american people want we to work on together   applause

       we do that in december   thank to the tax cut we pass americans paycheck be a little big today   every business can write off the full cost of new investment that they make this year   and these step take by democrats and republicans will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector job create last year

       but we have to do more   these step we ’ve take over the last two year may have break the back of this recession but to win the future we ’ll need to take on challenge that have be decade in the making

       many people watch tonight can probably remember a time when find a good job mean show up at a nearby factory or a business downtown   you do not always need a degree and your competition be pretty much limited to your neighbor   if you work hard chance be you ’d have a job for life with a decent paycheck and good benefit and the occasional promotion   maybe you ’d even have the pride of see your kid work at the same company

       that world have change   and for many the change have be painful   i ’ve see it in the shutter window of once booming factory and the vacant storefront on once busy main streets i ’ve hear it in the frustration of americans who ’ve see their paycheck dwindle or their job disappear proud man and woman who feel like the rule have be change in the middle of the game

       they ’re right   the rule have change   in a single generation revolution in technology have transform the way we live work and do business   steel mill that once need 1,000 worker can now do the same work with 100   today just about any company can set up shop hire worker and sell their product wherever there ’ an internet connection

       meanwhile nation like china and india realize that with some change of their own they could compete in this new world and so they start educate their child early and long with great emphasis on math and science   they ’re invest in research and new technology   just recently china become the home to the world ’s large private solar research facility and the world ’s fast computer

       so yes the world have change   the competition for job be real   but this should not discourage we   it should challenge we remember for all the hit we ’ve take these last few year for all the naysayer predict our decline america still have the large most prosperous economy in the world   applause   no worker no worker be more productive than our   no country have more successful company or grant more patent to inventor and entrepreneur   we ’re the home to the world ’s good college and university where more student come to study than any place on earth

       what ’s more we be the first nation to be found for the sake of an idea the idea that each of we deserve the chance to shape our own destiny   that ’ why century of pioneer and immigrant have risk everything to come here   it ’ why our student do not just memorize equation but answer question like what do you think of that idea   what would you change about the world   what do you want to be when you grow up

       the future be ours to win   but to get there we can not just stand still   as robert kennedy tell we the future be not a gift   it be an achievement   sustain the american dream have never be about stand pat   it have require each generation to sacrifice and struggle and meet the demand of a new age

       and now it ’ our turn   we know what it take to compete for the job and industry of our time   we need to out innovate out educate and out build the rest of the world   applause   we have to make america the good place on earth to do business   we need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government   that ’ how our people will prosper   that ’ how we ’ll win the future   applause   and tonight i ’d like to talk about how we get there

       the first step in win the future be encourage american innovation   none of we can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new job will come from   thirty year ago we could not know that something call the internet would lead to an economic revolution   what we can do what america do well than anyone else be spark the creativity and imagination of our people   we ’re the nation that put car in driveway and computer in office the nation of edison and the wright brother of google and facebook   in america innovation do not just change our life   it be how we make our living   applause

       our free enterprise system be what drive innovation   but because it ’s not always profitable for company to invest in basic research throughout our history our government have provide cutting edge scientist and inventor with the support that they need   that ’ what plant the seed for the internet   that ’ what help make possible thing like computer chip and gps   just think of all the good job from manufacture to retail that have come from these breakthrough

       half a century ago when the soviets beat we into space with the launch of a satellite call sputnik we have no idea how we would beat they to the moon   the science be not even there yet   nasa do n’t exist   but after invest in well research and education we do not just surpass the soviets we unleash a wave of innovation that create new industry and million of new job

       this be our generation ’s sputnik moment   two year ago i say that we need to reach a level of research and development we have n’t see since the height of the space race   and in a few week i will be send a budget to congress that help we meet that goal   we ’ll invest in biomedical research information technology and especially clean energy technology applause an investment that will strengthen our security protect our planet and create countless new job for our people

       already we ’re see the promise of renewable energy   robert and gary allen be brother who run a small michigan roofing company   after september 11th they volunteer their good roofer to help repair the pentagon   but half of their factory go unused and the recession hit they hard   today with the help of a government loan that empty space be be use to manufacture solar shingle that be be sell all across the country   in robert ’s word we reinvent ourselves

       that ’ what americans have do for over 200 year reinvent ourselves   and to spur on more success story like the allen brothers we ’ve begin to reinvent our energy policy we ’re not just hand out money   we ’re issue a challenge   we ’re tell america ’s scientist and engineer that if they assemble team of the good mind in their field and focus on the hard problem in clean energy we ’ll fund the apollo project of our time

       at the california institute of technology they ’re develop a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our car   at oak ridge national laboratory they ’re use supercomputer to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facility   with more research and incentive we can break our dependence on oil with biofuel and become the first country to have a million electric vehicle on the road by 2015   applause

       we need to get behind this innovation   and to help pay for it i ’m ask congress to eliminate the billion in taxpayer dollar we currently give to oil company   applause   i do not know if i do not know if you ’ve notice but they ’re do just fine on their own   laughter   so instead of subsidize yesterday ’s energy let ’s invest in tomorrow ’s

       now clean energy breakthrough will only translate into clean energy job if business know there will be a market for what they ’re sell   so tonight i challenge you to join i in set a new goal   by 2035 80 percent of america ’s electricity will come from clean energy source   applause

       some folk want wind and solar   other want nuclear clean coal and natural gas   to meet this goal we will need they all and i urge democrats and republicans to work together to make it happen   applause

       maintain our leadership in research and technology be crucial to america ’s success   but if we want to win the future if we want innovation to produce job in america and not overseas then we also have to win the race to educate our kid

       think about it   over the next 10 year nearly half of all new job will require education that go beyond a high school education   and yet as many as a quarter of our student be not even finish high school   the quality of our math and science education lag behind many other nation   america have fall to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree   and so the question be whether all of we as citizen and as parent be willing to do what ’s necessary to give every child a chance to succeed

       that responsibility begin not in our classroom but in our home and community   it ’ family that first instill the love of learn in a child   only parent can make sure the tv be turn off and homework get do   we need to teach our kid that it ’s not just the winner of the super bowl who deserve to be celebrate but the winner of the science fair   applause   we need to teach they that success be not a function of fame or pr but of hard work and discipline

       our school share this responsibility   when a child walk into a classroom it should be a place of high expectation and high performance   but too many school do not meet this test that ’ why instead of just pour money into a system that ’s not work we launch a competition call race to the top   to all 50 state we say if you show we the most innovative plan to improve teacher quality and student achievement we ’ll show you the money

       race to the top be the most meaningful reform of our public school in a generation   for less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year it have lead over 40 state to raise their standard for teaching and learning   and these standard be develop by the way not by washington but by republican and democratic governor throughout the country   and race to the top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace no child leave behind with a law that ’s more flexible and focus on what ’s good for our kid   applause

       you see we know what ’ possible from our child when reform be not just a top down mandate but the work of local teacher and principal school board and community   take a school like bruce randolph in denver   three year ago it be rate one of the bad school in colorado locate on turf between two rival gang   but last may 97 percent of the senior receive their diploma   most will be the first in their family to go to college   and after the first year of the school ’s transformation the principal who make it possible wipe away tear when a student say thank you ms. waters for show that we be smart and we can make it   applause   that ’ what good school can do and we want good school all across the country

       let ’s also remember that after parent the big impact on a child ’s success come from the man or woman at the front of the classroom   in south korea teacher be know as nation builder   here in america it ’ time we treat the people who educate our child with the same level of respect   applause   we want to reward good teacher and stop make excuse for bad one   applause   and over the next 10 year with so many baby boomer retire from our classroom we want to prepare 100,000 new teacher in the field of science and technology and engineering and math   applause

       in fact to every young person listen tonight who ’s contemplate their career choice   if you want to make a difference in the life of our nation if you want to make a difference in the life of a child become a teacher   your country need you   applause

       of course the education race do not end with a high school diploma   to compete high education must be within the reach of every american   applause   that ’ why we ’ve end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidy that go to bank and use the saving to make college affordable for million of student   applause   and this year i ask congress to go far and make permanent our tuition tax credit worth $ 10,000 for four year of college   it ’ the right thing to do   applause

       because people need to be able to train for new job and career in today ’s fast change economy we ’re also revitalize america ’s community college   last month i see the promise of these school at forsyth tech in north carolina   many of the student there use to work in the surround factory that have since leave town   one mother of two a woman name kathy proctor have work in the furniture industry since she be 18 year old   and she tell i she ’s earn her degree in biotechnology now at 55 year old not just because the furniture job be go but because she want to inspire her child to pursue their dream too   as kathy say i hope it tell they to never give up

       if we take these step if we raise expectation for every child and give they the well possible chance at an education from the day they be bear until the last job they take we will reach the goal that i set two year ago   by the end of the decade america will once again have the high proportion of college graduate in the world   applause

       one last point about education   today there be hundred of thousand of student excel in our school who be not american citizen   some be the child of undocumented worker who have nothing to do with the action of their parent they grow up as americans and pledge allegiance to our flag and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation   other come here from abroad to study in our college and university   but as soon as they obtain advanced degree we send they back home to compete against we   it make no sense

       now i strongly believe that we should take on once and for all the issue of illegal immigration   and i be prepared to work with republicans and democrats to protect our border enforce our law and address the million of undocumented worker who be now live in the shadow   applause   i know that debate will be difficult   i know it will take time   but tonight let ’s agree to make that effort   and let ’s stop expel talente responsible young people who could be staff our research lab or start a new business who could be far enrich this nation   applause

       the third step in win the future be rebuild america   to attract new business to our shore we need the fast most reliable way to move people good and information from high speed rail to high speed internet   applause

       our infrastructure use to be the good but our lead have slip   south korean home now have great internet access than we do   countries in europe and russia invest more in their road and railway than we do   china be build fast train and new airport   meanwhile when our own engineer grade our nation ’s infrastructure they give we a d.

       we have to do well   america be the nation that build the transcontinental railroad bring electricity to rural community construct the interstate highway system   the job create by these project do not just come from lay down track or pavement   they come from business that open near a town ’s new train station or the new off ramp

       so over the last two year we ’ve begin rebuild for the 21st century a project that have mean thousand of good job for the hard hit construction industry   and tonight i ’m propose that we redouble those effort   applause

       we ’ll put more americans to work repair crumble road and bridge   we ’ll make sure this be fully pay for attract private investment and pick project base on what ’ good for the economy not politician

       within 25 year our goal be to give 80 percent of americans access to high speed rail   applause   this could allow you to go place in half the time it take to travel by car   for some trip it will be fast than fly without the pat down   laughter and applause   as we speak route in california and the midwest be already underway

       within the next five year we ’ll make it possible for business to deploy the next generation of high speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all americans   this be not just about applause this be n’t about fast internet or few drop call   it ’ about connect every part of america to the digital age   it ’ about a rural community in iowa or alabama where farmer and small business owner will be able to sell their product all over the world   it ’ about a firefighter who can download the design of a burn building onto a handheld device a student who can take class with a digital textbook or a patient who can have face to face video chat with her doctor

       all these investment in innovation education and infrastructure will make america a well place to do business and create job   but to help our company compete we also have to knock down barrier that stand in the way of their success

       for example over the year a parade of lobbyist have rig the tax code to benefit particular company and industry   those with accountant or lawyer to work the system can end up pay no taxis at all   but all the rest be hit with one of the high corporate tax rate in the world   it make no sense and it have to change   applause

       so tonight i ’m ask democrats and republicans to simplify the system   get rid of the loophole   level the playing field   and use the saving to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 year without add to our deficit   it can be do   applause

       to help business sell more product abroad we set a goal of double our export by 2014 because the more we export the more job we create here at home   already our export be up   recently we sign agreement with india and china that will support more than 250,000 job here in the united states   and last month we finalize a trade agreement with south korea that will support at least 70,000 american job   this agreement have unprecedented support from business and labor democrats and republicans and i ask this congress to pass it as soon as possible   applause

       now before i take office i make it clear that we would enforce our trade agreement and that i would only sign deal that keep faith with american worker and promote american job   that ’ what we do with korea and that ’ what i intend to do as we pursue agreement with panama and colombia and continue our asia pacific and global trade talk   applause

       to reduce barrier to growth and investment i ’ve order a review of government regulation   when we find rule that put an unnecessary burden on business we will fix they   applause   but i will not hesitate to create or enforce common sense safeguard to protect the american people   applause   that ’ what we ’ve do in this country for more than a century   it ’ why our food be safe to eat our water be safe to drink and our air be safe to breathe   it ’ why we have speed limit and child labor law   it ’ why last year we put in place consumer protection against hide fee and penalty by credit card company and new rule to prevent another financial crisis   applause   and it ’ why we pass reform that finally prevent the health insurance industry from exploit patient   applause

       now i have hear rumor that a few of you still have concern about our new health care law   laughter   so let i be the first to say that anything can be improve   if you have idea about how to improve this law by make care well or more affordable i be eager to work with you   we can start right now by correct a flaw in the legislation that have place an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small business   applause

       what i ’m not willing to do what i ’m not willing to do be go back to the day when insurance company could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition   applause

       i ’m not willing to tell james howard a brain cancer patient from texas that his treatment might not be cover   i ’m not willing to tell jim houser a small business man from oregon that he have to go back to pay $ 5,000 more to cover his employee   as we speak this law be make prescription drug cheap for senior and give uninsured student a chance to stay on their patient parent coverage   applause

       so i say to this chamber tonight instead of re fight the battle of the last two year let ’s fix what need fix and let ’s move forward   applause

       now the final critical step in win the future be to make sure we be not bury under a mountain of debt

       we be live with a legacy of deficit spending that begin almost a decade ago   and in the wake of the financial crisis some of that be necessary to keep credit flow save job and put money in people ’s pocket

       but now that the bad of the recession be over we have to confront the fact that our government spend more than it take in   that be not sustainable   every day family sacrifice to live within their mean   they deserve a government that do the same

       so tonight i be propose that start this year we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five year   applause   now this would reduce the deficit by more than $ 400 billion over the next decade and will bring discretionary spending to the low share of our economy since dwight eisenhower be president

       this freeze will require painful cut   already we ’ve freeze the salary of hardworke federal employee for the next two year   i ’ve propose cut to thing i care deeply about like community action program   the secretary of defense have also agree to cut ten of billion of dollar in spending that he and his general believe our military can do without   applause

       i recognize that some in this chamber have already propose deep cut and i ’m willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without   but let ’s make sure that we ’re not do it on the back of our most vulnerable citizen   applause   and let ’s make sure that what we ’re cut be really excess weight   cut the deficit by gutte our investment in innovation and education be like lighten an overloaded airplane by remove its engine   it may make you feel like you ’re fly high at first but it will not take long before you feel the impact   laughter

       now most of the cut and saving i ’ve propose only address annual domestic spending which represent a little more than 12 percent of our budget   to make further progress we have to stop pretend that cut this kind of spending alone will be enough   it will n’t   applause

       the bipartisan fiscal commission i create last year make this crystal clear   i do not agree with all their proposal but they make important progress   and their conclusion be that the only way to tackle our deficit be to cut excessive spending wherever we find it in domestic spending defense spending health care spending and spend through tax break and loophole   applause

       this mean far reduce health care cost include program like medicare and medicaid which be the single big contributor to our long term deficit   the health insurance law we pass last year will slow these rise cost which be part of the reason that nonpartisan economist have say that repeal the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollar to our deficit   still i ’m willing to look at other idea to bring down cost include one that republicans suggest last year medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuit   applause

       to put we on solid ground we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen social security for future generation   applause   we must do it without put at risk current retiree the most vulnerable or people with disability without slash benefit for future generation and without subject americans guarantee retirement income to the whim of the stock market   applause

       and if we truly care about our deficit we simply can not afford a permanent extension of the tax cut for the wealthy 2 percent of americans   applause   before we take money away from our school or scholarship away from our student we should ask millionaire to give up their tax break   it ’ not a matter of punish their success   it ’ about promote america ’s success   applause

       in fact the good thing we could do on taxis for all americans be to simplify the individual tax code   applause   this will be a tough job but member of both party have express an interest in do this and i be prepared to join they   applause

       so now be the time to act   now be the time for both side and both house of congress democrats and republicans to forge a principle compromise that get the job do   if we make the hard choice now to rein in our deficit we can make the investment we need to win the future

       let i take this one step far   we should not just give our people a government that ’s more affordable   we should give they a government that ’s more competent and more efficient   we can not win the future with a government of the past   applause

       we live and do business in the information age but the last major reorganization of the government happen in the age of black and white tv   there be 12 different agency that deal with export   there be at least five different agency that deal with housing policy   then there ’ my favorite example   the interior department be in charge of salmon while they ’re in fresh water but the commerce department handle they when they ’re in saltwater   laughter   i hear it get even more complicated once they ’re smoke   laughter and applause

       now we ’ve make great stride over the last two year in use technology and getting rid of waste   veteran can now download their electronic medical record with a click of the mouse   we ’re sell acre of federal office space that have not be use in year and we ’ll cut through red tape to get rid of more   but we need to think big   in the come month my administration will develop a proposal to merge consolidate and reorganize the federal government in a way that well serve the goal of a more competitive america   i will submit that proposal to congress for a vote and we will push to get it pass   applause

       in the come year we ’ll also work to rebuild people ’s faith in the institution of government   because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollar be be spend you ’ll be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history   because you deserve to know when your elect official be meet with lobbyist i ask congress to do what the white house have already do put that information online   and because the american people deserve to know that special interest be not lard up legislation with pet project both party in congress should know this   if a bill come to my desk with earmark inside i will veto it   i will veto it   applause

       the 21st century government that ’s open and competent   a government that live within its mean   an economy that ’s drive by new skill and new idea   our success in this new and change world will require reform responsibility and innovation   it will also require we to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affair

       just as job and business can now race across border so can new threat and new challenge   no single wall separate east and west   no one rival superpower be align against we

       and so we must defeat determined enemy wherever they be and build coalition that cut across line of region and race and religion   and america ’s moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity   and because we ’ve begin this work tonight we can say that american leadership have be renew and america ’s standing have be restore

       look to iraq where nearly 100,000 of our brave man and woman have leave with their head hold high   applause   american combat patrol have end violence be down and a new government have be form   this year our civilian will forge a last partnership with the iraqi people while we finish the job of bring our troop out of iraq   america ’s commitment have be keep   the iraq war be come to an end   applause

       we ’ve also take the fight to al qaeda and their ally abroad   in afghanistan our troop have take taliban stronghold and train afghan security force   our purpose be clear   by prevent the taliban from reestablish a stranglehold over the afghan people we will deny al qaeda the safe haven that serve as a launch pad for 9/11

       thank to our heroic troop and civilian few afghans be under the control of the insurgency   there will be tough fighting ahead and the afghan government will need to deliver well governance   but we be strengthen the capacity of the afghan people and build an endure partnership with they   this year we will work with nearly 50 country to begin a transition to an afghan lead   and this july we will begin to bring our troop home   applause

       in pakistan al qaeda ’s leadership be under more pressure than at any point since 2001   their leader and operative be be remove from the battlefield   their safe haven be shrink   and we ’ve send a message from the afghan border to the arabian peninsula to all part of the globe   we will not relent we will not waver and we will defeat you   applause

       american leadership can also be see in the effort to secure the bad weapon of war   because republicans and democrats approve the new start treaty far few nuclear weapon and launcher will be deploy   because we rally the world nuclear material be be lock down on every continent so they never fall into the hand of terrorist   applause

       because of a diplomatic effort to insist that iran meet its obligation the iranian government now face tough sanction tight sanction than ever before   and on the korean peninsula we stand with our ally south korea and insist that north korea keep its commitment to abandon nuclear weapon   applause

       and we see that same desire to be free in tunisia where the will of the people prove more powerful than the writ of a dictator   and tonight let we be clear   the united states of america stand with the people of tunisia and support the democratic aspiration of all people   applause

       we must never forget that the thing we ’ve struggle for and fight for live in the heart of people everywhere   and we must always remember that the americans who have bear the great burden in this struggle be the man and woman who serve our country   applause

       tonight let we speak with one voice in reaffirm that our nation be unite in support of our troop and their family   let we serve they as well as they ’ve serve we by give they the equipment they need by provide they with the care and benefit that they have earn and by enlist our veteran in the great task of build our own nation

       and yet as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be i know there be n’t a person here who would trade place with any other nation on earth   applause

       we may have difference in policy but we all believe in the right enshrine in our constitution   we may have different opinion but we believe in the same promise that say this be a place where you can make it if you try   we may have different background but we believe in the same dream that say this be a country where anything be possible   no matter who you be   no matter where you come from

 over the last 10 year thank to the tireless and heroic work of our military and our counterterrorism professional we ’ve make great stride in that effort   we ’ve disrupt terrorist attack and strengthen our homeland defense   in afghanistan we remove the taliban government which have give bin laden and al qaeda safe haven and support   and around the globe we work with our friend and ally to capture or kill score of al qaeda terrorist include several who be a part of the 9/11 plot

 yet osama bin laden avoid capture and escape across the afghan border into pakistan   meanwhile al qaeda continue to operate from along that border and operate through its affiliate across the world

 and so shortly after take office i direct leon panetta the director of the cia to make the killing or capture of bin laden the top priority of our war against al qaeda even as we continue our broad effort to disrupt dismantle and defeat his network

 then last august after year of painstaking work by our intelligence community i be brief on a possible lead to bin laden   it be far from certain and it take many month to run this thread to ground   i meet repeatedly with my national security team as we develop more information about the possibility that we have locate bin laden hide within a compound deep inside of pakistan   and finally last week i determine that we have enough intelligence to take action and authorize an operation to get osama bin laden and bring he to justice

 today at my direction the united states launch a target operation against that compound in abbottabad pakistan   a small team of americans carry out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability   no americans be harm   they take care to avoid civilian casualty   after a firefight they kill osama bin laden and take custody of his body

 for over two decade bin laden have be al qaeda ’s leader and symbol and have continue to plot attack against our country and our friend and ally   the death of bin laden mark the most significant achievement to date in our nation ’s effort to defeat al qaeda

 yet his death do not mark the end of our effort   there ’ no doubt that al qaeda will continue to pursue attack against we   we must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad

 as we do we must also reaffirm that the united states be not and never will be at war with islam   i ’ve make clear just as president bush do shortly after 9/11 that our war be not against islam   bin laden be not a muslim leader he be a mass murderer of muslims   indeed al qaeda have slaughter score of muslims in many country include our own   so his demise should be welcome by all who believe in peace and human dignity

 over the year i ’ve repeatedly make clear that we would take action within pakistan if we know where bin laden be   that be what we ’ve do   but it ’ important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with pakistan help lead we to bin laden and the compound where he be hide   indeed bin laden have declare war against pakistan as well and order attack against the pakistani people

 tonight i call president zardari and my team have also speak with their pakistani counterpart   they agree that this be a good and historic day for both of our nation   and go forward it be essential that pakistan continue to join we in the fight against al qaeda and its affiliate

 the american people do not choose this fight   it come to our shore and start with the senseless slaughter of our citizen   after nearly 10 year of service struggle and sacrifice we know well the cost of war   these effort weigh on i every time i as commander in chief have to sign a letter to a family that have lose a love one or look into the eye of a service member who ’s be gravely wound

 so americans understand the cost of war   yet as a country we will never tolerate our security be threaten nor stand idly by when our people have be kill   we will be relentless in defense of our citizen and our friend and ally   we will be true to the value that make we who we be and on night like this one we can say to those family who have lose love one to al qaeda ’s terror   justice have be do

 tonight we give thank to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professional who ’ve work tirelessly to achieve this outcome   the american people do not see their work nor know their name   but tonight they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice

 we give thank for the man who carry out this operation for they exemplify the professionalism patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country   and they be part of a generation that have bear the heavy share of the burden since that september day

 finally let i say to the family who lose love one on 9/11 that we have never forget your loss nor waver in our commitment to see that we do whatever it take to prevent another attack on our shore

 and tonight let we think back to the sense of unity that prevail on 9/11   i know that it have at time fray   yet today ’s achievement be a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the american people

 the cause of secure our country be not complete   but tonight we be once again remind that america can do whatever we set our mind to   that be the story of our history whether it ’s the pursuit of prosperity for our people or the struggle for equality for all our citizen our commitment to stand up for our value abroad and our sacrifice to make the world a safe place

 let we remember that we can do these thing not just because of wealth or power but because of who we be   one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all

 thank you   may god bless you   and may god bless the united states of america

thank you   thank you   applause   thank you very much   thank you   please have a seat   thank you very much   i want to begin by thank hillary clinton who have travel so much these last six month that she be approach a new landmark one million frequent flyer mile   laughter   i count on hillary every single day and i believe that she will go down as one of the fine secretaries of state in our nation ’s history

 the state department be a fitting venue to mark a new chapter in american diplomacy   for six month we have witness an extraordinary change take place in the middle east and north africa   square by square town by town country by country the people have rise up to demand their basic human right   two leader have step aside   more may follow   and though these country may be a great distance from our shore we know that our own future be bind to this region by the force of economic and security by history and by faith

 today i want to talk about this change the force that be drive it and how we can respond in a way that advance our value and strengthen our security

 now already we ’ve do much to shift our foreign policy follow a decade define by two costly conflict   after year of war in iraq we ’ve remove 100,000 american troop and end our combat mission there   in afghanistan we ’ve break the taliban ’s momentum and this july we will begin to bring our troop home and continue a transition to afghan lead   and after year of war against al qaeda and its affiliate we have deal al qaeda a huge blow by kill its leader osama bin laden

 bin laden be no martyr   he be a mass murderer who offer a message of hate an insistence that muslims have to take up arm against the west and that violence against man woman and child be the only path to change   he reject democracy and individual right for muslims in favor of violent extremism his agenda focus on what he could destroy not what he could build

 bin laden and his murderous vision win some adherent   but even before his death al qaeda be lose its struggle for relevance as the overwhelming majority of people see that the slaughter of innocent do not answer their cry for a well life   by the time we find bin laden al qaeda ’s agenda have come to be see by the vast majority of the region as a dead end and the people of the middle east and north africa have take their future into their own hand

 that story of self determination begin six month ago in tunisia   on december 17th a young vendor name mohammed bouazizi be devastate when a police officer confiscate his cart   this be not unique   it ’ the same kind of humiliation that take place every day in many part of the world the relentless tyranny of government that deny their citizen dignity   only this time something different happen   after local official refuse to hear his complaint this young man who have never be particularly active in politic go to the headquarters of the provincial government douse himself in fuel and light himself on fire

 there be time in the course of history when the action of ordinary citizen spark movement for change because they speak to a longing for freedom that have be build up for year   in america think of the defiance of those patriot in boston who refuse to pay taxis to a king or the dignity of rosa parks as she sit courageously in her seat   so it be in tunisia as that vendor ’s act of desperation tap into the frustration feel throughout the country   hundred of protester take to the street then thousand   and in the face of baton and sometimes bullet they refuse to go home day after day week after week until a dictator of more than two decade finally leave power

 the story of this revolution and the one that follow should not have come as a surprise   the nation of the middle east and north africa win their independence long ago but in too many place their people do not   in too many country power have be concentrate in the hand of a few   in too many country a citizen like that young vendor have nowhere to turn   no honest judiciary to hear his case no independent medium to give he voice no credible political party to represent his view no free and fair election where he could choose his leader

 and this lack of self determination the chance to make your life what you will have apply to the region ’s economy as well   yes some nation be bless with wealth in oil and gas and that have lead to pocket of prosperity   but in a global economy base on knowledge base on innovation no development strategy can be base solely upon what come out of the ground nor can people reach their potential when you can not start a business without pay a bribe

 in the face of these challenge too many leader in the region try to direct their people ’s grievance elsewhere   the west be blame as the source of all ill a half century after the end of colonialism   antagonism toward israel become the only acceptable outlet for political expression   division of tribe ethnicity and religious sect be manipulate as a means of hold on to power or take it away from somebody else

 but the event of the past six month show we that strategy of repression and strategy of diversion will not work anymore   satellite television and the internet provide a window into the wide world a world of astonishing progress in place like india and indonesia and brazil   cell phone and social network allow young people to connect and organize like never before   and so a new generation have emerge   and their voice tell we that change can not be deny

 in cairo we hear the voice of the young mother who say it ’ like i can finally breathe fresh air for the first time

 in sanaa we hear the student who chant the night must come to an end

 in benghazi we hear the engineer who say our word be free now   it ’ a feeling you can not explain

 in damascus we hear the young man who say after the first yelling the first shout you feel dignity

 those shout of human dignity be be hear across the region   and through the moral force of nonviolence the people of the region have achieve more change in six month than terrorist have accomplish in decade

 of course change of this magnitude do not come easily   in our day and age a time of 24 hour news cycle and constant communication people expect the transformation of the region to be resolve in a matter of week   but it will be year before this story reach its end   along the way there will be good day and there will bad day   in some place change will be swift in other gradual   and as we ’ve already see call for change may give way in some case to fierce contest for power

 the question before we be what role america will play as this story unfold   for decade the united states have pursue a set of core interest in the region   counter terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapon secure the free flow of commerce and safe guard the security of the region stand up for israel ’s security and pursue arab israeli peace

 we will continue to do these thing with the firm belief that america ’s interest be not hostile to people ’s hope they ’re essential to they   we believe that no one benefit from a nuclear arm race in the region or al qaeda ’s brutal attack   we believe people everywhere would see their economy cripple by a cut off in energy supply   as we do in the gulf war we will not tolerate aggression across border and we will keep our commitment to friend and partner

 yet we must acknowledge that a strategy base solely upon the narrow pursuit of these interest will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak their mind   moreover failure to speak to the broad aspiration of ordinary people will only feed the suspicion that have fester for year that the united states pursue our interest at their expense   give that this mistrust run both way as americans have be sear by hostage taking and violent rhetoric and terrorist attack that have kill thousand of our citizen a failure to change our approach threaten a deepening spiral of division between the united states and the arab world

 and that ’ why two year ago in cairo i begin to broaden our engagement base upon mutual interest and mutual respect   i believe then and i believe now that we have a stake not just in the stability of nation but in the self determination of individual   the status quo be not sustainable   society hold together by fear and repression may offer the illusion of stability for a time but they be build upon fault line that will eventually tear asunder

 so we face a historic opportunity   we have the chance to show that america value the dignity of the street vendor in tunisia more than the raw power of the dictator   there must be no doubt that the united states of america welcome change that advance self determination and opportunity   yes there will be peril that accompany this moment of promise   but after decade of accept the world as it be in the region we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be

 of course as we do we must proceed with a sense of humility   it ’ not america that put people into the street of tunis or cairo it be the people themselves who launch these movement and it ’ the people themselves that must ultimately determine their outcome

 not every country will follow our particular form of representative democracy and there will be time when our short term interest do n’t align perfectly with our long term vision for the region   but we can and we will speak out for a set of core principle principle that have guide our response to the event over the past six month

 the united states oppose the use of violence and repression against the people of the region   applause

 the united states support a set of universal right   and these right include free speech the freedom of peaceful assembly the freedom of religion equality for man and woman under the rule of law and the right to choose your own leader   whether you live in baghdad or damascus sanaa or tehran

 and we support political and economic reform in the middle east and north africa that can meet the legitimate aspiration of ordinary people throughout the region

 our support for these principle be not a secondary interest   today i want to make it clear that it be a top priority that must be translate into concrete action and support by all of the diplomatic economic and strategic tool at our disposal

 let i be specific   first it will be the policy of the united states to promote reform across the region and to support transition to democracy   that effort begin in egypt and tunisia where the stake be high as tunisia be at the vanguard of this democratic wave and egypt be both a longstanding partner and the arab world ’s large nation   both nation can set a strong example through free and fair election a vibrant civil society accountable and effective democratic institution and responsible regional leadership   but our support must also extend to nation where transition have yet to take place

 unfortunately in too many country call for change have thus far be answer by violence   the most extreme example be libya where muammar qaddafi launch a war against his own people promise to hunt they down like rat   as i say when the united states join an international coalition to intervene we can not prevent every injustice perpetrate by a regime against its people and we have learn from our experience in iraq just how costly and difficult it be to try to impose regime change by force no matter how well intentione it may be

 but in libya we see the prospect of imminent massacre we have a mandate for action and hear the libyan people ’s call for help   have we not act along with our nato ally and regional coalition partner thousand would have be kill   the message would have be clear   keep power by kill as many people as it take   now time be work against qaddafi he do not have control over his country   the opposition have organize a legitimate and credible interim council   and when qaddafi inevitably leave or be force from power decade of provocation will come to an end and the transition to a democratic libya can proceed

 while libya have face violence on the great scale it ’ not the only place where leader have turn to repression to remain in power   most recently the syrian regime have choose the path of murder and the mass arrest of its citizen   the united states have condemn these action and work with the international community we have step up our sanction on the syrian regime include sanction announce yesterday on president assad and those around he

 the syrian people have show their courage in demand a transition to democracy   president assad now have a choice   he can lead that transition or get out of the way   the syrian government must stop shoot demonstrator and allow peaceful protest   it must release political prisoner and stop unjust arrest   it must allow human right monitor to have access to city like dara’a and start a serious dialogue to advance a democratic transition   otherwise president assad and his regime will continue to be challenge from within and will continue to be isolate abroad

 so far syria have follow its iranian ally seek assistance from tehran in the tactic of suppression   and this speak to the hypocrisy of the iranian regime which say it stand for the right of protester abroad yet repress its own people at home   let ’s remember that the first peaceful protest in the region be in the street of tehran where the government brutalize woman and man and throw innocent people into jail   we still hear the chant echo from the rooftop of tehran   the image of a young woman die in the street be still sear in our memory   and we will continue to insist that the iranian people deserve their universal right and a government that do not smother their aspiration

 now our opposition to iran ’s intolerance and iran ’s repressive measure as well as its illicit nuclear program and its support of terror be well know   but if america be to be credible we must acknowledge that at time our friend in the region have not all react to the demand for consistent change with change that ’ consistent with the principle that i ’ve outline today   that ’s true in yemen where president saleh need to follow through on his commitment to transfer power   and that ’ true today in bahrain

 bahrain be a longstanding partner and we be committed to its security   we recognize that iran have try to take advantage of the turmoil there and that the bahraini government have a legitimate interest in the rule of law

 nevertheless we have insist both publicly and privately that mass arrest and brute force be at odd with the universal right of bahrain ’s citizen and we will and such step will not make legitimate call for reform go away   the only way forward be for the government and opposition to engage in a dialogue and you can not have a real dialogue when part of the peaceful opposition be in jail   applause   the government must create the condition for dialogue and the opposition must participate to forge a just future for all bahrainis

 indeed one of the broad lesson to be draw from this period be that sectarian divide need not lead to conflict   in iraq we see the promise of a multiethnic multisectarian democracy   the iraqi people have reject the peril of political violence in favor of a democratic process even as they ’ve take full responsibility for their own security   of course like all new democracy they will face setback   but iraq be poise to play a key role in the region if it continue its peaceful progress   and as they do we will be proud to stand with they as a steadfast partner

 so in the month ahead america must use all our influence to encourage reform in the region   even as we acknowledge that each country be different we need to speak honestly about the principle that we believe in with friend and foe alike   our message be simple   if you take the risk that reform entail you will have the full support of the united states

 we must also build on our effort to broaden our engagement beyond elite so that we reach the people who will shape the future particularly young people   we will continue to make good on the commitment that i make in cairo to build network of entrepreneur and expand exchange in education to foster cooperation in science and technology and combat disease   across the region we intend to provide assistance to civil society include those that may not be officially sanction and who speak uncomfortable truth   and we will use the technology to connect with and listen to the voice of the people

 for the fact be real reform do not come at the ballot box alone   through our effort we must support those basic right to speak your mind and access information   we will support open access to the internet and the right of journalist to be hear whether it ’ a big news organization or a lone blogger   in the 21st century information be power the truth can not be hide and the legitimacy of government will ultimately depend on active and informed citizen

 such open discourse be important even if what be say do not square with our worldview   let i be clear america respect the right of all peaceful and law abide voice to be hear even if we disagree with they   and sometimes we profoundly disagree with they

 we look forward to work with all who embrace genuine and inclusive democracy   what we will oppose be an attempt by any group to restrict the right of other and to hold power through coercion and not consent   because democracy depend not only on election but also strong and accountable institution and the respect for the right of minority

 such tolerance be particularly important when it come to religion   in tahrir square we hear egyptians from all walk of life chant muslims christians we be one   america will work to see that this spirit prevail that all faith be respect and that bridge be build among they   in a region that be the birthplace of three world religion intolerance can lead only to suffering and stagnation   and for this season of change to succeed coptic christians must have the right to worship freely in cairo just as shia must never have their mosque destroy in bahrain

 what be true for religious minority be also true when it come to the right of woman   history show that country be more prosperous and more peaceful when woman be empower   and that ’ why we will continue to insist that universal right apply to woman as well as man by focus assistance on child and maternal health by help woman to teach or start a business by stand up for the right of woman to have their voice hear and to run for office   the region will never reach its full potential when more than half of its population be prevent from achieve their full potential   applause

 now even as we promote political reform even as we promote human right in the region our effort can not stop there   so the second way that we must support positive change in the region be through our effort to advance economic development for nation that be transition to democracy

 after all politic alone have not put protester into the street   the tipping point for so many people be the more constant concern of put food on the table and provide for a family   too many people in the region wake up with few expectation other than make it through the day perhaps hope that their luck will change   throughout the region many young people have a solid education but closed economy leave they unable to find a job   entrepreneur be brim with idea but corruption leave they unable to profit from those idea

 the great untapped resource in the middle east and north africa be the talent of its people   in the recent protest we see that talent on display as people harness technology to move the world   it ’ no coincidence that one of the leader of tahrir square be an executive for google   that energy now need to be channel in country after country so that economic growth can solidify the accomplishment of the street   for just as democratic revolution can be trigger by a lack of individual opportunity successful democratic transition depend upon an expansion of growth and broad base prosperity

 so draw from what we ’ve learn around the world we think it ’ important to focus on trade not just aid on investment not just assistance   the goal must be a model in which protectionism give way to openness the reign of commerce pass from the few to the many and the economy generate job for the young   america ’s support for democracy will therefore be base on ensure financial stability promote reform and integrate competitive market with each other and the global economy   and we ’re go to start with tunisia and egypt

 first we ’ve ask the world bank and the international monetary fund to present a plan at next week ’s g8 summit for what need to be do to stabilize and modernize the economy of tunisia and egypt   together we must help they recover from the disruption of their democratic upheaval and support the government that will be elect later this year   and we be urge other country to help egypt and tunisia meet its near term financial need

 second we do not want a democratic egypt to be saddle by the debt of its past   so we will relieve a democratic egypt of up to $ 1 billion in debt and work with our egyptian partner to invest these resource to foster growth and entrepreneurship   we will help egypt regain access to market by guarantee $ 1 billion in borrowing that be need to finance infrastructure and job creation   and we will help newly democratic government recover asset that be steal

 third we ’re work with congress to create enterprise funds to invest in tunisia and egypt   and these will be model on fund that support the transition in eastern europe after the fall of the berlin wall   opic will soon launch a $ 2 billion facility to support private investment across the region   and we will work with the ally to refocus the european bank for reconstruction and development so that it provide the same support for democratic transition and economic modernization in the middle east and north africa as it have in europe

 fourth the united states will launch a comprehensive trade and investment partnership initiative in the middle east and north africa   if you take out oil export this entire region of over 400 million people export roughly the same amount as switzerland   so we will work with the eu to facilitate more trade within the region build on exist agreement to promote integration with u.s. and european market and open the door for those country who adopt high standard of reform and trade liberalization to construct a regional trade arrangement   and just as eu membership serve as an incentive for reform in europe so should the vision of a modern and prosperous economy create a powerful force for reform in the middle east and north africa

 prosperity also require tear down wall that stand in the way of progress the corruption of elite who steal from their people the red tape that stop an idea from become a business the patronage that distribute wealth base on tribe or sect   we will help government meet international obligation and invest effort at anti corruption by work with parliamentarian who be develop reform and activist who use technology to increase transparency and hold government accountable   politic and human right economic reform

 let i conclude by talk about another cornerstone of our approach to the region and that relate to the pursuit of peace

 for decade the conflict between israelis and arabs have cast a shadow over the region   for israelis it have mean live with the fear that their child could be blow up on a bus or by rocket fire at their home as well as the pain of know that other child in the region be teach to hate they   for palestinians it have mean suffer the humiliation of occupation and never live in a nation of their own   moreover this conflict have come with a large cost to the middle east as it impede partnership that could bring great security and prosperity and empowerment to ordinary people

 for over two year my administration have work with the party and the international community to end this conflict build on decade of work by previous administration   yet expectation have go unmet   israeli settlement activity continue   palestinians have walk away from talk   the world look at a conflict that have grind on and on and on and see nothing but stalemate   indeed there be those who argue that with all the change and uncertainty in the region it be simply not possible to move forward now

 i disagree   at a time when the people of the middle east and north africa be cast off the burden of the past the drive for a last peace that end the conflict and resolve all claim be more urgent than ever   that ’ certainly true for the two party involve

 for the palestinians effort to delegitimize israel will end in failure   symbolic action to isolate israel at the united nations in september will not create an independent state palestinian leader will not achieve peace or prosperity if hamas insist on a path of terror and rejection   and palestinians will never realize their independence by deny the right of israel to exist

 as for israel our friendship be root deeply in a share history and share value   our commitment to israel ’s security be unshakeable   and we will stand against attempt to single it out for criticism in international forum   but precisely because of our friendship it ’ important that we tell the truth   the status quo be unsustainable and israel too must act boldly to advance a last peace

 the fact be a grow number of palestinians live west of the jordan river   technology will make it hard for israel to defend itself   a region undergo profound change will lead to populism in which million of people not just one or two leader must believe peace be possible   the international community be tired of an endless process that never produce an outcome the dream of a jewish and democratic state can not be fulfil with permanent occupation

 now ultimately it be up to the israelis and palestinians to take action   no peace can be impose upon they not by the united states not by anybody else   but endless delay will not make the problem go away   what america and the international community can do be to state frankly what everyone know a last peace will involve two state for two people   israel as a jewish state and the homeland for the jewish people and the state of palestine as the homeland for the palestinian people each state enjoy self determination mutual recognition and peace

 so while the core issue of the conflict must be negotiate the basis of those negotiation be clear   a viable palestine a secure israel   the united states believe that negotiation should result in two state with permanent palestinian border with israel jordan and egypt and permanent israeli border with palestine   we believe the border of israel and palestine should be base on the 1967 line with mutually agree swap so that secure and recognize border be establish for both state   the palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves and reach their full potential in a sovereign and contiguous state

 as for security every state have the right to self defense and israel must be able to defend itself by itself against any threat   provision must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism to stop the infiltration of weapon and to provide effective border security   the full and phase withdrawal of israeli military force should be coordinate with the assumption of palestinian security responsibility in a sovereign non militarized state   and the duration of this transition period must be agree and the effectiveness of security arrangement must be demonstrate

 these principle provide a foundation for negotiation   palestinians should know the territorial outline of their state israelis should know that their basic security concern will be meet   i ’m aware that these step alone will not resolve the conflict because two wrench and emotional issue will remain   the future of jerusalem and the fate of palestinian refugee   but move forward now on the basis of territory and security provide a foundation to resolve those two issue in a way that be just and fair and that respect the right and aspiration of both israelis and palestinians

 now let i say this   recognize that negotiation need to begin with the issue of territory and security do not mean that it will be easy to come back to the table   in particular the recent announcement of an agreement between fatah and hamas raise profound and legitimate question for israel   how can one negotiate with a party that have show itself unwilling to recognize your right to exist   and in the week and month to come palestinian leader will have to provide a credible answer to that question   meanwhile the united states our quartet partner and the arab state will need to continue every effort to get beyond the current impasse

 i recognize how hard this will be   suspicion and hostility have be pass on for generation and at time it have harden but i ’m convince that the majority of israelis and palestinians would rather look to the future than be trap in the past   we see that spirit in the israeli father whose son be kill by hamas who helped start an organization that bring together israelis and palestinians who have lose love one   that father say i gradually realize that the only hope for progress be to recognize the face of the conflict   we see it in the action of a palestinian who lose three daughter to israeli shell in gaza   i have the right to feel angry he say   so many people be expect i to hate   my answer to they be i shall not hate   let we hope he say for tomorrow

 that be the choice that must be make not simply in the israeli palestinian conflict but across the entire region a choice between hate and hope between the shackle of the past and the promise of the future   it ’ a choice that must be make by leader and by the people and it ’ a choice that will define the future of a region that serve as the cradle of civilization and a crucible of strife

 for all the challenge that lie ahead we see many reason to be hopeful   in egypt we see it in the effort of young people who lead protest   in syria we see it in the courage of those who brave bullet while chant peaceful peaceful   in benghazi a city threaten with destruction we see it in the courthouse square where people gather to celebrate the freedom that they have never know   across the region those right that we take for grant be be claim with joy by those who be pry loose the grip of an iron fist

 for the american people the scene of upheaval in the region may be unsettling but the force drive it be not unfamiliar   our own nation be found through a rebellion against an empire   our people fight a painful civil war that extend freedom and dignity to those who be enslave   and i would not be stand here today unless past generation turn to the moral force of nonviolence as a way to perfect our union organizing marching protest peacefully together to make real those word that declare our nation   we hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal

 those word must guide our response to the change that be transform the middle east and north africa word which tell we that repression will fail and that tyrant will fall and that every man and woman be endow with certain inalienable right

 it will not be easy   there ’ no straight line to progress and hardship always accompany a season of hope   but the united states of america be found on the belief that people should govern themselves   and now we can not hesitate to stand squarely on the side of those who be reach for their right know that their success will bring about a world that be more peaceful more stable and more just

 thank you very much everybody   applause   thank you

thank you very much   thank you   applause

      my lord chancellor mr. speaker mr. prime minister my lord and member of the house of commons

      i have know few great honor than the opportunity to address the mother of parliaments at westminster hall   i be tell that the last three speaker here have be the pope her majesty the queen and nelson mandela which be either a very high bar or the beginning of a very funny joke   laughter

      i come here today to reaffirm one of the old one of the strong alliance the world have ever know   it ’s long be say that the united states and the united kingdom share a special relationship   and since we also share an especially active press corps that relationship be often analyze and overanalyze for the slight hint of stress or strain

      of course all relationship have their up and down   admittedly our get off on the wrong foot with a small scrape about tea and taxis   laughter   there may also have be some hurt feeling when the white house be set on fire during the war of 1812   laughter   but fortunately it ’s be smooth sailing ever since

      the reason for this close friendship do not just have to do with our share history our shared heritage our tie of language and culture or even the strong partnership between our government   our relationship be special because of the value and belief that have unite our people through the age

      century ago when king emperor and warlord reign over much of the world it be the english who first spell out the right and liberty of man in the magna carta   it be here in this very hall where the rule of law first develop court be establish dispute be settle and citizen come to petition their leader

      over time the people of this nation wage a long and sometimes bloody struggle to expand and secure their freedom from the crown   propel by the ideal of the enlightenment they would ultimately forge an english bill of rights and invest the power to govern in an elect parliament that ’s gather here today

      what begin on this island would inspire million throughout the continent of europe and across the world   but perhaps no one draw great inspiration from these notion of freedom than your rabble rouse colonist on the other side of the atlantic   as winston churchill say the magna carta the bill of rights habeas corpus trial by jury and english common law find their most famous expression in the american declaration of independence

      for both of our nation live up to the ideal enshrine in these found document have sometimes be difficult have always be a work in progress   the path have never be perfect but through the struggle of slave and immigrant woman and ethnic minority former colony and persecute religion we have learn well than most that the longing for freedom and human dignity be not english or american or western it be universal and it beat in every heart   perhaps that ’ why there be few nation that stand firm speak louder and fight hard to defend democratic value around the world than the united states and the united kingdom

      we be the ally who land at omaha and gold who sacrifice side by side to free a continent from the march of tyranny and help prosperity flourish from the ruin of war   and with the founding of nato a british idea we join a transatlantic alliance that have ensure our security for over half a century

      together with our ally we forge a last peace from a cold war   when the iron curtain lift we expand our alliance to include the nation of central and eastern europe and build new bridge to russia and the former state of the soviet union and when there be strife in the balkans we work together to keep the peace

      today after a difficult decade that begin with war and end in recession our nation have arrive at a pivotal moment once more   a global economy that once stand on the brink of depression be now stable and recover   after year of conflict the united states have remove 100,000 troop from iraq the united kingdom have remove its force and our combat mission there have end   in afghanistan we ’ve break the taliban ’s momentum and will soon begin a transition to afghan lead   and nearly 10 year after 9/11 we have disrupt terrorist network and deal al qaeda a huge blow by kill its leader osama bin laden

      together we have meet great challenge   but as we enter this new chapter in our share history profound challenge stretch before we   in a world where the prosperity of all nation be now inextricably link a new era of cooperation be require to ensure the growth and stability of the global economy   as new threat spread across border and ocean we must dismantle terrorist network and stop the spread of nuclear weapon confront climate change and combat famine and disease   and as a revolution race through the street of the middle east and north africa the entire world have a stake in the aspiration of a generation that long to determine its own destiny

      these challenge come at a time when the international order have already be reshape for a new century   country like china india and brazil be grow by leap and bound   we should welcome this development for it have lift hundred of million from poverty around the globe and create new market and opportunity for our own nation

      and yet as this rapid change have take place it ’s become fashionable in some quarter to question whether the rise of these nation will accompany the decline of american and european influence around the world   perhaps the argument go these nation represent the future and the time for our leadership have pass

      that argument be wrong   the time for our leadership be now it be the united states and the united kingdom and our democratic ally that shape a world in which new nation could emerge and individual could thrive   and even as more nation take on the responsibility of global leadership our alliance will remain indispensable to the goal of a century that be more peaceful more prosperous and more just

      at a time when threat and challenge require nation to work in concert with one another we remain the great catalyst for global action   in an era define by the rapid flow of commerce and information it be our free market tradition our openness fortify by our commitment to basic security for our citizen that offer the good chance of prosperity that be both strong and share   as million be still deny their basic human right because of who they be or what they believe or the kind of government that they live under we be the nation most willing to stand up for the value of tolerance and self determination that lead to peace and dignity

      now this do not mean we can afford to stand still   the nature of our leadership will need to change with the time   as i say the first time i come to london as president for the g20 summit the day be go when roosevelt and churchill could sit in a room and solve the world ’s problem over a glass of brandy   although i ’m sure that prime minister cameron would agree that some day we could both use a stiff drink   laughter   in this century our joint leadership will require build new partnership adapt to new circumstance and remake ourselves to meet the demand of a new era

      that begin with our economic leadership

      adam smith ’s central insight remain true today   there be no great generator of wealth and innovation than a system of free enterprise that unleash the full potential of individual man and woman   that ’ what lead to the industrial revolution that begin in the factory of manchester   that be what lead to the dawn of the information age that arise from the office park of silicon valley   that ’ why country like china india and brazil be grow so rapidly because in fit and start they be move toward market base principle that the united states and the united kingdom have always embrace

      in other word we live in a global economy that be largely of our own making   and today the competition for the good job and industry favor country that be free thinking and forward look country with the most creative and innovative and entrepreneurial citizen

      that give nation like the united states and the united kingdom an inherent advantage   for from newton and darwin to edison and einstein from alan turing to steve jobs we have lead the world in our commitment to science and cutting edge research the discovery of new medicine and technology   we educate our citizen and train our worker in the good college and university on earth   but to maintain this advantage in a world that ’s more competitive than ever we will have to redouble our investment in science and engineering and renew our national commitment to educate our workforce

      we ’ve also be remind in the last few year that market can sometimes fail   in the last century both our nation put in place regulatory framework to deal with such market failure safeguard to protect the banking system after the great depression for example regulation that be establish to prevent the pollution of our air and water during the 1970

      but in today ’s economy such threat of market failure can no long be contain within the border of any one country   market failure can go global and go viral and demand international response

      a financial crisis that begin on wall street infect nearly every continent which be why we must keep work through forum like the g20 to put in place global rule of the road to prevent future excess and abuse   no country can hide from the danger of carbon pollution which be why we must build on what be achieve at copenhagen and cancun to leave our child a planet that be safe and clean

      moreover even when the free market work as it should both our country recognize that no matter how responsibly we live in our life hard time or bad luck a crippling illness or a layoff may strike any one of we   and so part of our common tradition have express itself in a conviction that every citizen deserve a basic measure of security health care if you get sick unemployment insurance if you lose your job a dignified retirement after a lifetime of hard work   that commitment to our citizen have also be the reason for our leadership in the world

      and now having come through a terrible recession our challenge be to meet these obligation while ensure that we ’re not consume and hence consume with a level of debt that could sap the strength and vitality of our economy   and that will require difficult choice and it will require different path for both of our country   but we have face such challenge before and have always be able to balance the need for fiscal responsibility with the responsibility we have to one another

      and i believe we can do this again   as we do the success and failure of our own past can serve as an example for emerge economy that it ’ possible to grow without pollute that lasting prosperity come not from what a nation consume but from what it produce and from the investment it make in its people and its infrastructure

      and just as we must lead on behalf of the prosperity of our citizen so we must safeguard their security   our two nation know what it be to confront evil in the world   hitler ’s army would not have stop their killing have we not fight they on the beach and on the landing ground in the field and on the street   we must never forget that there be nothing inevitable about our victory in that terrible war   it be win through the courage and character of our people

      precisely because we be willing to bear its burden we know well the cost of war   and that be why we build an alliance that be strong enough to defend this continent while deter our enemy   at its core nato be root in the simple concept of article five   that no nato nation will have to fend on its own that ally will stand by one another always   and for six decade nato have be the most successful alliance in human history

      today we confront a different enemy   terrorist have take the life of our citizen in new york and in london   and while al qaeda seek a religious war with the west we must remember that they have kill thousand of muslims man woman and child around the globe   our nation be not and will never be at war with islam   our fight be focus on defeat al qaeda and its extremist ally   in that effort we will not relent as osama bin laden and his follower have learn   and as we fight an enemy that respect no law of war we will continue to hold ourselves to a high standard by live up to the value the rule of law and due process that we so ardently defend

      for almost a decade afghanistan have be a central front of these effort   throughout those year you the british people have be a stalwart ally along with so many other who fight by our side

      together let we pay tribute to all of our man and woman who have serve and sacrifice over the last several year for they be part of an unbroken line of hero who have bear the heavy burden for the freedom that we enjoy   because of they we have break the taliban ’s momentum   because of they we have build the capacity of afghan security force   and because of they we be now prepare to turn a corner in afghanistan by transition to afghan lead   and during this transition we will pursue a last peace with those who break free of al qaeda and respect the afghan constitution and lie down arm   and we will ensure that afghanistan be never a safe haven for terror but be instead a country that be strong sovereign and able to stand on its own two foot

      indeed our effort in this young century have lead we to a new concept for nato that will give we the capability need to meet new threat threat like terrorism and piracy cyber attack and ballistic missile   but a revitalize nato will continue to hew to that original vision of its founder allow we to rally collective action for the defense of our people while build upon the broad belief of roosevelt and churchill that all nation have both right and responsibility and all nation share a common interest in an international architecture that maintain the peace

      we also share a common interest in stop the spread of nuclear weapon   across the globe nation be lock down nuclear material so they never fall into the wrong hand because of our leadership   from north korea to iran we ’ve send a message that those who flaunt their obligation will face consequence which be why america and the european union just recently strengthen our sanction on iran in large part because of the leadership of the united kingdom and the united states   and while we hold other to account we will meet our own obligation under the non proliferation treaty and strive for a world without nuclear weapon

      we share a common interest in resolve conflict that prolong human suffering and threaten to tear whole region asunder   in sudan after year of war and thousand of death we call on both north and south to pull back from the brink of violence and choose the path of peace   and in the middle east we stand united in our support for a secure israel and a sovereign palestine

      and we share a common interest in development that advance dignity and security   to succeed we must cast aside the impulse to look at impoverished part of the globe as a place for charity   instead we should empower the same force that have allow our own people to thrive   we should help the hungry to feed themselves the doctor who care for the sick   we should support country that confront corruption and allow their people to innovate   and we should advance the truth that nation prosper when they allow woman and girl to reach their full potential

      we do these thing because we believe not simply in the right of nation we believe in the right of citizen   that be the beacon that guide we through our fight against fascism and our twilight struggle against communism   and today that idea be be put to the test in the middle east and north africa   in country after country people be mobilize to free themselves from the grip of an iron fist   and while these movement for change be just six month old we have see they play out before from eastern europe to the americas from south africa to southeast asia

      history tell we that democracy be not easy   it will be year before these revolution reach their conclusion and there will be difficult day along the way   power rarely give up without a fight particularly in place where there be division of tribe and division of sect   we also know that populism can take dangerous turn from the extremism of those who would use democracy to deny minority right to the nationalism that leave so many scar on this continent in the 20th century

      but make no mistake   what we see what we be see in tehran in tunis in tahrir square be a longing for the same freedom that we take for grant here at home   it be a rejection of the notion that people in certain part of the world do not want to be free or need to have democracy impose upon they   it be a rebuke to the worldview of al qaeda which smother the right of individual and would thereby subject they to perpetual poverty and violence

      let there be no doubt   the united states and united kingdom stand squarely on the side of those who long to be free   and now we must show that we will back up those word with deed   that mean invest in the future of those nation that transition to democracy start with tunisia and egypt by deepen tie of trade and commerce by help they demonstrate that freedom bring prosperity   and that mean stand up for universal right by sanction those who pursue repression strengthen civil society support the right of minority
      we do this know that the west must overcome suspicion and mistrust among many in the middle east and north africa a mistrust that be root in a difficult past   for year we ’ve face charge of hypocrisy from those who do not enjoy the freedom that they hear us espouse   and so to they we must squarely acknowledge that yes we have endure interest in the region to fight terror sometimes with partner who may not be perfect to protect against disruption of the world ’s energy supply   but we must also insist that we reject as false the choice between our interest and our ideal between stability and democracy   for our idealism be root in the reality of history that repression offer only the false promise of stability that society be more successful when their citizen be free and that democracy be the close ally we have

      it be that truth that guide our action in libya   it would have be easy at the outset of the crackdown in libya to say that none of this be our business that a nation ’s sovereignty be more important than the slaughter of civilian within its border   that argument carry weight with some   but we be different   we embrace a broad responsibility   and while we can not stop every injustice there be circumstance that cut through our caution when a leader be threaten to massacre his people and the international community be call for action   that ’ why we stop a massacre in libya   and we will not relent until the people of libya be protect and the shadow of tyranny be lift

      we will proceed with humility and the knowledge that we can not dictate every outcome abroad   ultimately freedom must be win by the people themselves not impose from without   but we can and must stand with those who so struggle   because we have always believe that the future of our child and grandchild will be well if other people ’s child and grandchild be more prosperous and more free from the beach of normandy to the balkans to benghazi   that be our interest and our ideal   and if we fail to meet that responsibility who would take our place and what kind of world would we pass on

      our action our leadership be essential to the cause of human dignity   and so we must act and lead with confidence in our ideal and an abide faith in the character of our people who send we all here today

      for there be one final quality that i believe make the united states and the united kingdom indispensable to this moment in history   and that be how we define ourselves as nation

      unlike most country in the world we do not define citizenship base on race or ethnicity   be american or british be not about belong to a certain group it ’ about believe in a certain set of ideal the right of individual the rule of law   that be why we hold incredible diversity within our border   that ’ why there be people around the world right now who believe that if they come to america if they come to new york if they come to london if they work hard they can pledge allegiance to our flag and call themselves americans if they come to england they can make a new life for themselves and can sing god save the queen just like any other citizen

      yes our diversity can lead to tension   and throughout our history there have be heat debate about immigration and assimilation in both of our country   but even as these debate can be difficult we fundamentally recognize that our patchwork heritage be an enormous strength that in a world which will only grow small and more interconnect the example of our two nation say it be possible for people to be unite by their ideal instead of divide by their difference that it ’ possible for heart to change and old hatred to pass that it ’ possible for the son and daughter of former colony to sit here as member of this great parliament and for the grandson of a kenyan who serve as a cook in the british army to stand before you as president of the united states   applause

      that be what define we   that be why the young man and woman in the street of damascus and cairo still reach for the right our citizen enjoy even if they sometimes differ with our policy   as two of the most powerful nation in the history of the world we must always remember that the true source of our influence have not just be the size of our economy or the reach of our military or the land that we ’ve claim   it have be the value that we must never waver in defend around the world the idea that all being be endow by our creator with certain right that can not be deny

      that be what forge our bond in the fire of war a bond make manifest by the friendship between two of our great leader   churchill and roosevelt have their difference   they be keen observer of each other ’s blind spot and shortcoming if not always their own and they be hard headed about their ability to remake the world   but what join the fate of these two man at that particular moment in history be not simply a share interest in victory on the battlefield   it be a share belief in the ultimate triumph of human freedom and human dignity a conviction that we have a say in how this story end

      this conviction live on in their people today   the challenge we face be great   the work before we be hard   but we have come through a difficult decade and whenever the test and trial ahead may seem too big or too many let we turn to their example and the word that churchill speak on the day that europe be free

      in the long year to come not only will the people of this island but the world wherever the bird of freedom chirp in the human heart look back to what we ’ve do and they will say do not despair do not yield march straightforward

      with courage and purpose with humility and with hope with faith in the promise of tomorrow let we march straightforward together endure ally in the cause of a world that be more peaceful more prosperous and more just

      thank you very much   applause

good evening   nearly 10 year ago america suffer the bad attack on our shore since pearl harbor   this mass murder be plan by osama bin laden and his al qaeda network in afghanistan and signal a new threat to our security one in which the target be no long soldier on a battlefield but innocent man woman and child go about their daily life

 in the day that follow our nation be unite as we strike at al qaeda and route the taliban in afghanistan   then our focus shift   a second war be launch in iraq and we spend enormous blood and treasure to support a new government there   by the time i take office the war in afghanistan have enter its seventh year   but al qaeda ’s leader have escape into pakistan and be plot new attack while the taliban have regroup and go on the offensive   without a new strategy and decisive action our military commander warn that we could face a resurgent al qaeda and a taliban take over large part of afghanistan

 for this reason in one of the most difficult decision that i ’ve make as president i order an additional 30,000 american troop into afghanistan   when i announce this surge at west point we set clear objective   to refocus on al qaeda to reverse the taliban ’s momentum and train afghan security force to defend their own country   i also make it clear that our commitment would not be open ended and that we would begin to draw down our force this july

 tonight i can tell you that we be fulfil that commitment   thank to our extraordinary man and woman in uniform our civilian personnel and our many coalition partner we be meet our goal   as a result start next month we will be able to remove 10,000 of our troop from afghanistan by the end of this year and we will bring home a total of 33,000 troop by next summer fully recover the surge i announce at west point   after this initial reduction our troop will continue come home at a steady pace as afghan security force move into the lead   our mission will change from combat to support   by 2014 this process of transition will be complete and the afghan people will be responsible for their own security

 we ’re start this drawdown from a position of strength   al qaeda be under more pressure than at any time since 9/11   together with the pakistanis we have take out more than half of al qaeda ’s leadership   and thank to our intelligence professional and special forces we kill osama bin laden the only leader that al qaeda have ever know   this be a victory for all who have serve since 9/11   one soldier sum it up well   the message he say be we do not forget   you will be hold accountable no matter how long it take

 the information that we recover from bin laden ’s compound show al qaeda under enormous strain   bin laden express concern that al qaeda have be unable to effectively replace senior terrorist that have be kill and that al qaeda have fail in its effort to portray america as a nation at war with islam thereby drain more widespread support   al qaeda remain dangerous and we must be vigilant against attack   but we have put al qaeda on a path to defeat and we will not relent until the job be do

 in afghanistan we ’ve inflict serious loss on the taliban and take a number of its stronghold   along with our surge our ally also increase their commitment which help stabilize more of the country   afghan security force have grow by over 100,000 troop and in some province and municipality we ’ve already begin to transition responsibility for security to the afghan people   in the face of violence and intimidation afghans be fight and die for their country establish local police force open market and school create new opportunity for woman and girl and try to turn the page on decade of war

 of course huge challenge remain   this be the beginning but not the end of our effort to wind down this war   we ’ll have to do the hard work of keep the gain that we ’ve make while we draw down our force and transition responsibility for security to the afghan government   and next may in chicago we will host a summit with our nato ally and partner to shape the next phase of this transition

 we do know that peace can not come to a land that have know so much war without a political settlement   so as we strengthen the afghan government and security force america will join initiative that reconcile the afghan people include the taliban   our position on these talk be clear   they must be lead by the afghan government and those who want to be a part of a peaceful afghanistan must break from al qaeda abandon violence and abide by the afghan constitution   but in part because of our military effort we have reason to believe that progress can be make

 the goal that we seek be achievable and can be express simply   no safe haven from which al qaeda or its affiliate can launch attack against our homeland or our ally   we will not try to make afghanistan a perfect place   we will not police its street or patrol its mountain indefinitely   that be the responsibility of the afghan government which must step up its ability to protect its people and move from an economy shape by war to one that can sustain a last peace   what we can do and will do be build a partnership with the afghan people that endure one that ensure that we will be able to continue target terrorist and support a sovereign afghan government

 of course our effort must also address terrorist safe haven in pakistan   no country be more endanger by the presence of violent extremist which be why we will continue to press pakistan to expand its participation in secure a more peaceful future for this war tear region   we will work with the pakistani government to root out the cancer of violent extremism and we will insist that it keep its commitment   for there should be no doubt that so long as i be president the united states will never tolerate a safe haven for those who aim to kill we   they can not elude we nor escape the justice they deserve

 my fellow americans this have be a difficult decade for our country   we have learn anew the profound cost of war a cost that be be pay by the nearly 4,500 americans who have give their life in iraq and the over 1,500 who have do so in afghanistan man and woman who will not live to enjoy the freedom that they defend   thousand more have be wound some have lose limb on the battlefield and other still battle the demon that have follow they home

 yet tonight we take comfort in know that the tide of war be recede   few of our son and daughter be serve in harm ’s way   we ’ve end our combat mission in iraq with 100,000 american troop already out of that country   and even as there will be dark day ahead in afghanistan the light of a secure peace can be see in the distance   these long war will come to a responsible end

 as they do we must learn their lesson   already this decade of war have cause many to question the nature of america ’s engagement around the world   some would have america retreat from our responsibility as an anchor of global security and embrace an isolation that ignore the very real threat that we face   other would have america over extend confront every evil that can be find abroad

 we must chart a more centered course   like generation before we must embrace america ’s singular role in the course of human event   but we must be as pragmatic as we be passionate as strategic as we be resolute   when threaten we must respond with force but when that force can be target we need not deploy large army overseas   when innocent be be slaughter and global security endanger we do not have to choose between stand idly by or act on our own   instead we must rally international action which we ’re do in libya where we do not have a single soldier on the ground but be support ally in protect the libyan people and give they the chance to determine their own destiny

 in all that we do we must remember that what set america apart be not solely our power it be the principle upon which our union be found   we ’re a nation that bring our enemy to justice while adhere to the rule of law and respect the right of all our citizen   we protect our own freedom and prosperity by extend it to other   we stand not for empire but for self determination   that be why we have a stake in the democratic aspiration that be now wash across the arab world   we will support those revolution with fidelity to our ideal with the power of our example and with an unwavering belief that all human being deserve to live with freedom and dignity

 above all we be a nation whose strength abroad have be anchor in opportunity for our citizen here at home   over the last decade we have spend a trillion dollar on war at a time of rise debt and hard economic time   now we must invest in america ’s great resource our people   we must unleash innovation that create new job and industry while live within our mean   we must rebuild our infrastructure and find new and clean source of energy   and most of all after a decade of passionate debate we must recapture the common purpose that we share at the beginning of this time of war   for our nation draw strength from our difference and when our union be strong no hill be too steep no horizon be beyond our reach

 america it be time to focus on nation building here at home

 in this effort we draw inspiration from our fellow americans who have sacrifice so much on our behalf   to our troop our veteran and their family i speak for all americans when i say that we will keep our sacred trust with you and provide you with the care and benefit and opportunity that you deserve

 i meet some of these patriotic americans at fort campbell   a while back i speak to the 101st airborne that have fight to turn the tide in afghanistan and to the team that take out osama bin laden   stand in front of a model of bin laden ’s compound the navy seal who lead that effort pay tribute to those who have be lose brother and sister in arm whose name be now write on basis where our troop stand guard overseas and on headstone in quiet corner of our country where their memory will never be forget   this officer like so many other i ’ve meet on basis in baghdad and bagram and at walter reed and bethesda naval hospital speak with humility about how his unit work together as one depend on each other and trust one another as a family might do in a time of peril

 that ’ a lesson worth remembering that we be all a part of one american family   though we have know disagreement and division we be bind together by the creed that be write into our found document and a conviction that the united states of america be a country that can achieve whatever it set out to accomplish   now let we finish the work at hand   let we responsibly end these war and reclaim the american dream that be at the center of our story   with confidence in our cause with faith in our fellow citizen and with hope in our heart let we go about the work of extend the promise of america for this generation and the next

 may god bless our troop   and may god bless the united states of america

 pass this job bill and the typical work family will get a $ 1,500 tax cut next year   fifteen hundred dollar that would have be take out of your pocket will go into your pocket   this expand on the tax cut that democrats and republicans already pass for this year   if we allow that tax cut to expire if we refuse to act middle class family will get hit with a tax increase at the bad possible time   we can not let that happen   i know that some of you have swear oath to never raise any taxis on anyone for as long as you live   now be not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle class taxis which be why you should pass this bill right away   applause

 this be the american jobs act   it will lead to new job for construction worker for teacher for veteran for first responder young people and the long term unemployed   it will provide tax credit to company that hire new worker tax relief to small business owner and tax cut for the middle class   and here ’ the other thing i want the american people to know   the american jobs act will not add to the deficit   it will be pay for   and here ’ how   applause

 the agreement we pass in july will cut government spending by about $ 1 trillion over the next 10 year   it also charge this congress to come up with an additional $ 1.5 trillion in saving by christmas   tonight i be ask you to increase that amount so that it cover the full cost of the american jobs act   and a week from monday i ’ll be release a more ambitious deficit plan a plan that will not only cover the cost of this job bill but stabilize our debt in the long run   applause

 this approach be basically the one i ’ve be advocate for month   in addition to the trillion dollar of spending cut i ’ve already sign into law it ’ a balanced plan that would reduce the deficit by make additional spending cut by make modest adjustment to health care program like medicare and medicaid and by reform our tax code in a way that ask the wealthy americans and big corporation to pay their fair share   applause   what ’s more the spending cut would not happen so abruptly that they ’d be a drag on our economy or prevent we from help small business and middle class family get back on their foot right away

 now i realize there be some in my party who do not think we should make any change at all to medicare and medicaid and i understand their concern   but here ’ the truth   millions of americans rely on medicare in their retirement   and million more will do so in the future   they pay for this benefit during their working year   they earn it   but with an age population and rise health care cost we be spend too fast to sustain the program   and if we do not gradually reform the system while protect current beneficiary it will not be there when future retiree need it   we have to reform medicare to strengthen it   applause

 i be also i ’m also well aware that there be many republicans who do not believe we should raise taxis on those who be most fortunate and can well afford it   but here be what every american know   while most people in this country struggle to make end meet a few of the most affluent citizen and most profitable corporation enjoy tax break and loophole that nobody else get   right now warren buffett pay a low tax rate than his secretary an outrage he have ask we to fix   laughter   we need a tax code where everyone get a fair shake and where everybody pay their fair share   applause   and by the way i believe the vast majority of wealthy americans and ceo be willing to do just that if it help the economy grow and get our fiscal house in order

 i ’ll also offer idea to reform a corporate tax code that stand as a monument to special interest influence in washington   by eliminate page of loophole and deduction we can lower one of the high corporate tax rate in the world   applause   our tax code should not give an advantage to company that can afford the well connect lobbyist   it should give an advantage to company that invest and create job right here in the united states of america   applause

 so we can reduce this deficit pay down our debt and pay for this job plan in the process   but in order to do this we have to decide what our priority be   we have to ask ourselves what ’s the good way to grow the economy and create job

 should we keep tax loophole for oil company   or should we use that money to give small business owner a tax credit when they hire new worker   because we can not afford to do both   should we keep tax break for millionaire and billionaire   or should we put teacher back to work so our kid can graduate ready for college and good job   applause   right now we can not afford to do both

 this be n’t political grandstanding   this be n’t class warfare   this be simple math   laughter   this be simple math   these be real choice   these be real choice that we ’ve get to make   and i ’m pretty sure i know what most americans would choose   it ’ not even close   and it ’ time for we to do what ’s right for our future   applause

 now the american jobs act answer the urgent need to create job right away   but we can not stop there   as i ’ve argue since i run for this office we have to look beyond the immediate crisis and start build an economy that last into the future an economy that create good middle class job that pay well and offer security   we now live in a world where technology have make it possible for company to take their business anywhere   if we want they to start here and stay here and hire here we have to be able to out build and out educate and out innovate every other country on earth   applause

 and this task of make america more competitive for the long haul that ’ a job for all of we   for government and for private company   for state and for local community and for every american citizen   all of we will have to up our game   all of we will have to change the way we do business

 my administration can and will take some step to improve our competitiveness on our own   for example if you ’re a small business owner who have a contract with the federal government we ’re go to make sure you get pay a lot fast than you do right now   applause   we ’re also plan to cut away the red tape that prevent too many rapidly grow startup company from raise capital and go public   and to help responsible homeowner we ’re go to work with federal housing agency to help more people refinance their mortgage at interest rate that be now near 4 percent   that ’ a step applause i know you guy must be for this because that ’ a step that can put more than $ 2,000 a year in a family ’s pocket and give a lift to an economy still burden by the drop in housing price

 so some thing we can do on our own   other step will require congressional action   today you pass reform that will speed up the outdated patent process so that entrepreneur can turn a new idea into a new business as quickly as possible that ’ the kind of action we need   now it ’ time to clear the way for a series of trade agreement that would make it easy for american company to sell their product in panama and colombia and south korea while also help the worker whose job have be affect by global competition   applause   if americans can buy kias and hyundais i want to see folk in south korea drive fords and chevys and chryslers   applause   i want to see more product sell around the world stamp with the three proud word   make in america   that ’ what we need to get do   applause

 and on all of our effort to strengthen competitiveness we need to look for way to work side by side with america ’s business   that ’ why i ’ve bring together a jobs council of leader from different industry who be develop a wide range of new idea to help company grow and create job

 already we ’ve mobilize business leader to train 10,000 american engineer a year by provide company internship and training   other business be cover tuition for worker who learn new skill at community college   and we ’re go to make sure the next generation of manufacturing take root not in china or europe but right here in the united states of america   applause   if we provide the right incentive the right support and if we make sure our trading partner play by the rule we can be the one to build everything from fuel efficient car to advanced biofuel to semiconductor that we sell all around the world   that ’ how america can be number one again   and that ’ how america will be number one again   applause

 now i realize that some of you have a different theory on how to grow the economy   some of you sincerely believe that the only solution to our economic challenge be to simply cut most government spending and eliminate most government regulation   applause

 well i agree that we can not afford wasteful spending and i ’ll work with you with congress to root it out   and i agree that there be some rule and regulation that do put an unnecessary burden on business at a time when they can least afford it   applause   that ’ why i order a review of all government regulation   so far we ’ve identify over 500 reform which will save billion of dollar over the next few year   applause   we should have no more regulation than the health safety and security of the american people require   every rule should meet that common sense test   applause

 but what we can not do what i will not do be let this economic crisis be use as an excuse to wipe out the basic protection that americans have count on for decade   applause   i reject the idea that we need to ask people to choose between their job and their safety   i reject the argument that say for the economy to grow we have to roll back protection that ban hide fee by credit card company or rule that keep our kid from be expose to mercury or law that prevent the health insurance industry from shortchange patient   i reject the idea that we have to strip away collective bargaining right to compete in a global economy   applause   we should not be in a race to the bottom where we try to offer the cheap labor and the bad pollution standard   america should be in a race to the top   and i believe we can win that race   applause

 in fact this large notion that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity be just dismantle government refund everybody ’s money and let everyone write their own rule and tell everyone they ’re on their own that ’s not who we be   that ’s not the story of america

 yes we be rugged individualist   yes we be strong and self reliant   and it have be the drive and initiative of our worker and entrepreneur that have make this economy the engine and the envy of the world

 but there ’s always be another thread run throughout our history a belief that we ’re all connect and that there be some thing we can only do together as a nation

 we all remember abraham lincoln as the leader who save our union   founder of the republican party   but in the middle of a civil war he be also a leader who look to the future a republican president who mobilize government to build the transcontinental railroad applause launch the national academy of sciences set up the first land grant college   applause   and leader of both party have follow the example he set

 ask yourselves where would we be right now if the people who sit here before we decide not to build our highway not to build our bridge our dams our airport   what would this country be like if we have choose not to spend money on public high school or research university or community college   million of return hero include my grandfather have the opportunity to go to school because of the g.i. bill   where would we be if they have not have that chance   applause

 how many job would it have cost we if past congresses decide not to support the basic research that lead to the internet and the computer chip   what kind of country would this be if this chamber have vote down social security or medicare just because it violate some rigid idea about what government could or could not do   applause   how many americans would have suffer as a result

 no single individual build america on their own   we build it together   we have be and always will be one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all a nation with responsibility to ourselves and with responsibility to one another   and member of congress it be time for we to meet our responsibility   applause

 every proposal i ’ve lay out tonight be the kind that ’s be support by democrats and republicans in the past   every proposal i ’ve lay out tonight will be pay for   and every proposal be design to meet the urgent need of our people and our community

 now i know there ’s be a lot of skepticism about whether the politic of the moment will allow we to pass this job plan or any job plan   already we ’re see the same old press release and tweet fly back and forth   already the medium have proclaim that it ’ impossible to bridge our difference   and maybe some of you have decide that those difference be so great that we can only resolve they at the ballot box

 but know this   the next election be 14 month away   and the people who send we here the people who hire we to work for they they do not have the luxury of wait 14 month   applause   some of they be live week to week paycheck to paycheck even day to day   they need help and they need it now

 i do not pretend that this plan will solve all our problem it should not be nor will it be the last plan of action we propose   what ’s guide we from the start of this crisis have not be the search for a silver bullet   it ’s be a commitment to stay at it to be persistent to keep try every new idea that work and listen to every good proposal no matter which party come up with it

 regardless of the argument we ’ve have in the past regardless of the argument we will have in the future this plan be the right thing to do right now   you should pass it   applause   and i intend to take that message to every corner of this country   applause   and i ask i ask every american who agree to lift your voice   tell the people who be gather here tonight that you want action now   tell washington that do nothing be not an option   remind we that if we act as one nation and one people we have it within our power to meet this challenge

 president kennedy once say our problem be man make therefore they can be solve by man   and man can be as big as he want

 these be difficult year for our country   but we be americans   we be tough than the time we live in and we be big than our politic have be   so let ’s meet the moment   let ’s get to work and let ’s show the world once again why the united states of america remain the great nation on earth   applause

 thank you very much   god bless you and god bless the united states of america   applause

good afternoon everybody   as a candidate for president i pledge to bring the war in iraq to a responsible end for the sake of our national security and to strengthen american leadership around the world   after take office i announce a new strategy that would end our combat mission in iraq and remove all of our troop by the end of 2011

 as commander in chief ensure the success of this strategy have be one of my high national security priority   last year i announce the end to our combat mission in iraq   and to date we ’ve remove more than 100,000 troop   iraqis have take full responsibility for their country ’s security

 a few hour ago i speak with iraqi prime minister maliki   i reaffirm that the united states keep its commitment   he speak of the determination of the iraqi people to forge their own future   we be in full agreement about how to move forward

 so today i can report that as promise the rest of our troop in iraq will come home by the end of the year   after nearly nine year america ’s war in iraq will be over

 over the next two month our troop in iraq ten of thousand of they will pack up their gear and board convoy for the journey home   the last american soldier[s will cross the border out of iraq with their head hold high proud of their success and know that the american people stand united in our support for our troop   that be how america ’s military effort in iraq will end

 but even as we mark this important milestone we ’re also move into a new phase in the relationship between the united states and iraq   as of january 1st and in keep with our strategic framework agreement with iraq it will be a normal relationship between sovereign nation an equal partnership base on mutual interest and mutual respect

 in today ’s conversation prime minister maliki and i agree that a meeting of the higher coordinating committee of the strategic framework agreement will convene in the come week   and i invite the prime minister to come to the white house in december as we plan for all the important work that we have to do together   this will be a strong and endure partnership   with our diplomat and civilian advisor in the lead we ’ll help iraqis strengthen institution that be just representative and accountable   we ’ll build new tie of trade and of commerce culture and education that unleash the potential of the iraqi people   we ’ll partner with an iraq that contribute to regional security and peace just as we insist that other nation respect iraq ’s sovereignty

      as i tell prime minister maliki we will continue discussion on how we might help iraq train and equip its force again just as we offer training and assistance to country around the world   after all there will be some difficult day ahead for iraq and the united states will continue to have an interest in an iraq that be stable secure and self reliant   just as iraqis have persevere through war i ’m confident that they can build a future worthy of their history as a cradle of civilization

      here at home the come month will be another season of homecoming   across america our servicemen and woman will be reunite with their family   today i can say that our troop in iraq will definitely be home for the holiday

 this december will be a time to reflect on all that we ’ve be though in this war   i ’ll join the american people in pay tribute to the more than 1 million americans who have serve in iraq   we ’ll honor our many wounded warrior and the nearly 4,500 american patriot and their iraqi and coalition partner who give their life to this effort

 and finally i would note that the end of war in iraq reflect a large transition   the tide of war be recede   the drawdown in iraq allow we to refocus our fight against al qaeda and achieve major victory against its leadership include osama bin laden   now even as we remove our last troop from iraq we ’re begin to bring our troop home from afghanistan where we ’ve begin a transition to afghan security and leadership   when i take office roughly 180,000 troop be deploy in both these war   and by the end of this year that number will be cut in half and make no mistake   it will continue to go down

 meanwhile yesterday mark the definitive end of the qaddafi regime in libya   and there too our military play a critical role in shape a situation on the ground in which the libyan people can build their own future   today nato be work to bring this successful mission to a close

 so to sum up the united states be move forward from a position of strength   the long war in iraq will come to an end by the end of this year   the transition in afghanistan be move forward and our troop be finally come home   as they do few deployment and more time training will help keep our military the very good in the world   and as we welcome home our new veteran we ’ll never stop work to give they and their family the care the benefit and the opportunity that they have earn

 this include enlist our veteran in the great challenge that we now face as a nation create opportunity and job in this country   because after a decade of war the nation that we need to build and the nation that we will build be our own an america that see its economic strength restore just as we ’ve restore our leadership around the globe

 thank you very much

  mr. speaker mr. vice president member of congress distinguished guest and fellow americans

 last month i go to andrews air force base and welcome home some of our last troop to serve in iraq   together we offer a final proud salute to the color under which more than a million of our fellow citizen fight and several thousand give their life

 we gather tonight know that this generation of hero have make the united states safe and more respected around the world   applause   for the first time in nine year there be no americans fight in iraq   applause   for the first time in two decade osama bin laden be not a threat to this country   applause   most of al qaeda ’s top lieutenant have be defeat   the taliban ’s momentum have be break and some troop in afghanistan have begin to come home

 these achievement be a testament to the courage selflessness and teamwork of america ’s armed forces   at a time when too many of our institution have let we down they exceed all expectation   they ’re not consume with personal ambition   they do not obsess over their difference   they focus on the mission at hand   they work together

 imagine what we could accomplish if we follow their example   applause   think about the america within our reach   a country that lead the world in educate its people   an america that attract a new generation of high tech manufacturing and high pay job   a future where we ’re in control of our own energy and our security and prosperity be n’t so tie to unstable part of the world   an economy build to last where hard work pay off and responsibility be reward

 we can do this   i know we can because we ’ve do it before   at the end of world war ii when another generation of hero return home from combat they build the strong economy and middle class the world have ever know   applause   my grandfather a veteran of patton ’s army get the chance to go to college on the gi bill   my grandmother who work on a bomber assembly line be part of a workforce that turn out the good product on earth

 the two of they share the optimism of a nation that have triumph over a depression and fascism   they understand they be part of something large that they be contribute to a story of success that every american have a chance to share the basic american promise that if you work hard you could do well enough to raise a family own a home send your kid to college and put a little away for retirement

 the defining issue of our time be how to keep that promise alive   no challenge be more urgent   no debate be more important   we can either settle for a country where a shrink number of people do really well while a grow number of americans barely get by or we can restore an economy where everyone get a fair shot and everyone do their fair share and everyone play by the same set of rule   applause   what ’ at stake be n’t democratic value or republican value but american value   and we have to reclaim they

 let ’s remember how we get here   long before the recession job and manufacturing begin leave our shore   technology make business more efficient but also make some job obsolete   folk at the top see their income rise like never before but most hardworking americans struggle with cost that be grow paycheck that be n’t and personal debt that keep pile up

 in 2008 the house of card collapse   we learn that mortgage have be sell to people who could not afford or understand they   bank have make huge bet and bonus with other people ’s money   regulator have look the other way or do not have the authority to stop the bad behavior

 it be wrong   it be irresponsible   and it plunge our economy into a crisis that put million out of work saddle we with more debt and leave innocent hardworke americans hold the bag   in the six month before i take office we lose nearly 4 million job   and we lose another 4 million before our policy be in full effect

 those be the fact   but so be these   in the last 22 month business have create more than 3 million job   applause

 last year they create the most job since 2005   american manufacturer be hire again create job for the first time since the late 1990   together we ’ve agree to cut the deficit by more than $ 2 trillion   and we ’ve put in place new rule to hold wall street accountable so a crisis like this never happen again   applause

 the state of our union be get strong   and we ’ve come too far to turn back now   as long as i ’m president i will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum   but i intend to fight obstruction with action and i will oppose any effort to return to the very same policy that bring on this economic crisis in the first place   applause

 no we will not go back to an economy weaken by outsource bad debt and phony financial profit   tonight i want to speak about how we move forward and lie out a blueprint for an economy that ’s build to last an economy build on american manufacturing american energy skill for american worker and a renewal of american value

 now this blueprint begin with american manufacturing

 on the day i take office our auto industry be on the verge of collapse   some even say we should let it die   with a million job at stake i refuse to let that happen   in exchange for help we demand responsibility   we get worker and automaker to settle their difference   we get the industry to retool and restructure   today general motors be back on top as the world ’s number one automaker   applause   chrysler have grow fast in the u.s. than any major car company   ford be invest billion in u.s. plant and factory   and together the entire industry add nearly 160,000 job

 we bet on american worker   we bet on american ingenuity   and tonight the american auto industry be back   applause

 what ’s happen in detroit can happen in other industry   it can happen in cleveland and pittsburgh and raleigh   we can not bring every job back that ’ leave our shore   but right now it ’s get more expensive to do business in place like china   meanwhile america be more productive   a few week ago the ceo of master lock tell i that it now make business sense for he to bring job back home   applause   today for the first time in 15 year master lock ’s unionized plant in milwaukee be run at full capacity   applause

 so we have a huge opportunity at this moment to bring manufacturing back   but we have to seize it   tonight my message to business leader be simple   ask yourselves what you can do to bring job back to your country and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed   applause

 we should start with our tax code   right now company get tax break for move job and profit overseas   meanwhile company that choose to stay in america get hit with one of the high tax rate in the world   it make no sense and everyone know it   so let ’s change it

 first if you ’re a business that want to outsource job you should not get a tax deduction for do it   applause   that money should be use to cover moving expense for company like master lock that decide to bring job home   applause

 second no american company should be able to avoid pay its fair share of taxis by move job and profit overseas   applause   from now on every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax   and every penny should go towards lower taxis for company that choose to stay here and hire here in america   applause

 third if you ’re an american manufacturer you should get a big tax cut   if you ’re a high tech manufacturer we should double the tax deduction you get for make your product here   and if you want to relocate in a community that be hit hard when a factory leave town you should get help finance a new plant equipment or training for new worker   applause

 so my message be simple   it be time to stop reward business that ship job overseas and start reward company that create job right here in america   send i these tax reform and i will sign they right away   applause

 we ’re also make it easy for american business to sell product all over the world   two year ago i set a goal of double u.s. export over five year   with the bipartisan trade agreement we sign into law we ’re on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule applause   and soon there will be million of new customer for american good in panama colombia and south korea   soon there will be new car on the street of seoul import from detroit and toledo and chicago   applause

 i will go anywhere in the world to open new market for american product   and i will not stand by when our competitor do not play by the rule   we ’ve bring trade case against china at nearly twice the rate as the last administration and it ’s make a difference   applause   over a thousand americans be work today because we stop a surge in chinese tire   but we need to do more   it ’ not right when another country let our movie music and software be pirate   it ’ not fair when foreign manufacturer have a leg up on ours only because they ’re heavily subsidize

 tonight i ’m announce the creation of a trade enforcement unit that will be charge with investigate unfair trading practice in country like china   applause   there will be more inspection to prevent counterfeit or unsafe good from cross our border   and this congress should make sure that no foreign company have an advantage over american manufacturing when it come to access financing or new market like russia   our worker be the most productive on earth and if the play field be level i promise you america will always win   applause

 i also hear from many business leader who want to hire in the united states but can not find worker with the right skill   grow industry in science and technology have twice as many opening as we have worker who can do the job   think about that opening at a time when million of americans be look for work   it ’ inexcusable   and we know how to fix it

 jackie bray be a single mom from north carolina who be lay off from her job as a mechanic   then siemens open a gas turbine factory in charlotte and form a partnership with central piedmont community college   the company help the college design course in laser and robotic training   it pay jackie ’s tuition then hire she to help operate their plant

 i want every american look for work to have the same opportunity as jackie do   join i in a national commitment to train 2 million americans with skill that will lead directly to a job   applause   my administration have already line up more company that want to help   model partnership between business like siemens and community college in place like charlotte and orlando and louisville be up and run   now you need to give more community college the resource they need to become community career center place that teach people skill that business be look for right now from datum management to high tech manufacturing

 and i want to cut through the maze of confuse training program so that from now on people like jackie have one program one website and one place to go for all the information and help that they need   it be time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that put people to work   applause

 these reform will help people get job that be open today   but to prepare for the job of tomorrow our commitment to skill and education have to start early

 for less than 1 percent of what our nation spend on education each year we ’ve convince nearly every state in the country to raise their standard for teaching and learn the first time that ’s happen in a generation

 but challenge remain   and we know how to solve they

 at a time when other country be double down on education tight budget have force state to lay off thousand of teacher   we know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $ 250,000   a great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dream beyond his circumstance   every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who change the trajectory of their life   most teacher work tirelessly with modest pay sometimes dig into their own pocket for school supply just to make a difference

 teacher matter   so instead of bash they or defend the status quo let ’s offer school a deal   give they the resource to keep good teacher on the job and reward the good one   applause   and in return grant school flexibility   to teach with creativity and passion to stop teach to the test and to replace teacher who just be not help kid learn   that ’ a bargain worth make   applause

 we also know that when student do not walk away from their education more of they walk the stage to get their diploma   when student be not allow to drop out they do well   so tonight i be propose that every state every state require that all student stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18 applause

 when kid do graduate the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college   at a time when americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt this congress need to stop the interest rate on student loan from double in july   applause

 extend the tuition tax credit we start that save million of middle class family thousand of dollar and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by double the number of work study job in the next five year   applause

 of course it ’ not enough for we to increase student aid   we can not just keep subsidize skyrocket tuition we ’ll run out of money   states also need to do their part by make high education a high priority in their budget   and college and university have to do their part by work to keep cost down

 recently i speak with a group of college president who ’ve do just that   some school redesign course to help student finish more quickly   some use well technology   the point be it ’ possible   so let i put college and university on notice   if you can not stop tuition from go up the funding you get from taxpayer will go down   applause   high education can not be a luxury it be an economic imperative that every family in america should be able to afford

 let ’s also remember that hundred of thousand of talented hardworke student in this country face another challenge   the fact that they be n’t yet american citizen   many be bring here as small child be american through and through yet they live every day with the threat of deportation   other come more recently to study business and science and engineering but as soon as they get their degree we send they home to invent new product and create new job somewhere else

 that do not make sense

 i believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration   that ’ why my administration have put more boot on the border than ever before   that ’ why there be few illegal crossing than when i take office   the opponent of action be out of excuse   we should be work on comprehensive immigration reform right now   applause

 but if election year politic keep congress from act on a comprehensive plan let ’s at least agree to stop expel responsible young people who want to staff our lab start new business defend this country   send i a law that give they the chance to earn their citizenship   i will sign it right away   applause

 you see an economy build to last be one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country   that mean woman should earn equal pay for equal work   applause   it mean we should support everyone who ’ willing to work and every risk taker and entrepreneur who aspire to become the next steve jobs

 after all innovation be what america have always be about   most new job be create in start up and small business   so let ’s pass an agenda that help they succeed   tear down regulation that prevent aspire entrepreneur from get the financing to grow   applause   expand tax relief to small business that be raise wage and create good job   both party agree on these idea   so put they in a bill and get it on my desk this year   applause

 innovation also demand basic research   today the discovery take place in our federally finance lab and university could lead to new treatment that kill cancer cell but leave healthy one untouched   new lightweight vest for cop and soldier that can stop any bullet   do not gut these investment in our budget   do not let other country win the race for the future   support the same kind of research and innovation that lead to the computer chip and the internet to new american job and new american industry

 and nowhere be the promise of innovation great than in american make energy   over the last three year we ’ve open million of new acre for oil and gas exploration and tonight i ’m direct my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resource   applause   right now right now american oil production be the high that it ’s be in eight year   that ’ right eight year   not only that last year we rely less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 year   applause

 but with only 2 percent of the world ’s oil reserve oil be n’t enough   this country need an all out all of the above strategy that develop every available source of american energy   applause   a strategy that ’ clean cheap and full of new job

 we have a supply of natural gas that can last america nearly 100 year   applause   and my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy   expert believe this will support more than 600,000 job by the end of the decade   and i ’m require all company that drill for gas on public land to disclose the chemical they use   applause   because america will develop this resource without put the health and safety of our citizen at risk

 the development of natural gas will create job and power truck and factory that be clean and cheap prove that we do not have to choose between our environment and our economy   applause   and by the way it be public research dollar over the course of 30 year that help develop the technology to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock remind we that government support be critical in help business get new energy idea off the ground   applause

 now what ’ true for natural gas be just as true for clean energy   in three year our partnership with the private sector have already position america to be the world ’s lead manufacturer of high tech battery   because of federal investment renewable energy use have nearly double and thousand of americans have job because of it

 when bryan ritterby be lay off from his job make furniture he say he worry that at 55 no one would give he a second chance   but he find work at energetx a wind turbine manufacturer in michigan   before the recession the factory only make luxury yacht   today it ’s hire worker like bryan who say i ’m proud to be work in the industry of the future

 our experience with shale gas our experience with natural gas show we that the payoff on these public investment do not always come right away   some technology do not pan out some company fail   but i will not walk away from the promise of clean energy   i will not walk away from worker like bryan   applause   i will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to china or germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here

 we ’ve subsidize oil company for a century   that ’ long enough   applause   it ’ time to end the taxpayer giveaway to an industry that rarely have be more profitable and double down on a clean energy industry that never have be more promising   pass clean energy tax credit   create these job   applause

 we can also spur energy innovation with new incentive   the difference in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change   but there ’s no reason why congress should n’t at least set a clean energy standard that create a market for innovation   so far you have not act   well tonight i will   i ’m direct my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million home   and i ’m proud to announce that the department of defense work with we the world ’s large consumer of energy will make one of the large commitment to clean energy in history with the navy purchase enough capacity to power a quarter of a million home a year   applause

 of course the easy way to save money be to waste less energy   so here ’ a proposal   help manufacturer eliminate energy waste in their factory and give business incentive to upgrade their building   their energy bill will be $ 100 billion low over the next decade and america will have less pollution more manufacturing more job for construction worker who need they   send i a bill that create these job   applause

 build this new energy future should be just one part of a broad agenda to repair america ’s infrastructure   so much of america need to be rebuild   we ’ve get crumble road and bridge a power grid that waste too much energy an incomplete high speed broadband network that prevent a small business owner in rural america from sell her product all over the world

 during the great depression america build the hoover dam and the golden gate bridge   after world war ii we connect our state with a system of highway   democratic and republican administration invest in great project that benefit everybody from the worker who build they to the business that still use they today

 in the next few week i will sign an executive order clear away the red tape that slow down too many construction project   but you need to fund these project   take the money we ’re no long spend at war use half of it to pay down our debt and use the rest to do some nation building right here at home   applause

 there ’s never be a well time to build especially since the construction industry be one of the hard hit when the housing bubble burst   of course construction worker be n’t the only one who be hurt   so be million of innocent americans who ’ve see their home value decline   and while government can not fix the problem on its own responsible homeowner should not have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief

 and that ’ why i ’m send this congress a plan that give every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $ 3,000 a year on their mortgage by refinance at historically low rate   applause   no more red tape   no more runaround from the bank   a small fee on the large financial institution will ensure that it will not add to the deficit and will give those bank that be rescue by taxpayer a chance to repay a deficit of trust   applause

 let ’s never forget   millions of americans who work hard and play by the rule every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same   it ’ time to apply the same rule from top to bottom   no bailout no handout and no copout   an america build to last insist on responsibility from everybody

 we ’ve all pay the price for lender who sell mortgage to people who could not afford they and buyer who know they could not afford they   that ’ why we need smart regulation to prevent irresponsible behavior   applause   rule to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical device these do n’t destroy the free market   they make the free market work well

 there ’ no question that some regulation be outdate unnecessary or too costly   in fact i ’ve approve few regulation in the first three year of my presidency than my republican predecessor do in his   applause   i ’ve order every federal agency to eliminate rule that do not make sense   we ’ve already announce over 500 reform and just a fraction of they will save business and citizen more than $ 10 billion over the next five year we get rid of one rule from 40 year ago that could have force some dairy farmer to spend $ 10,000 a year prove that they could contain a spill because milk be somehow classify as an oil   with a rule like that i guess it be worth cry over spill milk laughter and applause

 now i ’m confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency look over his shoulder   applause   absolutely   but i will not back down from make sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we see in the gulf two year ago   applause   i will not back down from protect our kid from mercury poisoning or make sure that our food be safe and our water be clean   i will not go back to the day when health insurance company have unchecked power to cancel your policy deny your coverage or charge woman differently than man   applause

 and i will not go back to the day when wall street be allow to play by its own set of rule   the new rule we pass restore what should be any financial system ’s core purpose   get funding to entrepreneur with the good idea and get loan to responsible family who want to buy a home or start a business or send their kid to college

 so if you be a big bank or financial institution you ’re no long allow to make risky bet with your customer deposit   you ’re require to write out a living will that detail exactly how you ’ll pay the bill if you fail because the rest of we be not bail you out ever again   applause   and if you ’re a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company the day of sign people up for product they can not afford with confusing form and deceptive practice those day be over   today american consumer finally have a watchdog in richard cordray with one job   to look out for they   applause

 we ’ll also establish a financial crimes unit of highly train investigator to crack down on large scale fraud and protect people ’s investment   some financial firm violate major anti fraud law because there ’s no real penalty for be a repeat offender   that ’ bad for consumer and it ’ bad for the vast majority of banker and financial service professional who do the right thing   so pass legislation that make the penalty for fraud count

 and tonight i ’m ask my attorney general to create a special unit of federal prosecutor and lead state attorney general to expand our investigation into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgage that lead to the housing crisis   applause   this new unit will hold accountable those who break the law speed assistance to homeowner and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many americans

 now a return to the american value of fair play and share responsibility will help protect our people and our economy   but it should also guide we as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future

 right now our most immediate priority be stop a tax hike on 160 million work americans while the recovery be still fragile   applause   people can not afford lose $ 40 out of each paycheck this year   there be plenty of way to get this do   so let ’s agree right here right now   no side issue   no drama   pass the payroll tax cut without delay   let ’s get it do   applause

 when it come to the deficit we ’ve already agree to more than $ 2 trillion in cut and saving   but we need to do more and that mean make choice   right now we ’re poise to spend nearly $ 1 trillion more on what be suppose to be a temporary tax break for the wealthy 2 percent of americans   right now because of loophole and shelter in the tax code a quarter of all millionaire pay low tax rate than million of middle class household   right now warren buffett pay a low tax rate than his secretary

 do we want to keep these tax cut for the wealthy americans   or do we want to keep our investment in everything else like education and medical research a strong military and care for our veteran   because if we ’re serious about pay down our debt we can not do both

 the american people know what the right choice be   so do i.   as i tell the speaker this summer i ’m prepared to make more reform that rein in the long term cost of medicare and medicaid and strengthen social security so long as those program remain a guarantee of security for senior

 but in return we need to change our tax code so that people like i and an awful lot of member of congress pay our fair share of taxis   applause

 tax reform should follow the buffett rule   if you make more than $ 1 million a year you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxis   and my republican friend tom coburn be right   washington should stop subsidize millionaire   in fact if you ’re earn a million dollar a year you should not get special tax subsidy or deduction   on the other hand if you make under $ 250,000 a year like 98 percent of american family your taxis should not go up   applause   you ’re the one struggle with rise cost and stagnant wage   you ’re the one who need relief

 now you can call this class warfare all you want   but ask a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxis   most americans would call that common sense

 we do n’t begrudge financial success in this country   we admire it   when americans talk about folk like i pay my fair share of taxis it ’s not because they envy the rich   it ’s because they understand that when i get a tax break i do n’t need and the country can n’t afford it either add to the deficit or somebody else have to make up the difference like a senior on a fix income or a student try to get through school or a family try to make end meet   that ’s not right   americans know that ’s not right   they know that this generation ’s success be only possible because past generation feel a responsibility to each other and to the future of their country and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of share responsibility   that ’ how we ’ll reduce our deficit   that ’ an america build to last   applause

 now i recognize that people watch tonight have differ view about taxis and debt energy and health care   but no matter what party they belong to i bet most americans be think the same thing right about now   nothing will get do in washington this year or next year or maybe even the year after that because washington be break

 can you blame they for feel a little cynical

 the great blow to our confidence in our economy last year do not come from event beyond our control   it come from a debate in washington over whether the united states would pay its bill or not   who benefit from that fiasco

 i ’ve talk tonight about the deficit of trust between main street and wall street   but the divide between this city and the rest of the country be at least as bad and it seem to get bad every year

 some of this have to do with the corrosive influence of money in politic   so together let ’s take some step to fix that   send i a bill that ban insider trading by member of congress i will sign it tomorrow   applause   let ’s limit any elect official from own stock in industry they impact   let ’s make sure people who bundle campaign contribution for congress can not lobby congress and vice versa an idea that have bipartisan support at least outside of washington

 some of what ’s break have to do with the way congress do its business these day   a simple majority be no long enough to get anything even routine business pass through the senate   applause   neither party have be blameless in these tactic   now both party should put an end to it   applause   for starter i ask the senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nomination receive a simple up or down vote within 90 day applause

 the executive branch also need to change   too often it ’ inefficient outdated and remote   applause   that ’ why i ’ve ask this congress to grant i the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that our government be lean quick and more responsive to the need of the american people   applause

 finally none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town   we need to end the notion that the two party must be lock in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction that politics be about cling to rigid ideology instead of build consensus around common sense idea

 i ’m a democrat   but i believe what republican abraham lincoln believe   that government should do for people only what they can not do well by themselves and no more   applause   that ’ why my education reform offer more competition and more control for school and state   that ’ why we ’re getting rid of regulation that do n’t work   that ’ why our health care law rely on a reform private market not a government program

 on the other hand even my republican friend who complain the most about government spending have support federally finance road and clean energy project and federal office for the folk back home

 the point be we should all want a smart more effective government   and while we may not be able to bridge our big philosophical difference this year we can make real progress   with or without this congress i will keep take action that help the economy grow   but i can do a whole lot more with your help   because when we act together there ’ nothing the united states of america can not achieve   applause   that ’ the lesson we ’ve learn from our action abroad over the last few year

 end the iraq war have allow we to strike decisive blow against our enemy   from pakistan to yemen the al qaeda operative who remain be scramble know that they can not escape the reach of the united states of america   applause

 from this position of strength we ’ve begin to wind down the war in afghanistan   ten thousand of our troop have come home   twenty three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer   this transition to afghan lead will continue and we will build an endure partnership with afghanistan so that it be never again a source of attack against america   applause

 as the tide of war recede a wave of change have wash across the middle east and north africa from tunis to cairo from sana’a to tripoli   a year ago qaddafi be one of the world ’s long serve dictator a murderer with american blood on his hand   today he be go   and in syria i have no doubt that the assad regime will soon discover that the force of change can not be reverse and that human dignity can not be deny   applause

 how this incredible transformation will end remain uncertain   but we have a huge stake in the outcome   and while it ’s ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate we will advocate for those value that have serve our own country so well   we will stand against violence and intimidation   we will stand for the right and dignity of all human being man and woman christians muslims and jews   we will support policy that lead to strong and stable democracy and open market because tyranny be no match for liberty

 and we will safeguard america ’s own security against those who threaten our citizen our friend and our interest   look at iran   through the power of our diplomacy a world that be once divide about how to deal with iran ’s nuclear program now stand as one   the regime be more isolated than ever before its leader be face with crippling sanction and as long as they shirk their responsibility this pressure will not relent

 let there be no doubt   america be determined to prevent iran from get a nuclear weapon and i will take no option off the table to achieve that goal   applause

 but a peaceful resolution of this issue be still possible and far well and if iran change course and meet its obligation it can rejoin the community of nation

 the renewal of american leadership can be feel across the globe   our old alliance in europe and asia be strong than ever   our tie to the americas be deep   our ironclad commitment and i mean ironclad to israel ’s security have mean the close military cooperation between our two country in history   applause

 we ’ve make it clear that america be a pacific power and a new beginning in burma have light a new hope   from the coalition we ’ve build to secure nuclear material to the mission we ’ve lead against hunger and disease from the blow we ’ve deal to our enemy to the endure power of our moral example america be back

 anyone who tell you otherwise anyone who tell you that america be in decline or that our influence have wane do not know what they ’re talk about   applause

 that ’s not the message we get from leader around the world who be eager to work with we   that ’ not how people feel from tokyo to berlin from cape town to rio where opinion of america be high than they ’ve be in year   yes the world be change   no we can not control every event   but america remain the one indispensable nation in world affair and as long as i ’m president i intend to keep it that way   applause

 that ’ why work with our military leader i ’ve propose a new defense strategy that ensure we maintain the fine military in the world while save nearly half a trillion dollar in our budget   to stay one step ahead of our adversary i ’ve already send this congress legislation that will secure our country from the grow danger of cyber threat   applause

 above all our freedom endure because of the man and woman in uniform who defend it   applause   as they come home we must serve they as well as they ’ve serve we   that include give they the care and the benefit they have earn which be why we ’ve increase annual va spending every year i ’ve be president   applause   and it mean enlist our veteran in the work of rebuild our nation

 with the bipartisan support of this congress we ’re provide new tax credit to company that hire vet   michelle and jill biden have work with american business to secure a pledge of 135,000 job for veteran and their family   and tonight i ’m propose a veterans jobs corps that will help our community hire veteran as cop and firefighter so that america be as strong as those who defend she   applause

 which bring i back to where i begin   those of we who ’ve been send here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troop   when you put on that uniform it do not matter if you ’re black or white asian latino native american conservative liberal rich poor gay straight   when you ’re march into battle you look out for the person next to you or the mission fail   when you ’re in the thick of the fight you rise or fall as one unit serve one nation leave no one behind

 one of my proud possession be the flag that the seal team take with they on the mission to get bin laden   on it be each of their name   some may be democrats   some may be republicans   but that do not matter   just like it do not matter that day in the situation room when i sit next to bob gates a man who be george bush ’s defense secretary and hillary clinton a woman who run against i for president

 all that matter that day be the mission   no one think about politic   no one think about themselves   one of the young man involve in the raid later tell i that he do not deserve credit for the mission   it only succeed he say because every single member of that unit do their job the pilot who land the helicopter that spin out of control the translator who keep other from enter the compound the troop who separate the woman and child from the fight the seal who charge up the stair   more than that the mission only succeed because every member of that unit trust each other because you can not charge up those stair into darkness and danger unless you know that there ’s somebody behind you watch your back

 so it be with america   each time i look at that flag i ’m remind that our destiny be stitch together like those 50 star and those 13 stripe   no one build this country on their own   this nation be great because we build it together   this nation be great because we work as a team   this nation be great because we get each other ’s back   and if we hold fast to that truth in this moment of trial there be no challenge too great no mission too hard   as long as we be join in common purpose as long as we maintain our common resolve our journey move forward and our future be hopeful and the state of our union will always be strong

 thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america   applause

 and joe biden thank you for be the very good vice president i could have ever hope for and be a strong and loyal friend   applause

 madam chairwoman delegate i accept your nomination for president of the united states   applause

 now the first time i address this convention in 2004 i be a young man a senate candidate from illinois who speak about hope not blind optimism not wishful thinking but hope in the face of difficulty hope in the face of uncertainty that dog faith in the future which have push this nation forward even when the odd be great even when the road be long

 eight year later that hope have be test by the cost of war by one of the bad economic crisis in history and by political gridlock that ’s leave we wonder whether it ’s still even possible to tackle the challenge of our time

 i know campaign can seem small even silly sometimes   trivial thing become big distraction   serious issue become sound bite   the truth get bury under an avalanche of money and advertising   if you ’re sick of hear i approve this message believe i so be i.   laughter and applause

 but when all be say and do when you pick up that ballot to vote you will face the clear choice of any time in a generation   over the next few year big decision will be make in washington on job the economy taxis and deficit energy education war and peace decision that will have a huge impact on our life and on our child ’s life for decade to come

 and on every issue the choice you face will not just be between two candidate or two party   it will be a choice between two different path for america a choice between two fundamentally different vision for the future

 ours be a fight to restore the value that build the large middle class and the strong economy the world have ever know   applause the value my grandfather defend as a soldier in patton ’s army the value that drive my grandmother to work on a bomber assembly line while he be go

 they know they be part of something large a nation that triumph over fascism and depression a nation where the most innovative business turn out the world ’s good product and everyone share in that pride and success from the corner office to the factory floor

 my grandparent be give the chance to go to college buy their own home and fulfill the basic bargain at the heart of america ’s story the promise that hard work will pay off that responsibility will be reward that everyone get a fair shot and everyone do their fair share and everyone play by the same rule from main street to wall street to washington d.c.   applause

 and i run for president because i see that basic bargain slip away   i begin my career help people in the shadow of a shutter steel mill at a time when too many good job be start to move overseas   and by 2008 we have see nearly a decade in which family struggle with cost that keep rise but paycheck that didn’the folk rack up more and more debt just to make the mortgage or pay tuition put gas in the car or food on the table   and when the house of card collapse in the great recession million of innocent americans lose their job their home their life saving a tragedy from which we ’re still fight to recover

 now our friend down in tampa at the republican convention be more than happy to talk about everything they think be wrong with america   but they do not have much to say about how they ’d make it right   applause   they want your vote but they do not want you to know their plan   and that ’ because all they have to offer be the same prescription they ’ve have for the last 30 year have a surplus   try a tax cut   deficit too high   try another   feel a cold come on   take two tax cut roll back some regulation and call we in the morning   applause

 now i ’ve cut taxis for those who need it middle class family small business   but i do not believe that another round of tax break for millionaire will bring good job to our shore or pay down our deficit   i do not believe that fire teacher or kick student off financial aid will grow the economy or help we compete with the scientist and engineer come out of china   applause

 after all we ’ve be through i do not believe that roll back regulation on wall street will help the small businesswoman expand or the lay off construction worker keep his home

 we have be there   we ’ve try that and we ’re not go back   we be move forward america   applause

 now i will not pretend the path i ’m offer be quick or easy i never have   you do not elect i to tell you what you want to hear   you elect i to tell you the truth   applause

 and the truth be it will take more than a few year for we to solve challenge that have build up over decade   it will require common effort and share responsibility and the kind of bold persistent experimentation that franklin roosevelt pursue during the only crisis bad than this one   applause   and by the way those of we who carry on his party ’s legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedie with another government program or dictate from washington

 but know this america our problem can be solve   applause   our challenge can be meet   the path we offer may be hard but it lead to a well place   and i ’m ask you to choose that future   applause

 i ’m ask you to rally around a set of goal for your country goal in manufacturing energy education national security and the deficit real achievable plan that will lead to new job more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a strong foundation    that ’ what we can do in the next four year and that be why i ’m run for a second term as president of the united states   applause

 the president   and after a decade of decline this country create over half a million manufacturing job in the last two and a half year

 you can choose the path where we control more of our own energy   after 30 year of inaction we raise fuel standard so that by the middle of the next decade car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of gas   applause   we have double our use of renewable energy and thousand of americans have job today build wind turbine and long last battery   in the last year alone we cut oil import by 1 million barrel a day more than any administration in recent history   and today the united states of america be less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decade   applause

 so now you have a choice between a strategy that reverse this progress or one that build on it   we ’ve open million of new acre for oil and gas exploration in the last three year and we ’ll open more   but unlike my opponent i will not let oil company write this country ’s energy plan or endanger our coastline or collect another $ 4 billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayer   we ’re offer a well path   applause
 we ’re offer a well path where we a future where we keep invest in wind and solar and clean coal where farmer and scientist harness new biofuel to power our car and truck where construction worker build home and factory that waste less energy where we develop a hundred year supply of natural gas that ’ right beneath our foot   if you choose this path we can cut our oil import in half by 2020 and support more than 600,000 new job in natural gas alone   applause

 and yes my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that be heat our planet because climate change be not a hoax   more drought and flood and wildfire be not a joke   they be a threat to our child ’s future   and in this election you can do something about it   applause

 you can choose a future where more americans have the chance to gain the skill they need to compete no matter how old they be or how much money they have   education be the gateway to opportunity for i   it be the gateway for michelle   it be the gateway for most of you   and now more than ever it be the gateway to a middle class life

 for the first time in a generation nearly every state have answer our call to raise their standard for teaching and learning   some of the bad school in the country have make real gain in math and reading   million of student be pay less for college today because we finally take on a system that waste billion of taxpayer dollar on bank and lender   applause

 and now you have a choice we can gut education or we can decide that in the united states of america no child should have her dream defer because of a crowded classroom or a crumble school   applause   no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they do not have the money   no company should have to look for worker overseas because they could not find any with the right skill here at home   that ’s not our future   that be not our future   applause

 and government have a role in this   but teacher must inspire principal must lead parent must instill a thirst for learn   and student you ’ve get to do the work   applause and together i promise you we can out educate and out compete any nation on earth   applause

 so help i   help i recruit 100,000 math and science teacher within 10 year and improve early childhood education   help give 2 million worker the chance to learn skill at their community college that will lead directly to a job   applause help we work with college and university to cut in half the growth of tuition cost over the next 10 year   we can meet that goal together   you can choose that future for america   applause   that ’ our future

 in a world of new threat and new challenge you can choose leadership that have be test and prove   four year ago i promise to end the war in iraq   we do   applause   i promise to refocus on the terrorist who actually attack we on 9/11   and we have   applause   we ’ve blunt the taliban ’s momentum in afghanistan and in 2014 our long war will be over   applause

 a new tower rise above the new york skyline al qaeda be on the path to defeat and osama bin laden be dead   applause

 audience   u.s.a.   u.s.a.   u.s.a.

 the president   tonight we pay tribute to the americans who still serve in harm ’s way   we be forever in debt to a generation whose sacrifice have make this country safe and more respected   we will never forget you   and so long as i ’m commander in chief we will sustain the strong military the world have ever know   applause   when you take off the uniform we will serve you as well as you ’ve serve we because no one who fight for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head or the care that they need when they come home   applause

 around the world we ’ve strengthen old alliance and forge new coalition to stop the spread of nuclear weapon   we ’ve reassert our power across the pacific and stand up to china on behalf of our worker   from burma to libya to south sudan we have advance the right and dignity of all human being man and woman christians and muslims and jews   applause

 but for all the progress that we ’ve make challenge remain terrorist plot must be disrupt   europe ’s crisis must be contain   our commitment to israel ’s security must not waver and neither must our pursuit of peace   applause   the iranian government must face a world that stay united against its nuclear ambition   the historic change sweep across the arab world must be define not by the iron fist of a dictator or the hate of extremist but by the hope and aspiration of ordinary people who be reach for the same right that we celebrate here today   applause

 so now we have a choice   my opponent and his running mate be new to foreign policy laughter and applause but from all that we ’ve see and hear they want to take we back to an era of bluster and blunder that cost america so dearly
 after all you do not call russia our number one enemy not al qaeda russia unless you ’re still stick in a cold war mind warp   applause   you might not be ready for diplomacy with beijing if you can not visit the olympics without insult our close ally   applause

 my opponent say that it be tragic to end the war in iraq   and he will not tell we how he ’ll end the war in afghanistan well i have and i will   applause

 and while my opponent would spend more money on military hardware that our joint chiefs do not even want i will use the money we ’re no long spend on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work rebuild road and bridge and school and runway   because after two war that have cost we thousand of live and over a trillion dollar it ’ time to do some nation building right here at home   applause

 you can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without stick it to the middle class   independent expert say that my plan would cut our deficit by $ 4 trillion   and last summer i work with republicans in congress to cut a billion trillion dollar in spending because those of we who believe government can be a force for good should work hard than anyone to reform it so that it ’ lean and more efficient and more responsive to the american people   applause

 i want to reform the tax code so that it ’ simple fair and ask the wealthy household to pay high taxis on income over $ 250,000 the same rate we have when bill clinton be president the same rate when our economy create nearly 23 million new job the big surplus in history and a whole lot of millionaire to boot   applause

 now i ’m still eager to reach an agreement base on the principle of my bipartisan debt commission   no party have a monopoly on wisdom   no democracy work without compromise   i want to get this do and we can get it do   but when governor romney and his friend in congress tell we we can somehow lower our deficit by spend trillion more on new tax break for the wealthy well what do bill clinton call it you do the arithmetic   applause   you do the math   applause

 i refuse to go along with that and as long as i ’m president i never will   applause   i refuse to ask middle class family to give up their deduction for own a home or raise their kid just to pay for another millionaire ’s tax cut   applause
 i refuse to ask student to pay more for college or kick child out of head start program or eliminate health insurance for million of americans who be poor and elderly or disabled all so those with the most can pay less   i ’m not go along with that   applause

 and i will never i will never turn medicare into a voucher   applause   no american should ever have to spend their golden year at the mercy of insurance company   they should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earn   yes we will reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul but we ’ll do it by reduce the cost of health care not by ask senior to pay thousand of dollar more   applause

 and we will keep the promise of social security by take the responsible step to strengthen it not by turn it over to wall street   applause

 this be the choice we now face   this be what the election come down to   over and over we ’ve be tell by our opponent that big tax cut and few regulation be the only way that since government can not do everything it should do almost nothing   if you can not afford health insurance hope that you do not get sick   if a company release toxic pollution into the air your child breathe well that ’s the price of progress   if you can not afford to start a business or go to college take my opponent ’s advice and borrow money from your parent   laughter and applause

 you know what that ’s not who we be   that ’s not what this country ’s about   as americans we believe we be endow by our creator with certain inalienable right right that no man or government can take away   we insist on personal responsibility and we celebrate individual initiative   we ’re not entitle to success we have to earn it   we honor the striver the dreamer the risk taker the entrepreneur who have always be the drive force behind our free enterprise system the great engine of growth and prosperity that the world ’s ever know

 but we also believe in something call citizenship   applause   citizenship   a word at the very heart of our founding a word at the very essence of our democracy the idea that this country only work when we accept certain obligation to one another and to future generation

 we believe that when a ceo pay his autoworker enough to buy the car that they build the whole company do well   applause   we believe that when a family can no long be trick into sign a mortgage they can n’t afford that family be protect but so be the value of other people ’s home and so be the entire economy   applause   we believe the little girl who ’s offer an escape from poverty by a great teacher or a grant for college could become the next steve jobs or the scientist who cure cancer or the president of the united states and it be in our power to give she that chance   applause

 we know that church and charity can often make more of a difference than a poverty program alone   we do not want handout for people who refuse to help themselves and we certainly do not want bailout for bank that break the rule   applause   we do not think that government can solve all of our problem but we do not think that government be the source of all of our problem any more than be welfare recipient or corporation or union or immigrant or gay or any other group we ’re tell to blame for our trouble   applause

 because america we understand that this democracy be ours we the people recognize that we have responsibility as well as right that our destiny be bind together that a freedom which ask only what ’ in it for i a freedom without commitment to other a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism be unworthy of our found ideal and those who die in their defense   applause

 as citizen we understand that america be not about what can be do for we it ’ about what can be do by we together through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self government   that ’ what we believe   applause

 so you see the election four year ago be n’t about i   it be about you   applause   my fellow citizen you be the change   applause   you ’re the reason there ’ a little girl with a heart disorder in phoenix who will get the surgery she need because an insurance company can not limit her coverage   you do that   applause

 you ’re the reason a young man in colorado who never think he ’d be able to afford his dream of earn a medical degree be about to get that chance   you make that possible   applause

 you ’re the reason a young immigrant who grow up here and go to school here and pledge allegiance to our flag will no long be deport from the only country she ’s ever call home
 applause why selfless soldier will not be kick out of the military because of who they be or who they love why thousand of family have finally be able to say to the love one who serve we so bravely welcome home   welcome home   you do that   you do that   you do that   applause

 if you turn away now if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fight for be n’t possible well change will not happen   if you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference then other voice will fill the void the lobbyist and special interest the people with the $ 10 million check who be try to buy this election and those who be make it hard for you to vote washington politician who want to decide who you can marry or control health care choice that woman should be make for themselves   applause

 only you can make sure that do not happen   only you have the power to move we forward   applause

 i recognize that time have change since i first speak to this convention   the time have change and so have i.   i ’m no long just a candidate   i ’m the president   applause

 and that mean i know what it mean to send young americans into battle for i have hold in my arm the mother and father of those who do n’t return   i ’ve share the pain of family who ’ve lose their home and the frustration of worker who ’ve lose their job

 if the critic be right that i ’ve make all my decision base on poll then i must not be very good at read they   laughter   and while i ’m very proud of what we ’ve achieve together i ’m far more mindful of my own failing know exactly what lincoln mean when he say i have be drive to my knee many time by the overwhelming conviction that i have no place else to go   applause

 but as i stand here tonight i have never be more hopeful about america   not because i think i have all the answer   not because i ’m naïve about the magnitude of our challenge   i ’m hopeful because of you

 i think about the young sailor i meet at walter reed hospital still recover from a grenade attack that would cause he to have his leg amputate above the knee   six month ago we would watch he walk into a white house dinner honor those who serve in iraq tall and 20 pound heavy dash in his uniform with a big grin on his face sturdy on his new leg   and i remember how a few month after that i would watch he on a bicycle race with his fellow wound warrior on a sparkling spring day inspire other hero who have just begin the hard path he have travel he give i hope   he give i hope   applause

 i do not know what party these man and woman belong to   i do not know if they ’ll vote for i   but i know that their spirit define we   they remind i in the word of scripture that ours be a future fill with hope

 and if you share that faith with i if you share that hope with i i ask you tonight for your vote   applause   if you reject the notion that this nation ’s promise be reserve for the few your voice must be hear in this election   if you reject the notion that our government be forever beholden to the high bidder you need to stand up in this election   applause

 if you believe that new plant and factory can dot our landscape that new energy can power our future that new school can provide ladder of opportunity to this nation of dreamer if you believe in a country where everyone get a fair shot and everyone do their fair share and everyone play by the same rule then i need you to vote this november   applause

 america i never say this journey would be easy and i will not promise that now   yes our path be hard but it lead to a well place   yes our road be long but we travel it together   we do not turn back   we leave no one behind   we pull each other up   we draw strength from our victory and we learn from our mistake but we keep our eye fix on that distant horizon know that providence be with we and that we be surely bless to be citizen of the great nation on earth

 tonight in this election you the american people   remind we that while our road have be hard while our journey have be long we have pick ourselves up we have fight our way back and we know in our heart that for the united states of america the good be yet to come   applause

 i want to thank every american who participate in this election   applause   whether you vote for the very first time or wait in line for a very long time applause by the way we have to fix that   applause   whether you pound the pavement or pick up the phone applause whether you hold an obama sign or a romney sign you make your voice hear and you make a difference   applause

 i just speak with governor romney and i congratulate he and paul ryan on a hard fought campaign   applause   we may have battle fiercely but it ’ only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future   from george to lenore to their son mitt the romney family have choose to give back to america through public service and that be a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight   applause

 i know that political campaign can sometimes seem small even silly   and that provide plenty of fodder for the cynic who tell we that politics be nothing more than a contest of ego or the domain of special interest   but if you ever get the chance to talk to folk who turn out at our rally and crowd along a rope line in a high school gym or see folk work late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home you will discover something else

 you ’ll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who ’s work his way through college and want to make sure every child have that same opportunity   applause   you ’ll hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who ’s go door to door because her brother be finally hire when the local auto plant add another shift   applause   you ’ll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who ’s work the phone late at night to make sure that no one who fight for this country ever have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when they come home   applause

 that ’ why we do this   that ’ what politic can be   that ’ why election matter   it be not small it be big   it be important

 democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated   we have our own opinion   each of we have deeply hold belief   and when we go through tough time when we make big decision as a country it necessarily stir passion stir up controversy   that will not change after tonight and it should n’t   these argument we have be a mark of our liberty and we can never forget that as we speak people in distant nation be risk their life right now just for a chance to argue about the issue that matter the chance to cast their ballot like we do today   applause

 but despite all our difference most of we share certain hope for america ’s future   we want our kid to grow up in a country where they have access to the good school and the good teacher applause a country that live up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good job and new business that follow

 we want our child to live in an america that be not burden by debt that be not weaken by inequality that be not threaten by the destructive power of a warm planet   applause

 we want to pass on a country that ’ safe and respected and admire around the world a nation that be defend by the strong military on earth and the good troop this world have ever know applause but also a country that move with confidence beyond this time of war to shape a peace that be build on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being

 we believe in a generous america in a compassionate america in a tolerant america open to the dream of an immigrant ’s daughter who study in our school and pledge to our flag   applause   to the young boy on the south side of chicago who see a life beyond the near street corner   applause   to the furniture worker ’s child in north carolina who want to become a doctor or a scientist an engineer or entrepreneur a diplomat or even a president   that ’ the future we hope for   that ’ the vision we share   that ’s where we need to go   forward   applause   that be where we need to go

 now we will disagree sometimes fiercely about how to get there   as it have for more than two century progress will come in fit and start   it be not always a straight line   it be not always a smooth path   by itself the recognition that we have common hope and dream will not end all the gridlock or solve all our problem or substitute for the painstaking work of build consensus and make the difficult compromise need to move this country forward   but that common bond be where we must begin

 our economy be recover   a decade of war be end   a long campaign be now over   applause   and whether i earn your vote or not i have listen to you   i have learn from you   and you have make i a well president   with your story and your struggle i return to the white house more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there be to do and the future that lie ahead   applause

 tonight you vote for action not politic as usual   applause   you elect we to focus on your job not ours   and in the come week and month i be look forward to reach out and work with leader of both party to meet the challenge we can only solve together   reduce our deficit   reform our tax code fix our immigration system free ourselves from foreign oil   we have get more work to do   applause

 but that do not mean your work be do   the role of citizen in our democracy do not end with your vote   america have never be about what can be do for we   it ’ about what can be do by we together through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self government   applause   that be the principle we be found on

 this country have more wealth than any nation but that ’s not what make we rich   we have the most powerful military in history but that ’s not what make we strong   our university   culture be the envy of the world but that ’s not what keep the world come to our shore

 what make america exceptional be the bond that hold together the most diverse nation on earth the belief that our destiny be share that this country only work when we accept certain obligation to one another and to future generation that the freedom which so many americans have fight for and die for come with responsibility as well as right and among those be love and charity and duty and patriotism   that be what make america great   applause

 i be hopeful tonight because i have see this spirit at work in america   i ’ve see it in the family business whose owner would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbor and in the worker who would rather cut back their hour than see a friend lose a job

 i ’ve see it in the soldier who re enlist after lose a limb and in those seal who charge up the stair into darkness and danger because they know there be a buddy behind they watch their back   applause

 i ’ve see it on the shore of new jersey and new york where leader from every party and level of government have sweep aside their difference to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm   applause

 and i see it just the other day in mentor ohio where a father tell the story of his eight year old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything have it not be for health care reform pass just a few month before the insurance company be about to stop pay for her care   applause   i have an opportunity to not just talk to the father but meet this incredible daughter of his   and when he speak to the crowd listen to that father ’s story every parent in that room have tear in their eye because we know that little girl could be our own   and i know that every american want her future to be just as bright

 that ’s who we be   that ’ the country i be so proud to lead as your president   applause   and tonight despite all the hardship we ’ve be through despite all the frustration of washington i have never be more hopeful about our future   applause   i have never be more hopeful about america   and i ask you to sustain that hope

 i ’m not talk about blind optimism the kind of hope that just ignore the enormity of the task ahead or the roadblock that stand in our path   i ’m not talk about the wishful idealism that allow we to just sit on the sideline or shirk from a fight   i have always believe that hope be that stubborn thing inside we that insist despite all the evidence to the contrary that something well await we so long as we have the courage to keep reach to keep work to keep fight   applause

 america i believe we can build on the progress we ’ve make and continue to fight for new job and new opportunity and new security for the middle class   i believe we can keep the promise of our founding the idea that if you ’re willing to work hard it do not matter who you be or where you come from or what you look like or where you love it do not matter whether you be black or white or hispanic or asian or native american or young or old or rich or poor able disabled gay or straight you can make it here in america if you ’re willing to try   applause

 i believe we can seize this future together because we be not as divide as our politic suggest we be not as cynical as the pundit believe we be great than the sum of our individual ambition and we remain more than a collection of red state and blue state   we be and forever will be the united states of america   applause   and together with your help and god ’s grace we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it be that we live in the great nation on earth   applause

 thank you america   god bless you   god bless these united states   applause

thank you   applause   thank you governor   to all the family first responder to the community of newtown clergy guest scripture tell we   do not lose heart   though outwardly we be waste away inwardly we be be renew day by day   for our light and momentary trouble be achieve for we an eternal glory that far outweigh they all   so we fix our eye not on what be see but on what be unseen since what be see be temporary but what be unseen be eternal   for we know that if the earthly tent we live in be destroy we have a building from god an eternal house in heaven not build by human hand

 we gather here in memory of twenty beautiful child and six remarkable adult   they lose their life in a school that could have be any school in a quiet town full of good and decent people that could be any town in america

 here in newtown i come to offer the love and prayer of a nation   i be very mindful that mere word can not match the depth of your sorrow nor can they heal your wound heart   i can only hope it help for you to know that you ’re not alone in your grief that our world too have be tear apart that all across this land of ours we have weep with you we ’ve pull our child tight   and you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide we will provide whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load we will gladly bear it   newtown you be not alone

 as these difficult day have unfold you ’ve also inspire we with story of strength and resolve and sacrifice   we know that when danger arrive in the hall of sandy hook elementary the school ’s staff do not flinch they do not hesitate   dawn hochsprung and mary sherlach vicki soto lauren rousseau rachel davino and anne marie murphy they respond as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstance with courage and with love give their life to protect the child in their care

 we know that there be other teacher who barricade themselves inside classroom and keep steady through it all and reassure their student by say wait for the good guy they ’re come show i your smile

 and we know that good guy come   the first responder who race to the scene help to guide those in harm ’s way to safety and comfort those in need hold at bay their own shock and trauma because they have a job to do and other need they more

 and then there be the scene of the schoolchildren help one another hold each other dutifully follow instruction in the way that young child sometimes do one child even try to encourage a grown up by say i know karate   so it ’ okay   i ’ll lead the way out   laughter

 as a community you ’ve inspire we newtown   in the face of indescribable violence in the face of unconscionable evil you ’ve look out for each other and you ’ve care for one another and you ’ve love one another   this be how newtown will be remember   and with time and god ’s grace that love will see you through

 but we as a nation we be leave with some hard question   someone once describe the joy and anxiety of parenthood as the equivalent of have your heart outside of your body all the time walk around   with their very first cry this most precious vital part of ourselves our child be suddenly expose to the world to possible mishap or malice   and every parent know there be nothing we will not do to shield our child from harm   and yet we also know that with that child ’s very first step and each step after that they be separate from we that we will n’t that we can not always be there for they   they ’ll suffer sickness and setback and broken heart and disappointment   and we learn that our most important job be to give they what they need to become self reliant and capable and resilient ready to face the world without fear

 and we know we can not do this by ourselves   it come as a shock at a certain point where you realize no matter how much you love these kid you can not do it by yourself   that this job of keep our child safe and teach they well be something we can only do together with the help of friend and neighbor the help of a community and the help of a nation   and in that way we come to realize that we bear a responsibility for every child because we ’re count on everybody else to help look after our that we ’re all parent that they ’re all our child

 this be our first task care for our child   it ’ our first job   if we do not get that right we do not get anything right   that ’ how as a society we will be judge

 and by that measure can we truly say as a nation that we be meet our obligation   can we honestly say that we ’re do enough to keep our child all of they safe from harm   can we claim as a nation that we ’re all together there let they know that they be love and teach they to love in return   can we say that we ’re truly do enough to give all the child of this country the chance they deserve to live out their life in happiness and with purpose

 i ’ve be reflect on this the last few day and if we ’re honest with ourselves the answer be no   we ’re not do enough   and we will have to change

 since i ’ve be president this be the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieve community tear apart by a mass shooting   the fourth time we ’ve hug survivor   the fourth time we ’ve console the family of victim   and in between there have be an endless series of deadly shooting across the country almost daily report of victim many of they child in small town and big city all across america victim whose much of the time their only fault be be in the wrong place at the wrong time

 we can not tolerate this anymore   these tragedy must end   and to end they we must change   we will be tell that the cause of such violence be complex and that be true   no single law no set of law can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society

 but that can not be an excuse for inaction   surely we can do well than this   if there be even one step we can take to save another child or another parent or another town from the grief that have visit tucson and aurora and oak creek and newtown and community from columbine to blacksburg before that then surely we have an obligation to try

 all the world ’s religion so many of they represent here today start with a simple question   why be we here   what give our life mean   what give our act purpose   we know our time on this earth be fleeting   we know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain that even after we chase after some earthly goal whether it ’ wealth or power or fame or just simple comfort we will in some fashion fall short of what we have hope   we know that no matter how good our intention we will all stumble sometimes in some way   we will make mistake we will experience hardship   and even when we ’re try to do the right thing we know that much of our time will be spend grope through the darkness so often unable to discern god ’s heavenly plan

 there ’ only one thing we can be sure of and that be the love that we have for our child for our family for each other   the warmth of a small child ’s embrace that be true   the memory we have of they the joy that they bring the wonder we see through their eye that fierce and boundless love we feel for they a love that take we out of ourselves and bind we to something large we know that ’ what matter   we know we ’re always do right when we ’re take care of they when we ’re teach they well when we ’re show act of kindness   we do n’t go wrong when we do that

 that ’ what we can be sure of   and that ’ what you the people of newtown have remind we   that ’ how you ’ve inspire we   you remind we what matter   and that ’ what should drive we forward in everything we do for as long as god see fit to keep we on this earth

 vice president biden mr. chief justice
 member of the united states congress distinguished guest and fellow citizen

 each time we gather to inaugurate a president we bear witness to the endure strength of our constitution   we affirm the promise of our democracy   we recall that what bind this nation together be not the color of our skin or the tenet of our faith or the origin of our name   what make we exceptional what make we american be our allegiance to an idea articulate in a declaration make more than two century ago
 we hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal that they be endow by their creator with certain unalienable right that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

 today we continue a never end journey to bridge the meaning of those word with the reality of our time   for history tell we that while these truth may be self evident they ’ve never be self executing that while freedom be a gift from god it must be secure by his people here on earth   applause   the patriot of 1776 do not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privilege of a few or the rule of a mob   they give to we a republic a government of and by and for the people entrust each generation to keep safe our found creed

 and for more than two hundred year we have

 through blood draw by lash and blood draw by sword we learn that no union found on the principle of liberty and equality could survive half slave and half free   we make ourselves anew and vow to move forward together

 together we determine that a modern economy require railroad and highway to speed travel and commerce school and college to train our worker

 together we discover that a free market only thrive when there be rule to ensure competition and fair play

 together we resolve that a great nation must care for the vulnerable and protect its people from life ’s bad hazard and misfortune

 through it all we have never relinquish our skepticism of central authority nor have we succumb to the fiction that all society ’s ill can be cure through government alone   our celebration of initiative and enterprise our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility these be constant in our character

 but we have always understand that when time change so must we that fidelity to our found principle require new response to new challenge that preserve our individual freedom ultimately require collective action   for the american people can no more meet the demand of today ’s world by act alone than american soldier could have meet the force of fascism or communism with musket and militia   no single person can train all the math and science teacher we ’ll need to equip our child for the future or build the road and network and research lab that will bring new job and business to our shore   now more than ever we must do these thing together as one nation and one people   applause

 for we the people understand that our country can not succeed when a shrink few do very well and a grow many barely make it   applause   we believe that america ’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulder of a rise middle class   we know that america thrive when every person can find independence and pride in their work when the wage of honest labor liberate family from the brink of hardship   we be true to our creed when a little girl bear into the bleakest poverty know that she have the same chance to succeed as anybody else because she be an american she be free and she be equal not just in the eye of god but also in our own   applause

 we understand that outworn program be inadequate to the need of our time   so we must harness new idea and technology to remake our government revamp our tax code reform our school and empower our citizen with the skill they need to work hard learn more reach higher   but while the mean will change our purpose endure   a nation that reward the effort and determination of every single american   that be what this moment require   that be what will give real meaning to our creed

 we the people still believe that every citizen deserve a basic measure of security and dignity   we must make the hard choice to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit   but we reject the belief that america must choose between care for the generation that build this country and invest in the generation that will build its future   applause   for we remember the lesson of our past when twilight year be spend in poverty and parent of a child with a disability have nowhere to turn

 we do not believe that in this country freedom be reserve for the lucky or happiness for the few   we recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our life any one of we at any time may face a job loss or a sudden illness or a home sweep away in a terrible storm   the commitment we make to each other through medicare and medicaid and social security these thing do not sap our initiative they strengthen we   applause   they do not make we a nation of taker they free we to take the risk that make this country great   applause

 we the people still believe that our obligation as americans be not just to ourselves but to all posterity   we will respond to the threat of climate change know that the failure to do so would betray our child and future generation   applause   some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science but none can avoid the devastating impact of rage fire and crippling drought and more powerful storm

 the path towards sustainable energy source will be long and sometimes difficult   but america can not resist this transition we must lead it   we can not cede to other nation the technology that will power new job and new industry we must claim its promise   that ’ how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure our forest and waterway our crop land and snow cap peak   that be how we will preserve our planet command to our care by god   that ’ what will lend meaning to the creed our father once declare

 we the people still believe that endure security and last peace do not require perpetual war   applause   our brave man and woman in uniform temper by the flame of battle be unmatched in skill and courage   applause   our citizen sear by the memory of those we have lose know too well the price that be pay for liberty   the knowledge of their sacrifice will keep we forever vigilant against those who would do we harm but we be also heir to those who win the peace and not just the war who turn swear enemy into the sure of friend and we must carry those lesson into this time as well

 we will defend our people and uphold our value through strength of arm and rule of law   we will show the courage to try and resolve our difference with other nation peacefully not because we be naïve about the danger we face but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear   applause

 america will remain the anchor of strong alliance in every corner of the globe   and we will renew those institution that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad for no one have a great stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation   we will support democracy from asia to africa from the americas to the middle east because our interest and our conscience compel we to act on behalf of those who long for freedom   and we must be a source of hope to the poor the sick the marginalized the victim of prejudice not out of mere charity but because peace in our time require the constant advance of those principle that our common creed describe   tolerance and opportunity human dignity and justice

 we the people declare today that the most evident of truth that all of we be create equal be the star that guide we still just as it guide our forebear through seneca falls and selma and stonewall just as it guide all those man and woman sing and unsung who leave footprint along this great mall to hear a preacher say that we can not walk alone to hear a king proclaim that our individual freedom be inextricably bind to the freedom of every soul on earth   applause

 it be now our generation ’s task to carry on what those pioneer begin   for our journey be not complete until our wife our mother and daughter can earn a living equal to their effort   applause   our journey be not complete until our gay brother and sister be treat like anyone else under the law   applause for if we be truly create equal then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well   applause   our journey be not complete until no citizen be force to wait for hour to exercise the right to vote   applause   our journey be not complete until we find a well way to welcome the strive hopeful immigrant who still see america as a land of opportunity applause until bright young student and engineer be enlist in our workforce rather than expel from our country   applause    our journey be not complete until all our child from the street of detroit to the hill of appalachia to the quiet lane of newtown know that they be care for and cherish and always safe from harm

 that be our generation ’s task to make these word these right these value of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american   be true to our found document do not require we to agree on every contour of life it do not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness   progress do not compel we to settle century long debate about the role of government for all time but it do require we to act in our time   applause

 for now decision be upon we and we can not afford delay   we can not mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politic or treat name calling as reason debate   applause   we must act know that our work will be imperfect   we must act know that today ’s victory will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in four year and 40 year and 400 year hence to advance the timeless spirit once confer to we in a spare philadelphia hall

 my fellow americans the oath i have swear before you today like the one recite by other who serve in this capitol be an oath to god and country not party or faction   and we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service   but the word i speak today be not so different from the oath that be take each time a soldier sign up for duty or an immigrant realize her dream   my oath be not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that wave above and that fill our heart with pride

 they be the word of citizen and they represent our great hope   you and i as citizen have the power to set this country ’s course   you and i as citizen have the obligation to shape the debate of our time not only with the vote we cast but with the voice we lift in defense of our most ancient value and endure ideal   applause

 i know that some issue will be hard to lift than other   some debate will be more contentious   that ’ to be expect   but the reason i come here today be because of a challenge where the difference be dwindle where a broad consensus be emerge and where a call for action can now be hear come from all across america   i ’m here today because the time have come for common sense comprehensive immigration reform   applause   the time be now   now be the time   now be the time   now be the time

 audience   sí se puede   sí se puede

 the president   now be the time

 i ’m here because most americans agree that it ’ time to fix a system that ’s be break for way too long   i ’m here because business leader faith leader labor leader law enforcement and leader from both party be come together to say now be the time to find a well way to welcome the strive hopeful immigrant who still see america as the land of opportunity   now be the time to do this so we can strengthen our economy and strengthen our country ’s future

 think about it we define ourselves as a nation of immigrant   that ’s who we be in our bone   the promise we see in those who come here from every corner of the globe that ’s always be one of our great strength   it keep our workforce young   it keep our country on the cutting edge   and it ’s help build the great economic engine the world have ever know

 after all immigrant helped start business like google and yahoo   they create entire new industry that in turn create new job and new prosperity for our citizen   in recent year one in four high tech startup in america be found by immigrant   one in four new small business owner be immigrant include right here in nevada folk who come here seek opportunity and now want to share that opportunity with other americans

 but we all know that today we have an immigration system that ’ out of date and badly break a system that ’s hold we back instead of help we grow our economy and strengthen our middle class

 right now we have 11 million undocumented immigrant in america 11 million man and woman from all over the world who live their life in the shadow   yes they break the rule   they cross the border illegally   maybe they overstay their visa   those be fact   nobody dispute they   but these 11 million man and woman be now here   many of they have be here for year   and the overwhelming majority of these individual be n’t look for any trouble   they ’re contribute member of the community   they be look out for their family   they be look out for their neighbor   they be weave into the fabric of our life

 every day like the rest of we they go out and try to earn a living   often they do that in a shadow economy a place where employer may offer they less than the minimum wage or make they work overtime without extra pay   and when that happen it ’ not just bad for they it ’ bad for the entire economy   because all the business that be try to do the right thing that be hire people legally pay a decent wage follow the rule they ’re the one who suffer    they have get to compete against company that be break the rule   and the wage and working condition of american worker be threaten too

 so if we be truly committed to strengthen our middle class and provide more ladder of opportunity to those who be willing to work hard to make it into the middle class we have get to fix the system

 we have to make sure that every business and every worker in america be play by the same set of rule   we have to bring this shadow economy into the light so that everybody be hold accountable business for who they hire and immigrant for get on the right side of the law   that ’ common sense   and that ’ why we need comprehensive immigration reform   applause

 there ’ another economic reason why we need reform   it ’ not just about the folk who come here illegally and have the effect they have on our economy   it ’s also about the folk who try to come here legally but have a hard time do so and the effect that have on our economy

 right now there be brilliant student from all over the world sit in classroom at our top university   they ’re earn degree in the field of the future like engineering and computer science   but once they finish school once they earn that diploma there ’ a good chance they ’ll have to leave our country   think about that

 intel be start with the help of an immigrant who study here and then stay here   instagram be start with the help of an immigrant who study here and then stay here   right now in one of those classroom there ’ a student wrestle with how to turn their big idea their intel or instagram into a big business   we ’re give they all the skill they need to figure that out but then we ’re go to turn around and tell they to start that business and create those job in china or india or mexico or someplace else   that ’ not how you grow new industry in america   that ’ how you give new industry to our competitor    that ’ why we need comprehensive immigration reform   applause

 now during my first term we take step to try and patch up some of the bad crack in the system

 first we strengthen security at the border so that we could finally stem the tide of illegal immigrant   we put more boot on the ground on the southern border than at any time in our history   and today illegal crossing be down nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000   applause

 second we focus our enforcement effort on criminal who be here illegally and who endanger our community   and today deportation of criminal be at its high level ever   applause

 and third we take up the cause of the dreamer applause the young people who be bring to this country as child young people who have grow up here build their life here have future here   we say that if you ’re able to meet some basic criterion like pursue an education then we ’ll consider offer you the chance to come out of the shadow so that you can live here and work here legally so that you can finally have the dignity of know you belong

 but because this change be n’t permanent we need congress to act and not just on the dream act   we need congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deal with the 11 million undocumented immigrant who be in the country right now   that be what we need   applause

 now the good news be that for the first time in many year republicans and democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together   applause   member of both party in both chamber be actively work on a solution   yesterday a bipartisan group of senator announce their principle for comprehensive immigration reform which be very much in line with the principle i ’ve propose and campaign on for the last few year   so at this moment it look like there ’ a genuine desire to get this do soon and that ’ very encouraging

 but this time action must follow   applause   we can not allow immigration reform to get bogge down in an endless debate   we have be debate this a very long time   so it be not as if we do not know technically what need to get do   as a consequence to help move this process along today i ’m lay out my idea for immigration reform   and my hope be that this provide some key marker to member of congress as they craft a bill because the idea i ’m propose have traditionally be support by both democrats like ted kennedy and republicans like president george w. bush   you do not get that matchup very often   laughter   so we know where the consensus should be

 now of course there will be rigorous debate about many of the detail and every stakeholder should engage in real give and take in the process   but it ’ important for we to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action be already in place   and if congress be unable to move forward in a timely fashion i will send up a bill base on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away   applause

 so the principle be pretty straightforward   there be a lot of detail behind it   we be go to hand out a bunch of paper so that everybody will know exactly what we be talk about   but the principle be pretty straightforward

 first i believe we need to stay focused on enforcement   that mean continue to strengthen security at our border   it mean crack down more forcefully on business that knowingly hire undocumented worker   to be fair most business want to do the right thing but a lot of they have a hard time figure out who ’s here legally who ’s not   so we need to implement a national system that allow business to quickly and accurately verify someone ’s employment status   and if they still knowingly hire undocumented worker then we need to ramp up the penalty

 second we have to deal with the 11 million individual who be here illegally   we all agree that these man and woman should have to earn their way to citizenship   but for comprehensive immigration reform to work it must be clear from the outset that there be a pathway to citizenship   applause

 we ’ve get to lay out a path a process that include pass a background check pay taxis pay a penalty learn english and then go to the back of the line behind all the folk who be try to come here legally   that be only fair right   applause

 so that mean it will not be a quick process but it will be a fair process   and it will lift these individual out of the shadow and give they a chance to earn their way to a green card and eventually to citizenship   applause

 and the third principle be we ’ve get to bring our legal immigration system into the 21st century because it no long reflect the reality of our time   applause   for example if you be a citizen you should not have to wait year before your family be able to join you in america   you should not have to wait year   applause

 if you ’re a foreign student who want to pursue a career in science or technology or a foreign entrepreneur who want to start a business with the backing of american investor we should help you do that here   because if you succeed you ’ll create american business and american job   you ’ll help we grow our economy   you ’ll help we strengthen our middle class

 so that ’ what comprehensive immigration reform look like   smart enforcement a pathway to earn citizenship improvement in the legal immigration system so that we continue to be a magnet for the good and the bright all around the world   it ’ pretty straightforward

 the question now be simple   do we have the resolve as a people as a country as a government to finally put this issue behind we   i believe that we do   i believe that we do   applause   i believe we be finally at a moment where comprehensive immigration reform be within our grasp

 but i promise you this   the close we get the more emotional this debate be go to become   immigration have always be an issue that enflame passion   that ’ not surprising   there be few thing that be more important to we as a society than who get to come here and call our country home who get the privilege of become a citizen of the united states of america   that be a big deal

 when we talk about that in the abstract it ’ easy sometimes for the discussion to take on a feeling of us versus they   and when that happen a lot of folk forget that most of us use to be they   we forget that   applause

 it ’ really important for we to remember our history   unless you ’re one of the first americans a native american you come from someplace else   somebody bring you   applause

 ken salazar he ’s of mexican american descent but he point that his family have be live where he live for 400 year so he do not immigrate anywhere   laughter

 the irish who leave behind a land of famine   the germans who flee persecution   the scandinavians who arrive eager to pioneer out west   the polish   the russians   the italians   the chinese   the japanese   the west indians   the huddled masse who come through ellis island on one coast and angel island on the other   applause   all those folk before they be we they be they

 and when each new wave of immigrant arrive they face resistance from those who be already here   they face hardship   they face racism   they face ridicule   but over time as they go about their daily life as they earn a living as they raise a family as they build a community as their kid go to school here they do their part to build a nation

 they be the einsteins and the carnegies   but they be also the million of woman and man whose name history may not remember but whose action help make we who we be who build this country hand by hand brick by brick   applause   they all come here know that what make somebody an american be not just blood or birth but allegiance to our found principle and the faith in the idea that anyone from anywhere can write the next great chapter of our story

 and that ’ still true today   just ask alan aleman   alan be here this afternoon where be alan   he be around here there he be right here   applause   alan be bear in mexico   applause   he be bring to this country by his parent when he be a child   grow up alan go to an american school pledge allegiance to the american flag feel american in every way and he be except for one   on paper

 in high school alan watch his friend come of age drive around town with their new license earn some extra cash from their summer job at the mall   he know he could not do those thing   but it do not matter that much   what matter to alan be earn an education so that he could live up to his god give potential

 last year when alan hear the news that we be go to offer a chance for folk like he to emerge from the shadow even if it be just for two year at a time he be one of the first to sign up   and a few month ago he be one of the first people in nevada to get approve   applause   in that moment alan say i feel the fear vanish   i feel accept

 so today alan be in his second year at the college of southern nevada   applause   alan be study to become a doctor   applause   he hope to join the air force   he ’s work hard every single day to build a well life for himself and his family   and all he want be the opportunity to do his part to build a well america   applause

 so in the come week as the idea of reform become more real and the debate become more heated and there be folk who be try to pull this thing apart remember alan and all those who share the same hope and the same dream   remember that this be not just a debate about policy   it ’ about people   it ’ about man and woman and young people who want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the american story

 throughout our history that have only make our nation strong   and it ’ how we will make sure that this century be the same as the last   an american century welcoming of everybody who aspire to do something more and who be willing to work hard to do it and be willing to pledge that allegiance to our flag

 thank you   god bless you   and god bless the united states of america   applause


 mr. speaker mr. vice president member of congress fellow citizen

 fifty one year ago john f. kennedy declare to this chamber that the constitution make we not rival for power but partner for progress   applause it be my task he say to report the state of the union to improve it be the task of we all

 tonight thank to the grit and determination of the american people there be much progress to report   after a decade of grind war our brave man and woman in uniform be come home   applause   after year of gruele recession our business have create over six million new job   we buy more american car than we have in five year and less foreign oil than we have in 20   applause   our housing market be healing our stock market be rebound and consumer patient and homeowner enjoy strong protection than ever before   applause

 so together we have clear away the rubble of crisis and we can say with renew confidence that the state of our union be strong   applause

 but we gather here know that there be million of americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet be reward   our economy be add job but too many people still can not find full time employment   corporate profit have skyrocket to all time high but for more than a decade wage and income have barely budge

 it be our generation ’s task then to reignite the true engine of america ’s economic growth a rise thrive middle class   applause

 it be our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that build this country the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibility you can get ahead no matter where you come from no matter what you look like or who you love

 it be our unfinished task to make sure that this government work on behalf of the many and not just the few that it encourage free enterprise reward individual initiative and open the door of opportunity to every child across this great nation   applause

 the american people do not expect government to solve every problem   they do not expect those of we in this chamber to agree on every issue   but they do expect we to put the nation ’s interest before party   applause   they do expect we to forge reasonable compromise where we can   for they know that america move forward only when we do so together and that the responsibility of improve this union remain the task of we all

 our work must begin by make some basic decision about our budget decision that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery

 over the last few year both party have work together to reduce the deficit by more than $ 2.5 trillion mostly through spending cut but also by raise tax rate on the wealthy 1 percent of americans   as a result we be more than halfway towards the goal of $ 4 trillion in deficit reduction that economist say we need to stabilize our finance

 now we need to finish the job   and the question be how

 in 2011 congress pass a law say that if both party could not agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal about a trillion dollar worth of budget cut would automatically go into effect this year   these sudden harsh arbitrary cut would jeopardize our military readiness   they ’d devastate priority like education and energy and medical research   they would certainly slow our recovery and cost we hundred of thousand of job   that ’ why democrats republicans business leader and economist have already say that these cut know here in washington as the sequester be a really bad idea

 now some in congress have propose prevent only the defense cut by make even big cut to thing like education and job training medicare and social security benefit   that idea be even bad   applause

 yes the big driver of our long term debt be the rise cost of health care for an age population   and those of we who care deeply about program like medicare must embrace the need for modest reform otherwise our retirement program will crowd out the investment we need for our child and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generation

 but we can not ask senior citizen and work family to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while ask nothing more from the wealthy and the most powerful   applause   we will not grow the middle class simply by shift the cost of health care or college onto family that be already struggle or by force community to lay off more teacher and more cop and more firefighter   most americans democrats republicans and independent understand that we can not just cut our way to prosperity   they know that broad base economic growth require a balanced approach to deficit reduction with spending cut and revenue and with everybody do their fair share   and that ’s the approach i offer tonight
 on medicare i ’m prepared to enact reform that will achieve the same amount of health care saving by the beginning of the next decade as the reform propose by the bipartisan simpson bowles commission   applause

 already the affordable care act be help to slow the growth of health care cost   applause   and the reform i ’m propose go even far   we ’ll reduce taxpayer subsidy to prescription drug company and ask more from the wealthy senior   applause   we ’ll bring down cost by change the way our government pay for medicare because our medical bill should not be base on the number of test order or day spend in the hospital they should be base on the quality of care that our senior receive   applause   and i be open to additional reform from both party so long as they do not violate the guarantee of a secure retirement   our government should not make promise we can not keep but we must keep the promise we ’ve already make   applause

 to hit the rest of our deficit reduction target we should do what leader in both party have already suggest and save hundred of billion of dollar by getting rid of tax loophole and deduction for the well off and the well connect   after all why would we choose to make deep cut to education and medicare just to protect special interest tax break   how be that fair   why be it that deficit reduction be a big emergency justifying make cut in social security benefit but not close some loophole   how do that promote growth   applause

 now be our good chance for bipartisan comprehensive tax reform that encourage job creation and help bring down the deficit   applause   we can get this do   the american people deserve a tax code that help small business spend less time fill out complicated form and more time expand and hire a tax code that ensure billionaire with high power accountant can not work the system and pay a low rate than their hardworke secretary a tax code that lower incentive to move job overseas and lower tax rate for business and manufacturer that be create job right here in the united states of america   that ’ what tax reform can deliver   that ’ what we can do together   applause

 i realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy   the politic will be hard for both side   none of we will get 100 percent of what we want   but the alternative will cost we job hurt our economy visit hardship on million of hardworke americans   so let ’s set party interest aside and work to pass a budget that replace reckless cut with smart saving and wise investment in our future   and let ’s do it without the brinksmanship that stress consumer and scare off investor   applause   the great nation on earth can not keep conduct its business by drift from one manufacture crisis to the next   applause   we can not do it

 let ’s agree right here right now to keep the people ’s government open and pay our bill on time and always uphold the full faith and credit of the united states of america   applause   the american people have work too hard for too long rebuild from one crisis to see their elect official cause another   applause

 now most of we agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda   but let ’s be clear deficit reduction alone be not an economic plan   applause   a grow economy that create good middle class job that must be the north star that guide our effort   applause   every day we should ask ourselves three question as a nation   how do we attract more job to our shore   how do we equip our people with the skill they need to get those job   and how do we make sure that hard work lead to a decent living

 a year and a half ago i put forward an american jobs act that independent economist say would create more than 1 million new job   and i thank the last congress for pass some of that agenda   i urge this congress to pass the rest   applause   but tonight i ’ll lay out additional proposal that be fully pay for and fully consistent with the budget framework both party agree to just 18 month ago   let i repeat nothing i ’m propose tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime   it be not a big government we need but a smart government that set priority and invest in broad base growth   applause   that be what we should be look for

 our first priority be make america a magnet for new job and manufacturing   after shed job for more than 10 year our manufacturer have add about 500,000 job over the past three   caterpillar be bring job back from japan   ford be bring job back from mexico   and this year apple will start make macs in america again   applause

 there be thing we can do right now to accelerate this trend   last year we create our first manufacture innovation institute in youngstown ohio   a once shutter warehouse be now a state of the art lab where new worker be master the 3d printing that have the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything   there ’ no reason this can not happen in other town

 so tonight i ’m announce the launch of three more of these manufacture hub where business will partner with the department of defense and energy to turn region leave behind by globalization into global center of high tech job   and i ask this congress to help create a network of 15 of these hub and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing be make right here in america   we can get that do   applause

 now if we want to make the good product we also have to invest in the good idea   every dollar we invest to map the human genome return $ 140 to our economy every dollar   today our scientist be map the human brain to unlock the answer to alzheimer ’s   they ’re develop drug to regenerate damaged organ devise new material to make battery 10 time more powerful   now be not the time to gut these job create investment in science and innovation   now be the time to reach a level of research and development not see since the height of the space race   we need to make those investment   applause
 today no area hold more promise than our investment in american energy   after year of talk about it we ’re finally poise to control our own energy future   we produce more oil at home than we have in 15 year   applause   we have double the distance our car will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate from source like wind and solar with ten of thousand of good american job to show for it   we produce more natural gas than ever before and nearly everyone ’s energy bill be low because of it   and over the last four year our emission of the dangerous carbon pollution that threaten our planet have actually fall

 but for the sake of our child and our future we must do more to combat climate change   applause   now it ’ true that no single event make a trend   but the fact be the 12 hot year on record have all come in the last 15   heat wave drought wildfire flood all be now more frequent and more intense   we can choose to believe that superstorm sandy and the most severe drought in decade and the bad wildfire some state have ever see be all just a freak coincidence   or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it ’ too late   applause

 now the good news be we can make meaningful progress on this issue while drive strong economic growth   i urge this congress to get together pursue a bipartisan market base solution to climate change like the one john mccain and joe lieberman work on together a few year ago   but if congress will not act soon to protect future generation i will   applause   i will direct my cabinet to come up with executive action we can take now and in the future to reduce pollution prepare our community for the consequence of climate change and speed the transition to more sustainable source of energy

 four year ago other country dominate the clean energy market and the job that come with it   and we ’ve begin to change that   last year wind energy add nearly half of all new power capacity in america   so let ’s generate even more   solar energy get cheap by the year let ’s drive down cost even far as long as country like china keep go all in on clean energy so must we

 now in the meantime the natural gas boom have lead to clean power and great energy independence   we need to encourage that   and that ’ why my administration will keep cut red tape and speed up new oil and gas permit   applause   that ’s get to be part of an all of the above plan   but i also want to work with this congress to encourage the research and technology that help natural gas burn even cleaner and protect our air and our water

 in fact much of our new find energy be draw from land and water that we the public own together   so tonight i propose we use some of our oil and gas revenue to fund an energy security trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our car and truck off oil for good   if a nonpartisan coalition of ceo and retired general and admiral can get behind this idea then so can we   let ’s take their advice and free our family and business from the painful spike in gas price we ’ve put up with for far too long

 i ’m also issue a new goal for america   let ’s cut in half the energy waste by our home and business over the next 20 year   applause   we will work with the state to do it   those state with the good idea to create job and low energy bill by construct more efficient building will receive federal support to help make that happen

 america ’s energy sector be just one part of an age infrastructure badly in need of repair   ask any ceo where they ’d rather locate and hire a country with deteriorate road and bridge or one with high speed rail and internet high tech school self heal power grid   the ceo of siemens america a company that bring hundred of new job to north carolina say that if we upgrade our infrastructure they ’ll bring even more job   and that ’s the attitude of a lot of company all around the world   and i know you want these job create project in your district   i ’ve see all those ribbon cutting laughter

 so tonight i propose a fix it first program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repair like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridge across the country applause   and to make sure taxpayer do n’t shoulder the whole burden i ’m also propose a partnership to rebuild america that attract private capital to upgrade what our business need most   modern port to move our good modern pipeline to withstand a storm modern school worthy of our child   applause   let ’s prove that there ’ no well place to do business than here in the united states of america and let ’s start right away   we can get this do

 and part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector   the good news be our housing market be finally heal from the collapse of 2007   home price be rise at the fast pace in six year   home purchase be up nearly 50 percent and construction be expand again

 but even with mortgage rate near a 50 year low too many family with solid credit who want to buy a home be be reject   too many family who never miss a payment and want to refinance be be tell no   that ’s hold our entire economy back   we need to fix it

 right now there ’ a bill in this congress that would give every responsible homeowner in america the chance to save $ 3,000 a year by refinance at today ’s rate   democrats and republicans have support it before so what be we wait for take a vote and send i that bill   applause   why would we be against that   applause   why would that be a partisan issue help folk refinance   right now overlap regulation keep responsible young family from buy their first home   what ’s hold we back   let ’s streamline the process and help our economy grow

 these initiative in manufacturing energy infrastructure housing all these thing will help entrepreneur and small business owner expand and create new job   but none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizen with the skill and training to fill those job   applause

 and that have to start at the early possible age   study after study show that the soon a child begin learn the well he or she do down the road   but today few than 3 in 10 four year old be enrol in a high quality preschool program   most middle class parent can not afford a few hundred buck a week for a private preschool   and for poor kid who need help the most this lack of access to preschool education can shadow they for the rest of their life   so tonight i propose work with state to make high quality preschool available to every single child in america   applause   that be something we should be able to do

 every dollar we invest in high quality early childhood education can save more than seven dollar later on by boost graduation rate reduce teen pregnancy even reduce violent crime   in state that make it a priority to educate our young child like georgia or oklahoma study show student grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level graduate high school hold a job form more stable family of their own   we know this work   so let ’s do what work and make sure none of our child start the race of life already behind let ’s give our kid that chance   applause

 let ’s also make sure that a high school diploma put our kid on a path to a good job   right now country like germany focus on graduate their high school student with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community college   so those german kid they be ready for a job when they graduate high school   they have be train for the job that be there   now at school like p tech in brooklyn a collaboration between new york public schools and city university of new york and ibm student will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate 's degree in computer or engineering
 we need to give every american student opportunity like this   applause

 and four year ago we start race to the top a competition that convince almost every state to develop smart curriculum and high standard all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year   tonight i ’m announce a new challenge to redesign america ’s high school so they well equip graduate for the demand of a high tech economy   and we ’ll reward school that develop new partnership with college and employer and create class that focus on science technology engineering and math the skill today ’s employer be look for to fill the job that be there right now and will be there in the future

 now even with well high school most young people will need some high education   it ’ a simple fact the more education you ’ve get the more likely you be to have a good job and work your way into the middle class   but today skyrocket cost price too many young people out of a high education or saddle they with unsustainable debt

 through tax credit grant and well loan we ’ve make college more affordable for million of student and family over the last few year   but taxpayer can not keep on subsidize high and high and high cost for high education   college must do their part to keep cost down and it ’ our job to make sure that they do   applause

 so tonight i ask congress to change the higher education act so that affordability and value be include in determine which college receive certain type of federal aid   applause and tomorrow my administration will release a new college scorecard that parent and student can use to compare school base on a simple criterion where you can get the most bang for your educational buck

 now to grow our middle class our citizen have to have access to the education and training that today ’s job require   but we also have to make sure that america remain a place where everyone who ’ willing to work everybody who ’ willing to work hard have the chance to get ahead

 our economy be strong when we harness the talent and ingenuity of strive hopeful immigrant   applause   and right now leader from the business labor law enforcement faith community they all agree that the time have come to pass comprehensive immigration reform   applause   now be the time to do it   now be the time to get it do   now be the time to get it do   applause

 real reform mean strong border security and we can build on the progress my administration have already make put more boot on the southern border than at any time in our history and reduce illegal crossing to their low level in 40 year

 real reform mean establish a responsible pathway to earn citizenship a path that include pass a background check pay taxis and a meaningful penalty learn english and go to the back of the line behind the folk try to come here legally   applause

 and real reform mean fix the legal immigration system to cut waiting period and attract the highly skilled entrepreneur and engineer that will help create job and grow our economy   applause

 in other word we know what need to be do   and as we speak bipartisan group in both chamber be work diligently to draft a bill and i applaud their effort   so let ’s get this do   send i a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few month and i will sign it right away   and america will be well for it   applause   let ’s get it do   let ’s get it do

 but we can not stop there   we know our economy be strong when our wife our mother our daughter can live their life free from discrimination in the workplace and free from the fear of domestic violence   today the senate pass the violence against women act that joe biden originally write almost 20 year ago   and i now urge the house to do the same   applause   good job joe   and i ask this congress to declare that woman should earn a living equal to their effort and finally pass the paycheck fairness act this year   applause

 we know our economy be strong when we reward an honest day ’s work with honest wage   but today a full time worker make the minimum wage earn $ 14,500 a year   even with the tax relief we put in place a family with two kid that earn the minimum wage still live below the poverty line   that ’ wrong   that ’ why since the last time this congress raise the minimum wage 19 state have choose to bump theirs even higher

 tonight let ’s declare that in the wealthy nation on earth no one who work full time should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to $ 9.00 an hour   applause we should be able to get that do   applause

 this single step would raise the income of million of work family   it could mean the difference between grocery or the food bank rent or eviction scrape by or finally get ahead   for business across the country it would mean customer with more money in their pocket   and a whole lot of folk out there would probably need less help from government   in fact work folk should not have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while ceo pay have never be high   so here ’ an idea that governor romney and i actually agree on last year let ’s tie the minimum wage to the cost of living so that it finally become a wage you can live on   applause

 tonight let ’s also recognize that there be community in this country where no matter how hard you work it be virtually impossible to get ahead   factory town decimate from year of plant pack up   inescapable pocket of poverty urban and rural where young adult be still fight for their first job   america be not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny   and that ’ why we need to build new ladder of opportunity into the middle class for all who be willing to climb they

 let ’s offer incentive to company that hire americans who ’ve get what it take to fill that job opening but have be out of work so long that no one will give they a chance anymore let ’s put people back to work rebuild vacant home in run down neighborhood   and this year my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hard hit town in america to get these community back on their foot   we ’ll work with local leader to target resource at public safety and education and housing

 we ’ll give new tax credit to business that hire and invest   and we ’ll work to strengthen family by remove the financial deterrent to marriage for low income couple and do more to encourage fatherhood because what make you a man be n’t the ability to conceive a child it ’ have the courage to raise one   and we want to encourage that   we want to help that applause

 strong family   strong community   a strong america   it be this kind of prosperity broad share build on a thriving middle class that have always be the source of our progress at home   it ’ also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world

 tonight we stand united in salute the troop and civilian who sacrifice every day to protect we   because of they we can say with confidence that america will complete its mission in afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeat the core of al qaeda   applause

 already we have bring home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and woman   this spring our force will move into a support role while afghan security force take the lead   tonight i can announce that over the next year another 34,000 american troop will come home from afghanistan   this drawdown will continue and by the end of next year our war in afghanistan will be over   applause

 beyond 2014 america ’s commitment to a unified and sovereign afghanistan will endure but the nature of our commitment will change   we be negotiate an agreement with the afghan government that focus on two mission training and equip afghan force so that the country do not again slip into chaos and counterterrorism effort that allow we to pursue the remnant of al qaeda and their affiliate

 today the organization that attack we on 9/11 be a shadow of its former self   applause   it be true different al qaeda affiliate and extremist group have emerge from the arabian peninsula to africa   the threat these group pose be evolve   but to meet this threat we do not need to send ten of thousand of our son and daughter abroad or occupy other nation   instead we will need to help country like yemen and libya and somalia provide for their own security and help ally who take the fight to terrorist as we have in mali   and where necessary through a range of capability we will continue to take direct action against those terrorist who pose the grave threat to americans   applause

 now as we do we must enlist our value in the fight   that be why my administration have work tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism effort   throughout we have keep congress fully inform of our effort   i recognize that in our democracy no one should just take my word for it that we ’re do thing the right way   so in the month ahead i will continue to engage congress to ensure not only that our targeting detention and prosecution of terrorist remain consistent with our law and system of check and balance but that our effort be even more transparent to the american people and to the world   applause

 of course our challenge do n’t end with al qaeda   america will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world ’s most dangerous weapon   the regime in north korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meet their international obligation   provocation of the sort we see last night will only far isolate they as we stand by our ally strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in take firm action in response to these threat

 likewise the leader of iran must recognize that now be the time for a diplomatic solution because a coalition stand united in demand that they meet their obligation and we will do what be necessary to prevent they from get a nuclear weapon applause

 at the same time we ’ll engage russia to seek further reduction in our nuclear arsenal and continue lead the global effort to secure nuclear material that could fall into the wrong hand because our ability to influence other depend on our willingness to lead and meet our obligation

 america must also face the rapidly grow threat from cyber attack   applause   now we know hacker steal people ’s identity and infiltrate private email   we know foreign country and company swipe our corporate secret   now our enemy be also seek the ability to sabotage our power grid our financial institution our air traffic control system   we can not look back year from now and wonder why we do nothing in the face of real threat to our security and our economy

 and that ’ why early today i sign a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defense by increase information sharing and develop standard to protect our national security our job and our privacy   applause

 but now congress must act as well by pass legislation to give our government a great capacity to secure our network and deter attack   this be something we should be able to get do on a bipartisan basis   applause

 now even as we protect our people we should remember that today ’s world present not just danger not just threat it present opportunity   to boost american export support american job and level the play field in the grow market of asia we intend to complete negotiation on a trans pacific partnership   and tonight i ’m announce that we will launch talk on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the european union because trade that be fair and free across the atlantic support million of good pay american job   applause

 we also know that progress in the most impoverished part of our world enrich we all not only because it create new market more stable order in certain region of the world but also because it ’s the right thing to do   in many place people live on little more than a dollar a day   so the united states will join with our ally to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decade by connect more people to the global economy by empower woman by give our young and bright mind new opportunity to serve and help community to feed and power and educate themselves by save the world ’s child from preventable death and by realize the promise of an aids free generation which be within our reach   applause

 you see america must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change   i see the power of hope last year in rangoon in burma when aung san suu kyi welcome an american president into the home where she have be imprison for year when thousand of burmese line the street wave american flag include a man who say there be justice and law in the united states   i want our country to be like that

 in defense of freedom we ’ll remain the anchor of strong alliance from the americas to africa from europe to asia   in the middle east we will stand with citizen as they demand their universal right and support stable transition to democracy   applause

 we know the process will be messy and we can not presume to dictate the course of change in country like egypt but we can and will insist on respect for the fundamental right of all people   we ’ll keep the pressure on a syrian regime that have murder its own people and support opposition leader that respect the right of every syrian   and we will stand steadfast with israel in pursuit of security and a last peace   applause

 these be the message i will deliver when i travel to the middle east next month   and all this work depend on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous place at great personal risk our diplomat our intelligence officer and the man and woman of the united states armed forces   as long as i ’m commander in chief we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad and we will maintain the good military the world have ever know   applause

 we will invest in new capability even as we reduce waste and wartime spending   we will ensure equal treatment for all servicemember and equal benefit for their family gay and straight   applause   we will draw upon the courage and skill of our sister and daughter and mom because woman have prove under fire that they be ready for combat

 we will keep faith with our veteran invest in world class care include mental health care for our wound warrior applause support our military family give our veteran the benefit and education and job opportunity that they have earn   and i want to thank my wife michelle and dr. jill biden for their continue dedication to serve our military family as well as they have serve we thank you honey   thank you jill   applause

 defend our freedom though be not just the job of our military alone   we must all do our part to make sure our god give right be protect here at home   that include one of the most fundamental right of a democracy   the right to vote   applause   when any american no matter where they live or what their party be deny that right because they can not afford to wait for five or six or seven hour just to cast their ballot we be betray our ideal   applause

 so tonight i ’m announce a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in america   and it definitely need improvement   i ’m ask two long time expert in the field who by the way recently serve as the top attorney for my campaign and for governor romney ’s campaign to lead it   we can fix this and we will   the american people demand it and so do our democracy   applause

 of course what i ’ve say tonight matter little if we do not come together to protect our most precious resource   our child   it have be two month since newtown   i know this be not the first time this country have debate how to reduce gun violence   but this time be different   overwhelming majority of americans americans who believe in the second amendment have come together around common sense reform like background check that will make it hard for criminal to get their hand on a gun   applause   senator of both party be work together on tough new law to prevent anyone from buy gun for resale to criminal   police chief be ask our help to get weapon of war and massive ammunition magazine off our street because these police chief they ’re tired of see their guy and gal be outgunne

 each of these proposal deserve a vote in congress   applause   now if you want to vote no that ’s your choice   but these proposal deserve a vote   because in the two month since newtown more than a thousand birthday graduation anniversary have be steal from our life by a bullet from a gun more than a thousand

 one of those we lose be a young girl name hadiya pendleton   she be 15 year old   she love fig newtons and lip gloss   she be a majorette   she be so good to her friend they all think they be her good friend   just three week ago she be here in washington with her classmate perform for her country at my inauguration   and a week later she be shoot and kill in a chicago park after school just a mile away from my house

 hadiya ’s parent nate and cleo be in this chamber tonight along with more than two dozen americans whose life have be tear apart by gun violence   they deserve a vote   they deserve a vote   applause   gabby giffords deserve a vote   applause   the family of newtown deserve a vote   applause the family of aurora deserve a vote   applause   the family of oak creek and tucson and blacksburg and the countless other community rip open by gun violence they deserve a simple vote   applause   they deserve a simple vote

 our action will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country   in fact no law no initiative no administrative act will perfectly solve all the challenge i ’ve outline tonight   but we be never send here to be perfect   we be send here to make what difference we can to secure this nation expand opportunity uphold our ideal through the hard often frustrating but absolutely necessary work of self government

 we be send here to look out for our fellow americans the same way they look out for one another every single day usually without fanfare all across this country   we should follow their example

 we should follow the example of a new york city nurse name menchu sanchez   when hurricane sandy plunge her hospital into darkness she be not think about how her own home be fare her mind be on the 20 precious newborn in her care and the rescue plan she devise that keep they all safe

 we should follow the example of a north miami woman name desiline victor   when desiline arrive at her polling place she be tell the wait to vote might be six hour   and as time tick by her concern be not with her tired body or ache foot but whether folk like she would get to have their say   and hour after hour a throng of people stay in line to support she because desiline be 102 year old   applause   and they erupt in cheer when she finally put on a sticker that read i vote applause

 we should follow the example of a police officer name brian murphy   when a gunman open fire on a sikh temple in wisconsin and brian be the first to arrive he do not consider his own safety   he fight back until help arrive and order his fellow officer to protect the safety of the americans worship inside even as he lie bleed from 12 bullet wound   and when ask how he do that brian say that ’ just the way we ’re make

 that ’ just the way we ’re make   we may do different job and wear different uniform and hold different view than the person beside we   but as americans we all share the same proud title we be citizen   it ’ a word that do not just describe our nationality or legal status   it describe the way we ’re make   it describe what we believe   it capture the endure idea that this country only work when we accept certain obligation to one another and to future generation that our right be wrap up in the right of other and that well into our third century as a nation it remain the task of we all as citizen of these united states to be the author of the next great chapter of our american story

 thank you   god bless you and god bless these united states of america   applause


good morning everybody   as you know i just meet with leader of both party to discuss a way forward in light of the severe budget cut that start to take effect today   i tell they these cut will hurt our economy   they will cost we job   and to set it right both side need to be willing to compromise

 the good news be the american people be strong and they ’re resilient   they fight hard to recover from the bad economic crisis since the great depression and we will get through this as well   even with these cut in place folk all across this country will work hard to make sure that we keep the recovery go   but washington sure be n’t make it easy   at a time when our business have finally begin to get some traction hire new worker bring job back to america we should not be make a series of dumb arbitrary cut to thing that business depend on and worker depend on like education and research and infrastructure and defense   it ’ unnecessary   and at a time when too many americans be still look for work it ’ inexcusable

 now what ’ important to understand be that not everyone will feel the pain of these cut right away   the pain though will be real   begin this week many middle class family will have their life disrupt in significant way   business that work with the military like the virginia shipbuilder that i visit on tuesday may have to lay folk off   community near military basis will take a serious blow   hundred of thousand of americans who serve their country border patrol agent fbi agent civilian who work at the pentagon all will suffer significant pay cut and furlough

 all of this will cause a ripple effect throughout our economy   layoff and pay cut mean that people have less money in their pocket and that mean that they have less money to spend at local business   that mean low profit   that mean few hire   the long these cut remain in place the great the damage to our economy a slow grind that will intensify with each pass day

 so economist be estimate that as a consequence of this sequester that we could see growth cut by over one half of 1 percent   it will cost about 750,000 job at a time when we should be grow job more quickly   so every time that we get a piece of economic news over the next month next two month next six month as long as the sequester be in place we ’ll know that that economic news could have be well if congress have not fail to act

 and let ’s be clear   none of this be necessary   it ’s happen because of a choice that republicans in congress have make   they ’ve allow these cut to happen because they refuse to budge on close a single wasteful loophole to help reduce the deficit   as recently as yesterday they decide to protect special interest tax break for the well off and well connect and they think that that ’s apparently more important than protect our military or middle class family from the pain of these cut

 i do believe that we can and must replace these cut with a more balanced approach that ask something from everybody   smart spending cut entitlement reform tax reform that make the tax code more fair for family and business without raise tax rate   all so that we can responsibly lower the deficit without lay off worker or force parent to scramble for childcare or slash financial aid for college student

 i do not think that ’ too much to ask   i do not think that be partisan   it ’ the kind of approach that i ’ve propose for two year   it ’ what i run on last year   and the majority of the american people agree with i in this approach include by the way a majority of republicans   we just need republicans in congress to catch up with their own party and their country on this   and if they do so we could make a lot of progress

 i do know that there be republicans in congress who privately at least say that they would rather close tax loophole than let these cut go through   i know that there be democrats who ’d rather do smart entitlement reform than let these cut go through   so there be a caucus of common sense up on capitol hill   it ’ just it ’ a silent group right now and we want to make sure that their voice start getting hear

 in the come day and in the come week i ’m go to keep on reach out to they both individually and as group of senator or member of the house and say to they let ’s fix this not just for a month or two but for year to come   because the great nation on earth do not conduct its business in month to month increment or by careen from crisis to crisis   and america have get a lot more work to do

 in the meantime we can not let political gridlock around the budget stand in the way of other area where we can make progress   i be pleased to see that the house pass the violence against women act yesterday   that be a big win for not just woman but for family and for the american people   it ’ a law that ’s go to save life and help more americans live free from fear   it ’ something that we ’ve be push on for a long time   i be glad to see that do   and it ’ an example of how we can still get some important bipartisan legislation through this congress even though there be still these fiscal argument take place

 and i think there be other area where we can make progress even with the sequester unresolved   i will continue to push for those initiative   i ’m go to keep push for high quality preschool for every family that want it   i ’m go to keep push to make sure that we raise the minimum wage so that it ’ one that family can live on   i ’m go to keep on push for immigration reform and reform our voting system and improvement on our transportation sector   and i ’m go to keep push for sensible gun reform because i still think they deserve a vote

 this be the agenda that the american people vote for   these be america ’s priority   they be too important to go   unaddressed   and i ’m go to keep push to make sure that we see they through

 so with that i ’m go to take some question   i ’m go to start with julie

 q     thank you mr. president   how much responsibility do you feel like you bear for these cut take effect   and be the only way to offset they at this point for republicans to bend on revenue or do you see any alternative

 the president   look we have already cut $ 2.5 trillion in our deficit   everybody say we need to cut $ 4 trillion which mean we have to come up with another trillion and a half   the vast majority of economist agree that the problem when it come to deficit be not discretionary spending   it be not that we be spend too much money on education   it be not that we be spend too much money on job training or that we be spend too much money rebuild our road and our bridge   we be not

 the problem that we have be a long term problem in term of our health care cost and program like medicare   and what i have say very specifically very detailed be that i be prepared to take on the problem where it exist on entitlement and do some thing that my own party really do not like if it be part of a broad package of sensible deficit reduction   so the deal that i have put forward over the last two year the deal that i put forward as recently as december be still on the table   i be prepared to do hard thing and to push my democratic friend to do hard thing

 but what i can not do be ask middle class family ask senior ask student to bear the entire burden of deficit reduction when we know we have get a bunch of tax loophole that be benefit the well off and the well connect be not contribute to growth be not contribute to our economy   it be not fair   it be not right   the american people do not think it be fair and do not think it be right

 so i recognize that speaker boehner have get challenge in his caucus   i recognize that it be very hard for republican leader to be perceive as make concession to i   sometimes i reflect be there something else i could do to make these guy i be not talk about the leader now but maybe some of the house republican caucus member not paint horn on my head   and i genuinely believe that there be an opportunity for we to cooperate

 but what do not make sense and the only thing that we have see from republicans so far in term of proposal be to replace this set of arbitrary cut with even bad arbitrary cut   that be not go to help the economy   that be not go to help growth   that be not go to create job   and as a number of economist have note ironically it do not even reduce our deficit in the smart way possible or the fast way possible

 so in term of go forward my hope be that after some reflection as member of congress start hear from constituent who be be negatively impact as we start see the impact that the sequester be have that they step back and say all right be there a way for we to move forward on a package of entitlement reform tax reform not raise tax rate identify program that do not work come up with a plan that be comprehensive and that make sense   and it may take a couple of week   it may take a couple of month but i be just go to keep on push on it   and my view be that ultimately common sense prevail

 but what be true right now be that the republicans have make a choice that maintain an ironclad rule that we will not accept an extra dime ’s worth of revenue make it very difficult for we to get any large comprehensive deal   and that be a choice they be make   they be say that it be more important to preserve these tax loophole than it be to prevent these arbitrary cut

 and what be interesting be speaker boehner just a couple month ago identify these tax loophole and tax break and say we should close they and raise revenue   so it be not as if it be not possible to do   they themselves have suggest that it be possible to do   and if they believe that in fact these tax loophole and these tax break for the well off and the well connect be n’t contribute to growth be not good for our economy be not particularly fair and can raise revenue well why do n’t we get start   why do not we do that

 it may be that because of the politic within the republican party they can not do it right now   i understand that   my hope be be that they can do it later

 and i just want to repeat julie because i think it be very important to understand it be not as if democrats be not be ask to do anything either to compromise   there be member of my party who violently disagree with the notion that we should do anything on medicare   and i be willing to say to they i disagree with you because i want to preserve medicare for the long haul   and we be go to have some tough politic within my party to get this do

 this be not a situation where i be only ask for concession from republicans and ask nothing from democrats   i be say that everybody be go to have to do something   and the one key to this whole thing be try to make sure we keep in mind who we be here for   we be not here for ourselves we be not here for our party we be not here to advance our electoral prospect   we be here for american family who have be getting batter pretty good over the last four year be just start to see the economy improve business be just start to see some confidence come back   and this be not a win for anybody this be a loss for the american people

 and again if we step back and just remind ourselves what it be we be suppose to be do here then hopefully common sense will out in the end

 q     it sound like you be say that this be a republican problem and not one that you bear any responsibility for

 the president   well julie give i an example of what i might do

 q     i be just try to clarify your statement

 the president   well no but i be try to clarify the question   what i be suggest be i have put forward a plan that call for serious spending cut serious entitlement reform go right at the problem that be at the heart of our long term deficit problem   i have offer negotiation around that kind of balanced approach   and so far we have get rebuffed because what speaker boehner and the republicans have say be we can not do any revenue we can not do a dime 's worth of revenue

 so what more do you think i should do   okay i just want to clarify   laughter   because if people have a suggestion i be happy to this be a room full of smart folk

 all right zach goldfarb

 q     mr. president the next focal point seem to be the continue resolution that ’s fund the government at the end of the month that expire at the end of the month   would you sign a cr that continue the sequester but continue to fund the government   and in a related point how do you truly reach the limit of your persuasive power   be there any other leverage you have to convince the republicans to convince folk that this be n’t the way to go

 the president   well i ’d like to think i ’ve still get some persuasive power leave   let i check   laughter   look the issue be not my persuasive power   the american people agree with my approach   they agree that we should have a balanced approach to deficit reduction

 the question be can the american people help persuade their member of congress to do the right thing and i have a lot of confidence that over time if the american people express their displeasure about how something be work that eventually congress respond   sometimes there be a little gap between what the american people think and what congress think   but eventually congress catch up

 with respect to the budget and keep the government open i ’ll try for our view audience to make sure that we ’re not talk in washington gobbledygook   what ’s call the continue resolution which be essentially just an extension of last year ’s budget into this year ’s budget to make sure that basic government function continue i think it ’s the right thing to do to make sure that we do not have a government shutdown   and that be preventable

 we have a budget control act right   we agree to a certain amount of money that be go to be spend each year and certain funding level for our military our education system and so forth   if we stick to that deal then i will be supportive of we stick to that deal   it ’ a deal that i make

 the sequester be additional cut on top of that   and by law until congress take the sequester away we ’d have to abide by those additional cut   but there ’s no reason why we should have another crisis by shut the government down in addition to these arbitrary spending cut

 q     just to make it 100 percent clear you ’d sign a budget that continue to fund the government even at the low level of the sequester even if you do not prefer to do that

 the president   zach i ’m not go to i never want to make myself 100 percent clear with you guy   laughter   but i think it ’ fair to say that i make a deal for a certain budget certain number   there ’ no reason why that deal need to be reopen   it be a deal that speaker boehner make as well and all the leadership make   and if the bill that arrive on my desk be reflective of the commitment that we ’ve previously make then obviously i would sign it because i want to make sure that we keep on do what we need to do for the american people

 jessica

 q     mr. president to your question what could you do first of all could not you just have they down here and refuse to let they leave the room until you have a deal   laughter

 the president   i mean jessica i be not a dictator   i ’m the president   so ultimately if mitch mcconnell or john boehner say we need to go to catch a plane i can not have secret service block the doorway right   so

 q     but be n’t that part of leadership   i ’m sorry to interrupt but be n’t

 the president   i understand   and i know that this have be some of the conventional wisdom that be be float around washington that somehow even though most people agree that i ’m be reasonable that most people agree i ’m present a fair deal the fact that they do not take it mean that i should somehow do a jedi mind meld with these folk and convince they to do what ’s right   well they be elect   we have a constitutional system of government   the speaker of the house and the leader of the senate and all those folk have responsibility

 what i can do be i can make the good possible case for why we need to do the right thing   i can speak to the american people about the consequence of the decision that congress be make or the lack of decision making by congress   but ultimately it ’ a choice they make

 and this idea that somehow there ’ a secret formula or secret sauce to get speaker boehner or mitch mcconnell to say you know what mr. president you ’re right we should close some tax loophole for the well off and well connect in exchange for some serious entitlement reform and spending cut of program we do not need   i think if there be a secret way to do that i would have try it   i would have do it

 what i can do be i can make the good possible argument   and i can offer concession and i can offer compromise   i can negotiate   i can make sure that my party be willing to compromise and be not be ideological or think about these just in term of political term   and i think i have do that and i will continue to do that

 but what i can not do be force congress to do the right thing   the american people may have the capacity to do that   and in the absence of a decision on the part of the speaker of the house and other to put middle class family ahead of whatever political imperative he might have right now we be go to have these cut in place   but again i be hopeful about human nature   i think that over time people do the right thing   and i will keep on reach out and see if there be other formula or other way to jigger this thing into place so that we get a well result

 q     what do you say to the people like mayor bloomberg who be no critic of yours in general he endorse you who argue that there be some what he call posturing in these claim that there be go to be big layoff and a lot of people out of work and think that the effect of the spending cut be be overstate by the administration

 the president   well jessica look i will just give you an example   the department of defense right now have to figure out how the child of military family be go to continue with their schooling over the next several month because teacher at these army basis be typically civilian   they be therefore subject to furlough which mean that they may not be able to teach one day a week

 now i expect that we will be able to manage around it   but if i be a man or woman in uniform in afghanistan right now the notion that my spouse back home be have to worry about whether or not our kid be get the good education possible the notion that my school for my child on an army base might be disrupt because congress do not act that be an impact   now mayor bloomberg and other may not feel that impact   i suspect they will not   but that family will

 the border patrol agent who be out there in the hot sun do what congress say they be suppose to be do find out suddenly that they be get a 10 percent pay cut and have to go home and explain that to their family i do not think they feel like this be an exaggerated impact   so i guess it depend on where you sit

 now what be absolutely true be that not everybody be go to feel it   not everybody be go to feel it all at once   what be true be that the accumulation of those story all across this country folk who suddenly might have be work all their life to get an education just so that they can get that job and get out of welfare and they have get their kid in head start and now suddenly that head start slot be go and they be try to figure out how be i go to keep my job because i can not afford child care for my kid some of the supplier for those shipbuilder down in virginia where you have get some supplier who be small business this be all they do and they may shut down those company and their employee be go to be lay off the accumulation of all of those story of impact be go to make our economy weak   it be go to mean less growth   it be go to mean hundred of thousand of job lose

 that be real   that ’s not we be not make that up   that ’s not a scare tactic that ’ a fact

 start tomorrow everybody here all the folk who be clean the floor at the capitol now that congress have leave somebody be go to be vacuum and clean those floor and throw out the garbage they be go to have less pay   the janitor the security guard they just get a pay cut and they have get to figure out how to manage that   that ’ real

 so i want to be very clear here   it be absolutely true that this be not go to precipitate the kind of crisis we talk about with america default and some of the problem around the debt ceiling   i do not anticipate a huge financial crisis but people be go to be hurt   the economy will not grow as quickly as it would have   unemployment will not go down as quickly as it would have and there be life behind that   and that ’ real   and it be not necessary that ’s the problem

 christi parsons

 q     thank you

 the president   hey christi

 q     mr. president your administration weigh in yesterday on the proposition 8 case   a few month ago it look like you might be averse to do that and i just wonder if you could talk a little bit about your deliberation and how your thinking evolve on that   be there conversation that be important to you   be there thing that you read that influence your thinking

 the president   as everybody here know last year upon a long period of reflection i conclude that we can not discriminate against same sex couple when it come to marriage that the basic principle that america be found on the idea that we be all create equal apply to everybody regardless of sexual orientation as well as race or gender or religion or ethnicity

 and i think that the same evolution that i have go through be an evolution that the country as a whole have go through   and i think it be a profoundly positive thing   so that when the supreme court essentially call the question by take this case about california 's law i do not feel like that be something that this administration could avoid   i feel it be important for we to articulate what i believe and what this administration stand for

 and although i do think that we be see on a state by state basis progress be make more and more state recognize same sex couple and give they the opportunity to marry and maintain all the benefit of marriage that heterosexual couple do when the supreme court ask do you think that the california law which do not provide any rationale for discriminate against same sex couple other than just the notion that well they be same sex couple if the supreme court ask i or my attorney general or solicitor general do we think that meet constitutional muster i feel it be important for we to answer that question honestly and the answer be no

 q     and give the fact that you do hold that position about gay marriage i wonder if you think about just once you make the decision to weigh in why not just argue that marriage be a right that should be available to all people of this country

 the president   well that be an argument that i ’ve make personally   the solicitor general in his institutional role go before the supreme court be oblige to answer the specific question before they   and the specific question present before the court right now be whether prop 8 and the california law be unconstitutional

 and what we ’ve do be we ’ve put forward a basic principle which be which apply to all equal protection case   whenever a particular group be be discriminate against the court ask the question what ’s the rationale for this and it well be a good reason   and if you do not have a good reason we ’re go to strike it down

 and what we ’ve say be be that same sex couple be a group a class that deserve heighten scrutiny that the supreme court need to ask the state why it ’s do it   and if the state do not have a good reason it should be strike down   that be the core principle as apply to this case

 now the court may decide that if it do not apply in this case it probably can not apply in any case   there ’ no good reason for it   if i be on the court that would probably be the view that i ’d put forward   but i ’m not a judge i ’m the president   so the basic principle though be let ’s treat everybody fairly and let ’s treat everybody equally   and i think that the brief that be be present accurately reflect our view

 ari shapiro

 q     thank you mr. president   you say a few minute ago and you ’ve say repeatedly that the country have to stop careen from crisis to crisis

 the president   right

 q     so with a few crisis behind we and a few more crisis ahead of we take a step back from this specific debate over the sequester how as the leader of this country do you plan to stop the country from careen from crisis to crisis

 the president   well a couple of thing   number one be to make sure that we keep make progress wherever we can on thing that be important to middle class americans and those who be fight to get into the middle class   so if you set aside budget fight for a second we ’ve be able to get now the violence against women act do   the conversation that be take place on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform be move forward   we ’ve see great interest in a bipartisan fashion around how we can continue to improve our education system include around early childhood education   there have be constructive discussion around how do we reduce gun violence

 and what i ’m go to keep on try to do be to make sure that we push on those thing that be important to family   and we will not get everything do all at once but we can get a lot do   so that be point number one

 with respect to the budget what i ’ve do be to make a case to the american people that we have to make sure that we have a balanced approach to deficit reduction but that deficit reduction alone be not an economic policy   and part of the challenge that we ’ve have here be that not only congress but i think washington generally spend all its time together about deficit and do not spend a lot of time talk about how do we create job   so i want to make sure that we be talk about both

 i think that for example we could put a lot of people back to work right now rebuild our road and bridge   and this be defer maintenance   we know we be go to have to do it   and i go to a bridge that connect mitch mcconnell 's state to john boehner 's state and it be a rotten bridge and everybody know it   and i will bet they really want to see that improve   well how do we do it   let us have a conversation about it   that will create job   it will be good for business reduce commuter time improve commuter safety   that have to be part of this conversation not just this constant argument about cut and spending

 so i guess my point be ari that what i want to try to do be to make sure that we be constantly focus that our true north be on how be we help american family succeed   deficit reduction be part of that agenda and an important part   but it be not the only part   and i do not want we to be paralyze on everything just because we disagree on this one thing

 and as i already say to jessica what i be also hope be be that over time perhaps after republicans step back and maybe they can say you know what we stick tough on the sequester and this make we feel good and the republican caucus be in a well mood when they come back maybe then we can have a more serious discussion about what the real problem on deficit and deficit reduction be

 and the good thing about america be that sometimes we get to these bottleneck and we get stick and you have these sharp partisan fight but the american people pretty steadily be common sense and practical and eventually that common sense practical approach win out   and i think that be what will happen here as well

 and in the meantime just to make the final point about the sequester we will get through this   this be not go to be a apocalypse i think as some people have say   it be just dumb   and it be go to hurt   it be go to hurt individual people and it be go to hurt the economy overall

 but if congress come to its sense a week from now a month from now three month from now then there be a lot of open running room there for we to grow our economy much more quickly and to advance the agenda of the american people dramatically   so this be a temporary stop on what i believe be the long term outstanding prospect for american growth and greatness

 thank you very much

thank you   applause   thank you so much well it be a great honor to be with you here in jerusalem and i ’m so grateful for the welcome that i ’ve receive from the people of israel   thank you   applause   i bring with i the support of the american people applause and the friendship that bind we together   applause

 but what i ’ve most look forward to be the ability to speak directly to you the israeli people especially so many young people who be here today applause to talk about the history that bring we here today and the future that you will make in the year to come

 now i know that in israel ’s vibrant democracy every word every gesture be carefully scrutinize   laughter   but i want to clear something up just so you know any drama between i and my friend bibi over the year be just a plot to create material for eretz nehederet   applause   that ’s the only thing that be go on   we just want to make sure the writer have good material   laughter

 i also know that i come to israel on the eve of a sacred holiday the celebration of passover   and that be where i would like to begin today

 just a few day from now jews here in israel and around the world will sit with family and friend at the seder table and celebrate with song wine and symbolic food   after enjoy seders with family and friend in chicago and on the campaign trail i ’m proud that i have now bring this tradition into the white house   applause   i do so because i want my daughter to experience the haggadah and the story at the center of passover that make this time of year so powerful

 it ’ a story of century of slavery and year of wander in the desert a story of perseverance amidst persecution and faith in god and the torah   it ’ a story about find freedom in your own land   and for the jewish people this story be central to who you ’ve become   but it ’ also a story that hold within it the universal human experience with all of its suffering but also all of its salvation

 it ’ a part of the three great religion judaism christianity and islam that trace their origin to abraham and see jerusalem as sacred   and it ’ a story that ’s inspire community across the globe include i and my fellow americans

 in the united states a nation make up of people who cross ocean to start anew we ’re naturally draw to the idea of find freedom in our land   to african americans the story of the exodus be perhaps the central story the most powerful image about emerge from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity a tale that be carry from slavery through the civil rights movement into today

 for generation this promise help people weather poverty and persecution while hold on to the hope that a well day be on the horizon   for i personally grow up in far fling part of the world and without firm root the story speak to a yearning within every human be for a home   applause

 of course even as we draw strength from the story of god ’s will and his gift of freedom express on passover we also know that here on earth we must bear our responsibility in an imperfect world   that mean accept our measure of sacrifice and struggle just like previous generation   it mean we work through generation after generation on behalf of that ideal of freedom

 as dr. martin luther king say on the day before he be kill i may not get there with you   but i want you to know that we as a people will get to the promise land   applause   so just as joshua carry on after moses the work go on for all of you the joshua generation for justice and dignity for opportunity and freedom

 for the jewish people the journey to the promise of the state of israel wind through countless generation   it involve century of suffering and exile prejudice and pogrom and even genocide   through it all the jewish people sustain their unique identity and tradition as well as a longing to return home   and while jews achieve extraordinary success in many part of the world the dream of true freedom finally find its full expression in the zionist idea to be a free people in your homeland   that ’ why i believe that israel be root not just in history and tradition but also in a simple and profound idea the idea that people deserve to be free in a land of their own   applause

 over the last 65 year when israel have be at its good israelis have demonstrate that responsibility do not end when you reach the promise land it only begin   and so israel have be a refuge for the diaspora welcome jews from europe from the former soviet union from ethiopia from north africa   applause

 israel have build a prosperous nation through kibbutzeem that make the desert bloom business that broaden the middle class innovator who reach new frontier from the small microchip to the orbit of space   israel have establish a thriving democracy with a spirited civil society and proud political party and a tireless free press and a lively public debate lively may even be an understatement   applause

 and israel have achieve all this even as it ’s overcome relentless threat to its security through the courage of the israel defense forces and the citizenry that be so resilient in the face of terror

 this be the story of israel   this be the work that have bring the dream of so many generation to life   and every step of the way israel have build unbreakable bond of friendship with my country the united states of america   applause

 those tie begin only 11 minute after israeli independence when the united states be the first nation to recognize the state of israel   applause   as president truman say in explain his decision to recognize israel he say i believe it have a glorious future before it not just as another sovereign nation but as an embodiment of the great ideal of our civilization   and since then we ’ve build a friendship that advance our share interest

 together we share a commitment to security for our citizen and the stability of the middle east and north africa   together we share a focus on advance economic growth around the globe and strengthen the middle class within our own country   together we share a stake in the success of democracy

 but the source of our friendship extend beyond mere interest just as it have transcend political party and individual leader   america be a nation of immigrant   america be strengthen by diversity   america be enrich by faith   we be govern not simply by man and woman but by law   we be fuel by entrepreneurship and innovation and we be define by a democratic discourse that allow each generation to reimagine and renew our union once more   so in israel we see value that we share even as we recognize what make we different   that be an essential part of our bond

 now i stand here today mindful that for both our nation these be some complicated time   we have difficult issue to work through within our own country and we face danger and upheaval around the world   and when i look at young people within the united states i think about the choice that they must make in their life to define who we will be as a nation in this 21st century particularly as we emerge from two war and the bad recession since the great depression   but part of the reason i like talk to young people be because no matter how great the challenge be their idealism their energy their ambition always give i hope   applause

 and i see the same spirit in the young people here today   applause   i believe that you will shape our future   and give the tie between our country i believe your future be bind to ours   audience interruption

   no no this be part of the lively debate that we talk about   applause   this be good   you know i have to say we actually arrange for that because it make i feel at home   laughter   i would not feel comfortable if i do not have at least one heckler   laughter

 i ’d like to focus on how we and when i say we in particular young people can work together to make progress in three area that will define our time security peace and prosperity   applause

 let i begin with security   i be proud that the security relationship between the united states and israel have never be strong   never   applause   more exercise between our military more exchange among our political and military and intelligence official than ever before the large program to date to help you retain your qualitative military edge   these be the fact   these be not my opinion these be fact   but to i this be not simply measure on a balance sheet   i know that here in israel security be something personal

 here be what i think about when i consider these issue   when i consider israel ’s security i think about child like osher twito who i meet in sderot applause child the same age as my own daughter who go to bed at night fearful that a rocket would land in their bedroom simply because of who they be and where they live   applause

 that reality be why we ’ve invest in the iron dome system to save countless life because those child deserve to sleep well at night   applause   that ’ why we ’ve make it clear time and again that israel can not accept rocket attack from gaza and we have stand up for israel ’s right to defend itself   applause   and that ’ why israel have a right to expect hamas to renounce violence and recognize israel ’s right to exist applause

 when i think about israel ’s security i think about five israelis who board a bus in bulgaria who be blow up because of where they come from rob of the ability to live and love and raise family   that ’ why every country that value justice should call hizbollah what it truly be a terrorist organization   applause   because the world can not tolerate an organization that murder innocent civilian stockpile rocket to shoot at city and support the massacre of man and woman and child in syria right now   applause

 the fact that hizbollah ’s ally the assad regime have stockpile of chemical weapon only heighten the urgency   we will continue to cooperate closely to guard against that danger i ’ve make it clear to bashar al assad and all who follow his order   we will not tolerate the use of chemical weapon against the syrian people or the transfer of those weapon to terrorist   the world be watch we will hold you accountable applause

 the syrian people have the right to be free from the grip of a dictator who would rather kill his own people than relinquish power   applause   assad must go so that syria ’s future can begin   because true stability in syria depend upon establish a government that be responsible to its people one that protect all community within its border while make peace with country beyond they

 these be the thing i think about when i think about israel ’s security   when i consider israel ’s security i also think about a people who have a live memory of the holocaust face with the prospect of a nuclear armed iranian government that have call for israel ’s destruction   it ’ no wonder israelis view this as an existential threat   but this be not simply a challenge for israel it be a danger for the entire world include the united states   applause   a nuclear armed iran would raise the risk of nuclear terrorism   it would undermine the non proliferation regime   it would spark an arm race in a volatile region   and it would embolden a government that have show no respect for the right of its own people or the responsibility of nation

 that ’ why america have build a coalition to increase the cost to iran of fail to meet their obligation   the iranian government be now under more pressure than ever before and that pressure be increase   it be isolate   its economy be in dire strait   its leadership be divide   and its position in the region and the world have only grow weak   applause

 i do believe that all of we have an interest in resolve this issue peacefully   applause   strong and principled diplomacy be the good way to ensure that the iranian government forsake nuclear weapon   applause   peace be far more preferable to war   and the inevitable cost the unintended consequence that would come with war mean that we have to do everything we can to try to resolve this diplomatically   because of the cooperation between our government we know that there remain time to pursue a diplomatic resolution   that ’ what america will do with clear eye work with a world that ’ unite and with the sense of urgency that ’s require

 but iran must know this time be not unlimited   and i ’ve make the position of the united states of america clear   iran must not get a nuclear weapon   this be not a danger that can be contain and as president i ’ve say all option be on the table for achieve our objective   america will do what we must to prevent a nuclear arm iran   applause

 for young israelis i know that these issue of security be root in an experience that be even more fundamental than the press threat of the day   you live in a neighborhood where many of your neighbor have reject the right of your nation to exist   your grandparent have to risk their life and all that they have to make a place for themselves in this world   your parent live through war after war to ensure the survival of the jewish state   your child grow up know that people they ’ve never meet may hate they because of who they be in a region that be full of turmoil and change underneath your foot

 so that ’ what i think about when israel be face with these challenge that sense of an israel that be surround by many in this region who still reject it and many in the world who refuse to accept it   and that ’ why the security of the jewish people in israel be so important   it can not be take for grant

 but make no mistake those who adhere to the ideology of reject israel ’s right to exist they might as well reject the earth beneath they or the sky above because israel be not go anywhere   applause   and today i want to tell you particularly the young people so that there be no mistake here so long as there be a united states of america atem lo levad you be not alone   applause

 the question be what kind of future israel will look forward to   israel be not go anywhere but especially for the young people in this audience the question be what do its future hold   and that bring i to the subject of peace   applause

 i know israel have take risk for peace   brave leader menachem begin yitzhak rabin reach treaty with two of your neighbor   you make credible proposal to the palestinians at annapolis   you withdraw from gaza and lebanon and then face terror and rocket   across the region you ’ve extend a hand of friendship and all too often you ’ve be confront with rejection and in some case the ugly reality of anti semitism so i believe that the israeli people do want peace and i also understand why too many israelis maybe an increase number maybe a lot of young people here today be skeptical that it can be achieve

 but today israel be at a crossroad   it can be tempting to put aside the frustration and sacrifice that come with the pursuit of peace particularly when iron dome repel rocket barrier keep out suicide bomber   there be so many other press issue that demand your attention   and i know that only israelis can make the fundamental decision about your country ’s future   applause   i recognize that

 i also know by the way that not everyone in this hall will agree with what i have to say about peace   i recognize that there be those who be not simply skeptical about peace but question its underlie premise have a different vision for israel 's future   and that ’ part of a democracy   that be part of the discourse between our two country   i recognize that   but i also believe it be important to be open and honest especially with your friend   i also believe that   applause

 politically give the strong bipartisan support for israel in america the easy thing for i to do would be to put this issue aside just express unconditional support for whatever israel decide to do that would be the easy political path but i want you to know that i speak to you as a friend who be deeply concerned and commit to your future and i ask you to consider three point

 first peace be necessary   applause   i believe that   i believe that peace be the only path to true security   applause   you have the opportunity to be the generation that permanently secure the zionist dream or you can face a grow challenge to its future   give the demographic west of the jordan river the only way for israel to endure and thrive as a jewish and democratic state be through the realization of an independent and viable palestine   applause   that be true

 there be other factor involve   give the frustration in the international community about this conflict israel need to reverse an undertow of isolation   and give the march of technology the only way to truly protect the israeli people over the long term be through the absence of war   because no wall be high enough and no iron dome be strong enough or perfect enough to stop every enemy that be intent on do so from inflict harm   applause

 and this truth be more pronounced give the change sweep the arab world   i understand that with the uncertainty in the region people in the street change in leadership the rise of non secular party in politic it be tempting to turn inward because the situation outside of israel seem so chaotic but this be precisely the time to respond to the wave of revolution with a resolve and commitment for peace   applause because as more government respond to popular will the day when israel could seek peace simply with a handful of autocratic leader those day be over   peace will have to be make among people not just government   applause

 no one no single step can change overnight what lie in the heart and mind of million   no single step be go to erase year of history and propaganda   but progress with the palestinians be a powerful way to begin while sidelining extremist who thrive on conflict and thrive on division   it would make a difference   applause

 so peace be necessary   but peace be also just   peace be also just   there be no question that israel have face palestinian faction who turn to terror leader who miss historic opportunity   that be all true   and that ’ why security must be at the center of any agreement   and there be no question that the only path to peace be through negotiation which be why despite the criticism we ’ve receive the united states will oppose unilateral effort to bypass negotiation through the united nations   it have to be do by the party   applause   but the palestinian people ’ right to self determination their right to justice must also be recognize   applause

 put yourself in their shoe   look at the world through their eye   it be not fair that a palestinian child can not grow up in a state of their own   applause   live their entire life with the presence of a foreign army that control the movement not just of those young people but their parent their grandparent every single day   it ’ not just when settler violence against palestinians go unpunished   applause   it ’ not right to prevent palestinians from farm their land or restrict a student ’s ability to move around the west bank or displace palestinian family from their home   applause   neither occupation nor expulsion be the answer   applause   just as israelis build a state in their homeland palestinians have a right to be a free people in their own land   applause

 i ’m go off script here for a second but before i come here i meet with a group of young palestinians from the age of 15 to 22   and talk to they they be n’t that different from my daughter   they be n’t that different from your daughter or son   i honestly believe that if any israeli parent sit down with those kid they ’d say i want these kid to succeed i want they to prosper   applause   i want they to have opportunity just like my kid do   i believe that ’ what israeli parent would want for these kid if they have a chance to listen to they and talk to they   applause   i believe that

 now only you can determine what kind of democracy you will have   but remember that as you make these decision you will define not simply the future of your relationship with the palestinians you will define the future of israel as well   applause

 as ariel sharon say i be quote he it be impossible to have a jewish democratic state at the same time to control all of eretz israel   if we insist on fulfil the dream in its entirety we be liable to lose it all   applause   or from a different perspective i think of what the novelist david grossman say shortly after lose his son as he describe the necessity of peace a peace of no choice he say must be approach with the same determination and creativity as one approach a war of no choice   applause

 now israel can not be expect to negotiate with anyone who be dedicate to its destruction   applause   but while i know you have have difference with the palestinian authority i genuinely believe that you do have a true partner in president abbas and prime minister fayyad   applause   i believe that   and they have a track record to prove it   over the last few year they have build institution and maintain security on the west bank in way that few could have imagine just a few year ago   so many palestinians include young people have reject violence as a means of achieve their aspiration

 there be an opportunity there there ’ a window which bring i to my third point   peace be possible   it be possible applause   i be not say it be guarantee   i can not even say that it be more likely than not   but it be possible   i know it do not seem that way   there be always go to be reason to avoid risk   there be cost for failure   there will always be extremist who provide an excuse not to act

 i know there must be something exhausting about endless talk about talk and daily controversy and just the grind status quo   and i be sure there be a temptation just to say ah enough   let i focus on my small corner of the world and my family and my job and what i can control   but it be possible

 negotiation will be necessary but there be little secret about where they must lead two state for two people   two state for two people   applause

 there will be difference about how to get there   there be go to be hard choice along the way   arab state must adapt to a world that have change   the day when they could condemn israel to distract their people from a lack of opportunity or government corruption or mismanagement those day need to be over   applause   now be the time for the arab world to take step toward normalizing relation with israel   applause

 meanwhile palestinians must recognize that israel will be a jewish state and that israelis have the right to insist upon their security   applause   israelis must recognize that continue settlement activity be counterproductive to the cause of peace and that an independent palestine must be viable with real border that have to be draw   applause

 i ’ve suggest principle on territory and security that i believe can be the basis for these talk   but for the moment put aside the plan and the process   i ask you instead to think about what can be do to build trust between people

 four year ago i stand in cairo in front of an audience of young people politically religiously they must seem a world away   but the thing they want they ’re not so different from what the young people here want   they want the ability to make their own decision and to get an education get a good job to worship god in their own way to get marry to raise a family the same be true of those young palestinians that i meet with this morning   the same be true for young palestinians who yearn for a well life in gaza

 that be where peace begin not just in the plan of leader but in the heart of people   not just in some carefully design process but in the daily connection that sense of empathy that take place among those who live together in this land and in this sacred city of jerusalem   applause

 and let i say this as a politician i can promise you this political leader will never take risk if the people do not push they to take some risk   you must create the change that you want to see   applause   ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary thing

 i know this be possible   look to the bridge be build in business and civil society by some of you here today   look at the young people who ’ve not yet learn a reason to mistrust or those young people who ’ve learn to overcome a legacy of mistrust that they inherit from their parent because they simply recognize that we hold more hope in common than fear that drive we apart   your voice must be loud than those who would drown out hope   your hope must light the way forward

 look to a future in which jews and muslims and christians can all live in peace and great prosperity in this holy land   applause   believe in that   and most of all look to the future that you want for your own child a future in which a jewish democratic vibrant state be protect and accept for this time and for all time   applause

 there will be many who say this change be not possible but remember this israel be the most powerful country in this region   israel have the unshakeable support of the most powerful country in the world   applause   israel be not go anywhere israel have the wisdom to see the world as it be but this be in your nature israel also have the courage to see the world as it should be   applause

 ben gurion once say in israel in order to be a realist you must believe in miracle   sometimes the great miracle be recognize that the world can change   that be a lesson that the world have learn from the jewish people

 and that bring i to the final area that i will focus on prosperity and israel ’s broad role in the world   i know that all the talk about security and peace can sometimes seem to dominate the headline but that be not where people live   and every day even amidst the threat that you face israelis be define themselves by the opportunity that you be create
 through talent and hard work israelis have put this small country at the forefront of the global economy

 israelis understand the value of education and have produce 10 nobel laureate   applause   israelis understand the power of invention and your university educate engineer and inventor   and that spirit have lead to economic growth and human progress solar power and electric car bandage and prosthetic limb that save life stem cell research and new drug that treat disease cell phone and computer technology that change the way people around the world live

 so if people want to see the future of the world economy they should look at tel aviv home to hundred of start up and research center   applause   israelis be so active on social medium that every day seem to bring a different facebook campaign about where i should give this speech   laughter and applause

 that innovation be just as important to the relationship between the united states and israel as our security cooperation our first free trade agreement in the world be reach with israel nearly three decade ago   applause   today the trade between our two country be at $ 40 billion every year   applause   more importantly that partnership be create new product and medical treatment it ’s push new frontier of science and exploration

 that ’ the kind of relationship that israel should have and could have with every country in the world   already we see how that innovation could reshape this region   there ’ a program here in jerusalem that bring together young israelis and palestinians to learn vital skill in technology and business   an israeli and palestinian have start a venture capital fund to finance palestinian start up   over 100 high tech company have find a home on the west bank which speak to the talent and entrepreneurial spirit of the palestinian people

 one of the great irony of what ’s happen in the broad region be that so much of what people be yearn for education entrepreneurship the ability to start a business without pay a bribe the ability to connect to the global economy those be thing that can be find here in israel this should be a hub for thrive regional trade and an engine for opportunity   applause

 israel be already a center for innovation that help power the global economy   and i believe that all of that potential for prosperity can be enhance with great security enhance with last peace   applause

 here in this small strip of land that have be the center of so much of the world ’s history so much triumph and so much tragedy israelis have build something that few could have imagine 65 year ago   tomorrow i will pay tribute to that history at the grave of herzl a man who have the foresight to see the future of the jewish people have to be reconnecte to their past at the grave of rabin who understand that israel ’s victory in war have to be follow by the battle for peace at yad vashem where the world be remind of the cloud of evil that can descend on the jewish people and all of humanity if we ever fail to be vigilant

 we bear all that history on our shoulder   we carry all that history in our heart   today as we face the twilight of israel ’s found generation you the young people of israel
 must now claim its future   it fall to you to write the next chapter in the great story of this great nation

 and as the president of a country that you can count on as your great friend applause i be confident that you can help we find the promise in the day that lie ahead   and as a man who ’s be inspire in my own life by that timeless call within the jewish experience tikkun olam applause i be hopeful that we can draw upon what ’s good in ourselves to meet the challenge that will come to win the battle for peace in the wake of so much war and to do the work of repair this world   applause   that ’s your job   that ’ my job   that ’ the task of all of we

 so every family in this state be shake by the tragedy of that morning   every family in this country be shake   we hug our kid more tightly   we ask what could we do as a society to help prevent a tragedy like that from happen again

 and as a society we decide that we have to change   we must   we must change   applause

 i notice that nicole and other refer to that day as 12/14   for these family it be a day that change everything   and i know many of you in newtown wonder if the rest of we would live up to the promise we make in those dark day if we ’d change too or if once the television truck leave once the candle flicker out once the teddy bear be carefully gather up that the country would somehow move on to other thing

 over the weekend i hear francine wheeler who lose her son ben that day say that the four month since the tragedy might feel like a brief moment for some but for she it feel like it ’s be year since she see ben   and she ’s determine not to let what happen that day just fade away   we ’re not go anywhere she say   we be here   and we be go to be here   and i know that she speak for everybody in newtown everybody who be impact

 we can not forget   your family still grieve in way most of we can not comprehend   but so many of you have use that grief to make a difference not just to honor your own child but to protect the life of all of our child   so many of you have mobilize and organize and petitioned your elect official with love and logic as nicole put it as citizen determine to right something go wrong

 and last week here in connecticut your elect leader respond   the connecticut legislature lead by many of the legislator here today pass new measure to protect more of our child and our community from gun violence   and governor malloy sign that legislation into law   applause

 so i want to be clear   you the family of newtown people across connecticut you help make that happen   your voice your determination make that happen   obviously the elect leader do an extraordinary job move it forward but it could not have happen if they be not hear from people in their respective district people all across the state   that be the power of your voice

 and by the way connecticut be not alone   in the past few month new york colorado maryland have all pass new common sense gun safety reform as well   applause

 these be all state that share an awful familiarity with gun violence whether it ’ the horror of mass killing or the street crime that ’s too common in too many neighborhood   all of these state also share a strong tradition of hunting and sport shooting and gun ownership   it ’s be a part of the fabric of people ’s life for generation   and every single one of those state include here in connecticut decide that yes we can protect more of our citizen from gun violence while still protect our second amendment right   those two thing do not contradict each other   applause   we can pass common sense law that protect our kid and protect our right

 so connecticut have show the way   and now be the time for congress to do the same   applause   now be the time for congress to do the same   this week be the time for congress to do the same   applause

 now back in january just a few month after the tragedy in newtown i announce a series of executive action to reduce gun violence and keep our kid safe   and i put forward common sense proposal much like those that pass here in connecticut for congress to consider   and you will remember in my state of the union address i urge congress to give those proposal a vote   and that moment be now

 as soon as this week congress will begin debate these common sense proposal to reduce gun violence   your senator dick blumenthal and chris murphy they be here applause your representatives john larson rosa delauro elizabeth esty jim hines joe courtney they be all push to pass this legislation   applause   but much of congress be go to only act if they hear from you the american people   so here ’ what we have to do

 audience member   i love you mr. president

 the president   i appreciate that   laughter   here be what we have get to do   we have to tell congress it ’ time to require a background check for anyone who want to buy a gun so that people who be dangerous to themselves and other can not get their hand on a gun   let ’s make that happen   applause

 we have to tell congress it ’ time to crack down on gun trafficking so that folk will think twice before buy a gun as part of a scheme to arm someone who will not pass a background check   let ’s get that do   applause

 we have to tell congress it ’ time to restore the ban on military style assault weapon and a 10 round limit for magazine to make it hard for a gunman to fire 154 bullet into his victim in less than five minute   let ’s put that to a vote   applause

 we have to tell congress it ’ time to strengthen school safety and help people struggle with mental health problem get the treatment they need before it ’ too late   let ’s do that for our kid and for our community   applause

 now i know that some of these proposal inspire more debate than other but each of they have the support of the majority of the american people   all of they be common sense   all of they deserve a vote   all of they deserve a vote   applause

 consider background check   over the past 20 year background check have keep more than 2 million dangerous people from get their hand on a gun   a group of police officer in colorado tell i last week that thank to background check they ’ve be able to stop convict murderer folk under restrain order for commit violent domestic abuse from buy a gun   in some case they ’ve actually arrest the person as they be come to purchase the gun

 so we know that background check can work   but the problem be loophole in the current law let so many people avoid background check altogether   that ’ not safe   it do not make sense   if you ’re a law abide citizen and you go through a background check to buy a gun would not you expect other people to play by the same rule   applause

 if you ’re a law abide gun seller would not you want to know you ’re not sell your gun to someone who ’s likely to commit a crime   applause   should not we make it hard not easy for somebody who be convict of domestic abuse to get his hand on a gun   applause

 it turn out 90 percent of americans think so   ninety percent of americans support universal background check   think about that   how often do 90 percent of americans agree on anything   laughter   and yet 90 percent agree on this republicans democrats folk who own gun folk who do n’t own gun 80 percent of republicans more than 80 percent of gun owner more than 70 percent of nra household   it be common sense

 and yet there be only one thing that can stand in the way of change that just about everybody agree on and that ’s politic in washington   you would think that with those number congress would rush to make this happen   that be what you would think   applause   if our democracy be work the way it ’s suppose to and 90 percent of the american people agree on something in the wake of a tragedy you ’d think this would not be a heavy lift

 and yet some folk back in washington be already float the idea that they may use political stunt to prevent vote on any of these reform   think about that   they ’re not just say they ’ll vote no on idea that almost all americans support   they ’re say they ’ll do everything they can to even prevent any vote on these provision   they ’re say your opinion do not matter   and that ’s not right

 audience   booo

 the president   that be not right

 audience   we want a vote

 the president   we need a vote

 audience   we want a vote   we want a vote

 the president   we need a vote

 audience   we want a vote

 the president   now i ’ve also hear some in the washington press suggest that what happen to gun violence legislation in congress this week will either be a political victory or defeat for i   connecticut this be not about i   this be not about politic   this be about do the right thing for all the family who be here that have be tear apart by gun violence   applause   it ’ about they and all the family go forward so we can prevent this from happen again   that ’ what it ’ about   it ’ about the law enforcement official put their life at risk   that ’ what this be about   this be not about politic   applause   this be not about politic

 this be about these family and family all across the country who be say let ’s make it a little hard for our kid to get gun down

 when i say in my state of the union address that these proposal deserve a vote that family of newtown and aurora and tucson and a former member of congress gabby giffords that they all deserve a vote virtually every member of that chamber stand up and applaud   and now they ’re go to start deny your family a vote when the camera be off and when the lobbyist have work what they do   you deserve well than that   you deserve a vote

 now look we know from the beginning of this debate that change would not be easy   we know that there would be powerful interest that be very good at confuse the subject that be good at amplify conflict and extreme that be good at drown out rational debate good at gin up irrational fear all of which stand in the way of progress

 but if our history teach we anything then it ’ up to we the people to stand up to those who say we can n’t or we will n’t stand up for the change that we need   and i believe that that ’ what the american people be look for

 when i first run for this office i say that i do not believe the country be as divide as our politic would suggest and i still believe that   applause   i know sometimes when you watch cable news or talk radio or you browse the internet you ’d think man everybody just hate each other everybody be just at each other ’s throat   but that ’ not how most americans think about these issue   there be good people on both side of every issue

 so if we ’re go to move forward we can not just talk past one another   we ’ve get to listen to one another   that ’ what governor malloy and all these legislative leader do   that ’ why they be able to pass bipartisan legislation   applause

 i ’ve get stack of letter from gun owner who want i to know that they care passionately about their right to bear arm do not want they infringe upon and i appreciate every one of those letter   i ’ve learn from they   but a lot of those letter what they ’ve also say be they ’re not just gun owner they ’re also parent or police officer or veteran and they agree that we can not stand by and keep let these tragedy happen that with our right come some responsibility and obligation to our community and ourselves and most of all to our child   we can not just think about us we ’ve get to think about we the people

 i be in colorado   i tell a story about michelle   she come back from a trip to rural iowa we be out there campaign   sometimes it would be mile between farm let alone town   and she say you know come back i can understand why somebody would want a gun for protection   if somebody drive up into the driveway and barack you be not home the sheriff live mile away i might want that security   so she can understand what it might be like in term of somebody want that kind of security

 on the other hand i also talk to a hunter last week who say all my experience with gun have be positive but i also realize that for other all their experience with gun have be negative

 and when he say that i think about the mom i meet from suburban chicago whose son be kill in a random shooting   and this mom tell i i hate it when people tell i that my son be in the wrong place at the wrong time   he be on his way to school   he be exactly where he be suppose to be   he be in the right place at the right time and he still get shoot   applause

 the kid at sandy hook be where they be suppose to be   so be those moviegoer in aurora   so be those worshipper in oak creek   so be gabby giffords   she be at a supermarket listen to the concern of her constituent   applause   they be exactly where they be suppose to be   they be also exercise their right to assemble peaceably to worship freely and safely   they be exercise the right of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness   so surely we can reconcile those two thing   surely america do not have to be divide between rural and urban and democrat and republican when it come to something like this

 if you ’re an american who want to do something to prevent more family from know the immeasurable anguish that these family here have know then we have to act   now be the time to get engage   now be the time to get involve   now be the time to push back on fear and frustration and misinformation   now be the time for everybody to make their voice hear from every state house to the corridor of congress

 and i ’m ask everyone listen today find out where your member of congress stand on this   if they ’re not part of the 90 percent of americans who agree on background check then ask they why not   why would not you want to make it easy for law enforcement to do their job   why would not you want to make it hard for a dangerous person to get his or her hand on a gun   what ’ more important to you   our child or an a grade from the gun lobby   applause

 i ’ve hear nicole talk about what her life have be like since dylan be take from she in december   and one thing she say strike i   she say every night i beg for he to come to i in my dream so that i can see he again   and during the day i just focus on what i need to do to honor he and make change   now if nicole can summon the courage to do that how can the rest of we do any less   applause   how can we do any less

 if there be even one thing we can do to protect our kid do n’t we have an obligation to try   if there be even one step we can take to keep somebody from murder dozen of innocent in the span of minute should not we be take that step   applause   if there be just one thing we can do to keep one father from have to bury his child be n’t that worth fight for

 i have get to tell you i have have tough day in the presidency i have say this before   the day newtown happen be the tough day of my presidency   but i have get to tell you if we do not respond to this that will be a tough day for i too   applause   because we have get to expect more from ourselves and we have get to expect more from congress   we have get to believe that every once in a while we set politic aside and we just do what be right   applause   we have get to believe that

 and if you believe that i be ask you to stand up   applause   if you believe in the right to bear arm like i do but think we should prevent an irresponsible few from inflict harm stand up   stand up   applause

 if you believe that the family of newtown and aurora and tucson and virginia tech and the thousand of americans who have be gun down in the last four month deserve a vote we all have to stand up   applause

      if you want the people you send to washington to have just an iota of the courage that the educator at sandy hook show when danger arrive on their doorstep then we ’re all go to have to stand up

      and if we do if we come together and raise our voice together and demand this change together i ’m convince cooperation and common sense will prevail   we will find sensible intelligent way to make this country strong and safe for our child   applause

      so let ’s do the right thing   let ’s do right by our kid   let ’s do right by these family   let ’s get this do   connecticut thank you   god bless you   god bless the united states of america   applause

i want to come out here first of all to tell you that jay be prepared for all your question and be very much look forward to the session   the second thing be i want to let you know that over the next couple of week there ’s go to obviously be a whole range of issue immigration economic et cetera we will try to arrange a full press conference to address your question

 the reason i actually want to come out today be not to take question but to speak to an issue that obviously have get a lot of attention over the course of the last week the issue of the trayvon martin ruling   i give a preliminary statement right after the ruling on sunday   but watch the debate over the course of the last week i think it might be useful for i to expand on my thought a little bit

 first of all i want to make sure that once again i send my thought and prayer as well as michelle ’s to the family of trayvon martin and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which they ’ve deal with the entire situation   i can only imagine what they ’re go through and it ’ remarkable how they ’ve handle it

 the second thing i want to say be to reiterate what i say on sunday which be there ’s go to be a lot of argument about the legal issue in the case i will let all the legal analyst and talk head address those issue   the judge conduct the trial in a professional manner   the prosecution and the defense make their argument   the jury be properly instruct that in a case such as this reasonable doubt be relevant and they render a verdict   and once the jury have speak that be how our system work   but i do want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have respond to it and how people be feel

 you know when trayvon martin be first shot i say that this could have be my son   another way of say that be trayvon martin could have be i 35 year ago   and when you think about why in the african american community at least there ’ a lot of pain around what happen here i think it ’ important to recognize that the african american community be look at this issue through a set of experience and a history that do not go away

 there be very few african american man in this country who have not have the experience of be follow when they be shop in a department store   that include i   there be very few african american man who have not have the experience of walk across the street and hear the lock click on the door of car   that happen to i at least before i be a senator   there be very few african americans who have not have the experience of get on an elevator and a woman clutch her purse nervously and hold her breath until she have a chance to get off   that happen often

 and i do not want to exaggerate this but those set of experience inform how the african american community interpret what happen one night in florida   and it ’ inescapable for people to bring those experience to bear   the african american community be also knowledgeable that there be a history of racial disparity in the application of our criminal law everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug law   and that end up have an impact in term of how people interpret the case

 now this be not to say that the african american community be naïve about the fact that african american young man be disproportionately involve in the criminal justice system that they ’re disproportionately both victim and perpetrator of violence   it ’ not to make excuse for that fact although black folk do interpret the reason for that in a historical context   they understand that some of the violence that take place in poor black neighborhood around the country be bear out of a very violent past in this country and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those community can be trace to a very difficult history

 and so the fact that sometimes that ’s unacknowledged add to the frustration   and the fact that a lot of african american boy be paint with a broad brush and the excuse be give well there be these statistic out there that show that african american boy be more violent use that as an excuse to then see son treat differently cause pain

 i think the african american community be also not naïve in understand that statistically somebody like trayvon martin be statistically more likely to be shoot by a peer than he be by somebody else   so folk understand the challenge that exist for african american boy   but they get frustrate i think if they feel that there ’ no context for it and that context be be deny and that all contribute i think to a sense that if a white male teen be involve in the same kind of scenario that from top to bottom both the outcome and the aftermath might have be different

 now the question for i at least and i think for a lot of folk be where do we take this   how do we learn some lesson from this and move in a positive direction   i think it ’ understandable that there have be demonstration and vigil and protest and some of that stuff be just go to have to work its way through as long as it remain nonviolent   if i see any violence then i will remind folk that that dishonor what happen to trayvon martin and his family   but beyond protest or vigil the question be be there some concrete thing that we might be able to do

 i know that eric holder be review what happen down there but i think it ’ important for people to have some clear expectation here   traditionally these be issue of state and local government the criminal code   and law enforcement be traditionally do at the state and local level not at the federal level

 that do not mean though that as a nation we can not do some thing that i think would be productive   so let i just give a couple of specific that i ’m still bounce around with my staff so we ’re not roll out some five point plan but some area where i think all of we could potentially focus

 number one precisely because law enforcement be often determine at the state and local level i think it would be productive for the justice department governor mayor to work with law enforcement about training at the state and local level in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exist

 when i be in illinois i pass racial profiling legislation and it actually do just two simple thing   one it collect datum on traffic stop and the race of the person who be stop   but the other thing be it resource we train police department across the state on how to think about potential racial bias and way to far professionalize what they be do

 and initially the police department across the state be resistant but actually they come to recognize that if it be do in a fair straightforward way that it would allow they to do their job well and community would have more confidence in they and in turn be more helpful in apply the law   and obviously law enforcement have get a very tough job

 so that ’ one area where i think there be a lot of resource and good practice that could be bring to bear if state and local government be receptive   and i think a lot of they would be   and let us figure out be there way for we to push out that kind of training

 along the same line i think it would be useful for we to examine some state and local law to see if it if they be design in such a way that they may encourage the kind of altercation and confrontation and tragedy that we see in the florida case rather than diffuse potential altercation

 i know that there be be commentary about the fact that the stand your ground law in florida be not use as a defense in the case   on the other hand if we be send a message as a society in our community that someone who be arm potentially have the right to use those firearm even if there be a way for they to exit from a situation be that really go to be contribute to the kind of peace and security and order that we would like to see

 and for those who resist that idea that we should think about something like these stand your ground law i would just ask people to consider if trayvon martin be of age and arm could he have stand his ground on that sidewalk   and do we actually think that he would have be justify in shoot mr. zimmerman who have follow he in a car because he feel threaten   and if the answer to that question be at least ambiguous then it seem to i that we might want to examine those kind of law

 number three and this be a long term project we need to spend some time in think about how do we bolster and reinforce our african american boy   and this be something that michelle and i talk a lot about   there be a lot of kid out there who need help who be get a lot of negative reinforcement   and be there more that we can do to give they the sense that their country care about they and value they and be willing to invest in they

 i be not naïve about the prospect of some grand new federal program   i be not sure that that ’ what we be talk about here but i do recognize that as president i have get some convening power and there be a lot of good program that be be do across the country on this front   and for we to be able to gather together business leader and local elect official and clergy and celebrity and athlete and figure out how be we do a well job help young african american man feel that they be a full part of this society and that they have get pathway and avenue to succeed i think that would be a pretty good outcome from what be obviously a tragic situation   and we be go to spend some time work on that and think about that

 and then finally i think it be go to be important for all of we to do some soul search   there have be talk about should we convene a conversation on race   i have not see that be particularly productive when politician try to organize conversation   they end up be stilte and politicize and folk be lock into the position they already have   on the other hand in family and church and workplace there be the possibility that people be a little bit more honest and at least you ask yourself your own question about be i wring as much bias out of myself as i can   be i judge people as much as i can base on not the color of their skin but the content of their character   that would i think be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy

 and let i just leave you with a final thought that as difficult and challenging as this whole episode have be for a lot of people i do not want we to lose sight that thing be get well   each successive generation seem to be make progress in change attitude when it come to race   it do not mean we ’re in a post racial society   it do not mean that racism be eliminate   but when i talk to malia and sasha and i listen to their friend and i seem they interact they ’re well than we be they ’re well than we be on these issue   and that ’ true in every community that i ’ve visit all across the country

 and so we have to be vigilant and we have to work on these issue   and those of we in authority should be do everything we can to encourage the well angel of our nature as oppose to use these episode to heighten division   but we should also have confidence that kid these day i think have more sense than we do back then and certainly more than our parent do or our grandparent do and that along this long difficult journey we ’re become a more perfect union not a perfect union but a more perfect union

 thank you guy

hello warrensburg   applause   hello mules   applause   hello jennies   applause   well i know it ’ hot   laughter   that ’ why i take off my jacket   if you ’ve still get yours on feel free to take it off   it be great to be back in missouri   it ’ great to be back in the midwest   it ’ great to be here at ucm   applause

 i want to thank your outstanding president dr. chuck ambrose for have i here today   applause   give brian a big round of applause for the introduction   applause   you ’ve get your outstanding governor jay nixon in the house   applause   your mayor charlie rutt be here   applause   and i bring a special guest with i who be celebrate her birthday today your senator claire mccaskill   applause   i figure the least i could do be give she a ride on air force one for her birthday   laughter

 so we ’ve get mules in the house   we ’ve get jenny in the house   we ’ve get governor we ’ve get senator and now we ’ve probably get some very confused people watch at home because who be jennie   laughter

 i want to thank all the student who come out on a summer afternoon   i know that summer be especially a day as pretty as today it ’s tempting to be outside   i know class do not start for a few more week   you could be over on pine street beat the heat   applause   now that i think about it it may be good that you ’re here instead of get into trouble   laughter

 i ’ve just come from knox college in galesburg illinois where i give a pretty long speech on the economy   i will not repeat the whole thing here   applause   but what i do want to talk about today be what i ’ve talk about when i give my first big speech as a senator eight year ago and that ’ where we as a country need to go to give every american a chance to get ahead in the 21st century   and ucm understand how important that be   applause

 just a little context here in the period after world war ii you have a grow middle class that be the engine of our prosperity   the economy do well in part because everybody be participate   and whether you own a company or you sweep the floor of that company or you work anywhere in between america offer a basic bargain   if you work hard then you will be reward with fair wage and benefit   you ’ll have the chance to buy your own home   you ’ll have the chance to save for retirement   you ’ll have the protection of decent health insurance   but most of all you ’ll have the chance to pass on a well life to your kid

 and then what happen be that engine begin to stall   the bargain begin to fray   so technology make some job obsolete nobody go to a bank teller anymore   you want to schedule a trip somewhere you get online   global competition send some job overseas   when i be in galesburg we talk about the maytag plant that use to make household brand there and people thousand of people use to work in the plant and it go down to mexico   then washington dole out big tax cut to folk at the top income bracket small minimum wage increase for people who be struggle   you combine all this and the income of the top 1 percent quadruple from 1979 to 2007 but the typical family ’s income barely budge

 so a lot of middle class family begin to feel that the odd be stack against they and they be right   and then for a while this be kind of paper over because we have a housing bubble go on and everybody be maxe out on their credit card everybody be highly leveraged there be a lot of financial deal go around   and so it look like the economy be go to be do okay but then by the time i take office the bottom have fall out   and it cost as we know million of americans their job or their home or their saving   and that long term erosion of middle class security be evident for everybody to see

 now the good news be five year later five year after the crisis first hit america have fight its way back   so together we save an auto industry   we take on a broken health care system   we invest in new american technology to reverse our addiction to foreign oil   we double the production of clean energy   natural gas take off   we put in place tough new rule on big bank and mortgage lender and credit card company   we change the tax code so it be fair for middle class folk and do not just benefit folk at the very top like i   laughter   no it be true because thing be skew too much towards folk who be already bless already lucky   and you take all that together and now you add it all up

 what we have see be over the past 40 month our business have create more than 7.2 million new job   this year we be off to our strong private sector job growth since 1999   applause   our export have surge so we sell more product make in america to the rest of the world than ever before   applause   we produce more natural gas than any country on earth   we ’re about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from overseas and that be the first time that be happen in nearly 20 year   applause   the cost of health care be grow at its slow rate in 50 year so we be slow the growth of health care cost   applause   and our deficit be fall at the fast rate in 60 year   applause   deficit have be cut by almost half from the time i take office

 so we do this together because americans be gritty and resilient and work hard   we have be able to clear away the rubble of the financial crisis   we be start to lay a new foundation for more durable economic growth   and with the new revolution in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care we be actually poise we be in a position to reverse all those force that batter middle class family for too long   we can start build now an economy where everybody who work hard can get ahead   that be all good   that be the good news

 but missouri i ’m here to tell you what you already know which be we be not there yet   in some way the trend that have be build for decade this winner take all economy where a few do well and well but everybody else just tread water all those trend be make bad by the recession   and reverse these trend have to be washington ’s number one priority   applause   it have to be washington 's number one priority   applause

 put people back to work make sure the economy be work for everybody build the middle class make sure they be secure that be my high priority   that be what i be interested in   applause   because when the economy be work for middle class family it solve an awful lot of other problem   now the poor start have ladder of opportunity they can climb into if they work hard   a lot of the social tension be reduce because everybody be feel pretty good

 now unfortunately over the past couple of year in particular washington have not just ignore this problem they have actually make it bad   and i be interested in work with everybody and there be a bunch of not just democrats but also republicans who recognize that washington be not work   but we have also see a group of folk particularly in the house a group of republicans in congress that they suggest they would not vote to pay the bill that congress have already run up   and that fiasco harm a fragile recovery back in 2011

 we have get a grow number of republican senator who be try to get thing do with their democratic counterpart just pass an immigration bill that economist say be go to boost our economy by more than a trillion dollar   applause   but so far at least there be a faction of house republicans who will not let the bill go to the floor for a vote   and if you ask they well okay what be your economic agenda for the middle class how be we go to grow our economy so everybody prosper they will start talk about out of control government spending although as i say government spending have actually go down and deficit be go down or they will talk about obamacare the whole idea that somehow if we do not provide health insurance to 50 million americans that be go to improve the economy   never mind the fact that our job growth be a lot fast now than it be during the last recovery when obamacare be not around

 so we have get some basic challenge that we be just go to have to meet   we have cut our deficit   we be create job at nearly twice the pace   we be provide health care for americans that need it   but we now have to get back and focus on what be important   an endless parade of distraction and political posturing and phony scandal can not get in the way of what we need to do   applause   and i be here to say it be get to stop   we have get to focus on job and the economy and help middle class family get ahead   and if we do that we be go to solve a whole lot of problem   applause

 and as we be think about these issue we can not get involve in short term thinking   we can not have all the same old debate   that be not what the moment require   we have get to focus on the core economic issue that matter to you   and as washington be now prepare for another debate about the budget the stake could not be high   if we do not make the investment america need to make this country a magnet for good job if we do not make investment in education and manufacturing and science and research and transportation and information network we will be wave the white flag while other country forge ahead in a global economy   applause   if we just stand by and do nothing we be say it ’ okay for middle class folk to keep take it on the chin   and i do not think it be okay

 and that be why i come here to warrensburg today   i need you involve in this debate to remind washington what ’ at stake   and over the next several week in town just like this one i ’m go to lay out my idea for how we build on the cornerstone of what it mean to be middle class what it take to work your way into the middle class a good job with good wage in durable grow industry a good education for our kid and our worker a home to call your own affordable health care that ’s there for you when you or your family member get sick applause a secure retirement even if you ’re not rich applause more ladder of opportunity for people who want to earn their way into the middle class as long as they be willing to work for it

 and what we need what we need be not a three month plan or even a three year plan we need a long term plan base on steady persistent effort to reverse the force that have conspire against middle class family for decade   and i be confident i know there be member of both party who understand what ’ at stake

 so i welcome idea from anybody across the political spectrum   but i ’m not go to allow gridlock or inaction or willful indifference to get in this country ’s way   we ’ve get to get move   applause

 so where i can act on my own i ’m go to   i ’m not go to wait for congress   applause   because the choice that we make now be n’t just go to determine what happen to the young people here at this school it ’s go to determine what happen to your kid and your grandkid   so one thing i really want to focus on here because ucm be do some extraordinary thing i want to focus on just briefly that second cornerstone an education that prepare our kid and our worker for the global competition that you ’ll face   that be why i want to highlight what ’s happen here at the university of central missouri because you guy be do some thing right   applause

 in an age where business know no border job be go to seek out the country that have the most talente skilled citizen and those be the folk who be go to make a good living   the day when the wage for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earning of somebody with a college degree those day be over   you can see it all throughout the midwest where you ’ve get folk who a generation ago could just walk into a factory or a plant do not have a lot of skill get train on the job make a good living live out a middle class life   that ’s not go to happen anymore   technology global competition those thing be not go away

 so we can either throw up our hand and resign ourselves to lower living standard or we can do what america have always do we can adapt we can pull together we can fight back we can win   applause   and if we do not invest in american education then we ’re go to put our kid our worker our country our business at a competitive disadvantage   because if you think it ’ if you think education be expensive you should see how much ignorance be go to cost in the 21st century   it ’s go to be expensive   applause

 so what do we need to do on education   number one it ’s get to start in the early year   and that mean work with state to make high quality preschool available for every four year old in america   applause   every study show this be a smart investment encourage healthy behavior increase our kid success in the classroom increase their earning power as they grow up reduce rate of teen pregnancy reduce criminal behavior   it ’ really important   and any work parent will tell you that know your kid be in a safe place to learn be a big relief so it ’ also important for the parent

 this idea of early childhood education it should not be partisan   state with republican governor be do it just like a lot of democratic governor be do it   our kid do not care about politic   we should prove that we care about they and make this thing happen   and i be go to keep on push as long as i be president until we have a situation where every kid be get a good healthy start in life and be prepare when they go to school   applause

 we ’re go to take action on prove idea to upgrade our school that do not require congress   so for example last month i announce a goal of connect 99 percent of america ’s student to high speed internet within five year   we ’re go ahead and take step for that to happen right now   now some of you may have go to school where you have internet in every classroom but a lot of school right now they ’ve get maybe a computer lab but if you go in the classroom kid they do not have it   in america in this country every child at every desk should have access to the entire world ’s information and every teacher should have the cutting edge technology to help their kid succeed and learn   we ’re go to make that happen   applause

 we ’ve get to rethink our high school so that our kid graduate with the real world skill that this new age demand   we ’ve get to reward the school that forge partnership with local college and business and that focus on the field of the future like science and technology and math and engineering

 and i ’m go to use the power of my office over the next few month to highlight a topic that affect probably everybody here and that be the soar cost of high education   applause

 now three year ago i work with democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollar be not go to pad the pocket of big bank and instead be go to help student get a college education   so million of student be help by that   we take action to cap loan repayment at 10 percent of monthly income for responsible borrower   a lot of young people do not know this but if you ’ve take out federal loan then if you choose a job let ’s say that do n’t pay as much as you ’d like or you deserve if you ’re a teacher or some other profession you only have to pay 10 percent of your income which mean that you can afford to go to college and know that you ’re not go to be break when you graduate which be important   and not enough young people be use this   applause

 as we speak and then as we speak we be work with both party to reverse the doubling of student loan rate that happen a few week ago because congress do not get its act together   we have get to get student loan rate interest rate back down   applause

 so these be all good step but here be the problem and this be where what be happen at university of central missouri be so important   we can put more and more money into student loan we can put more and more money into grant but if college cost keep on go up then there be never go to be enough money   i can keep student loan rate low but if you be borrow $ 80,000 for college or $ 100,000 and you get out it do not matter whether interest rate be 3.5 or 8.5 you be still go to have trouble repay it   it will take you long to buy a house   if you have get an idea for a business it be go to take you long to invest in start your business

 so we have get to do something about college cost   family and taxpayer can not just keep pay more and more into an undisciplined system   we ’ve get to get a well bang for our buck   applause   so state have to do their part by prioritize high education in their budget applause because part of the reason tuition have be skyrocket be college be not state fund college be not get as much funding and so then tuition be go up on the back of student and family   but we have also get to test new way of funding base not just on how many student enroll but how well they do   and college have to do their part by keep cost from go up

 so here at central missouri you be a laboratory for this kind of innovation   i have a great discussion with not only the president of this university but also the superintendent of school here the head of the community college   what be happen at ucm be you have partner with the lee ’s summit school district with the metropolitan community college with local health care engineering energy and infrastructure firm all industry that be go to drive job growth in the future and everybody be now work together to equip student with well skill allow they to graduate fast with less debt and with the certainty of be able to get a job at the other end   applause   that be a recipe for success over the long term

 so we have get student at summit technology academy applause there we go   those student they be begin to accrue credit towards an associate ’s degree while they ’re still in high school which mean they can come here to earn a bachelor ’s degree in two year and graduate debt free   applause   debt free on a fast track   applause

 and because the community college and industry be involve student be make quick decision about the industry that be go to create job and the business be help to design the program to make sure that they have the skill for those job so that not only be you graduate debt free but you also know that you have get a job wait for you on the other end   applause

 now that be exactly the kind of innovation we need when it come to college cost   that ’ what be happen right here in warrensburg   and i want the entire country to notice it and i want other college to take a look at what be be do here   and i ’ve ask my team to shake the tree all across the country for some of the good idea out there for keep college cost down so that as student prepare to go back to school i ’m in a position to lay out what ’s go to be an aggressive strategy to shake up the system to make sure that middle class student working class student poor kid who have the drive and the wherewithal and want to get a good college education they can get it without basically mortgage their entire future   we can make this happen but this be an example of the kind of thing we ’ve get to focus on instead of a bunch of distraction in washington   applause

 tackle college cost create more good job establish a well bargain for middle class family and everybody try to work to join into it an economy that grow not from the top down but from the middle out that ’s not just what i ’m go to focus on for the next few month that ’ what i ’m go to be focus on for the remainder of my presidency   and i ’m go to take these plan all across the country and i ’m go to ask folk for help because frankly sometimes i just can not wait for congress   it just take they a long time to decide on stuff   applause

 so we ’re go to reach out to ceo and we ’re go to reach out to worker and we ’re go to reach out to college president and we ’re go to reach out to student   we ’ll talk to democrats and independent and yes i will be ask republicans to get involve because this have to be our core project for the next decade

 i want to lay out my idea to give the middle class a well shot in the 21st century   and look i want republicans to lay out their idea   if they ’ve get a well idea to bring down college cost that we have not think of let ’s hear they   i ’m ready to go   if they ’ve get a well plan to make sure that every american know the security of affordable health care then please share it with the class   raise your hand   applause   but what you can not do be just manufacture another crisis because you think it might be good politic just as our economy be get some traction   what you can not do be shut down our government just because i ’m for open the government   applause   you can not threaten not to pay the bill this country rack up or to cut investment in education and science and basic research that be go to help we grow

 if we ’re go to manage deficit and debt let ’s do it in a sensible way   we can do this if we work together   and it may seem hard right now but if we ’re willing to take a few bold step if washington will just shake off its complacency set aside the kind of slash and burn partisanship that we ’ve see over the past few year i promise you our economy will be strong a year from now just like it ’ strong now than it be last year   and then it will be strong five year from now and then it will be strong 10 year from now   applause   and more americans will have the pride of a first paycheck   and more americans will have the satisfaction of start their own business and flip that sign that say open   more folk will have the thrill of marching across the stage to earn a diploma from a university like this and then know that they ’ve get a job wait for they when they graduate

 what make we special a lot of time we talk about american exceptionalism and how much we love this country and there be so many wonderful thing about our country   but what make we the envy of the world have not just be our ability to generate incredible wealth for a few people it ’ the fact that we ’ve give everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness   applause   that ’ who we be

 we have n’t just want success for ourselves we want it for our neighbor   we want it for our neighborhood   that ’ why we do not call it bob ’s dream or barbara ’s dream or barack ’s dream we call it the american dream   applause   it ’ one that we share   that be who we be the idea that no matter who you be what you look like where you come from who you love you can make it here in america if you ’re try hard   applause

 that ’ what a college education can be all about   that ’ what inspire your president that ’ what inspire the faculty   that ’ why when we see young people like you we ’re inspire because you ’re an expression of that idea   and we ’ve get to make sure that that continue not just for this generation but for the next generation

 so thank you missouri   thank you ucm   thank you mules   thank you jennies   god bless you   god bless the united states of america   let ’s get to work   applause

my fellow americans tonight i want to talk to you about syria why it matter and where we go from here

 over the past two year what begin as a series of peaceful protest against the repressive regime of bashar al assad have turn into a brutal civil war   over 100,000 people have be kill   million have flee the country   in that time america have work with ally to provide humanitarian support to help the moderate opposition and to shape a political settlement   but i have resist call for military action because we can not resolve someone else ’s civil war through force particularly after a decade of war in iraq and afghanistan

 the situation profoundly change though on august 21st when assad ’s government gas to death over a thousand people include hundred of child   the image from this massacre be sicken   man woman child lie in row kill by poison gas   other foam at the mouth gasp for breath   a father clutch his dead child implore they to get up and walk   on that terrible night the world see in gruesome detail the terrible nature of chemical weapon and why the overwhelming majority of humanity have declare they off limit a crime against humanity and a violation of the law of war

 this be not always the case   in world war i american gi be among the many thousand kill by deadly gas in the trench of europe   in world war ii the nazis use gas to inflict the horror of the holocaust   because these weapon can kill on a mass scale with no distinction between soldier and infant the civilized world have spend a century work to ban they   and in 1997 the united states senate overwhelmingly approve an international agreement prohibit the use of chemical weapon now join by 189 government that represent 98 percent of humanity

 on august 21st these basic rule be violate along with our sense of common humanity   no one dispute that chemical weapon be use in syria   the world see thousand of video cell phone picture and social medium account from the attack and humanitarian organization tell story of hospital pack with people who have symptom of poison gas

 moreover we know the assad regime be responsible   in the day lead up to august 21st we know that assad ’s chemical weapon personnel prepare for an attack near an area where they mix sarin gas   they distribute gasmask to their troop   then they fire rocket from a regime control area into 11 neighborhood that the regime have be try to wipe clear of opposition force   shortly after those rocket land the gas spread and hospital fill with the dying and the wound   we know senior figure in assad ’s military machine review the result of the attack and the regime increase their shelling of the same neighborhood in the day that follow   we ’ve also study sample of blood and hair from people at the site that test positive for sarin

 when dictator commit atrocity they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrify picture fade from memory   but these thing happen   the fact can not be deny the question now be what the united states of america and the international community be prepared to do about it   because what happen to those people to those child be not only a violation of international law it ’s also a danger to our security

 let i explain why   if we fail to act the assad regime will see no reason to stop use chemical weapon   as the ban against these weapon erode other tyrant will have no reason to think twice about acquire poison gas and use they   over time our troop would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield   and it could be easy for terrorist organization to obtain these weapon and to use they to attack civilian

 if fight spill beyond syria ’s border these weapon could threaten ally like turkey jordan and israel   and a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapon would weaken prohibition against other weapon of mass destruction and embolden assad ’s ally iran which must decide whether to ignore international law by build a nuclear weapon or to take a more peaceful path

 this be not a world we should accept   this be what ’ at stake   and that be why after careful deliberation i determine that it be in the national security interest of the united states to respond to the assad regime ’s use of chemical weapon through a targeted military strike   the purpose of this strike would be to deter assad from use chemical weapon to degrade his regime ’s ability to use they and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use

 that be my judgment as commander in chief   but i ’m also the president of the world ’s old constitutional democracy   so even though i possess the authority to order military strike i believe it be right in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to our security to take this debate to congress   i believe our democracy be strong when the president act with the support of congress   and i believe that america act more effectively abroad when we stand together

 this be especially true after a decade that put more and more war make power in the hand of the president and more and more burden on the shoulder of our troop while sideline the people ’s representative from the critical decision about when we use force

 now i know that after the terrible toll of iraq and afghanistan the idea of any military action no matter how limited be not go to be popular   after all i have spend four and a half year work to end war not to start they   our troop be out of iraq   our troop be come home from afghanistan   and i know americans want all of we in washington

 especially i to concentrate on the task of build our nation here at home   put people back to work educate our kid grow our middle class

 it ’ no wonder then that you be ask hard question   so let i answer some of the most important question that i have hear from member of congress and that i have read in letter that you have send to i

 first many of you have ask will not this put we on a slippery slope to another war   one man write to i that we be still recover from our involvement in iraq   a veteran put it more bluntly   this nation be sick and tired of war

 my answer be simple   i will not put american boot on the ground in syria   i will not pursue an open ended action like iraq or afghanistan   i will not pursue a prolong air campaign like libya or kosovo   this would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective   deter the use of chemical weapon and degrade assad ’s capability

 other have ask whether it be worth act if we do n’t take out assad   as some member of congress have say there ’ no point in simply do a pinprick strike in syria

 let i make something clear   the united states military do n’t do pinprick   even a limited strike will send a message to assad that no other nation can deliver   i do not think we should remove another dictator with force we learn from iraq that do so make we responsible for all that come next   but a target strike can make assad or any other dictator think twice before use chemical weapon

 other question involve the danger of retaliation   we do not dismiss any threat but the assad regime do not have the ability to seriously threaten our military   any other retaliation they might seek be in line with threat that we face every day   neither assad nor his ally have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise   and our ally israel can defend itself with overwhelming force as well as the unshakeable support of the united states of america

 many of you have ask a broad question   why should we get involve at all in a place that be so complicated and where   as one person write to i those who come after assad may be enemy of human right

 it ’ true that some of assad ’s opponent be extremist   but al qaeda will only draw strength in a more chaotic syria if people there see the world do nothing to prevent innocent civilian from be gas to death   the majority of the syrian people and the syrian opposition we work with just want to live in peace with dignity and freedom   and the day after any military action we would redouble our effort to achieve a political solution that strengthen those who reject the force of tyranny and extremism

 finally many of you have ask   why not leave this to other country or seek solution short of force   as several people write to i we should not be the world ’s policeman

 i agree and i have a deeply hold preference for peaceful solution   over the last two year my administration have try diplomacy and sanction warning and negotiation but chemical weapon be still use by the assad regime

 however over the last few day we ’ve see some encouraging sign   in part because of the credible threat of u.s. military action as well as constructive talk that i have with president putin the russian government have indicate a willingness to join with the international community in push assad to give up his chemical weapon   the assad regime have now admit that it have these weapon and even say they ’d join the chemical weapons convention which prohibit their use

 it ’ too early to tell whether this offer will succeed and any agreement must verify that the assad regime keep its commitment   but this initiative have the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapon without the use of force particularly because russia be one of assad ’s strong ally

 i have therefore ask the leader of congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path   i ’m send secretary of state john kerry to meet his russian counterpart on thursday and i will continue my own discussion with president putin   i ’ve speak to the leader of two of our close ally france and the united kingdom and we will work together in consultation with russia and china to put forward a resolution at the u.n. security council require assad to give up his chemical weapon and to ultimately destroy they under international control   we ’ll also give u.n. inspector the opportunity to report their finding about what happen on august 21st   and we will continue to rally support from ally from europe to the americas from asia to the middle east who agree on the need for action

 meanwhile i ’ve order our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fail   and tonight i give thank again to our military and their family for their incredible strength and sacrifice

 my fellow americans for nearly seven decade the united states have be the anchor of global security   this have mean do more than forge international agreement it have mean enforce they   the burden of leadership be often heavy but the world be a well place because we have bear they

 and so to my friend on the right i ask you to reconcile your commitment to america ’s military might with a failure to act when a cause be so plainly just   to my friend on the left i ask you to reconcile your belief in freedom and dignity for all people with those image of child writhe in pain and go still on a cold hospital floor   for sometimes resolution and statement of condemnation be simply not enough

 indeed i ’d ask every member of congress and those of you watch at home tonight to view those video of the attack and then ask   what kind of world will we live in if the united states of america see a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas and we choose to look the other way

 franklin roosevelt once say our national determination to keep free of foreign war and foreign entanglement can not prevent we from feel deep concern when ideal and principle that we have cherish be challenge   our ideal and principle as well as our national security be at stake in syria along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the bad weapon will never be use

 america be not the world ’s policeman   terrible thing happen across the globe and it be beyond our mean to right every wrong   but when with modest effort and risk we can stop child from be gas to death and thereby make our own child safe over the long run i believe we should act   that ’ what make america different   that ’ what make we exceptional   with humility but with resolve let we never lose sight of that essential truth

 thank you   god bless you   and god bless the united states of america


 thank you   applause   thank you everybody   thank you so much   please please have a seat   thank you so much   well thank you neera for the wonderful introduction and share a story that resonate with i   there be a lot of parallel in my life and probably resonate with some of you

 over the past 10 year the center for american progress have do incredible work to shape the debate over expand opportunity for all americans   and i could not be more grateful to cap not only for give i a lot of good policy idea but also give i a lot of staff   laughter   my friend john podesta run my transition my chief of staff denis mcdonough do a stint at cap   so you guy be obviously do a good job training folk

 i also want to thank all the member of congress and my administration who be here today for the wonderful work that they do   i want to thank mayor gray and everyone here at thearc for have i   this center which i ’ve be to quite a bit have have a chance to see some of the great work that ’s do here   and all the nonprofit that call thearc home offer access to everything from education to health care to a safe shelter from the street which mean that you ’re harness the power of community to expand opportunity for folk here in d.c.   and your work reflect a tradition that run through our history a belief that we ’re great together than we be on our own   and that ’ what i ’ve come here to talk about today

 over the last two month washington have be dominate by some pretty contentious debate i think that ’ fair to say   and between a reckless shutdown by congressional republicans in an effort to repeal the affordable care act and admittedly poor execution on my administration ’s part in implement the late stage of the new law nobody have acquit themselves very well these past few month   so it ’ not surprising that the american people ’s frustration with washington be at an all time high

 but we know that people ’s frustration run deeply than these most recent political battle   their frustration be root in their own daily battle to make end meet to pay for college buy a home save for retirement   it ’s root in the nagging sense that no matter how hard they work the deck be stack against they   and it ’s root in the fear that their kid will not be well off than they be   they may not follow the constant back and forth in washington or all the policy detail but they experience in a very personal way the relentless decade long trend that i want to spend some time talk about today   and that be a dangerous and grow inequality and lack of upward mobility that have jeopardize middle class america ’s basic bargain that if you work hard you have a chance to get ahead

 i believe this be the define challenge of our time   make sure our economy work for every work american   it ’ why i run for president   it be at the center of last year ’s campaign   it drive everything i do in this office   and i know i ’ve raise this issue before and some will ask why i raise the issue again right now   i do it because the outcome of the debate we ’re have right now whether it ’ health care or the budget or reform our housing and financial system all these thing will have real practical implication for every american   and i be convinced that the decision we make on these issue over the next few year will determine whether or not our child will grow up in an america where opportunity be real

 now the premise that we ’re all create equal be the opening line in the american story   and while we do not promise equal outcome we have strive to deliver equal opportunity the idea that success do not depend on be bear into wealth or privilege it depend on effort and merit   and with every chapter we ’ve add to that story we ’ve work hard to put those word into practice

 it be abraham lincoln a self describe poor man ’s son who start a system of land grant college all over this country so that any poor man ’s son could go learn something new

 when farm give way to factory a rich man ’s son name teddy roosevelt fight for an eight hour workday protection for worker and bust monopoly that keep price high and wage low

 when million live in poverty fdr fight for social security and insurance for the unemployed and a minimum wage

 when million die without health insurance lbj fight for medicare and medicaid

 together we forge a new deal declare a war on poverty in a great society   we build a ladder of opportunity to climb and stretch out a safety net beneath so that if we fall it would not be too far and we could bounce back   and as a result america build the large middle class the world have ever know   and for the three decade after world war ii it be the engine of our prosperity

 now we can not look at the past through rose color glass   the economy do not always work for everyone   racial discrimination lock million out of poverty or out of opportunity   woman be too often confine to a handful of often poorly pay profession   and it be only through painstaking struggle that more woman and minority and americans with disability begin to win the right to more fairly and fully participate in the economy

 nevertheless during the post world war ii year the economic ground feel stable and secure for most americans and the future look bright than the past   and for some that mean follow in your old man ’s footstep at the local plant and you know that a blue collar job would let you buy a home and a car maybe a vacation once in a while health care a reliable pension   for other it mean go to college in some case maybe the first in your family to go to college   and it mean graduate without take on load of debt and be able to count on advancement through a vibrant job market

 now it ’ true that those at the top even in those year claim a much large share of income than the rest   the top 10 percent consistently take home about one third of our national income   but that kind of inequality take place in a dynamic market economy where everyone ’s wage and income be grow   and because of upward mobility the guy on the factory floor could picture his kid run the company some day

 but start in the late 70 this social compact begin to unravel   technology make it easy for company to do more with less eliminate certain job occupation   a more competitive world let company ship job anywhere   and as good manufacturing job automate or head offshore worker lose their leverage job pay less and offer few benefit

 as value of community break down and competitive pressure increase business lobby washington to weaken union and the value of the minimum wage   as a trickle down ideology become more prominent taxis be slash for the wealthy while investment in thing that make we all rich like school and infrastructure be allow to wither   and for a certain period of time we could ignore this weaken economic foundation in part because more family be rely on two earner as woman enter the workforce   we take on more debt finance by a juice up housing market   but when the music stop and the crisis hit million of family be strip of whatever cushion they have leave

 and the result be an economy that ’s become profoundly unequal and family that be more insecure   i ’ll just give you a few statistic   since 1979 when i graduate from high school our productivity be up by more than 90 percent but the income of the typical family have increase by less than eight percent   since 1979 our economy have more than double in size but most of that growth have flow to a fortunate few

 the top 10 percent no long take in one third of our income it now take half   whereas in the past the average ceo make about 20 to 30 time the income of the average worker today ’s ceo now make 273 time more   and meanwhile a family in the top 1 percent have a net worth 288 time high than the typical family which be a record for this country

 so the basic bargain at the heart of our economy have fray   in fact this trend towards grow inequality be not unique to america ’s market economy   across the developed world inequality have increase   some of you may have see just last week the pope himself speak about this at eloquent length   how can it be he write that it be not a news item when an elderly homeless person die of exposure but it be news when the stock market lose two point

 but this increase inequality be most pronounce in our country and it challenge the very essence of who we be as a people   understand we ’ve never begrudge success in america   we aspire to it   we admire folk who start new business create job and invent the product that enrich our life   and we expect they to be reward handsomely for it   in fact we have often accept more income inequality than many other nation for one big reason because we be convince that america be a place where even if you ’re bear with nothing with a little hard work you can improve your own situation over time and build something well to leave your kid   as lincoln once say while we do not propose any war upon capital we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else

 the problem be that alongside increase inequality we ’ve see diminished level of upward mobility in recent year   a child bear in the top 20 percent have about a 2 in-3 chance of stay at or near the top   a child bear into the bottom 20 percent have a less than 1 in-20 shot at make it to the top   he ’ 10 time likeli to stay where he be   in fact statistic show not only that our level of income inequality rank near country like jamaica and argentina but that it be hard today for a child bear here in america to improve her station in life than it be for child in most of our wealthy ally country like canada or germany or france   they have great mobility than we do not less

 the idea that so many child be bear into poverty in the wealthy nation on earth be heartbreake enough   but the idea that a child may never be able to escape that poverty because she lack a decent education or health care or a community that view her future as their own that should offend all of we and it should compel we to action   we be a well country than this

 so let i repeat   the combined trend of increase inequality and decrease mobility pose a fundamental threat to the american dream our way of life and what we stand for around the globe   and it be not simply a moral claim that i ’m make here   there be practical consequence to rise inequality and reduced mobility

 for one thing these trend be bad for our economy   one study find that growth be more fragile and recession be more frequent in country with great inequality   and that make sense   when family have less to spend that mean business have few customer and household rack up great mortgage and credit card debt meanwhile concentrated wealth at the top be less likely to result in the kind of broadly base consumer spending that drive our economy and together with lax regulation may contribute to risky speculative bubble

 and rise inequality and decline mobility be also bad for our family and social cohesion not just because we tend to trust our institution less but study show we actually tend to trust each other less when there ’ great inequality   and great inequality be associate with less mobility between generation   that mean it ’ not just temporary the effect last   it create a vicious cycle   for example by the time she turn three year old a child bear into a low income home hear 30 million few word than a child from a well off family which mean by the time she start school she ’s already behind and that deficit can compound itself over time

 and finally rise inequality and decline mobility be bad for our democracy   ordinary folk can not write massive campaign check or hire high price lobbyist and lawyer to secure policy that tilt the play field in their favor at everyone else ’s expense   and so people get the bad taste that the system be rig and that increase cynicism and polarization and it decrease the political participation that be a requisite part of our system of self government

 so this be an issue that we have to tackle head on   and if in fact the majority of americans agree that our number one priority be to restore opportunity and broad base growth for all americans the question be why have washington consistently fail to act   and i think a big reason be the myth that have develop around the issue of inequality

 first there be the myth that this be a problem restrict to a small share of predominantly minority poor that this be n’t a broad base problem this be a black problem or a hispanic problem or a native american problem   now it ’ true that the painful legacy of discrimination mean that african americans latinos native americans be far more likely to suffer from a lack of opportunity high unemployment high poverty rate   it ’ also true that woman still make 77 cent on the dollar compare to man   so we ’re go to need strong application of antidiscrimination law   we ’re go to need immigration reform that grow the economy and take people out of the shadow   we ’re go to need target initiative to close those gap   applause

 but here ’ an important point   the decade long shift in the economy have hurt all group   poor and middle class inner city and rural folk man and woman and americans of all race   and as a consequence some of the social pattern that contribute to decline mobility that be once attribute to the urban poor that ’ a particular problem for the inner city single parent household or drug abuse it turn out now we ’re see that pop up everywhere

 a new study show that disparity in education mental health obesity absent father isolation from church isolation from community group these gap be now as much about grow up rich or poor as they be about anything else   the gap in test score between poor kid and wealthy kid be now nearly twice what it be between white kid and black kid   kid with working class parent be 10 time likeli than kid with middle- or upper class parent to go through a time when their parent have no income   so the fact be this   the opportunity gap in america be now as much about class as it be about race and that gap be grow

 so if we ’re go to take on grow inequality and try to improve upward mobility for all people we ’ve get to move beyond the false notion that this be an issue exclusively of minority concern   and we have to reject a politics that suggest any effort to address it in a meaningful way somehow pit the interest of a deserve middle class against those of an undeserving poor in search of handout   applause

 second we need to dispel the myth that the goal of grow the economy and reduce inequality be necessarily in conflict when they should actually work in concert   we know from our history that our economy grow good from the middle out when growth be more widely share   and we know that beyond a certain level of inequality growth actually slow altogether

 third we need to set aside the belief that government can not do anything about reduce inequality   it ’ true that government can not prevent all the downside of the technological change and global competition that be out there right now and some of those force be also some of the thing that be help we grow   and it ’ also true that some program in the past like welfare before it be reform be sometimes poorly design create disincentive to work

 but we ’ve also see how government action time and again can make an enormous difference in increase opportunity and bolster ladder into the middle class   investment in education law establish collective bargaining and a minimum wage these all contribute to rise standard of live for massive number of americans   applause   likewise when previous generation declare that every citizen of this country deserve a basic measure of security a floor through which they could not fall we help million of americans live in dignity and give million more the confidence to aspire to something well by take a risk on a great idea

 without social security nearly half of senior would be live in poverty half   today few than 1 in 10 do   before medicare only half of all senior have some form of health insurance   today virtually all do   and because we ’ve strengthen that safety net and expand pro work and pro family tax credit like the earned income tax credit a recent study find that the poverty rate have fall by 40 percent since the 1960   and these endeavor do not just make we a well country they reaffirm that we be a great country

 so we can make a difference on this   in fact that ’ our generation ’s task to rebuild america ’s economic and civic foundation to continue the expansion of opportunity for this generation and the next generation   applause   and like neera i take this personally   i ’m only here because this country educate my grandfather on the gi bill   when my father leave and my mom hit hard time try to raise my sister and i while she be go to school this country help make sure we do not go hungry   when michelle the daughter of a shift worker at a water plant and a secretary want to go to college just like i this country help we afford it until we could pay it back

 so what drive i as a grandson a son a father as an american be to make sure that every strive hardworking optimistic kid in america have the same incredible chance that this country give i   applause   it have be the drive force between everything we ’ve do these past five year   and over the course of the next year and for the rest of my presidency that ’s where you should expect my administration to focus all our effort   applause

 now you will be pleased to know this be not a state of the union address   laughter   and many of the idea that can make the big difference in expand opportunity i ’ve present before   but let i offer a few key principle just a roadmap that i believe should guide we in both our legislative agenda and our administrative effort

 to begin with we have to continue to relentlessly push a growth agenda   it may be true that in today ’s economy growth alone do not guarantee high wage and income   we have see that   but what be also true be we can not tackle inequality if the economic pie be shrink or stagnant   the fact be if you ’re a progressive and you want to help the middle class and the work poor you ’ve still get to be concern about competitiveness and productivity and business confidence that spur private sector investment

 and that ’ why from day one we ’ve work to get the economy grow and help our business hire   and thank to their resilience and innovation they ’ve create nearly 8 million new job over the past 44 month   and now we ’ve get to grow the economy even fast   and we have get to keep work to make america a magnet for good middle class job to replace the one that we ’ve lose in recent decade job in manufacturing and energy and infrastructure and technology

 and that mean simplify our corporate tax code in a way that close wasteful loophole and end incentive to ship job overseas   applause   and by broaden the base we can actually lower rate to encourage more company to hire here and use some of the money we save to create good job rebuild our road and our bridge and our airport and all the infrastructure our business need

 it mean a trade agenda that grow export and work for the middle class   it mean streamline regulation that be outdated or unnecessary or too costly   and it mean come together around a responsible budget one that grow our economy fast right now and shrink our long term deficit one that unwind the harmful sequester cut that have not make a lot of sense applause and then free up resource to invest in thing like the scientific research that be always unleash new innovation and new industry

 when it come to our budget we should not be stick in a stale debate from two year ago or three year ago   a relentlessly grow deficit of opportunity be a big threat to our future than our rapidly shrink fiscal deficit   applause

 so that ’s step one towards restore mobility   make sure our economy be grow fast   step two be make sure we empower more americans with the skill and education they need to compete in a highly competitive global economy

 we know that education be the most important predictor of income today so we launch a race to the top in our school   we ’re support state that have raise standard for teaching and learning   we ’re push for redesign high school that graduate more kid with the technical training and apprenticeship and in demand high tech skill that can lead directly to a good job and a middle class life

 we know it ’ hard to find a job today without some high education so we ’ve help more student go to college with grant and loan that go far than before   we ’ve make it more practical to repay those loan   and today more student be graduate from college than ever before   we ’re also pursue an aggressive strategy to promote innovation that rein in tuition cost   we ’ve get low cost so that young people be not burden by enormous debt when they make the right decision to get high education   and next week michelle and i will bring together college president and non profit to lead a campaign to help more low income student attend and succeed in college   applause

 but while high education may be the sure path to the middle class it ’ not the only one   so we should offer our people the well technical education in the world   that ’ why we ’ve work to connect local business with community college so that worker young and old can earn the new skill that earn they more money

 and i ’ve also embrace an idea that i know all of you at the center for american progress have champion and by the way republican governor in a couple of state have champion and that ’s make high quality preschool available to every child in america   applause   we know that kid in these program grow up likelier to get more education earn high wage form more stable family of their own   it start a virtuous cycle not a vicious one   and we should invest in that   we should give all of our child that chance

 and as we empower our young people for future success the third part of this middle class economic be empower our worker   it ’ time to ensure our collective bargaining law function as they ’re suppose to applause so union have a level playing field to organize for a well deal for worker and well wage for the middle class   it ’ time to pass the paycheck fairness act so that woman will have more tool to fight pay discrimination   applause   it ’ time to pass the employment non discrimination act so worker can not be fire for who they be or who they love   applause

 and even though we ’re bring manufacture job back to america we ’re create more good pay job in education and health care and business service we know that we ’re go to have a great and great portion of our people in the service sector   and we know that there be airport worker and fast food worker and nurse assistant and retail salesperson who work their tail off and be still live at or barely above poverty   applause   and that ’ why it ’ well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real term right now be below where it be when harry truman be in office   applause

 this should not be an ideological question   it be adam smith the father of free market economic who once say they who feed clothe and lodge the whole body of the people should have such a share of the produce of their own labor as to be themselves tolerably well fed clothe and lodge   and for those of you who do not speak old english laughter let i translate   it mean if you work hard you should make a decent living   applause   if you work hard you should be able to support a family

 now we all know the argument that have be use against a high minimum wage   some say it actually hurt low wage worker business will be less likely to hire they   but there ’s no solid evidence that a high minimum wage cost job and research show it raise income for low wage worker and boost short term economic growth   applause

 other argue that if we raise the minimum wage company will just pass those cost on to consumer   but a grow chorus of business small and large argue differently   and   already there be extraordinary company in america that provide decent wage salary and benefit and training for their worker and deliver a great product to consumer

 sas in north carolina offer childcare and sick leave   rei a company my secretary of the interior use to run offer retirement plan and strive to cultivate a good work balance   there be company out there that do right by their worker   they recognize that pay a decent wage actually help their bottom line reduce turnover   it mean worker have more money to spend to save maybe eventually start a business of their own

 a broad majority of americans agree we should raise the minimum wage   that ’ why last month voter in new jersey decide to become the 20th state to raise theirs even higher   that ’ why yesterday the d.c. council vote to do it too   i agree with those voter   applause   i agree with those voter and i ’m go to keep push until we get a high minimum wage for hard work americans across the entire country   it will be good for our economy   it will be good for our family   applause

 number four as i allude to early we still need target program for the community and worker that have be hit hard by economic change and the great recession   these community be no long limit to the inner city   they ’re find in neighborhood hammer by the housing crisis manufacture town hit hard by year of plant pack up landlocke rural area where young folk oftentime feel like they have get to leave just to find a job   there be community that just be n’t generate enough job anymore

 so we ’ve put forward new plan to help these community and their resident because we ’ve watch city like pittsburgh or my hometown of chicago revamp themselves   and if we give more city the tool to do it not handout but a hand up city like detroit can do it too   so in a few week we ’ll announce the first of these promise zones urban and rural community where we ’re go to support local effort focus on a national goal and that be a child ’s course in life should not be determine by the zip code he ’s bear in but by the strength of his work ethic and the scope of his dream   applause

 and we be also go to have to do more for the long term unemployed   for people who have be out of work for more than six month often through no fault of their own life be a catch-22   company will not give their résumé an honest look because they ’ve be lay off so long but they ’ve be lay off so long because company will not give their résumé an honest look   laughter   and that ’ why early this year i challenge ceo from some of america ’s good company to give these americans a fair shot   and next month many of they will join we at the white house for an announcement about this

 fifth we have get to revamp retirement to protect americans in their golden year to make sure another housing collapse do not steal the saving in their home   we have also get to strengthen our safety net for a new age so it do not just protect people who hit a run of bad luck from fall into poverty but also propel they back out of poverty

 today nearly half of full time worker and 80 percent of part time worker do not have a pension or retirement account at their job   about half of all household do not have any retirement saving   so we ’re go to have to do more to encourage private saving and shore up the promise of social security for future generation   and remember these be promise we make to one another   we do not do it to replace the free market but we do it to reduce risk in our society by give people the ability to take a chance and catch they if they fall   one study show that more than half of americans will experience poverty at some point during their adult life   think about that   this be not an isolated situation   more than half of americans at some point in their life will experience poverty

 that ’ why we have nutrition assistance or the program know as snap because it make a difference for a mother who ’s work but be just have a hard time put food on the table for her kid   that ’ why we have unemployment insurance because it make a difference for a father who lose his job and be out there look for a new one that he can keep a roof over his kid head   by the way christmastime be no time for congress to tell more than 1 million of these americans that they have lose their unemployment insurance which be what will happen if congress do not act before they leave on their holiday vacation   applause

 the point be these program be not typically hammock for people to just lie back and relax   these program be almost always temporary mean for hardworke people to stay afloat while they try to find a new job or go into school to retrain themselves for the job that be out there or sometimes just to cope with a bout of bad luck   progressive should be open to reform that actually strengthen these program and make they more responsive to a 21st century economy   for example we should be willing to look at fresh idea to revamp unemployment and disability program to encourage fast and high rate of re employment without cut benefit   we should not weaken fundamental protection build over generation because give the constant churn in today ’s economy and the disability that many of our friend and neighbor live with they be need more than ever   we should strengthen they and adapt they to new circumstance so they work even well

 but understand that these program of social insurance benefit all of we because we do not know when we might have a run of bad luck   applause   we do not know when we might lose a job   of course for decade there be one yawn gap in the safety net that do more than anything else to expose work family to the insecurity of today ’s economy namely our break health care system

 that ’ why we fight for the affordable care act applause because 14,000 americans lose their health insurance every single day and even more die each year because they do not have health insurance at all   we do it because million of family who think they have coverage be drive into bankruptcy by out of pocket cost that they do not realize would be there   ten of million of our fellow citizen could not get any coverage at all   and dr. king once say of all the form of inequality injustice in health care be the most shocking and inhumane

 well not anymore   applause   because in the three year since we pass this law the share of americans with insurance be up the growth of health care cost be down to their slow rate in 50 year   more people have insurance and more have new benefit and protection 100 million americans who have gain the right for free preventive care like mammogram and contraception the more than 7 million americans who have save an average of $ 1,200 on their prescription medicine every american who will not go broke when they get sick because their insurance can not limit their care anymore

 more people without insurance have gain insurance more than 3 million young americans who have be able to stay on their parent plan the more than half a million americans and count who be poise to get cover start on january 1st some for the very first time

 and it be these number not the one in any poll that will ultimately determine the fate of this law   applause   it be the measurable outcome in reduce bankruptcy and reduce hour that have be lose because somebody could not make it to work and healthy kid with well performance in school and young entrepreneur who have the freedom to go out there and try a new idea those be the thing that will ultimately reduce a major source of inequality and help ensure more americans get the start that they need to succeed in the future

 i have acknowledge more than once that we do not roll out part of this law as well as we should have   but the law be already work in major way that benefit million of americans right now even as we ’ve begin to slow the rise in health care cost which be good for family budget good for federal and state budget and good for the budget of business small and large   so this law be go to work   and for the sake of our economic security it need to work   applause

 and as people in state as different as california and kentucky sign up every single day for health insurance sign up in drove they ’re prove they want that economic security   if the senate republican leader still think he be go to be able to repeal this someday he might want to check with the more than 60,000 people in his home state who be already set to finally have coverage that free they from the fear of financial ruin and let they afford to take their kid to see a doctor   applause

 so let i end by address the elephant in the room here which be the seem inability to get anything do in washington these day   i realize we be not go to resolve all of our political debate over the good way to reduce inequality and increase upward mobility this year or next year or in the next five year   but it be important that we have a serious debate about these issue   for the long that current trend be allow to continue the more it will feed the cynicism and fear that many americans be feel right now that they ’ll never be able to repay the debt they take on to go to college they ’ll never be able to save enough to retire they ’ll never see their own child land a good job that support a family

 and that ’ why even as i will keep on offer my own idea for expand opportunity i ’ll also keep challenge and welcome those who oppose my idea to offer their own   if republicans have concrete plan that will actually reduce inequality build the middle class provide more ladder of opportunity to the poor let ’s hear they   i want to know what they be   if you do not think we should raise the minimum wage let ’s hear your idea to increase people ’s earning   if you do not think every child should have access to preschool tell we what you ’d do differently to give they a well shot

 if you still do n’t like obamacare and i know you do n’t laughter even though it ’s build on market base idea of choice and competition in the private sector then you should explain how exactly you ’d cut cost and cover more people and make insurance more secure   you owe it to the american people to tell we what you be for not just what you ’re against   applause   that way we can have a vigorous and meaningful debate   that ’ what the american people deserve   that ’ what the time demand   it ’ not enough anymore to just say we should just get our government out of the way and let the unfettered market take care of it for our experience tell we that ’s just not true   applause

 look i ’ve never believe that government can solve every problem or should and neither do you   we know that ultimately our strength be ground in our people individual out there strive work make thing happen   it depend on community a rich and generous sense of community that ’s at the core of what happen at thearc here every day   you understand that turn back rise inequality and expand opportunity require parent take responsibility for their kid kid take responsibility to work hard   it require religious leader who mobilize their congregation to rebuild neighborhood block by block require civic organization that can help train the unemployed link they with business for the job of the future   it require company and ceo to set an example by provide decent wage and salary and benefit for their worker and a shot for somebody who be down on his or her luck   we know that ’ our strength our people our community our business

 but government can not stand on the sideline in our effort   because government be we   it can and should reflect our deep value and commitment   and if we refocus our energy on build an economy that grow for everybody and give every child in this country a fair chance at success then i remain confident that the future still look bright than the past and that the good day for this country we love be still ahead   applause

 thank you everybody   god bless you   god bless america   applause


mr. speaker mr. vice president members of congress my fellow americans

 today in america a teacher spend extra time with a student who need it and do her part to lift america ’s graduation rate to its high level in more than three decade

 an entrepreneur flip on the light in her tech startup and do her part to add to the more than eight million new job our business have create over the past four year

 an autoworker fine tune some of the good most fuel efficient car in the world and do his part to help america wean itself off foreign oil

 a farmer prepare for the spring after the strong five year stretch of farm export in our history   a rural doctor give a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford   a man take the bus home from the graveyard shift bone tired but dream big dream for his son   and in tight knit community across america father and mother will tuck in their kid put an arm around their spouse remember fallen comrade and give thank for be home from a war that after twelve long year be finally come to an end

 tonight this chamber speak with one voice to the people we represent it be you our citizen who make the state of our union strong

  here be the result of your effort   the low unemployment rate in over five year   a rebound housing market   a manufacturing sector that ’s add job for the first time since the 1990s   more oil produce at home than we buy from the rest of the world the first time that ’s happen in nearly twenty year   our deficit cut by more than half   and for the first time in over a decade business leader around the world have declare that china be no long the world ’s number one place to invest america be

 that ’ why i believe this can be a breakthrough year for america   after five year of grit and determined effort the united states be well positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on earth

 the question for everyone in this chamber run through every decision we make this year be whether we be go to help or hinder this progress   for several year now this town have be consume by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government   it ’ an important debate one that date back to our very founding   but when that debate prevent we from carry out even the most basic function of our democracy when our difference shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the united states then we be not do right by the american people

 as president i ’m committed to make washington work well and rebuild the trust of the people who send we here   i believe most of you be too   last month thank to the work of democrats and republicans this congress finally produce a budget that undo some of last year ’s severe cut to priority like education   nobody get everything they want and we can still do more to invest in this country ’s future while bring down our deficit in a balanced way   but the budget compromise should leave we free to focus on create new job not create new crisis

 in the come month let ’s see where else we can make progress together   let ’s make this a year of action   that ’ what most americans want for all of we in this chamber to focus on their life their hope their aspiration   and what i believe unite the people of this nation regardless of race or region or party young or old rich or poor be the simple profound belief in opportunity for all the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility you can get ahead

 let ’s face it that belief have suffer some serious blow   over more than three decade even before the great recession hit massive shift in technology and global competition have eliminate a lot of good middle class job and weaken the economic foundation that family depend on

 today after four year of economic growth corporate profit and stock price have rarely be high and those at the top have never do well   but average wage have barely budge   inequality have deepen   upward mobility have stall   the cold hard fact be that even in the midst of recovery too many americans be work more than ever just to get by let alone get ahead   and too many still be n’t work at all

 our job be to reverse these trend   it will not happen right away and we will not agree on everything   but what i offer tonight be a set of concrete practical proposal to speed up growth strengthen the middle class and build new ladder of opportunity into the middle class   some require congressional action and i ’m eager to work with all of you   but america do not stand still and neither will i.   so wherever and whenever i can take step without legislation to expand opportunity for more american family that ’ what i ’m go to do

 as usual our first lady set a good example   michelle ’s let ’s move partnership with school business and local leader have help bring down childhood obesity rate for the first time in thirty year an achievement that will improve life and reduce health care cost for decade to come   the joining forces alliance that michelle and jill biden launch have already encourage employer to hire or train nearly 400,000 veteran and military spouse   take a page from that playbook the white house just organize a college opportunity summit where already 150 university business and nonprofit have make concrete commitment to reduce inequality in access to high education and help every hardworke kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus   across the country we ’re partner with mayor governor and state legislature on issue from homelessness to marriage equality

 the point be there be million of americans outside washington who be tired of stale political argument and be move this country forward   they believe and i believe that here in america our success should depend not on accident of birth but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dream   that ’ what draw our forebear here   it ’ how the daughter of a factory worker be ceo of america ’s large automaker how the son of a barkeeper be speaker of the house how the son of a single mom can be president of the great nation on earth

 opportunity be who we be   and the define project of our generation be to restore that promise

 we know where to start the good measure of opportunity be access to a good job   with the economy pick up speed company say they intend to hire more people this year   and over half of big manufacturer say they ’re think of insource job from abroad

 so let ’s make that decision easy for more company   both democrats and republicans have argue that our tax code be riddle with wasteful complicated loophole that punish business invest here and reward company that keep profit abroad   let ’s flip that equation   let ’s work together to close those loophole end those incentive to ship job overseas and low tax rate for business that create job here at home

 moreover we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create job rebuild our road upgrade our port unclog our commute because in today ’s global economy first class job gravitate to first class infrastructure   we ’ll need congress to protect more than three million job by finish transportation and waterway bill this summer   but i will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key project so we can get more construction worker on the job as fast as possible

 we also have the chance right now to beat other country in the race for the next wave of high tech manufacturing job   my administration have launch two hub for high tech manufacturing in raleigh and youngstown where we ’ve connect business to research university that can help america lead the world in advanced technology   tonight i ’m announce we ’ll launch six more this year   bipartisan bill in both house could double the number of these hub and the job they create   so get those bill to my desk and put more americans back to work

 let ’s do more to help the entrepreneur and small business owner who create most new job in america   over the past five year my administration have make more loan to small business owner than any other   and when ninety eight percent of our exporter be small business new trade partnership with europe and the asia pacific will help they create more job   we need to work together on tool like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our worker protect our environment and open new market to new good stamp make in the usa   china and europe be not stand on the sideline   neither should we

 we know that the nation that go all in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow   this be an edge america can not surrender   federally fund research help lead to the idea and invention behind google and smartphone   that ’ why congress should undo the damage do by last year ’s cut to basic research so we can unleash the next great american discovery whether it ’ vaccine that stay ahead of drug resistant bacteria or paper thin material that ’ strong than steel   and let ’s pass a patent reform bill that allow our business to stay focused on innovation not costly needless litigation

 now one of the big factor in bring more job back be our commitment to american energy   the all of the above energy strategy i announce a few year ago be work and today america be close to energy independence than we ’ve be in decade

 one of the reason why be natural gas if extract safely it ’ the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that cause climate change   business plan to invest almost $ 100 billion in new factory that use natural gas   i ’ll cut red tape to help state get those factory build and this congress can help by put people to work building fuel station that shift more car and truck from foreign oil to american natural gas   my administration will keep work with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthen protection of our air our water and our community   and while we ’re at it i ’ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal land for future generation

 it ’ not just oil and natural gas production that ’ boom we ’re become a global leader in solar too   every four minute another american home or business go solar every panel pound into place by a worker whose job can not be outsource   let ’s continue that progress with a smart tax policy that stop give $ 4 billion a year to fossil fuel industry that do not need it so that we can invest more in fuel of the future that do

 and even as we ’ve increase energy production we ’ve partner with business builder and local community to reduce the energy we consume   when we rescue our automaker for example we work with they to set high fuel efficiency standard for our car   in the come month i ’ll build on that success by set new standard for our truck so we can keep drive down oil import and what we pay at the pump

 take together our energy policy be create job and lead to a clean safe planet   over the past eight year the united states have reduce our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on earth   but we have to act with more urgency because a change climate be already harm western community struggle with drought and coastal city deal with flood that ’s why i direct my administration to work with state utility and other to set new standard on the amount of carbon pollution our power plant be allow to dump into the air   the shift to a clean energy economy will not happen overnight and it will require tough choice along the way   but the debate be settle   climate change be a fact   and when our child ’s child look we in the eye and ask if we do all we could to leave they a safe more stable world with new source of energy i want we to be able to sayyes we do

 finally if we be serious about economic growth it be time to heed the call of business leader labor leader faith leader and law enforcement and fix our broken immigration system   republicans and democrats in the senate have act   i know that member of both party in the house want to do the same   independent economist say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficit by almost $ 1 trillion in the next two decade   and for good reason when people come here to fulfill their dream to study invent and contribute to our culture they make our country a more attractive place for business to locate and create job for everyone   so let ’s get immigration reform do this year

 the idea i ’ve outline so far can speed up growth and create more job   but in this rapidly change economy we have to make sure that every american have the skill to fill those job

 the good news be we know how to do it   two year ago as the auto industry came roar back andra rush open up a manufacturing firm in detroit   she know that ford need part for the well sell truck in america and she know how to make they   she just need the workforce   so she dial up what we call an american job center place where folk can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job or well job   she be flood with new worker   and today detroit manufacturing systems have more than 700 employee

 what andra and her employee experience be how it should be for every employer and every job seeker   so tonight i ’ve ask vice president biden to lead an across the board reform of america ’s training program to make sure they have one mission train americans with the skill employer need and match they to good job that need to be fill right now   that mean more on the job training and more apprenticeship that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life   it mean connect company to community college that can help design training to fill their specific need   and if congress want to help you can concentrate funding on prove program that connect more ready to work americans with ready to be fill job

 i ’m also convince we can help americans return to the workforce fast by reform unemployment insurance so that it ’ more effective in today ’s economy   but first this congress need to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people

 let i tell you why

 misty demars be a mother of two young boy she ’d be steadily employ since she be a teenager   she put herself through college   she ’d never collect unemployment benefit   in may she and her husband use their life saving to buy their first home   a week later budget cut claim the job she love   last month when their unemployment insurance be cut off she sit down and write i a letter the kind i get every day   we be the face of the unemployment crisis she write   i be not dependent on the government our country depend on people like we who build career contribute to society care about our neighbor i be confident that in time i will find a job i will pay my taxis and we will raise our child in their own home in the community we love   please give we this chance

 congress give these hardworking responsible americans that chance   they need our help but more important this country need they in the game   that ’ why i ’ve be ask ceo to give more long term unemployed worker a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their family this week many will come to the white house to make that commitment real   tonight i ask every business leader in america to join we and to do the same because we be strong when america field a full team

 of course it ’ not enough to train today ’s workforce   we also have to prepare tomorrow ’s workforce by guarantee every child access to a world class education

 estiven rodriguez could not speak a word of english when he move to new york city at age nine   but last month thank to the support of great teacher and an innovative tutoring program he lead a march of his classmate through a crowd of cheer parent and neighbor from their high school to the post office where they mail off their college application   and this son of a factory worker just find out he ’s go to college this fall

 five year ago we set out to change the odd for all our kid   we work with lender to reform student loan and today more young people be earn college degree than ever before   race to the top with the help of governor from both party have help state raise expectation and performance   teacher and principal in school from tennessee to washington d.c. be make big stride in prepare student with skill for the new economy problem solve critical thinking science technology engineering and math   some of this change be hard   it require everything from more challenging curriculum and more demanding parent to well support for teacher and new way to measure how well our kid think not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test   but it ’ worth it and it ’ work

 the problem be we ’re still not reach enough kid and we ’re not reach they in time   that have to change

 research show that one of the good investment we can make in a child ’s life be high quality early education   last year i ask this congress to help state make high quality pre k available to every four year old   as a parent as well as a president i repeat that request tonight but in the meantime thirty state have raise pre k funding on their own   they know we can not wait   so just as we work with state to reform our school this year we ’ll invest in new partnership with state and community across the country in a race to the top for our young child   and as congress decide what it ’s go to do i ’m go to pull together a coalition of elect official business leader and philanthropist willing to help more kid access the high quality pre k they need

 last year i also pledge to connect 99 percent of our student to high speed broadband over the next four year   tonight i can announce that with the support of the fcc and company like apple microsoft sprint and verizon we ’ve get a down payment to start connect more than 15,000 school and twenty million student over the next two year without add a dime to the deficit

 we ’re work to redesign high school and partner they with college and employer that offer the real world education and hand on training that can lead directly to a job and career   we ’re shake up our system of high education to give parent more information and college more incentive to offer well value so that no middle class kid be price out of a college education   we ’re offer million the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payment to ten percent of their income and i want to work with congress to see how we can help even more americans who feel trap by student loan debt   and i ’m reach out to some of america ’s lead foundation and corporation on a new initiativeto help more young man of color face tough odd stay on track and reach their full potential

 the bottom line be michelle and i want every child to have the same chance this country give we   but we know our opportunity agenda will not be complete and too many young people enter the workforce today will see the american dream as an empty promise unless we do more to make sure our economy honor the dignity of work and hard work pay off for every single american

 today woman make up about half our workforce   but they still make 77 cent for every dollar a man earn   that be wrong and in 2014 it ’ an embarrassment a woman deserve equal pay for equal work   she deserve to have a baby without sacrifice her job   a mother deserve a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without run into hardship and you know what a father do too   it ’ time to do away with workplace policy that belong in a mad man episode   this year let ’s all come together congress the white house and business from wall street to main street to give every woman the opportunity she deserve   because i firmly believe when woman succeed america succeed

 now woman hold a majority of low wage job but they ’re not the only one stifle by stagnant wage   americans understand that some people will earn more than other and we do not resent those who by virtue of their effort achieve incredible success   but americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who work full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty

 in the year since i ask this congress to raise the minimum wage five state have pass law to raise theirs   many business have do it on their own   nick chute be here tonight with his boss john soranno   john ’s an owner of punch pizza in minneapolis and nick help make the dough   only now he make more of it john just give his employee a raise to ten buck an hour a decision that ease their financial stress and boost their morale

 tonight i ask more of america ’s business leader to follow john ’s lead and do what you can to raise your employee wage   to every mayor governor and state legislator in america i say you do not have to wait for congress to act americans will support you if you take this on   and as a chief executive i intend to lead by example profitable corporation like costco see high wage as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover we should too   in the come week i will issue an executive order require federal contractor to pay their federally fund employee a fair wage of at least $ 10.10 an hour because if you cook our troop meal or wash their dish you should not have to live in poverty

 of course to reach million more congress need to get on board today the federal minimum wage be worth about twenty percent less than it be when ronald reagan first stand here   tom harkin and george miller have a bill to fix that by lift the minimum wage to $ 10.10   this will help family   it will give business customer with more money to spend   it do not involve any new bureaucratic program   so join the rest of the country   say yes   give america a raise

 there be other step we can take to help family make end meet and few be more effective at reduce inequality and help family pull themselves up through hard work than the earned income tax credit   right now it help about half of all parent at some point   but i agree with republicans like senator rubio that it do not do enough for single worker who do not have kid   so let ’s work together to strengthen the credit reward work and help more americans get ahead

 let ’s do more to help americans save for retirement today most worker do not have a pension   a social security check often be not enough on its own   and while the stock market have double over the last five year that do not help folk who do not have 401ks   that ’ why tomorrow i will direct the treasury to create a new way for work americans to start their own retirement saving myra it ’ a new saving bond that encourage folk to build a nest egg   myra guarantee a decent return with no risk of lose what you put in   and if this congress want to help work with i to fix an upside down tax code that give big tax break to help the wealthy save but do little to nothing for middle class americans   offer every american access to an automatic ira on the job so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can   and since the most important investment many family make be their home send i legislation that protect taxpayer from foot the bill for a housing crisis ever again and keep the dream of homeownership alive for future generation of americans

 one last point on financial security   for decade few thing expose hard work family to economic hardship more than a broken health care system   and in case you have not hear we ’re in the process of fix that

 a pre existing condition use to mean that someone like amanda shelley a physician assistant and single mom from arizona could not get health insurance   but on january 1st she get cover   on january 3rd she feel a sharp pain   on january 6th she have emergency surgery   just one week early amanda say that surgery would ’ve mean bankruptcy

 that ’ what health insurance reform be all about the peace of mind that if misfortune strike you do not have to lose everything

 already because of the affordable care act more than three million americans under age 26 have gain coverage under their parent plan

 more than nine million americans have sign up for private health insurance or medicaid coverage

 and here ’s another number zero   because of this law no american can ever again be drop or deny coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma back pain or cancer no woman can ever be charge more just because she ’ a woman   and we do all this while add year to medicare ’s finance keep medicare premium flat and lower prescription cost for million of senior

 now i do not expect to convince my republican friend on the merit of this law   but i know that the american people be not interested in refighte old battle   so again if you have specific plan to cut cost cover more people and increase choice tell america what you ’d do differently   let ’s see if the number add up   but let ’s not have another forty something vote to repeal a law that ’s already help million of americans like amanda   the first forty be plenty   we get it   we all owe it to the american people to say what we ’re for not just what we ’re against

 and if you want to know the real impact this law be have just talk to governor steve beshear of kentucky who ’s here tonight   kentucky ’s not the most liberal part of the country but he ’s like a man possess when it come to cover his commonwealth ’s family   they be our friend and neighbor he say   they be people we shop and go to church with farmer out on the tractor grocery clerk they be people who go to work every morning pray they do not get sick   no one deserve to live that way

 steve ’s right   that ’ why tonight i ask every american who know someone without health insurance to help they get cover by march 31st   mom get on your kid to sign up   kid call your mom and walk she through the application   it will give she some peace of mind plus she ’ll appreciate hearing from you

 after all that ’s the spirit that have always move this nation forward   it ’ the spirit of citizenship the recognition that through hard work and responsibility we can pursue our individual dream but still come together as one american family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dream as well

 citizenship mean stand up for everyone ’s right to vote   last year part of the voting rights act be weaken   but conservative republicans and liberal democrats be work together to strengthen it and the bipartisan commission i appoint last year have offer reform so that no one have to wait more than a half hour to vote   let ’s support these effort   it should be the power of our vote not the size of our bank account that drive our democracy

 citizenship mean stand up for the life that gun violence steal from we each day   i have see the courage of parent student pastor and police officer all over this country who say we be not afraid and i intend to keep try with or without congress to help stop more tragedy from visit innocent americans in our movie theater shopping mall or school like sandy hook

 citizenship demand a sense of common cause participation in the hard work of self government an obligation to serve to our community   and i know this chamber agree that few americans give more to their country than our diplomat and the man and woman of the united states armed forces

 tonight because of the extraordinary troop and civilian who risk and lie down their life to keep we free the united states be more secure   when i take office nearly 180,000 americans be serve in iraq and afghanistan   today all our troop be out of iraq   more than 60,000 of our troop have already come home from afghanistan   with afghan force now in the lead for their own security our troop have move to a support role together with our ally we will complete our mission there by the end of this year and america ’s long war will finally be over

 after 2014 we will support a unified afghanistan as it take responsibility for its own future   if the afghan government sign a security agreement that we have negotiate a small force of americans could remain in afghanistan with nato ally to carry out two narrow mission training and assist afghan force and counterterrorism operation to pursue any remnant of al qaeda   for while our relationship with afghanistan will change one thing will not our resolve that terrorist do not launch attack against our country

 the fact be that danger remain   while we have put al qaeda ’s core leadership on a path to defeat the threat have evolve as al qaeda affiliate and other extremist take root in different part of the world in yemen somalia iraq and mali we have to keep work with partner to disrupt and disable these network in syria we ’ll support the opposition that reject   the agenda of terrorist network here at home we ’ll keep strengthen our defense and combat new threat like cyberattack   and as we reform our defense budget we have to keep faith with our man and woman in uniform and invest in the capability they need to succeed in future mission

 we have to remain vigilant   but i strongly believe our leadership and our security can not depend on our military alone as commander in chief i have use force when need to protect the american people and i will never hesitate to do so as long as i hold this office   but i will not send our troop into harm ’s way unless it ’ truly necessary nor will i allow our son and daughter to be mire in open ended conflict   we must fight the battle that need to be fight not those that terrorist prefer from we large scale deployment that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism

 so even as we aggressively pursue terrorist network through more target effort and by build the capacity of our foreign partner america must move off a permanent war footing   that ’ why i ’ve impose prudent limit on the use of drone for we will not be safe if people abroad believe we strike within their country without regard for the consequence   that ’ why work with this congress i will reform our surveillance program because the vital work of our intelligence community depend on public confidence here and abroad that the privacy of ordinary people be not be violate   and with the afghan war end this need to be the year congress lift the remain restriction on detainee transfer and we close the prison at guantanamo bay because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action but by remain true to our constitutional ideal and set an example for the rest of the world

 you see in a world of complex threat our security and leadership depend on all element of our power include strong and principled diplomacy   american diplomacy have rally more than fifty country to prevent nuclear material from fall into the wrong hand and allow we to reduce our own reliance on cold war stockpile   american diplomacy back by the threat of force be why syria ’s chemical weapon be be eliminate and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the syrian people deserve a future free of dictatorship terror and fear as we speak american diplomacy be support israelis and palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talk to end the conflict there to achieve dignity and an independent state for palestinians and last peace and security for the state of israel a jewish state that know america will always be at their side

 and it be american diplomacy back by pressure that have halt the progress of iran ’s nuclear program and roll part of that program back for the very first time in a decade   as we gather here tonight iran have begin to eliminate its stockpile of high level of enriched uranium   it be not instal advanced centrifuge   unprecedented inspection help the world verify every day that iran be not build a bomb   and with our ally and partner we ’re engage in negotiation to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share prevent iran from obtain a nuclear weapon

 these negotiation will be difficult   they may not succeed   we be clear eyed about iran ’s support for terrorist organization like hezbollah which threaten our ally and the mistrust between our nation can not be wish away   but these negotiation do not rely on trust any long term deal we agree to must be base on verifiable action that convince we and the international community that iran be not build a nuclear bomb   if john f. kennedy and ronald reagan could negotiate with the soviet union then surely a strong and confident america can negotiate with less powerful adversary today

 the sanction that we put in place help make this opportunity possible   but let i be clear if this congress send i a new sanction bill now that threaten to derail these talk i will veto it   for the sake of our national security we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed   if iran ’s leader do not seize this opportunity then i will be the first to call for more sanction and stand ready to exercise all option to make sure iran do not build a nuclear weapon   but if iran ’s leader do seize the chance then iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nation and we will have resolve one of the lead security challenge of our time without the risk of war

 finally let ’s remember that our leadership be define not just by our defense against threat but by the enormous opportunity to do good and promote understanding around the globe to forge great cooperation to expand new market to free people from fear and want   and no one be well position to take advantage of those opportunity than america

 our alliance with europe remain the strong the world have ever know   from tunisia to burma we ’re support those who be willing to do the hard work of build democracy   in ukraine we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and have a say in their country ’s future   across africa we ’re bring together business and government to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty   in the americas we be build new tie of commerce but we ’re also expand cultural and educational exchange among young people   and we will continue to focus on the asia pacific where we support our ally shape a future of great security and prosperity and extend a hand to those devastate by disaster as we do in the philippines when our marines and civilian rush to aid those batter by a typhoon and be greet with word like we will never forget your kindness and god bless america

 we do these thing because they help promote our long term security   and we do they because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being regardless of race or religion creed or sexual orientation   and next week the world will see one expression of that commitment when team usa march the red white and blue into the olympic stadium and bring home the gold

 my fellow americans no other country in the world do what we do   on every issue the world turn to we not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might but because of the ideal we stand for and the burden we bear to advance they

 no one know this well than those who serve in uniform   as this time of war draw to a close a new generation of hero return to civilian life   we ’ll keep slash that backlog so our veteran receive the benefit they ’ve earn and our wounded warrior receive the health care include the mental health care that they need   we ’ll keep work to help all our veteran translate their skill and leadership into job here at home   and we all continue to join force to honor and support our remarkable military family

 let i tell you about one of those family i ’ve come to know

 i first meet cory remsburg a proud army ranger at omaha beach on the 65th anniversary of d day   along with some of his fellow rangers he walk i through the program a strong impressive young man with an easy manner sharp as a tack   we joke around and take picture and i tell he to stay in touch

 a few month later on his tenth deployment cory be nearly kill by a massive roadside bomb in afghanistan his comrade find he in a canal face down underwater shrapnel in his brain

 for month he lie in a coma   the next time i meet he in the hospital he could not speak he could barely move   over the year he ’s endure dozen of surgery and procedure and hour of gruele rehab every day

 even now cory be still blind in one eye   he still struggle on his left side   but slowly steadily with the support of caregiver like his dad craig and the community around he cory have grow strong day by day he ’s learn to speak again and stand again and walk again and he ’s work toward the day when he can serve his country again

 my recovery have not be easy he say nothing in life that ’ worth anything be easy

 cory be here tonight   and like the army he love like the america he serve sergeant first class cory remsburg never give up and he do not quit

 my fellow americans man and woman like cory remind we that america have never come easy   our freedom our democracy have never be easy   sometimes we stumble we make mistake we get frustrated or discourage   but for more than two hundred year we have put those thing aside and place our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress to create and build and expand the possibility of individual achievement to free other nation from tyranny and fear to promote justice and fairness and equality under the law so that the word set to paper by our founder be make real for every citizen   the america we want for our kid a rise america where honest work be plentiful and community be strong where prosperity be widely shared and opportunity for all let we go as far as our dream and toil will take we none of it be easy   but if we work together if we summon what be good in we with our foot plant firmly in today but our eye cast towards tomorrow i know it ’s within our reach

 believe it

 god bless you and god bless the united states of america

my fellow americans tonight i ’d like to talk with you about immigration

 for more than 200 year our tradition of welcome immigrant from around the world have give we a tremendous advantage over other nation it ’s keep we youthful dynamic and entrepreneurial it have shape our character as a people with limitless possibility people not trap by our past but able to remake ourselves as we choose

 but today our immigration system be break and everybody know it

 family who enter our country the right way and play by the rule watch other flout the rule business owner who offer their worker good wage and benefit see the competition exploit undocumented immigrant by pay they far less all of we take offense to anyone who reap the reward of live in america without take on the responsibility of live in america and undocumented immigrant who desperately want to embrace those responsibility see little option but to remain in the shadow or risk their family be tear apart

 it ’s be this way for decade and for decade we have not do much about it

 when i take office i commit to fix this broken immigration system and i begin by do what i could to secure our border today we have more agent and technology deploy to secure our southern border than at any time in our history and over the past six year illegal border crossing have be cut by more than half although this summer there be a brief spike in unaccompanied child be apprehend at our border the number of such child be now actually low than it ’s be in nearly two year overall the number of people try to cross our border illegally be at its low level since the 1970 those be the fact

 meanwhile i work with congress on a comprehensive fix and last year 68 democrats republicans and independent come together to pass a bipartisan bill in the senate it be n’t perfect it be a compromise but it reflect common sense it would have double the number of border patrol agent while give undocumented immigrant a pathway to citizenship if they pay a fine start pay their taxis and go to the back of the line and independent expert say that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficit

 have the house of representatives allow that kind of bill a simple yes or no vote it would have pass with support from both party and today it would be the law but for a year and a half now republican leader in the house have refuse to allow that simple vote

 now i continue to believe that the good way to solve this problem be by work together to pass that kind of common sense law but until that happen there be action i have the legal authority to take as president the same kind of action take by democratic and republican president before i that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just

 tonight i be announce those action

 first we ’ll build on our progress at the border with additional resource for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossing and speed the return of those who do cross over

 second i ’ll make it easy and fast for high skilled immigrant graduate and entrepreneur to stay and contribute to our economy as so many business leader have propose

 third we ’ll take step to deal responsibly with the million of undocumented immigrant who already live in our country

 i want to say more about this third issue because it generate the most passion and controversy even as we be a nation of immigrant we ’re also a nation of law undocumented worker break our immigration law and i believe that they must be hold accountable especially those who may be dangerous that ’ why over the past six year deportation of criminal be up 80 percent and that ’ why we ’re go to keep focus enforcement resource on actual threat to our security felon not family criminal not child gang member not a mom who ’s work hard to provide for her kid we ’ll prioritize just like law enforcement do every day

 but even as we focus on deport criminal the fact be million of immigrant in every state of every race and nationality still live here illegally and let ’s be honest track down round up and deport million of people be n’t realistic anyone who suggest otherwise be n’t be straight with you it ’s also not who we be as americans after all most of these immigrant have be here a long time they work hard often in tough low pay job they support their family they worship at our church many of their kid be american bear or spend most of their life here and their hope dream and patriotism be just like our as my predecessor president bush once put it they be a part of american life

 now here ’ the thing we expect people who live in this country to play by the rule we expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly reward so we ’re go to offer the follow deal if you ’ve be in america for more than five year if you have child who be american citizen or legal resident if you register pass a criminal background check and you ’re willing to pay your fair share of taxis you ’ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation you can come out of the shadow and get right with the law that ’ what this deal be

 now let ’s be clear about what it be n’t this deal do not apply to anyone who have come to this country recently it do not apply to anyone who might come to america illegally in the future it do not grant citizenship or the right to stay here permanently or offer the same benefit that citizen receive only congress can do that all we ’re say be we ’re not go to deport you

 i know some of the critic of this action call it amnesty well it ’ not amnesty be the immigration system we have today million of people who live here without pay their taxis or play by the rule while politician use the issue to scare people and whip up vote at election time

 that ’ the real amnesty leave this broken system the way it be mass amnesty would be unfair mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character what i ’m describe be accountability a common sense middle ground approach if you meet the criterion you can come out of the shadow and get right with the law if you ’re a criminal you ’ll be deport if you plan to enter the u.s. illegally your chance of getting catch and send back just go up

 the action i ’m take be not only lawful they ’re the kind of action take by every single republican president and every single democratic president for the past half century and to those member of congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work well or question the wisdom of i act where congress have fail i have one answer pass a bill

 i want to work with both party to pass a more permanent legislative solution and the day i sign that bill into law the action i take will no long be necessary meanwhile do not let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue that ’ not how our democracy work and congress certainly should not shut down our government again just because we disagree on this americans be tired of gridlock what our country need from we right now be a common purpose a high purpose

 most americans support the type of reform i ’ve talk about tonight but i understand the disagreement hold by many of you at home million of we myself include go back generation in this country with ancestor who put in the painstaking work to become citizen so we do n’t like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to american citizenship

 i know some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we be or take our job or stick it to middle class family at a time when they already feel like they ’ve get the raw deal for over a decade i hear these concern but that ’s not what these step would do our history and the fact show that immigrant be a net plus for our economy and our society and i believe it ’ important that all of we have this debate without impugn each other ’s character

 because for all the back and forth of washington we have to remember that this debate be about something big it ’ about who we be as a country and who we want to be for future generation

 be we a nation that tolerate the hypocrisy of a system where worker who pick our fruit and make our bed never have a chance to get right with the law or be we a nation that give they a chance to make amend take responsibility and give their kid a well future

 be we a nation that accept the cruelty of rip child from their parent arm or be we a nation that value family and work together to keep they together

 be we a nation that educate the world ’s good and bright in our university only to send they home to create business in country that compete against we or be we a nation that encourage they to stay and create job here create business here create industry right here in america

 that ’ what this debate be all about we need more than politic as usual when it come to immigration we need reason thoughtful compassionate debate that focus on our hope not our fear i know the politic of this issue be tough but let i tell you why i have come to feel so strongly about it

 over the past few year i have see the determination of immigrant father who work two or three job without take a dime from the government and at risk any moment of lose it all just to build a well life for their kid i ’ve see the heartbreak and anxiety of child whose mother might be take away from they just because they do not have the right paper i ’ve see the courage of student who except for the circumstance of their birth be as american as malia or sasha student who bravely come out as undocumented in hope they could make a difference in the country they love

 these people our neighbor our classmate our friend they do not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life they come to work and study and serve in our military and above all contribute to america ’s success

 tomorrow i ’ll travel to las vegas and meet with some of these student include a young woman name astrid silva astrid be bring to america when she be four year old her only possession be a cross her doll and the frilly dress she have on when she start school she do not speak any english she catch up to other kid by read newspaper and watch pbs and she become a good student her father work in landscaping her mom clean other people ’s home they would not let astrid apply to a technology magnet school not because they do not love she but because they be afraid the paperwork would out she as an undocumented immigrant so she apply behind their back and get in still she mostly live in the shadow until her grandmother who visit every year from mexico pass away and she could not travel to the funeral without risk of be find out and deport it be around that time she decide to begin advocate for herself and other like she and today astrid silva be a college student work on her third degree

 be we a nation that kick out a strive hopeful immigrant like astrid or be we a nation that find a way to welcome she in scripture tell we that we shall not oppress a stranger for we know the heart of a stranger we be stranger once too

 my fellow americans we be and always will be a nation of immigrant we be stranger once too and whether our forebear be stranger who cross the atlantic or the pacific or the rio grande we be here only because this country welcome they in and teach they that to be an american be about something more than what we look like or what our last name be or how we worship what make we americans be our share commitment to an ideal that all of we be create equal and all of we have the chance to make of our life what we will

 that ’ the country our parent and grandparent and generation before they build for we that ’ the tradition we must uphold that ’ the legacy we must leave for those who be yet to come

 thank you god bless you and god bless this country we love

mr. speaker mr. vice president members of congress my fellow americans

 we be 15 year into this new century   fifteen year that dawn with terror touch our shore that unfold with a new generation fight two long and costly war that see a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world   it have be and still be a hard time for many

 but tonight we turn the page   tonight after a breakthrough year for america our economy be grow and create job at the fast pace since 1999   applause   our unemployment rate be now low than it be before the financial crisis   more of our kid be graduate than ever before   more of our people be insure than ever before   applause   and we be as free from the grip of foreign oil as we ’ve be in almost 30 year   applause

 tonight for the first time since 9/11 our combat mission in afghanistan be over   applause   six year ago nearly 180,000 american troop serve in iraq and afghanistan   today few than 15,000 remain   and we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 generation who have serve to keep we safe   applause   we be humble and grateful for your service

 america for all that we have endure for all the grit and hard work require to come back for all the task that lie ahead know this   the shadow of crisis have pass and the state of the union be strong   applause

 at this moment with a grow economy shrink deficit bustling industry boom energy production we have rise from recession free to write our own future than any other nation on earth   it ’ now up to we to choose who we want to be over the next 15 year and for decade to come

 will we accept an economy where only a few of we do spectacularly well   or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generate rise income and chance for everyone who make the effort   applause

 will we approach the world fearful and reactive drag into costly conflict that strain our military and set back our standing   or will we lead wisely use all element of our power to defeat new threat and protect our planet

 will we allow ourselves to be sort into faction and turn against one another   or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that have always propel america forward

 in two week i will send this congress a budget fill with idea that be practical not partisan   and in the month ahead i ’ll crisscross the country make a case for those idea   so tonight i want to focus less on a checklist of proposal and focus more on the value at stake in the choice before we

 it begin with our economy   seven year ago rebekah and ben erler of minneapolis be newlywed   laughter   she wait table   he work construction   their first child jack be on the way   they be young and in love in america   and it do not get much well than that   if only we have know rebekah write to i last spring what be about to happen to the housing and construction market

 as the crisis worsen ben ’s business dry up so he take what job he could find even if they keep he on the road for long stretch of time   rebekah take out student loan and enrol in community college and retrain for a new career   they sacrifice for each other   and slowly it pay off   they buy their first home   they have a second son henry   rebekah get a well job and then a raise   ben be back in construction and home for dinner every night

 it be amazing rebekah write what you can bounce back from when you have to we be a strong tight knit family who have make it through some very very hard time   we be a strong tight knit family who have make it through some very very hard time

 america rebekah and ben ’s story be our story   they represent the million who have work hard and scrimp and sacrifice and retool   you be the reason that i run for this office   you be the people i be think of six year ago today in the dark month of the crisis when i stand on the step of this capitol and promise we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation   and it have be your resilience your effort that have make it possible for our country to emerge strong

 we believe we could reverse the tide of outsource and draw new job to our shore   and over the past five year our business have create more than 11 million new job   applause

 we believe we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet   and today america be number one in oil and gas   america be number one in wind power   every three week we bring online as much solar power as we do in all of 2008 applause   and thank to low gas price and high fuel standard the typical family this year should save about $ 750 at the pump   applause

 we believe we could prepare our kid for a more competitive world   and today our young student have earn the high math and read score on record   our high school graduation rate have hit an all time high   more americans finish college than ever before   applause

 we believe that sensible regulation could prevent another crisis shield family from ruin and encourage fair competition   today we have new tool to stop taxpayer fund bailout and a new consumer watchdog to protect we from predatory lending and abusive credit card practice   and in the past year alone about 10 million uninsured americans finally gain the security of health coverage   applause

 at every step we be tell our goal be misguide or too ambitious that we would crush job and explode deficit   instead we ’ve see the fast economic growth in over a decade our deficit cut by two third a stock market that have double and health care inflation at its low rate in 50 year   applause   this be good news people   laughter and applause

 so the verdict be clear   middle class economic work   expand opportunity work   and these policy will continue to work as long as politic do not get in the way   we can not slow down business or put our economy at risk with government shutdown or fiscal showdown   we can not put the security of family at risk by take away their health insurance or unravel the new rule on wall street or refighte past battle on immigration when we ’ve get to fix a broken system   and if a bill come to my desk that try to do any of these thing i will veto it   it will have earn my veto   applause

 today thank to a grow economy the recovery be touch more and more life   wage be finally start to rise again   we know that more small business owner plan to raise their employee pay than at any time since 2007   but here ’ the thing   those of we here tonight we need to set our sight high than just make sure government do not screw thing up that government do not halt the progress we ’re make   we need to do more than just do no harm   tonight together let ’s do more to restore the link between hard work and grow opportunity for every american   applause

 because family like rebekah ’s still need our help   she and ben be work as hard as ever but they ’ve have to forego vacation and a new car so that they can pay off student loan and save for retirement   friday night pizza that ’ a big splurge   basic childcare for jack and henry cost more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the university of minnesota   like million of hardworke americans rebekah be not ask for a handout but she be ask that we look for more way to help family get ahead

 and in fact at every moment of economic change throughout our history this country have take bold action to adapt to new circumstance and to make sure everyone get a fair shot   we set up worker protection social security medicare medicaid to protect ourselves from the harsh adversity   we give our citizen school and college infrastructure and the internet tool they need to go as far as their effort and their dream will take they

 that ’ what middle class economic be the idea that this country do well when everyone get their fair shot everyone do their fair share everyone play by the same set of rule   applause   we do not just want everyone to share in america ’s success we want everyone to contribute to our success   applause

 so what do middle class economic require in our time

 first middle class economic mean help work family feel more secure in a world of constant change   that mean help folk afford childcare college health care a home retirement   and my budget will address each of these issue lower the taxis of work family and put thousand of dollar back into their pocket each year   applause

 here ’ one example   during world war ii when man like my grandfather go off to war have woman like my grandmother in the workforce be a national security priority so this country provide universal childcare   in today ’s economy when have both parent in the workforce be an economic necessity for many family we need affordable high quality childcare more than ever   applause

 it ’ not a nice to have it ’ a must have   so it ’ time we stop treat childcare as a side issue or as a woman ’s issue and treat it like the national economic priority that it be for all of we   applause   and that ’ why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle class and low income family with young child in america by create more slot and a new tax cut of up to $ 3,000 per child per year   applause

 here ’ another example   today we be the only advanced country on earth that do not guarantee pay sick leave or pay maternity leave to our worker   forty three million worker have no pay sick leave 43 million   think about that   and that force too many parent to make the gut wrench choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home   so i ’ll be take new action to help state adopt pay leave law of their own   and since pay sick leave win where it be on the ballot last november let ’s put it to a vote right here in washington   applause   send i a bill that give every worker in america the opportunity to earn seven day of pay sick leave   it ’ the right thing to do   it ’ the right thing to do   applause

 of course nothing help family make end meet like high wage   that ’ why this congress still need to pass a law that make sure a woman be pay the same as a man for do the same work   applause   it ’ 2015   laughter   it ’ time   we still need to make sure employee get the overtime they ’ve earn   applause   and to everyone in this congress who still refuse to raise the minimum wage i say this   if you truly believe you could work full time and support a family on less than $ 15,000 a year try it   if not vote to give million of the hard work people in america a raise   applause

 now these idea will not make everybody rich will not relieve every hardship   that ’s not the job of government   to give work family a fair shot we still need more employer to see beyond next quarter ’s earning and recognize that invest in their workforce be in their company ’s long term interest   we still need law that strengthen rather than weaken union and give american worker a voice   applause

 but you know thing like childcare and sick leave and equal pay thing like low mortgage premium and a high minimum wage these idea will make a meaningful difference in the life of million of family   that ’ a fact   and that ’ what all of we republicans and democrats alike be send here to do

 second to make sure folk keep earn high wage down the road we have to do more to help americans upgrade their skill   applause   america thrive in the 20th century because we make high school free send a generation of gi to college train the good workforce in the world   we be ahead of the curve   but other country catch on   and in a 21st century economy that reward knowledge like never before we need to up our game   we need to do more

 by the end of this decade two in three job opening will require some high education two in three   and yet we still live in a country where too many bright strive americans be price out of the education they need   it ’ not fair to they and it ’ sure not smart for our future   that ’ why i ’m send this congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero   applause

 of course if there ’ one thing this new century have teach we it ’s that we can not separate our work here at home from challenge beyond our shore

 my first duty as commander in chief be to defend the united states of america   in do so the question be not whether america lead in the world but how   when we make rash decision react to the headline instead of use our head when the first response to a challenge be to send in our military then we risk getting draw into unnecessary conflict and neglect the broad strategy we need for a safe more prosperous world   that ’ what our enemy want we to do

 i believe in a smart kind of american leadership   we lead well when we combine military power with strong diplomacy when we leverage our power with coalition building when we do not let our fear blind we to the opportunity that this new century present   that ’s exactly what we ’re do right now   and around the globe it be make a difference

 first we stand united with people around the world who have be target by terrorist from a school in pakistan to the street of paris   applause   we will continue to hunt down terrorist and dismantle their network and we reserve the right to act unilaterally as we have do relentlessly since i take office to take out terrorist who pose a direct threat to we and our ally applause

 at the same time we ’ve learn some costly lesson over the last 13 year   instead of americans patrol the valley of afghanistan we ’ve train their security force who have now take the lead and we ’ve honor our troop sacrifice by support that country ’s first democratic transition   instead of send large ground force overseas we ’re partner with nation from south asia to north africa to deny safe haven to terrorist who threaten america

 in iraq and syria american leadership include our military power be stop isil ’s advance   instead of getting drag into another ground war in the middle east we be lead a broad coalition include arab nation to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group   applause   we ’re also support a moderate opposition in syria that can help we in this effort and assist people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism

 now this effort will take time   it will require focus   but we will succeed   and tonight i call on this congress to show the world that we be unite in this mission by pass a resolution to authorize the use of force against isil   we need that authority   applause

 second we ’re demonstrate the power of american strength and diplomacy   we ’re uphold the principle that big nation can not bully the small by oppose russian aggression and support ukraine ’s democracy and reassure our nato ally   applause

 last year as we be do the hard work of impose sanction along with our ally as we be reinforce our presence with frontline state mr. putin ’s aggression it be suggest be a masterful display of strategy and strength   that be what i hear from some folk   well today it be america that stand strong and unite with our ally while russia be isolate with its economy in tatter   that ’ how america lead not with bluster but with persistent steady resolve   applause

 in cuba we be end a policy that be long past its expiration date   applause   when what you ’re do do n’t work for 50 year it ’ time to try something new   applause   and our shift in cuba policy have the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere   it remove a phony excuse for restriction in cuba   it stand up for democratic value and extend the hand of friendship to the cuban people   and this year congress should begin the work of end the embargo   applause

 our diplomacy be at work with respect to iran where for the first time in a decade we ’ve halt the progress of its nuclear program and reduce its stockpile of nuclear material   between now and this spring we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevent a nuclear arm iran secure america and our ally include israel while avoid yet another middle east conflict there be no guarantee that negotiation will succeed and i keep all option on the table to prevent a nuclear iran

 but new sanction pass by this congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fail alienate america from its ally make it hard to maintain sanction and ensure that iran start up its nuclear program again   it do not make sense   and that be why i will veto any new sanction bill that threaten to undo this progress   applause   the american people expect we only to go to war as a last resort and i intend to stay true to that wisdom

 third we ’re look beyond the issue that have consume we in the past to shape the come century   no foreign nation no hacker should be able to shut down our network steal our trade secret or invade the privacy of american family especially our kid   applause   so we be make sure our government integrate intelligence to combat cyber threat just as we have do to combat terrorism

 and tonight i urge this congress to finally pass the legislation we need to well meet the evolve threat of cyber attack combat identity theft and protect our child ’s information   that should be a bipartisan effort   applause

 if we do n’t act we ’ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable   if we do we can continue to protect the technology that have unleash untold opportunity for people around the globe

 i ’ve hear some folk try to dodge the evidence by say they ’re not scientist that we do not have enough information to act   well i ’m not a scientist either   but you know what i know a lot of really good scientist at nasa and at noaa and at our major university   and the good scientist in the world be all tell we that our activity be change the climate and if we do not act forcefully we ’ll continue to see rise ocean long hotter heat wave dangerous drought and flood and massive disruption that can trigger great migration and conflict and hunger around the globe   the pentagon say that climate change pose immediate risk to our national security   we should act like it   applause

 and that ’ why over the past six year we ’ve do more than ever to combat climate change from the way we produce energy to the way we use it   that ’ why we ’ve set aside more public land and water than any administration in history   and that ’ why i will not let this congress endanger the health of our child by turn back the clock on our effort   i be determined to make sure that american leadership drive international action   applause

 in beijing we make a historic announcement   the united states will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution   and china commit for the first time to limit their emission   and because the world ’s two large economy come together other nation be now step up and offer hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we ’ve get

 and there ’ one last pillar of our leadership and that ’s the example of our value

 as americans we respect human dignity even when we ’re threaten which be why i have prohibit torture and work to make sure our use of new technology like drone be properly constrain   applause   it ’ why we speak out against the deplorable anti semitism that have resurface in certain part of the world   applause   it ’ why we continue to reject offensive stereotype of muslims the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace   that ’ why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoner and condemn the persecution of woman or religious minority or people who be lesbian gay bisexual or transgender   we do these thing not only because they be the right thing to do but because ultimately they will make we safe   applause

 as americans we have a profound commitment to justice   so it make no sense to spend $ 3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemn and terrorist use to recruit   applause   since i ’ve be president we ’ve work responsibly to cut the population of gitmo in half   now it be time to finish the job   and i will not relent in my determination to shut it down   it be not who we be   it ’ time to close gitmo   applause

 as americans we cherish our civil liberty and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other country and industry in our fight against terrorist network   so while some have move on from the debate over our surveillance program i have not   as promise our intelligence agency have work hard with the recommendation of privacy advocate to increase transparency and build more safeguard against potential abuse   and next month we ’ll issue a report on how we ’re keep our promise to keep our country safe while strengthen privacy

 look to the future instead of the past   make sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely   building coalition to meet new challenge and opportunity   lead always with the example of our value   that ’ what make we exceptional   that ’ what keep we strong   that ’ why we have to keep strive to hold ourselves to the high of standard our own

 you know just over a decade ago i give a speech in boston where i say there be n’t a liberal america or a conservative america a black america or a white america but a united states of america   i say this because i have see it in my own life in a nation that give someone like i a chance because i grow up in hawaii a melt pot of race and custom because i make illinois my home a state of small town rich farmland one of the world ’s great city a microcosm of the country where democrats and republicans and independents good people of every ethnicity and every faith share certain bedrock value

 over the past six year the pundit have point out more than once that my presidency have not deliver on this vision   how ironic they say that our politic seem more divided than ever   it ’s hold up as proof not just of my own flaw of which there be many but also as proof that the vision itself be misguided naïve that there be too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for we to ever do anything about it

 i know how tempting such cynicism may be   but i still think the cynic be wrong   i still believe that we be one people   i still believe that together we can do great thing even when the odd be long   applause

 i believe this because over and over in my six year in office i have see america at its good   i ’ve see the hopeful face of young graduate from new york to california and our new officer at west point annapolis colorado springs new london   i ’ve mourn with grieve family in tucson and newtown in boston in west texas and west virginia   i ’ve watch americans beat back adversity from the gulf coast to the great plains from midwest assembly line to the mid atlantic seaboard   i ’ve see something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue use to drive we apart to a story of freedom across our country a civil right now legal in state that seven in 10 americans call home   applause

 so i know the good and optimistic and big hearted generosity of the american people who every day live the idea that we be our brother ’s keeper and our sister ’s keeper   and i know they expect those of we who serve here to set a well example

 so the question for those of we here tonight be how we all of we can well reflect america ’s hope   i ’ve serve in congress with many of you   i know many of you well   there be a lot of good people here on both side of the aisle   and many of you have tell i that this be n’t what you sign up for argue past each other on cable show the constant fundraising always look over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision

 imagine if we break out of these tired old pattern   imagine if we do something different   understand a well politic be n’t one where democrats abandon their agenda or republicans simply embrace mine   a well politic be one where we appeal to each other ’s basic decency instead of our basest fear   a well politic be one where we debate without demonize each other where we talk issue and value and principle and fact rather than gotcha moment or trivial gaffe or fake controversy that have nothing to do with people ’s daily life   applause

 a politic a well politic be one where we spend less time drown in dark money for ad that pull we into the gutter and spend more time lift young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility ask they to join in the great mission of build america

 if we ’re go to have argument let ’s have argument but let ’s make they debate worthy of this body and worthy of this country   we still may not agree on a woman ’s right to choose but surely we can agree it ’ a good thing that teen pregnancy and abortion be near all time low and that every woman should have access to the health care that she need   applause

 yes passion still fly on immigration but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the strive young student and agree that no one benefit when a hardworke mom be snatch from her child and that it ’ possible to shape a law that uphold our tradition as a nation of law and a nation of immigrant   i ’ve talk to republicans and democrats about that   that ’ something that we can share

 we may go at it in campaign season but surely we can agree that the right to vote be sacred that it ’s be deny to too many applause and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from selma to montgomery and the passage of the voting rights act we can come together democrats and republicans to make voting easy for every single american   applause

 we may have different take on the event of ferguson and new york   but surely we can understand a father who fear his son can not walk home without be harass   and surely we can understand the wife who will not rest until the police officer she marry walk through the front door at the end of his shift   applause   andsurely we can agree that it ’ a good thing that for the first time in 40 year the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together and use that as a starting point for democrats and republicans community leader and law enforcement to reform america ’s criminal justice system so that it protect and serve all of we   applause

 that ’ a well politic   that ’ how we start rebuild trust   that ’ how we move this country forward   that ’ what the american people want   and that ’ what they deserve

 i have no more campaign to run   applause   my only agenda laughter i know because i win both of they   applause   my only agenda for the next two year be the same as the one i ’ve have since the day i swear an oath on the step of this capitol to do what i believe be good for america   if you share the broad vision i outline tonight i ask you to join i in the work at hand   if you disagree with part of it i hope you ’ll at least work with i where you do agree   and i commit to every republican here tonight that i will not only seek out your idea i will seek to work with you to make this country strong   applause

 because i want this chamber i want this city to reflect the truth that for all our blind spot and shortcoming we be a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divide to unite in common effort to help our neighbor whether down the street or on the other side of the world

 i want our action to tell every child in every neighborhood your life matter and we be committed to improve your life chance as commit as we be to work on behalf of our own kid   applause   i want future generation to know that we be a people who see our difference as a great gift that we ’re a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen man and woman young and old black and white latino asian immigrant native american gay straight americans with mental illness or physical disability   everybody matter   i want they to grow up in a country that show the world what we still know to be true   that we be still more than a collection of red state and blue state that we be the united states of america   applause

 i want they to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her president with a story that sum up these past six year   it ’ amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to we be a strong tight knit family who ’s make it through some very very hard time

 my fellow americans we too be a strong tight knit family   we too have make it through some hard time   fifteen year into this new century we have pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remake america   we have lay a new foundation   a bright future be ours to write   let ’s begin this new chapter together and let ’s start the work right now   applause

 thank you   god bless you   god bless this country we love   thank you   applause

udience member   we love you president obama

 the president   well you know i love you back   applause

 it be a rare honor in this life to follow one of your hero   and john lewis be one of my hero

 now i have to imagine that when a young john lewis wake up that morning 50 year ago and make his way to brown chapel heroic be not on his mind   a day like this be not on his mind   young folk with bedroll and backpack be mill about   veteran of the movement train newcomer in the tactic of non violence the right way to protect yourself when attack   a doctor describe what tear gas do to the body while marcher scribble down instruction for contact their love one   the air be thick with doubt anticipation and fear   and they comfort themselves with the final verse of the final hymn they sing

 no matter what may be the test god will take care of you
 lean weary one upon his breast god will take care of you

 and then his knapsack stock with an apple a toothbrush and a book on government all you need for a night behind bar john lewis lead they out of the church on a mission to change america

 president and mrs. bush governor bentley mayor evans sewell reverend strong member of congress elect official foot soldier friend fellow americans

 as john note there be place and moment in america where this nation ’s destiny have be decide   many be site of war concord and lexington appomattox gettysburg   other be site that symbolize the daring of america ’s character independence hall and seneca falls kitty hawk and cape canaveral

 selma be such a place   in one afternoon 50 year ago so much of our turbulent history the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war the yoke of segregation and tyranny of jim crow the death of four little girl in birmingham and the dream of a baptist preacher all that history meet on this bridge

 it be not a clash of army but a clash of will a contest to determine the true meaning of america   and because of man and woman like john lewis joseph lowery hosea williams amelia boynton diane nash ralph abernathy c.t. vivian andrew young fred shuttlesworth dr. martin luther king jr. and so many other the idea of a just america and a fair america an inclusive america and a generous america that idea ultimately triumph

 as be true across the landscape of american history we can not examine this moment in isolation   the march on selma be part of a broad campaign that span generation the leader that day part of a long line of hero

 we gather here to celebrate they   we gather here to honor the courage of ordinary americans willing to endure billy club and the chasten rod tear gas and the trample hoof man and woman who despite the gush of blood and splinter bone would stay true to their north star and keep march towards justice

 they do as scripture instruct   rejoice in hope be patient in tribulation be constant in prayer   and in the day to come they go back again and again   when the trumpet call sound for more to join the people come black and white young and old christian and jew wave the american flag and singe the same anthem full of faith and hope   a white newsman bill plante who cover the marche then and who be with we here today quip that the grow number of white people lower the quality of the singing   laughter   to those who march though those old gospel song must have never sound so sweet

 in time their chorus would well up and reach president johnson   and he would send they protection and speak to the nation echo their call for america and the world to hear   we shall overcome   applause   what enormous faith these man and woman have   faith in god but also faith in america

 the americans who cross this bridge they be not physically impose   but they give courage to million   they hold no elect office   but they lead a nation   they march as americans who have endure hundred of year of brutal violence countless daily indignity but they do not seek special treatment just the equal treatment promise to they almost a century before   applause

 what they do here will reverberate through the age   not because the change they win be preordain not because their victory be complete but because they prove that nonviolent change be possible that love and hope can conquer hate

 as we commemorate their achievement we be well serve to remember that at the time of the marche many in power condemn rather than praise they   back then they be call communists or half breed or outside agitator sexual and moral degenerate and bad they be call everything but the name their parent give they   their faith be question   their life be threaten   their patriotism challenge

 and yet what could be more american than what happen in this place   applause   what could more profoundly vindicate the idea of america than plain and humble people unsung the downtrodden the dreamer not of high station not bear to wealth or privilege not of one religious tradition but many come together to shape their country ’s course

 what great expression of faith in the american experiment than this what great form of patriotism be there than the belief that america be not yet finish that we be strong enough to be self critical that each successive generation can look upon our imperfection and decide that it be in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our high ideal   applause

 that ’ why selma be not some outlier in the american experience   that ’ why it ’ not a museum or a static monument to behold from a distance   it be instead the manifestation of a creed write into our found document   we the people in order to form a more perfect union   we hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal   applause

 these be not just word   they ’re a live thing a call to action a roadmap for citizenship and an insistence in the capacity of free man and woman to shape our own destiny   for founder like franklin and jefferson for leader like lincoln and fdr the success of our experiment in self government rest on engage all of our citizen in this work   and that ’ what we celebrate here in selma   that ’ what this movement be all about one leg in our long journey toward freedom   applause

 the american instinct that lead these young man and woman to pick up the torch and cross this bridge that ’s the same instinct that move patriot to choose revolution over tyranny   it ’ the same instinct that draw immigrant from across ocean and the rio grande the same instinct that lead woman to reach for the ballot worker to organize against an unjust status quo the same instinct that lead we to plant a flag at iwo jima and on the surface of the moon   applause

 it ’ the idea hold by generation of citizen who believe that america be a constant work in progress who believe that love this country require more than singe its praise or avoid uncomfortable truth   it require the occasional disruption the willingness to speak out for what be right to shake up the status quo   that ’ america   applause

 that ’ what make we unique   that ’ what cement our reputation as a beacon of opportunity   young people behind the iron curtain would see selma and eventually tear down that wall   young people in soweto would hear bobby kennedy talk about ripple of hope and eventually banish the scourge of apartheid   young people in burma go to prison rather than submit to military rule   they see what john lewis have do   from the street of tunis to the maidan in ukraine this generation of young people can draw strength from this place where the powerless could change the world ’s great power and push their leader to expand the boundary of freedom

 they see that idea make real right here in selma alabama   they see that idea manifest itself here in america

 because of campaign like this a voting rights act be pass   political and economic and social barrier come down   and the change these man and woman work be visible here today in the presence of african americans who run boardroom who sit on the bench who serve in elect office from small town to big city from the congressional black caucus all the way to the oval office   applause

 because of what they do the door of opportunity swung open not just for black folk but for every american   woman march through those door   latinos march through those door   asian americans gay americans americans with disability they all come through those door   applause   their endeavor give the entire south the chance to rise again not by reassert the past but by transcend the past

 what a glorious thing dr. king might say   and what a solemn debt we owe   which lead we to ask just how might we repay that debt

 first and foremost we have to recognize that one day ’s commemoration no matter how special be not enough   if selma teach we anything it ’ that our work be never do   applause   the american experiment in self government give work and purpose to each generation

 selma teach we as well that action require that we shed our cynicism   for when it come to the pursuit of justice we can afford neither complacency nor despair

 just this week i be ask whether i think the department of justice ’s ferguson report show that with respect to race little have change in this country   and i understand the question the report ’s narrative be sadly familiar   it evoke the kind of abuse and disregard for citizen that spawn the civil rights movement   but i reject the notion that nothing ’ change   what happen in ferguson may not be unique but it ’s no long endemic   it ’s no long sanction by law or by custom   and before the civil rights movement it most surely be   applause

 we do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimate that bias and discrimination be immutable that racial division be inherent to america   if you think nothing ’ change in the past 50 year ask somebody who live through the selma or chicago or los angeles of the 1950s   ask the female ceo who once might have be assign to the secretarial pool if nothing ’s change   ask your gay friend if it ’s easy to be out and proud in america now than it be thirty year ago   to deny this progress this hard win progress our progress would be to rob we of our own agency our own capacity our responsibility to do what we can to make america well

 of course a more common mistake be to suggest that ferguson be an isolated incident that racism be banish that the work that draw man and woman to selma be now complete and that whatever racial tension remain be a consequence of those seek to play the race card for their own purpose   we do not need the ferguson report to know that ’ not true   we just need to open our eye and our ear and our heart to know that this nation ’s racial history still cast its long shadow upon we

 to the family of the fall the nation share in your grief   our pain cut that much deeply because it happen in a church   the church be and always have be the center of african american life applause a place to call our own in a too often hostile world a sanctuary from so many hardship

 over the course of century black church serve as hush harbor where slave could worship in safety praise house where their free descendant could gather and shout hallelujah applause rest stop for the weary along the underground railroad bunker for the foot soldier of the civil rights movement   they have be and continue to be community center where we organize for job and justice place of scholarship and network place where child be love and feed and keep out of harm ’s way and tell that they be beautiful and smart applause and teach that they matter   applause   that ’ what happen in church

 we do not know whether the killer of reverend pinckney and eight other know all of this history   but he surely sense the meaning of his violent act   it be an act that draw on a long history of bomb and arson and shot fire at church not random but as a means of control a way to terrorize and oppress   applause   an act that he imagine would incite fear and recrimination violence and suspicion   an act that he presume would deepen division that trace back to our nation ’s original sin

 oh but god work in mysterious way   applause   god have different idea   applause

 he do not know he be be use by god   applause   blind by hatred the alleged killer could not see the grace surround reverend pinckney and that bible study group the light of love that shine as they open the church door and invite a stranger to join in their prayer circle   the alleged killer could have never anticipate the way the family of the fall would respond when they see he in court in the midst of unspeakable grief with word of forgiveness   he could not imagine that   applause

 the alleged killer could not imagine how the city of charleston under the good and wise leadership of mayor riley applause how the state of south carolina how the united states of america would respond not merely with revulsion at his evil act but with big hearted generosity and more importantly with a thoughtful introspection and self examination that we so rarely see in public life

 blind by hatred he fail to comprehend what reverend pinckney so well understand the power of god ’s grace   applause

 this whole week i ’ve be reflect on this idea of grace applause   the grace of the family who lose love one   the grace that reverend pinckney would preach about in his sermon   the grace describe in one of my favorite hymnal the one we all know   amazing grace how sweet the sound that save a wretch like i   applause   i once be lose but now i ’m find be blind but now i see   applause

 accord to the christian tradition grace be not earn   grace be not merit   it ’ not something we deserve   rather grace be the free and benevolent favor of god applause as manifest in the salvation of sinner and the bestowal of blessing   grace

 as a nation out of this terrible tragedy god have visit grace upon we for he have allow we to see where we ’ve be blind   applause   he have give we the chance where we ’ve be lose to find our good self   applause   we may not have earn it this grace with our rancor and complacency and short sightedness and fear of each other but we get it all the same   he give it to we anyway   he ’ once more give we grace   but it be up to we now to make the most of it to receive it with gratitude and to prove ourselves worthy of this gift

 for too long we be blind to the pain that the confederate flag stir in too many of our citizen   applause   it ’ true a flag do not cause these murder   but as people from all walk of life republicans and democrats now acknowledge include governor haley whose recent eloquence on the subject be worthy of praise applause as we all have to acknowledge the flag have always represent more than just ancestral pride   applause   for many black and white that flag be a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation   we see that now

 remove the flag from this state ’s capitol would not be an act of political correctness it would not be an insult to the valor of confederate soldier   it would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fight the cause of slavery be wrong applause the imposition of jim crow after the civil war the resistance to civil right for all people be wrong   applause it would be one step in an honest accounting of america ’s history a modest but meaningful balm for so many unhealed wound   it would be an expression of the amazing change that have transform this state and this country for the well because of the work of so many people of goodwill people of all race strive to form a more perfect union   by take down that flag we express god ’s grace   applause

 but i do not think god want we to stop there   applause   for too long we ’ve be blind to the way past injustice continue to shape the present   perhaps we see that now   perhaps this tragedy cause we to ask some tough question about how we can permit so many of our child to languish in poverty or attend dilapidated school or grow up without prospect for a job or for a career   applause

 perhaps it cause we to examine what we ’re do to cause some of our child to hate   applause   perhaps it soften heart towards those lose young man ten and ten of thousand catch up in the criminal justice system applause and lead we to make sure that that system be not infect with bias that we embrace change in how we train and equip our police so that the bond of trust between law enforcement and the community they serve make we all safe and more secure   applause

 maybe we now realize the way racial bias can infect we even when we do not realize it so that we be guard against not just racial slur but we be also guard against the subtle impulse to call johnny back for a job interview but not jamal   applause   so that we search our heart when we consider law to make it hard for some of our fellow citizen to vote   applause   by recognize our common humanity by treat every child as important regardless of the color of their skin or the station into which they be bear and to do what ’s necessary to make opportunity real for every american by do that we express god ’s grace   applause

 for too long

 audience   for too long

 the president   for too long we ’ve be blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflict upon this nation   applause sporadically our eye be open   when eight of our brother and sister be cut down in a church basement 12 in a movie theater 26 in an elementary school   but i hope we also see the 30 precious life cut short by gun violence in this country every single day the countless more whose life be forever change the survivor cripple the child traumatize and fearful every day as they walk to school the husband who will never feel his wife ’s warm touch the entire community whose grief overflow every time they have to watch what happen to they happen to some other place

 the vast majority of americans the majority of gun owner want to do something about this   we see that now   applause   and i be convince that by acknowledge the pain and loss of other even as we respect the tradition and way of life that make up this beloved country by make the moral choice to change we express god ’s grace   applause

 we do not earn grace   we be all sinner   we do not deserve it   applause   but god give it to we anyway   applause   and we choose how to receive it   it be our decision how to honor it

 none of we can or should expect a transformation in race relation overnight   every time something like this happen somebody say we have to have a conversation about race   we talk a lot about race   there ’ no shortcut   and we do not need more talk   applause   none of we should believe that a handful of gun safety measure will prevent every tragedy   it will not   people of goodwill will continue to debate the merit of various policy as our democracy require this be a big raucous place america be   and there be good people on both side of these debate   whatever solution we find will necessarily be incomplete

 but it would be a betrayal of everything reverend pinckney stand for i believe if we allow ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again   applause   once the eulogy have be deliver once the tv camera move on to go back to business as usual that ’ what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truth about the prejudice that still infect our society   applause   to settle for symbolic gesture without follow up with the hard work of more lasting change that ’ how we lose our way again

 it would be a refutation of the forgiveness express by those family if we merely slip into old habit whereby those who disagree with we be not merely wrong but bad where we shout instead of listen where we barricade ourselves behind preconceive notion or well practice cynicism

 reverend pinckney once say across the south we have a deep appreciation of history we have not always have a deep appreciation of each other ’s history   applause   what be true in the south be true for america   clem understand that justice grow out of recognition of ourselves in each other   that my liberty depend on you be free too   applause   that history can not be a sword to justify injustice or a shield against progress but must be a manual for how to avoid repeat the mistake of the past how to break the cycle   a roadway toward a well world   he know that the path of grace involve an open mind but more importantly an open heart

 that ’ what i ’ve feel this week an open heart   that more than any particular policy or analysis be what ’s call upon right now i think what a friend of mine the writer marilyn robinson call that reservoir of goodness beyond and of another kind that we be able to do each other in the ordinary cause of thing

 that reservoir of goodness   if we can find that grace anything be possible   applause   if we can tap that grace everything can change   applause

 amazing grace   amazing grace

mr. speaker mr. vice president members of congress my fellow americans

 tonight mark the eighth year that i ’ve come here to report on the state of the union and for this final one i ’m go to try to make it a little short applause i know some of you be antsy to get back to iowa laughter i have be there i will be shake hand afterwards if you want some tip laughter

 and i understand that because it ’ an election season expectation for what we will achieve this year be low but mr. speaker i appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaderstook at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cut permanent for work family so i hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priority like criminal justice reform applause and help people who be battle prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse applause so who know we might surprise the cynic again

 but tonight i want to go easy on the traditional list of proposal for the year ahead do not worry i ’ve get plenty from help student learn to write computer code to personalize medical treatment for patient and i will keep push for progress on the work that i believe still need to be do fix a broken immigration system applause protect our kid from gun violence applause.)equal pay for equal work applause pay leave applause.)raise the minimum wage applause all these thing still matter to hardworke family they ’re still the right thing to do and i will not let up until they get do

 but for my final address to this chamber i do not want to just talk about next year i want to focus on the next five year the next 10 year and beyond i want to focus on our future

 we live in a time of extraordinary change change that ’ reshape the way we live the way we work our planet our place in the world it ’ change that promise amazing medical breakthrough but also economic disruption that strain work family it promise education for girl in the most remote village but also connect terrorist plot an ocean away it ’ change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality and whether we like it or not the pace of this change will only accelerate

  america have be through big change before war and depression the influx of new immigrant worker fight for a fair deal movement to expand civil right each time there have be those who tell we to fear the future who claim we could slam the brake on change who promise to restore past glory if we just get some group or idea that be threaten america under control and each time we overcome those fear we do not in the word of lincoln adhere to the dogma of the quiet past instead we think anew and act anew we make change work for we always extend america ’s promise outward to the next frontier to more people and because we do because we see opportunity where other see only peril we emerge strong and well than before

 what be true then can be true now our unique strength as a nation our optimism and work ethic our spirit of discovery our diversity our commitment to rule of law these thing give we everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generation to come

 in fact it ’ that spirit that make the progress of these past seven year possible   it ’ how we recover from the bad economic crisis in generation   it ’ how we reform our health care system and reinvent our energy sector how we deliver more care and benefit to our troop and veteran and how we secure the freedom in every state to marry the person we love

 but such progress be not inevitable it ’ the result of choice we make together and we face such choice right now will we respond to the change of our time with fear turn inward as a nation turn against each other as a people or will we face the future with confidence in who we be in what we stand for in the incredible thing that we can do together

 so let ’s talk about the future and four big question that i believe we as a country have to answer regardless of who the next president be or who control the next congress

 first how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy applause

 second how do we make technology work for we and not against we especially when it come to solve urgent challenge like climate change applause

 third how do we keep america safe and lead the world without become its policeman applause

 and finally how can we make our politic reflect what ’s good in we and not what ’s bad

 let i start with the economy and a basic fact the united states of america right now have the strong most durable economy in the world applause we ’re in the middle of the long streak of private sector job creation in history applause more than 14 million new job the strong two year of job growth since the 90 an unemployment rate cut in half our auto industry just have its good year ever applause that be just part of a manufacturing surge that be create nearly 900,000 new job in the past six year and we ’ve do all this while cut our deficit by almost three quarter applause

 anyone claim that america ’s economy be in decline be peddle fiction applause now what be true and the reason that a lot of americans feel anxious be that the economy have be change in profound way change that start long before the great recession hit change that have not let up

 today technology do not just replace job on the assembly line but any job where work can be automate company in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tough competition as a result worker have less leverage for a raise company have less loyalty to their community and more and more wealth and income be concentrate at the very top

 all these trend have squeeze worker even when they have job even when the economy be grow it ’s make it hard for a hardworke family to pull itself out of poverty hard for young people to start their career tough for worker to retire when they want to and although none of these trend be unique to america they do offend our uniquely american belief that everybody who work hard should get a fair shot

 for the past seven year our goal have be a grow economy that work also well for everybody we ’ve make progress but we need to make more and despite all the political argument that we ’ve have these past few year there be actually some area where american broadly agree

 we agree that real opportunity require every american to get the education and training they need to land a good pay job the bipartisan reform of no child leave behind be an important start and together we ’ve increase early childhood education lift high school graduation rate to new high boost graduate in field like engineering in the come year we should build on that progress by provide pre k for all and applause offer every student the hand on computer science and math class that make they job ready on day one we should recruit and support more great teacher for our kid applause

 and we have to make college affordable for every american applause no hardworke student should be stick in the red we’ve already reduce student loan payment to 10 percent of a borrower ’s income and that be good but now we ’ve actually get to cut the cost of college applause provide two year of community college at no cost for every responsible student be one of the good way to do that and i ’m go to keep fight to get that start this year applause it be the right thing to do applause

 but a great education be not all we need in this new economy we also need benefit and protection that provide a basic measure of security it ’ not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in america who be go to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for 30 year be sit in this chamber laughter for everyone else especially folk in their 40 and 50 save for retirement or bounce back from job loss have get a lot tough americans understand that at some point in their career in this new economy they may have to retool and they may have to retrain but they should not lose what they ’ve already work so hard to build in the process

 that ’ why social security and medicare be more important than ever we should not weaken they we should strengthen them.(applause and for americans short of retirement basic benefit should be just as mobile as everything else be today that by the way be what the affordable care act be all about it ’ about fill the gap in employer base care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business you ’ll still have coverage nearly 18 million people have gain coverage so far applause and in the process health care inflation have slow and our business have create job every single month since it become law

 now i ’m guess we will not agree on health care anytime soon applause a little applause right there laughter just a guess but there should be other way party can work together to improve economic security say a hardworke american lose his job we should not just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourage he to retrain for a business that ’ ready to hire he if that new job do n’t pay as much there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bill and even if he ’s go from job to job he should still be able to save for retirement and take his saving with he that ’ the way we make the new economy work well for everybody

 i also know speaker ryan have talk about his interest in tackle poverty america be about give everybody willing to work a chance a hand up and i ’d welcome a serious discussion about strategy we can all support like expand tax cut for low income worker who do not have child applause

 but there be some area where we just have to be honest it have be difficult to find agreement over the last seven year and a lot of they fall under the category of what role the government should play in make sure the system ’s not rig in favor of the wealthy and big corporation applause and it be an honest disagreement and the american people have a choice to make

 i believe a thriving private sector be the lifeblood of our economy i think there be outdated regulation that need to be change there be red tape that need to be cut applause there you go yes applause but after year now of record corporate profit work family will not get more opportunity or big paycheck just by let big bank or big oil or hedge fund make their own rule at everybody else ’s expense applause middle class family be not go to feel more secure because we allow attack on collective bargaining to go unanswered food stamp recipient do not cause the financial crisis recklessness on wall street do applause immigrant be n’t the principal reason wage have not go up those decision be make in the boardroom that all too often put quarterly earning over long term return it ’ sure not the average family watch tonight that avoid pay taxis through offshore account applause

 the point be i believe that in this new economy worker and start up and small business need more of a voice not less the rule should work for they applause and i be not alone in this this year i plan to lift up the many business who ’ve figure out that do right by their worker or their customer or their community end up be good for their shareholder applause and i want to spread those good practice across america that be part of a bright future applause

 in fact it turn out many of our good corporate citizen be also our most creative and this bring i to the second big question we as a country have to answer how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our big challenge

 sixty year ago when the russians beat we into space we do not deny sputnik be up there laughter we do not argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget we build a space program almost overnight and 12 year later we be walk on the moon applause

 now that spirit of discovery be in our dna america be thomas edison and the wright brothers and george washington carver america be grace hopper and katherine johnson and sally ride america be every immigrant and entrepreneur from boston to austin to silicon valley race to shape a well world applause that be who we be

 and over the past seven year we ’ve nurture that spirit we ’ve protect an open internet and take bold new step to get more student and low income americans online applause we ’ve launch next generation manufacturing hub and online tool that give an entrepreneur everything he or she need to start a business in a single day but we can do so much more

 last year vice president biden say that with a new moonshot america can cure cancer last month he work with this congress to give scientist at the national institutes of health the strong resource that they ’ve have in over a decade applause so tonight i ’m announce a new national effort to get it do and because he ’s go to the mat for all of we on so many issue over the past 40 year i ’m put joe in charge of mission control applause for the love one we ’ve all lose for the family that we can still save let ’s make america the country that cure cancer once and for all.(applause

 medical research be critical we need the same level of commitment when it come to develop clean energy source applause.)look if anybody still want to dispute the science around climate change have at it you will be pretty lonely because you ’ll be debate our military most of america ’s business leader the majority of the american people almost the entire scientific community and 200 nation around the world who agree it ’ a problem and intend to solve it applause

 but even if even if the planet be n’t at stake even if 2014 be n’t the warm year on record until 2015 turn out to be even hot why would we want to pass up the chance for american business to produce and sell the energy of the future applause

 listen seven year ago we make the single big investment in clean energy in our history here be the result in field from iowa to texas wind power be now cheap than dirty conventional power on rooftop from arizona to new york solar be save americans ten of million of dollar a year on their energy bill and employ more americans than coal in job that pay well than average we ’re take step to give homeowner the freedom to generate and store their own energy something by the way that environmentalist and tea partiers have team up to support and meanwhile we ’ve cut our import of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on earth applause

 gas under two buck a gallon ai not bad either applause

 now we ’ve get to accelerate the transition away from old dirty energy source rather than subsidize the past we should invest in the future especially in community that rely on fossil fuel we do they no favor when we do not show they where the trend be go that ’s why i ’m go to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resource so that they well reflect the cost they impose on taxpayer and our planet and that way we put money back into those community and put ten of thousand of americans to work build a 21st century transportation system applause

 now none of this be go to happen overnight and yes there be plenty of entrenched interest who want to protect the status quo but the job we ’ll create the money we ’ll save the planet we ’ll preserve that be the kind of future our kid and our grandkid deserve and it be within our grasp

 climate change be just one of many issue where our security be link to the rest of the world and that ’ why the third big question that we have to answer together be how to keep america safe and strong without either isolate ourselves or try to nation build everywhere there ’ a problem

 i tell you early all the talk of america ’s economic decline be political hot air well so be all the rhetoric you hear about our enemy get strong and america get weak let i tell you something the united states of america be the most powerful nation on earth period applause period it ’ not even close it be not even close applause it be not even close we spend more on our military than the next eight nation combine our troop be the fine fighting force in the history of the world applause no nation attack we directly or our ally because they know that ’ the path to ruin survey show our standing around the world be high than when i be elect to this office and when it come to every important international issue people of the world do not look to beijing or moscow to lead they call we applause

 i mean it be useful to level the set here because when we do not we do not make good decision

 now as someone who begin every day with an intelligence briefing i know this be a dangerous time but that ’s not primarily because of some loom superpower out there and certainly not because of diminished american strength in today ’s world we ’re threaten less by evil empire and more by fail state

 the middle east be go through a transformation that will play out for a generation root in conflict that date back millennia economic headwind be blow in from a chinese economy that be in significant transition even as their economy severely contract russia be pour resource in to prop up ukraine and syria client state that they see slip away from their orbit and the international system we build after world war ii be now struggle to keep pace with this new reality

 it ’ up to we the united states of america to help remake that system and to do that well it mean that we ’ve get to set priority

 priority number one be protect the american people and go after terrorist network applause both al qaeda and now isil pose a direct threat to our people because in today ’s world even a handful of terrorist who place no value on human life include their own can do a lot of damage they use the internet to poison the mind of individual inside our country their action undermine and destabilize our ally we have to take they out./p&gt

 but as we focus on destroy isil over the top claim that this be world war iii just play into their hand masse of fighter on the back of pickup truck twisted soul plot in apartment or garage they pose an enormous danger to civilian they have to be stop but they do not threaten our national existence applause that be the story isil want to tell that ’ the kind of propaganda they use to recruit we do not need to build they up to show that we ’re serious and we sure do not need to push away vital ally in this fight by echo the lie that isil be somehow representative of one of the world ’s large religion applause we just need to call they what they be killer and fanatic who have to be root out hunt down and destroy applause

 and that ’s exactly what we ’re do for more than a year america have lead a coalition of more than 60 country to cut off isil ’s financing disrupt their plot stop the flow of terrorist fighter and stamp out their vicious ideology with nearly 10,000 air strike we ’re take out their leadership their oil their training camp their weapon we ’re train arm and support force who be steadily reclaim territory in iraq and syria

 if this congress be serious about win this war and want to send a message to our troop and the world authorize the use of military force against isil take a vote applause take a vote but the american people should know that with or without congressional action isil will learn the same lesson as terrorist before they if you doubt america ’s commitment or mine to see that justice be do just ask osama bin laden applause ask the leader of al qaeda in yemen who be take out last year or the perpetrator of the benghazi attack who sit in a prison cell when you come after americans we go after you applause and it may take time but we have long memory and our reach have no limit applause

 our foreign policy hast to be focus on the threat from isil and al qaeda but it can not stop there for even without isil even without al qaeda instability will continue for decade in many part of the world in the middle east in afghanistan part of pakistan in part of central america in africa and asia some of these place may become safe haven for new terrorist network other will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine feed the next wave of refugee the world will look to we to help solve these problem and our answer need to be more than tough talk or call to carpet bomb civilian that may work as a tv sound bite but it do not pass muster on the world stage

 we also can not try to take over and rebuild every country that fall into crisis even if it be do with the good of intention applause that ’ not leadership that ’ a recipe for quagmire spill american blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken we it ’ the lesson of vietnam it be the lesson of iraq and we should have learn it by now applause

 fortunately there be a smart approach a patient and discipline strategy that use every element of our national power it say america will always act alone if necessary to protect our people and our ally but on issue of global concern we will mobilize the world to work with we and make sure other country pull their own weight

 that ’ our approach to conflict like syria where we ’re partner with local force and lead international effort to help that broken society pursue a last peace

 that ’ why we build a global coalition with sanction and principled diplomacy to prevent a nuclear arm iran and as we speak iran have roll back its nuclear program ship out its uranium stockpile and the world have avoid another war applause

 that ’ how we stop the spread of ebola in west africa applause our military our doctor our development worker they be heroic they set up the platform that then allow other country to join in behind we and stamp out that epidemic hundred of thousand maybe a couple million life be save

 that ’ how we forge a trans pacific partnership to open market and protect worker and the environment and advance american leadership in asia it cut 18,000 taxis on product make in america which will then support more good job here in america with tpp china do not set the rule in that region we do you want to show our strength in this new century approve this agreement give we the tool to enforce it it be the right thing to do applause

 let i give you another example fifty year of isolate cuba have fail to promote democracy and set we back in latin america that ’s why we restore diplomatic relation applause open the door to travel and commerce position ourselves to improve the life of the cuban people applause so if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere recognize that the cold war be over lift the embargo applause

 the point be american leadership in the 21st century be not a choice between ignore the rest of the world except when we kill terrorist or occupy and rebuild whatever society be unravel leadership mean a wise application of military power and rally the world behind cause that be right it mean see our foreign assistance as a part of our national security not something separate not charity

 when we lead nearly 200 nation to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change yes that help vulnerable country but it also protect our kid when we help ukraine defend its democracy or colombia resolve a decade long war that strengthen the international order we depend on when we help african country feed their people and care for the sick applause it be the right thing to do and it prevent the next pandemic from reach our shore right now we ’re on track to end the scourge of hiv aids that be within our grasp applause and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria something i ’ll be push this congress to fund this year applause

 that be american strength that be american leadership and that kind of leadership depend on the power of our example that ’s why i will keep work to shut down the prison at guantanamo applause it be expensive it be unnecessary and it only serve as a recruitment brochure for our enemy applause there ’ a well way applause

 and that ’ why we need to reject any politic any politic that target people because of race or religion applause let i just say this this be not a matter of political correctness this be a matter of understanding just what it be that make we strong the world respect we not just for our arsenal it respect we for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith

 his holiness pope francis tell this body from the very spot that i be stand on tonight that to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrant and murderer be the good way to take their place when politician insult muslims whether abroad or our fellow citizen when a mosque be vandalize or a kid be call name that do not make we safe that ’s not tell it like it be it ’ just wrong applause it diminish we in the eye of the world it make it hard to achieve our goal it betray who we be as a country applause

 we the people our constitution begin with those three simple word word we ’ve come to recognize mean all the people not just some word that insist we rise and fall together and that be how we might perfect our union and that bring i to the fourth and maybe the most important thing that i want to say tonight

 the future we want all of we want opportunity and security for our family a rise standard of living a sustainable peaceful planet for our kid all that be within our reach but it will only happen if we work together it will only happen if we can have rational constructive debate it will only happen if we fix our politic

 a well politic do not mean we have to agree on everything this be a big country different region different attitude different interest that ’ one of our strength too our founder distribute power between state and branch of government and expect we to argue just as they do fiercely over the size and shape of government over commerce and foreign relation over the meaning of liberty and the imperative of security

 but democracy do require basic bond of trust between its citizen it do n’t work if we think the people who disagree with we be all motivate by malice it do n’t work if we think that our political opponent be unpatriotic or try to weaken america democracy grind to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic fact be contest or when we listen only to those who agree with we our public life wither when only the most extreme voice get all the attention and most of all democracy break down when the average person feel their voice do not matter that the system be rig in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest

 too many americans feel that way right now it ’ one of the few regret of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the party have get bad instead of well i have no doubt a president with the gift of lincoln or roosevelt might have well bridge the divide and i guarantee i ’ll keep try to be well so long as i hold this office

 but my fellow americans this can not be my task or any president ’s alone there be a whole lot of folk in this chamber good people who would like to see more cooperation would like to see a more elevated debate in washington but feel trap by the imperative of getting elect by the noise come out of your base i know you ’ve tell i it be the worst keep secret in washington and a lot of you be not enjoy be trap in that kind of rancor

 but that mean if we want a well politic and i be address the american people now if we want a well politic it ’ not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president we have to change the system to reflect our well self i think we have get to end the practice of draw our congressional district so that politician can pick their voter and not the other way around applause let a bipartisan group do it applause

 we have to reduce the influence of money in our politic so that a handful of family or hidden interest can n’t bankroll our election applause and if our exist approach to campaign finance reform can not pass muster in the court we need to work together to find a real solution because it be a problem and most of you do not like raise money i know i have do it applause we ’ve get to make it easy to vote not hard applause we need to modernize it for the way we live now applause this be america we want to make it easy for people to participate and over the course of this year i intend to travel the country to push for reform that do just that

 but i can not do these thing on my own applause change in our political process in not just who get elect but how they get elect that will only happen when the american people demand it it depend on you that ’ what ’s mean by a government of by and for the people

 what i ’m suggest be hard it ’ a lot easy to be cynical to accept that change be not possible and politic be hopeless and the problem be all the folk who be elect do not care and to believe that our voice and action do not matter but if we give up now then we forsake a well future those with money and power will gain great control over the decision that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal right and voting right that generation of americans have fight even die to secure and then as frustration grow there will be voice urge we to fall back into our respective tribe to scapegoat fellow citizen who do not look like we or pray like we or vote like we do or share the same background

 we can not afford to go down that path it will not deliver the economy we want it will not produce the security we want but most of all it contradict everything that make we the envy of the world

 so my fellow americans whatever you may believe whether you prefer one party or no party whether you support my agenda or fight as hard as you could against it our collective future depend on your willingness to uphold your duty as a citizen to vote to speak out to stand up for other especially the weak especially the vulnerable know that each of we be only here because somebody somewhere stand up for we applause we need every american to stay active in our public life and not just during election time so that our public life reflect the goodness and the decency that i see in the american people every single day

 it be not easy our brand of democracy be hard but i can promise that a little over a year from now when i no long hold this office i will be right there with you as a citizen inspire by those voice of fairness and vision of grit and good humor and kindness that help america travel so far voice that help we see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or asian or latino not as gay or straight immigrant or native bear not as democrat or republican but as americans first bind by a common creed voice dr. king believe would have the final word voice of unarmed truth and unconditional love

 and they ’re out there those voice they do not get a lot of attention they do not seek a lot of fanfare but they ’re busy do the work this country need do i see they everywhere i travel in this incredible country of ours i see you the american people and in your daily act of citizenship i see our future unfolding

 i see it in the worker on the assembly line who clock extra shift to keep his company open and the boss who pay he high wage instead of lay he off

 i see it in the dreamer who stay up late to finish her science project and the teacher who come in early because he know she might someday cure a disease

 i see it in the american who serve his time and make mistake as a child but now be dream of start over and i see it in the business owner who give he that second chance the protester determine to prove that justice matter and the young cop walk the beat treat everybody with respect do the brave quiet work of keep we safe applause

 i see it in the soldier who give almost everything to save his brother the nurse who tend to he till he can run a marathon the community that line up to cheer he on

 it ’ the son who find the courage to come out as who he be and the father whose love for that son override everything he ’s be teach applause

 i see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she have to the new citizen who cast his vote for the first time the volunteer at the poll who believe every vote should count because each of they in different way know how much that precious right be worth

 that be the america i know that ’ the country we love clear eye big hearted undaunte by challenge optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word applause that ’ what make i so hopeful about our future i believe in change because i believe in you the american people

 and that ’ why i stand here confident as i have ever be that the state of our union be strong applause

 thank you god bless you god bless the united states of america

thank you   applause   muchas gracia   thank you so much   thank you very much

 president castro the people of cuba thank you so much for the warm welcome that i have receive that my family have receive and that our delegation have receive   it be an extraordinary honor to be here today

 before i begin please indulge i   i want to comment on the terrorist attack that have take place in brussels   the thought and the prayer of the american people be with the people of belgium   we stand in solidarity with they in condemn these outrageous attack against innocent people   we will do whatever be necessary to support our friend and ally belgium in bring to justice those who be responsible   and this be yet another reminder that the world must unite we must be together regardless of nationality or race or faith in fight against the scourge of terrorism   we can and will defeat those who threaten the safety and security of people all around the world

 to the government and the people of cuba i want to thank you for the kindness that you ’ve show to i and michelle malia sasha my mother in law marian

 cultivo una rosa blanca   applause   in his most famous poem jose marti make this offering of friendship and peace to both his friend and his enemy   today as the president of the united states of america i offer the cuban people el saludo de paz   applause

 havana be only 90 mile from florida but to get here we have to travel a great distance over barrier of history and ideology barrier of pain and separation   the blue water beneath air force one once carry american battleship to this island to liberate but also to exert control over cuba   those water also carry generation of cuban revolutionary to the united states where they build support for their cause   and that short distance have be cross by hundred of thousand of cuban exile on plane and makeshift raft who come to america in pursuit of freedom and opportunity sometimes leave behind everything they own and every person that they love

 like so many people in both of our country my lifetime have span a time of isolation between we   the cuban revolution take place the same year that my father come to the united states from kenya   the bay of pigs take place the year that i be bear the next year the entire world hold its breath watch our two country as humanity come as close as we ever have to the horror of nuclear war   as the decade roll by our government settle into a seemingly endless confrontation fight battle through proxy   in a world that remade itself time and again one constant be the conflict between the united states and cuba

 i have come here to bury the last remnant of the cold war in the americas   applause   i have come here to extend the hand of friendship to the cuban people   applause

 i want to be clear   the difference between our government over these many year be real and they be important   i ’m sure president castro would say the same thing i know because i ’ve hear he address those difference at length   but before i discuss those issue we also need to recognize how much we share   because in many way the united states and cuba be like two brother who ’ve be estranged for many year even as we share the same blood

 we both live in a new world colonize by europeans   cuba like the united states be build in part by slave bring here from africa   like the united states the cuban people can trace their heritage to both slave and slave owner   we ’ve welcome both immigrant who come a great distance to start new life in the americas

 over the year our culture have blend together        dr. carlos finlay ’s work in cuba pave the way for generation of doctor include walter reed who draw on dr. finlay ’s work to help combat yellow fever   just as marti write some of his most famous word in new york ernest hemingway make a home in cuba and find inspiration in the water of these shore   we share a national past time la pelota and later today our player will compete on the same havana field that jackie robinson play on before he make his major league debut   applause   and it be say that our great boxer muhammad ali once pay tribute to a cuban that he could never fight say that he would only be able to reach a draw with the great cuban teofilo stevenson   applause

 so even as our government become adversary our people continue to share these common passion particularly as so many cubans come to america   in miami or havana you can find place to dance the cha cha cha or the salsa and eat ropa vieja   people in both of our country have sing along with celia cruz or gloria estefan and now listen to reggaeton or pitbull   laughter   million of our people share a common religion a faith that i pay tribute to at the shrine of our lady of charity in miami a peace that cubans find in la cachita

 for all of our difference the cuban and american people share common value in their own life   a sense of patriotism and a sense of pride a lot of pride   a profound love of family   a passion for our child a commitment to their education   and that be why i believe our grandchild will look back on this period of isolation as an aberration as just one chapter in a long story of family and of friendship

 but we can not and should not ignore the very real difference that we have about how we organize our government our economy and our society   cuba have a one party system the united states be a multi party democracy   cuba have a socialist economic model the united states be an open market   cuba have emphasize the role and right of the state the united states be found upon the right of the individual

 despite these difference on december 17th 2014 president castro and i announce that the united states and cuba would begin a process to normalize relation between our country   applause   since then we have establish diplomatic relation and open embassy   we have begin initiative to cooperate on health and agriculture education and law enforcement   we have reach agreement to restore direct flight and mail service   we have expand commercial tie and increase the capacity of americans to travel and do business in cuba

 and these change have be welcome even though there be still opponent to these policy   but still many people on both side of this debate have ask   why now   why now

 there be one simple answer   what the united states be do be not work   we have to have the courage to acknowledge that truth   a policy of isolation design for the cold war make little sense in the 21st century   the embargo be only hurt the cuban people instead of help they   and i have always believe in what martin luther king jr. call the fierce urgency of now we should not fear change we should embrace it   applause

 that lead i to a big and more important reason for these change   creo en el pueblo cubano   i believe in the cuban people   applause   this be not just a policy of normalizing relation with the cuban government   the united states of america be normalize relation with the cuban people   applause

 and today i want to share with you my vision of what our future can be   i want the cuban people especially the young people to understand why i believe that you should look to the future with hope not the false promise which insist that thing be well than they really be or the blind optimism that say all your problem can go away tomorrow   hope that be root in the future that you can choose and that you can shape and that you can build for your country

 i be hopeful because i believe that the cuban people be as innovative as any people in the world

 in a global economy power by idea and information a country ’s great asset be its people   in the united states we have a clear monument to what the cuban people can build it ’s call miami   here in havana we see that same talent in cuentapropista cooperative and old car that still run   el cubano inventa del aire   applause

 cuba have an extraordinary resource a system of education which value every boy and every girl   applause   and in recent year the cuban government have begin to open up to the world and to open up more space for that talent to thrive   in just a few year we have see how cuentapropista can succeed while sustain a distinctly cuban spirit   be self employ be not about become more like america it ’ about be yourself

 look at sandra lidice aldama who choose to start a small business   cubans she say can innovate and adapt without lose our identity our secret be in not copy or imitating but simply be ourselves

 look at papito valladeres a barber whose success allow he to improve condition in his neighborhood   i realize i ’m not go to solve all of the world ’s problem he say   but if i can solve problem in the little piece of the world where i live it can ripple across havana

 that ’s where hope begin with the ability to earn your own living and to build something you can be proud of   that ’ why our policy focus on support cubans instead of hurt they   that ’ why we get rid of limit on remittance so ordinary cubans have more resource   that ’ why we ’re encourage travel which will build bridge between our people and bring more revenue to those cuban small business that ’s why we ’ve open up space for commerce and exchange so that americans and cubans can work together to find cure for disease and create job and open the door to more opportunity for the cuban people

 as president of the united states i ’ve call on our congress to lift the embargo   applause   it be an outdated burden on the cuban people   it be a burden on the americans who want to work and do business or invest here in cuba   it be time to lift the embargo   but even if we lift the embargo tomorrow cubans would not realize their potential without continued change here in cuba   applause   it should be easy to open a business here in cuba   a worker should be able to get a job directly with company who invest here in cuba   two currency should not separate the type of salary that cubans can earn   the internet should be available across the island so that cubans can connect to the wide world applause and to one of the great engine of growth in human history

 there ’ no limitation from the united states on the ability of cuba to take these step   it ’ up to you   and i can tell you as a friend that sustainable prosperity in the 21st century depend upon education health care and environmental protection   but it also depend on the free and open exchange of idea   if you can not access information online if you can not be expose to different point of view you will not reach your full potential   and over time the youth will lose hope

 i know these issue be sensitive especially come from an american president   before 1959 some americans see cuba as something to exploit ignore poverty enable corruption   and since 1959 we ’ve be shadow boxer in this battle of geopolitic and personality   i know the history but i refuse to be trap by it   applause

 i ’ve make it clear that the united states have neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on cuba   what change come will depend upon the cuban people   we will not impose our political or economic system on you   we recognize that every country every people must chart its own course and shape its own model   but having remove the shadow of history from our relationship i must speak honestly about the thing that i believe the thing that we as americans believe   as marti say liberty be the right of every man to be honest to think and to speak without hypocrisy

 so let i tell you what i believe   i can not force you to agree but you should know what i think   i believe that every person should be equal under the law applause   every child deserve the dignity that come with education and health care and food on the table and a roof over their head   applause   i believe citizen should be free to speak their mind without fear applause to organize and to criticize their government and to protest peacefully and that the rule of law should not include arbitrary detention of people who exercise those right   applause   i believe that every person should have the freedom to practice their faith peacefully and publicly applause   and yes i believe voter should be able to choose their government in free and democratic election   applause

 not everybody agree with i on this   not everybody agree with the american people on this   but i believe those human right be universal   applause   i believe they be the right of the american people the cuban people and people around the world

 now there ’ no secret that our government disagree on many of these issue   i ’ve have frank conversation with president castro   for many year he have point out the flaw in the american system economic inequality the death penalty racial discrimination war abroad   that ’ just a sample   he have a much long list   laughter   but here ’ what the cuban people need to understand   i welcome this open debate and dialogue it ’ good   it ’ healthy   i ’m not afraid of it

 we do have too much money in american politic   but in america it be still possible for somebody like i a child who be raise by a single mom a child of mixed race who do not have a lot of money to pursue and achieve the high office in the land   that be what ’ possible in america   applause

 we do have challenge with racial bias in our community in our criminal justice system in our society the legacy of slavery and segregation   but the fact that we have open debate within america ’s own democracy be what allow we to get well   in 1959 the year that my father move to america it be illegal for he to marry my mother who be white in many american state   when i first start school we be still struggle to desegregate school across the american south   but people organize they protest they debate these issue they challenge government official   and because of those protest and because of those debate and because of popular mobilization i ’m able to stand here today as an african american and as president of the united states   that be because of the freedom that be afford in the united states that we be able to bring about change

 i ’m not say this be easy   there ’ still enormous problem in our society   but democracy be the way that we solve they   that be how we get health care for more of our people   that be how we make enormous gain in woman ’s right and gay right   that be how we address the inequality that concentrate so much wealth at the top of our society   because worker can organize and ordinary people have a voice american democracy have give our people the opportunity to pursue their dream and enjoy a high standard of living   applause

 now there be still some tough fight   it be not always pretty the process of democracy    it be often frustrating   you can see that in the election go on back home   but just stop and consider this fact about the american campaign that be take place right now   you have two cuban americans in the republican party run against the legacy of a black man who be president while argue that they ’re the good person to beat the democratic nominee who will either be a woman or a democratic socialist   laughter and applause   who would have believe that back in 1959   that be a measure of our progress as a democracy   applause

 so here ’s my message to the cuban government and the cuban people   the ideal that be the starting point for every revolution america ’s revolution cuba ’s revolution the liberation movement around the world those ideal find their true expression i believe in democracy   not because american democracy be perfect but precisely because we ’re not   and we like every country need the space that democracy give we to change   it give individual the capacity to be catalyst to think in new way and to reimagine how our society should be and to make they well

 there ’ already an evolution take place inside of cuba a generational change   many suggest that i come here and ask the people of cuba to tear something down but i ’m appeal to the young people of cuba who will lift something up build something new   applause   el futuro   de cuba tiene que estar en las manos del pueblo cubano   applause

 and to president castro who i appreciate be here today i want you to know i believe my visit here demonstrate you do not need to fear a threat from the united states   and give your commitment to cuba ’s sovereignty and self determination i be also confident that you need not fear the different voice of the cuban people and their capacity to speak and assemble and vote for their leader   in fact i ’m hopeful for the future because i trust that the cuban people will make the right decision

 and as you do i ’m also confident that cuba can continue to play an important role in the hemisphere and around the globe and my hope be be that you can do so as a partner with the united states

 we ’ve play very different role in the world   but no one should deny the service that thousand of cuban doctor have deliver for the poor and suffer   applause   last year american health care worker and the u.s. military work side by side with cubans to save life and stamp out ebola in west africa   i believe that we should continue that kind of cooperation in other country

 we ’ve be on the different side of so many conflict in the americas   but today americans and cubans be sit together at the negotiating table and we be help the colombian people resolve a civil war that ’s drag on for decade   applause   that kind of cooperation be good for everybody   it give everyone in this hemisphere hope

 we take different journey to our support for the people of south africa in end apartheid   but president castro and i could both be there in johannesburg to pay tribute to the legacy of the great nelson mandela   applause   and in examine his life and his word i be sure we both realize we have more work to do to promote equality in our own country to reduce discrimination base on race in our own country   and in cuba we want our engagement to help lift up the cubans who be of african descent applause who ’ve prove that there ’s nothing they can not achieve when give the chance

 we ’ve be a part of different bloc of nation in the hemisphere and we will continue to have profound difference about how to promote peace security opportunity and human right   but as we normalize our relation i believe it can help foster a great sense of unity in the americas todo somo americanos   applause

 from the beginning of my time in office i ’ve urge the people of the americas to leave behind the ideological battle of the past   we be in a new era   i know that many of the issue that i ’ve talk about lack the drama of the past   and i know that part of cuba ’s identity be its pride in be a small island nation that could stand up for its right and shake the world but i also know that cuba will always stand out because of the talent hard work and pride of the cuban people   that be your strength   applause   cuba do not have to be define by be against the united states any more than the united states should be define by be against cuba   i be hopeful for the future because of the reconciliation that ’s take place among the cuban people

 i know that for some cubans on the island there may be a sense that those who leave somehow support the old order in cuba   i be sure there ’ a narrative that linger here which suggest that cuban exile ignore the problem of pre revolutionary cuba and reject the struggle to build a new future   but i can tell you today that so many cuban exile carry a memory of painful and sometimes violent separation   they love cuba   a part of they still consider this their true home that ’ why their passion be so strong   that be why their heartache be so great   and for the cuban american community that i ’ve come to know and respect this be not just about politic this be about family the memory of a home that be lose the desire to rebuild a broken bond the hope for a well future the hope for return and reconciliation

 for all of the politic people be people and cubans be cubans   and i ’ve come here i ’ve travel this distance on a bridge that be build by cubans on both side of the florida straits   i first get to know the talent and passion of the cuban people in america   and i know how they have suffer more than the pain of exile they also know what it ’s like to be an outsider and to struggle and to work hard to make sure their child can reach high in america

 so the reconciliation of the cuban people the child and grandchild of revolution and the child and grandchild of exile that be fundamental to cuba ’s future   applause

 you see it in gloria gonzalez who travel here in 2013 for the first time after 61 year of separation and be meet by her sister llorca   you recognize i but i do not recognize you gloria say after she embrace her sibling   imagine that after 61 year

 you see it in melinda lopez who come to her family ’s old home   and as she be walk the street an elderly woman recognize she as her mother ’s daughter and begin to cry   she take she into her home and show she a pile of photo that include melinda ’s baby picture which her mother have send 50 year ago   melinda later say so many of we be now get so much back

 you see it in cristian miguel soler a young man who become the first of his family to travel here after 50 year   and meet relative for the first time he say i realize that family be family no matter the distance between we

 sometimes the most important change start in small place the tide of history can leave people in conflict and exile and poverty   it take time for those circumstance to change   but the recognition of a common humanity the reconciliation of people bind by blood and a belief in one another that ’s where progress begin   understanding and listening and forgiveness and if the cuban people face the future together it will be more likely that the young people of today will be able to live with dignity and achieve their dream right here in cuba

 the history of the united states and cuba encompass revolution and conflict struggle and sacrifice retribution and now reconciliation   it be time now for we to leave the past behind   it be time for we to look forward to the future together un future de esperanza   and it will not be easy and there will be setback   it will take time   but my time here in cuba renew my hope and my confidence in what the cuban people will do   we can make this journey as friend and as neighbor and as family together   si se puede   muchas gracia   applause

 the truth be rutgers i come here because you ask   applause   now it be true that a lot of school invite i to their commencement every year   but you be the first to launch a three year campaign   laughter   email letter tweet youtube video   i even get three note from the grandmother of your student body president   laughter   and i have to say that really seal the deal   that be smart because i have a soft spot for grandmas   laughter

 so i be here off exit 9 on the bank of the old raritan applause at the site of one of the original nine colonial college   applause   winner of the first ever college football game   applause   one of the new member of the big ten   applause   home of what i understand to be a grease truck for a fat sandwich   applause   mozzarella stick and chicken finger on your cheesesteak applause   i ’m sure michelle would approve   laughter

 but however you get here you make it   you make it   today you join a long line of scarlet knights whose energy and intellect have lift this university to height its founder could not have imagine   two hundred and fifty year ago when america be still just an idea a charter from the royal governor ben franklin ’s son establish queen ’s college   a few year later a handful of student gather in a convert tavern for the first class   and from that first class in a pub rutgers have evolve into one of the fine research institution in america   applause

 this be a place where you 3d print prosthetic hand for child and devise rooftop wind array that can power entire office building with clean renewable energy   every day ten of thousand of student come here to this intellectual melting pot where idea and culture flow together among what might just be america ’s most diverse student body   applause   here in new brunswick you can debate philosophy with a classmate from south asia in one class and then strike up a conversation on the ee bus with a first generation latina student from jersey city before sit down for your psych group project with a veteran who ’s go to school on the post-9/11 gi bill   applause

 america converge here   and in so many way the history of rutgers mirror the evolution of america the course by which we become big strong and rich and more dynamic and a more inclusive nation

 but america ’s progress have never be smooth or steady   progress do n’t travel in a straight line   it zig and zag in fit and start   progress in america have be hard and contentious and sometimes bloody   it remain uneven and at time for every two step forward it feel like we take one step back

 now for some of you this may sound like your college career   laughter   it sound like mine anyway   laughter   which make sense because measure against the whole of human history america remain a very young nation young even than this university

 but progress be bumpy   it always have be   but because of dreamer and innovator and striver and activist progress have be this nation ’s hallmark   i ’m fond of quote dr. martin luther king jr. who say the arc of the moral universe be long but it bend towards justice   applause   it bend towards justice   i believe that   but i also believe that the arc of our nation the arc of the world do not bend towards justice or freedom or equality or prosperity on its own   it depend on we on the choice we make particularly at certain inflection point in history particularly when big change be happen and everything seem up for grab

 and class of 2016 you be graduate at such an inflection point   since the start of this new millennium you ’ve already witness horrific terrorist attack and war and a great recession   you ’ve see economic and technological and cultural shift that be profoundly alter how we work and how we communicate how we live how we form family   the pace of change be not subside it be accelerate   and these change offer not only great opportunity but also great peril

 fortunately your generation have everything it take to lead this country toward a bright future   i ’m confident that you can make the right choice away from fear and division and paralysis and toward cooperation and innovation and hope   applause   now partly i ’m confident because on average you ’re smart and well educate than my generation although we probably have well penmanship laughter and be certainly well speller   we do not have spell check back in my day   you ’re not only well educate you ’ve be more exposed to the world more expose to other culture   you ’re more diverse   you ’re more environmentally conscious   you have a healthy skepticism for conventional wisdom

 so you ’ve get the tool to lead we   and precisely because i have so much confidence in you i ’m not go to spend the remainder of my time tell you exactly how you ’re go to make the world well   you ’ll figure it out   you ’ll look at thing with fresher eye unencumbered by the bias and blind spot and inertia and general crankiness of your parent and grandparent and old head like i   but i do have a couple of suggestion that you may find useful as you go out there and conquer the world

 point number one   when you hear someone long for the good old day take it with a grain of salt   laughter and applause   take it with a grain of salt   we live in a great nation and we be rightly proud of our history   we be beneficiary of the labor and the grit and the courage of generation who come before   but i guess it be part of human nature especially in time of change and uncertainty to want to look backwards and long for some imaginary past when everything work and the economy hum and all politician be wise and every kid be well mannered and america pretty much do whatever it want around the world

 guess what   it ai n’t so   laughter   the good old day be n’t that great   yes there have be some stretch in our history where the economy grow much fast or when government run more smoothly   there be moment when immediately after world war ii for example or the end of the cold war when the world bent more easily to our will   but those be sporadic those moment those episode   in fact by almost every measure america be well and the world be well than it be 50 year ago or 30 year ago or even eight year ago   applause

 and by the way i be not set aside 150 year ago pre civil war there ’ a whole bunch of stuff there we could talk about   set aside life in the 50s when woman and people of color be systematically exclude from big chunk of american life   since i graduate in 1983 which be not that long ago laughter i be just say   since i graduate crime rate teenage pregnancy the share of americans live in poverty they ’re all down   the share of americans with college education have go way up   our life expectancy have as well   black and latinos have rise up the rank in business and politic   applause   more woman be in the workforce   applause   they ’re earn more money although it ’ long past time that we pass law to make sure that woman be get the same pay for the same work as man   applause

 meanwhile in the eight year since most of you start high school we ’re also well off   you and your fellow graduate be enter the job market with well prospect than any time since 2007   twenty million more americans know the financial security of health insurance   we ’re less dependent on foreign oil   we ’ve double the production of clean energy   we have cut the high school dropout rate   we have cut the deficit by two third   marriage equality be the law of the land   applause

 and just as america be well the world be well than when i graduate   since i graduate an iron curtain fall apartheid end   there ’ more democracy   we virtually eliminate certain disease like polio   we ’ve cut extreme poverty drastically   we have cut infant mortality by an enormous amount   applause
 now i say all these thing not to make you complacent   we ’ve get a bunch of big problem to solve   but i say it to point out that change have be a constant in our history   and the reason america be well be because we do not look backwards we do not fear the future   we seize the future and make it our own   and that ’s exactly why it ’s always be young people like you that have bring about big change because you do not fear the future

 that lead i to my second point   the world be more interconnected than ever before and it ’s become more connected every day   building wall will not change that   applause

 look as president my first responsibility be always the security and prosperity of the united states   and as citizen we all rightly put our country first   but if the past two decade have teach we anything it ’ that the big challenge we face can not be solve in isolation   applause   when overseas state start fall apart they become breed ground for terrorist and ideology of nihilism and despair that ultimately can reach our shore   when develop country do not have function health system epidemic like zika or ebola can spread and threaten americans too   and a wall will not stop that applause

 if we want to close loophole that allow large corporation and wealthy individual to avoid pay their fair share of taxis we ’ve get to have the cooperation of other country in a global financial system to help enforce financial law   the point be to help ourselves we ’ve get to help other applause not pull up the drawbridge and try to keep the world out applause

 and engagement do not just mean deploy our military   there be time where we must take military action to protect ourselves and our ally and we be in awe of and we be grateful for the man and woman who make up the fine fighting force the world have ever know   applause   but i worry if we think that the entire burden of our engagement with the world be up to the 1 percent who serve in our military and the rest of we can just sit back and do nothing   they can not shoulder the entire burden   and engagement mean use all the lever of our national power and rally the world to take on our share challenge

 you look at something like trade for example   we live in an age of global supply chain and cargo ship that crisscross ocean and online commerce that can render border obsolete   and a lot of folk have legitimate concern with the way globalization have progress that be one of the change that be be take place job ship overseas trade deal that sometimes put worker and business at a disadvantage   but the answer be n’t to stop trade with other country   in this global economy that ’s not even possible   the answer be to do trade the right way by negotiate with other country so that they raise their labor standard and their environmental standard and we make sure they do not impose unfair tariff on american good or steal american intellectual property   that ’ how we make sure that international rule be consistent with our value include human right   and ultimately that be how we help raise wage here in america   that ’ how we help our worker compete on a level playing field

 building wall will not do that applause   it will not boost our economy and it will not enhance our security either   isolate or disparage muslims suggest that they should be treat differently when it come to enter this country applause that be not just a betrayal of our value applause that be not just a betrayal of who we be it would alienate the very community at home and abroad who be our most important partner in the fight against violent extremism    suggest that we can build an endless wall along our border and blame our challenge on immigrant that do not just run counter to our history as the world ’s melting pot it contradict the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism have always be spur by our ability to attract striver from every corner of the globe   that be how we become america   why would we want to stop it now   applause

 audience member   four more year

 the president   can not do it   laughter

 which bring i to my third point   fact evidence reason logic an understanding of science these be good thing   applause   these be quality you want in people make policy   these be quality you want to continue to cultivate in yourself as citizen   applause   that might seem obvious laughter   that be why we honor bill moyers or dr. burnell

 we traditionally have value those thing   but if you be listen to today ’s political debate you might wonder where this strain of anti intellectualism come from   applause   so class of 2016 let i be as clear as i can be   in politic and in life ignorance be not a virtue   applause   it be not cool to not know what you be talk about   applause   that be not keep it real or tell it like it be   laughter   that be not challenge political correctness   that be just not know what you be talk about   applause   and yet we have become confused about this

 look our nation ’s founders franklin madison hamilton jefferson they be bear of the enlightenment   they seek to escape superstition and sectarianism and tribalism and no nothingness   applause   they believe in rational thought and experimentation and the capacity of informed citizen to master our own fate   that be embed in our constitutional design   that spirit inform our inventor and our explorer the edisons and the wright brothers and the george washington carvers and the grace hoppers and the norman borlaugs and the steve jobses   that be what build this country

 and today in every phone in one of your pocket laughter we have access to more information than at any time in human history at a touch of a button   but ironically the flood of information have not make we more discerning of the truth in some way it ’s just make we more confident in our ignorance applause   we assume whatever be on the web must be true   we search for site that just reinforce our own predisposition opinion masquerade as fact   the wildest conspiracy theory be take for gospel

 now understand i be sure you ’ve learn during your year of college and if not you will learn soon that there be a whole lot of folk who be book smart and have no common sense   applause   that be the truth   you ’ll meet they if you have not already   laughter   so the fact that they ’ve get a fancy degree you got to talk to they to see whether they know what they ’re talk about   laughter   quality like kindness and compassion honesty hard work they often matter more than technical skill or know how   applause

 but when our leader express a disdain for fact when they ’re not hold accountable for repeat falsehood and just make stuff up while actual expert be dismiss as elitist then we ’ve get a problem   applause

 you know it be interesting that if we get sick we actually want to make sure the doctor have go to medical school they know what they ’re talk about   applause   if we get on a plane we say we really want a pilot to be able to pilot the plane   laughter   and yet in our public life we certainly think i do not want somebody who ’s do it before   laughter and applause   the rejection of fact the rejection of reason and science that be the path to decline   it call to mind the word of carl sagan who graduate high school here in new jersey applause he say   we can judge our progress by the courage of our question and the depth of our answer our willingness to embrace what be true rather than what feel good

 the debate around climate change be a perfect example of this   now i recognize it do not feel like the planet be warm right now   laughter   i understand   there be hail when i land in newark   laughter   the wind start blow hard   laughter    but think about the climate change issue   every day there be official in high office with responsibility who mock the overwhelming consensus of the world ’s scientist that human activity and the release of carbon dioxide and methane and other substance be alter our climate in profound and dangerous way

 a while back you may have see a united states senator trot out a snowball during a floor speech in the middle of winter as proof that the world be not warm   laughter   i mean listen climate change be not something subject to political spin   there be evidence   there be fact   we can see it happen right now   applause   if we do n’t act if we do not follow through on the progress we make in paris the progress we have be make here at home your generation will feel the brunt of this catastrophe

 so it ’ up to you to insist upon and shape an informed debate   imagine if benjamin franklin have see that senator with the snowball what he would think   imagine if your 5th grade science teacher have see that   laughter   he ’d get a d.   laughter   and he ’ a senator   laughter

 look i be not suggest that cold analysis and hard datum be ultimately more important in life than passion or faith or love or loyalty   i be suggest that those high expression of our humanity can only flourish when our economy function well and propose budget add up and our environment be protect   and to accomplish those thing to make collective decision on behalf of a common good we have to use our head   we have to agree that fact and evidence matter   and we get to hold our leader and ourselves accountable to know what the heck they ’re talk about   applause

 all right   i only have two more point   i know it be get cold and you guy have to graduate   laughter   point four   have faith in democracy   look i know it ’s not always pretty    really i know   laughter   i have be live it   but it ’ how bit by bit generation by generation we have make progress in this nation   that be how we ban child labor   that be how we clean up our air and our water   that be how we pass program like social security and medicare that lift million of senior out of poverty   applause

 none of these change happen overnight   they do not happen because some charismatic leader get everybody suddenly to agree on everything   it do not happen because some massive political revolution occur   it actually happen over the course of year of advocacy and organizing and alliance building and deal making and the change of public opinion   it happen because ordinary americans who care participate in the political process

 audience member   because of you   applause

 the president   well that be nice   i mean i help but applause

 look if you want to change this country for the well you well start participate   i will give you an example on a lot of people ’s mind right now and that ’ the grow inequality in our economy   over much of the last century we ’ve unleash the strong economic engine the world have ever see but over the past few decade our economy have become more and more unequal   the top 10 percent of earner now take in half of all income in the u.s.   in the past it use to be a top ceo make 20 or 30 time the income of the average worker   today it ’ 300 time more   and wage be n’t rise fast enough for million of hardworke family

 now if we want to reverse those trend there be a bunch of policy that would make a real difference   we can raise the minimum wage   applause   we can modernize our infrastructure we can invest in early childhood education   we can make college more affordable   applause   we can close tax loophole on hedge fund manager and take that money and give tax break to help family with child care or retirement   and if we do these thing then we ’d help to restore the sense that hard work be reward and we could build an economy that truly work for everybody   applause

 now the reason some of these thing have not happen even though the majority of people approve of they be really simple it be not because i be not propose they   it be n’t because the fact and the evidence show they would not work   it be because a huge chunk of americans especially young people do not vote
 in 2014 voter turnout be the low since world war ii   few than one in five young people show up to vote 2014   and the four who stay home determine the course of this country just as much as the single one who vote   because apathy have consequence   it determine who our congress be   it determine what policy they prioritize   it even for example determine whether a really highly qualified supreme court nominee receive the courtesy of a hearing and a vote in the united states senate   applause

 and yes big money in politic be a huge problem   we have get to reduce its influence   yes special interest and lobbyist have disproportionate access to the corridor of power but contrary to what we hear sometimes from both the left as well as the right the system be not as rig as you think and it certainly be not as hopeless as you think   politician care about be elect and they especially care about be reelect   and if you vote and you elect a majority that represent your view you will get what you want   and if you opt out or stop pay attention you will n’t   it ’ that simple applause   it be not that complicated

 now one of the reason that people do n’t vote be because they do not see the change they be look for right away   well guess what none of the great stride in our history happen right away   it take thurgood marshall and the naacp decade to win brown v. board of education and then another decade after that to secure the civil rights act and the voting rights act   applause   and it take more time after that for it to start work   it take a proud daughter of new jersey alice paul year of organize marche and hunger strike and protest and draft hundred of piece of legislation and write letter and give speech and work with congressional leader before she and other suffragette finally help win woman the right to vote   applause

 each stage along the way require compromise   sometimes you take half a loaf   you forge ally   sometimes you lose on an issue and then you come back to fight another day   that ’ how democracy work   so you ’ve get to be commit to participate not just if you get immediate gratification but you got to be a citizen full time all the time

 and if participation mean voting and it mean compromise and organizing and advocacy it also mean listen to those who do n’t agree with you   i know a couple year ago folk on this campus get upset that condoleezza rice be suppose to speak at a commencement   now i do not think it be a secret that i disagree with many of the foreign policy of dr. rice and the previous administration   but the notion that this community or the country would be well serve by not hear from a former secretary of state or shut out what she have to say i believe that ’s misguided   applause   i do not think that be how democracy work well when we be not even willing to listen to each other   applause   i believe that be misguided

 if you disagree with somebody bring they in applause and ask they tough question   hold their foot to the fire   make they defend their position   applause   if somebody have get a bad or offensive idea prove it wrong   engage it   debate it   stand up for what you believe in   applause   do not be scared to take somebody on   do not feel like you get to shut your ear off because you be too fragile and somebody might offend your sensibility   go at they if they ’re not make any sense use your logic and reason and word   and by do so you ’ll strengthen your own position and you ’ll hone your argument   and maybe you ’ll learn something and realize you do not know everything   and you may have a new understanding not only about what your opponent believe but maybe what you believe   either way you win   and more importantly our democracy win   applause

 so anyway all right   that be it class of 2016 laughter a few suggestion on how you can change the world except maybe i have get one last suggestion   applause   just one   and that be gear yourself for the long haul   whatever path you choose business nonprofit government education health care the art whatever it be you be go to have some setback   you will deal occasionally with foolish people   you will be frustrate   you ’ll have a boss that be not great   you will not always get everything you want at least not as fast as you want it   so you have to stick with it   you have to be persistent   and success however small however incomplete success be still success   i always tell my daughter you know well be good   it may not be perfect it may not be great but it be good   that be how progress happen in society and in our own life

 so do not lose hope if sometimes you hit a roadblock   do not lose hope in the face of naysayer   and certainly do not let resistance make you cynical   cynicism be so easy and cynic do n’t accomplish much   as a friend of mine who happen to be from new jersey a guy name bruce springsteen once sing applause they spend their life wait for a moment that just do not come   do not let that be you   do not waste your time wait

 if you doubt you can make a difference look at the impact some of your fellow graduate be already make   look at what matthew be do   look at somebody like yasmin ramadan who begin organize anti bullying assembly when she be 10 year old to help kid handle bias and discrimination and here at rutgers helped find the muslim public relations council to work with administrator and police to promote inclusion   applause

 look at somebody like madison little who grow up deal with some health issue and start wonder what his care would have be like if he live someplace else and so here at rutgers he take charge of a student nonprofit and work with folk in australia and cambodia and uganda to address the aids epidemic   our generation have so much energy to adapt and impact the world he say   my peer give i a lot of hope that we ’ll overcome the obstacle we face in society

 that be you   be it any wonder that i be optimistic   throughout our history a new generation of americans have reach up and bent the arc of history in the direction of more freedom and more opportunity and more justice   and class of 2016 it be your turn now applause to shape our nation ’s destiny as well as your own

 so get to work   make sure the next 250 year be well than the last   applause

 good luck   god bless you   god bless this country we love   thank you   applause

  so i first come to chicago when i be in my early twenty and i be still try to figure out who i be still search for a purpose in my life and it be a neighborhood not far from here where i begin work with church group in the shadow of closed steel mill it be on these street where i witness the power of faith and the quiet dignity of work people in the face of struggle and loss
  < em > audience members</em > four more year four more year four more year
  < em > the president</em > i can not do that
  < em > audience members</em > four more year four more year four more year
  < em > the president</em > now this be where i learn that change only happen when ordinary people get involve and they get engage and they come together to demand it
  after 8 year as your president i still believe that and it be not just my belief it be the beat heart of our american idea our bold experiment in self government it be the conviction that we be all create equal endow by our creator with certain unalienable right among they life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it be the insistence that these right while self evident have never be self executing that we the people through the instrument of our democracy can form a more perfect union
  what a radical idea a great gift that our founder give to we the freedom to chase our individual dream through our sweat and toil and imagination and the imperative to strive together as well to achieve a common good a great good
  for 240 year our nation 's call to citizenship have give work and purpose to each new generation it be what lead patriot to choose republic over tyranny pioneer to trek west slave to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom it be what pull immigrant and refugee across ocean and the rio grande it be what push woman to reach for the ballot it be what powered worker to organize it be why gi give their life at omaha beach and iwo jima iraq and afghanistan and why man and woman from selma to stonewall be prepared to give theirs as well
  so that be what we mean when we say america 's exceptional not that our nation have be flawless from the start but that we have show the capacity to change and make life well for those who follow yes our progress have be uneven the work of democracy have always be hard it be always be contentious sometimes it be be bloody for every two step forward it often feel we take one step back but the long sweep of america have be define by forward motion a constant widening of our found creed to embrace all and not just some
  if i have tell you 8 year ago that america would reverse a great recession reboot our auto industry and unleash the long stretch of job creation in our history if i have tell you that we would open up a new chapter with the cuban people shut down iran 's nuclear weapon program without fire a shot take out the mastermind of 9/11 if i have tell you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizen if i have tell you all that you might have say our sight be set a little too high but that be what we do that be what you do
  you be the change you answer people 's hope and because of you by almost every measure america be a well strong place than it be when we start
  in 10 day the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy
  < em > audience members</em > no
  < em > the president</em > no no no no no the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elect president to the next i commit to president elect trump that my administration would ensure the smooth possible transition just as president bush do for i because it be up to all of we to make sure our government can help we meet the many challenge we still face
  we have what we need to do so we have everything we need to meet those challenge after all we remain the wealthy most powerful and most respected nation on earth our youth our drive our diversity and openness our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention mean that the future should be ours but that potential will only be realize if our democracy work only if our politic well reflect the decency of our people only if all of we regardless of party affiliation or particular interest help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now
  that be what i want to focus on tonight the state of our democracy understand democracy do not require uniformity our founder argue they quarrel eventually they compromise they expect we to do the same but they know that democracy do require a basic sense of solidarity the idea that for all our outward difference we be all in this together that we rise or fall as one
  there have be moment throughout our history that threaten that solidarity the beginning of this century have be one of those time a shrink world grow inequality demographic change and the specter of terrorism these force have not just test our security and our prosperity but be test our democracy as well and how we meet these challenge to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kid and create good job and protect our homeland in other word it will determine our future
  to begin with our democracy will not work without a sense that everyone have economic opportunity and the good news be that today the economy be grow again wage income home value and retirement account be all rise again poverty be fall again the wealthy be pay a fairer share of taxis even as the stock market shatter record the unemployment rate be near a 10 year low the uninsured rate have never ever be low health care cost be rise at the slow rate in 50 year and i have say and i mean it if anyone can put together a plan that be demonstrably well than the improvement we have make to our health care system that cover as many people at less cost i will publicly support it
  because that after all be why we serve not to score point or take credit but to make people 's life well
  but for all the real progress that we have make we know it be not enough our economy do not work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a grow middle class and ladder for folk who want to get into the middle class that be the economic argument but stark inequality be also corrosive to our democratic ideal while the top 1 percent have amass a big share of wealth and income too many of our family in inner city and in rural county have be leave behind the lay off factory worker the waitress or health care worker who be just barely get by and struggle to pay the bill convince that the game be fix against they that their government only serve the interest of the powerful that be a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politic
  but there be no quick fix to this long term trend i agree our trade should be fair and not just free but the next wave of economic dislocation will not come from overseas it will come from the relentless pace of automation that make a lot of good middle class job obsolete
  and so we be go to have to forge a new social compact to guarantee all our kid the education they need to give worker the power to unionize for well wage to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now and make more reform to the tax code so corporation and individual who reap the most from this new economy do not avoid their obligation to the country that be make their very success possible
  we can argue about how to well achieve these goal but we can not be complacent about the goal themselves for if we do not create opportunity for all people the disaffection and division that have stall our progress will only sharpen in year to come
  there be a second threat to our democracy and this one be as old as our nation itself after my election there be talk of a postracial america and such a vision however well intend be never realistic race remain a potent and often divisive force in our society now i have live long enough to know that race relation be well than they be 10 or 20 or 30 year ago no matter what some folk say you can see it not just in statistic you see it in the attitude of young americans across the political spectrum
  but we be not where we need to be and all of we have more work to do if every economic issue be frame as a struggle between a hardworke white middle class and an undeserving minority then worker of all shade be go to be leave fight for scrap while the wealthy withdraw far into their private enclave if we be unwilling to invest in the child of immigrant just because they do not look like we we will diminish the prospect of our own child because those brown kid will represent a large and large share of america 's workforce and we have show that our economy do not have to be a zero sum game last year income rise for all race all age group for man and for woman
  so if we be go to be serious about race go forward we need to uphold law against discrimination in hire and in housing and in education and in the criminal justice system that be what our constitution and our high ideal require but law alone will not be enough heart must change it will not change overnight social attitude oftentime take generation to change but if our democracy be to work the way it should in this increasingly diverse nation then each one of we need to try to heed the advice of a great character in american fiction atticus finch who say you never really understand a person until you consider thing from his point of view until you climb into his skin and walk around in it
  for blacks and other minority group that mean tie our own very real struggle for justice to the challenge that a lot of people in this country face not only the refugee or the immigrant or the rural poor or the transgender american but also the middle aged white guy who from the outside may seem like he be get advantage but have see his world upend by economic and cultural and technological change we have to pay attention and listen
  for white americans it mean acknowledge that the effect of slavery and jim crow do not suddenly vanish in the sixty that when minority group voice discontent they be not just engage in reverse racism or practice political correctness when they wage peaceful protest they be not demand special treatment but the equal treatment that our founder promise
  for native bear americans it mean remind ourselves that the stereotype about immigrant today be say almost word for word about the irish and italians and poles who it be say be go to destroy the fundamental character of america and as it turn out america be not weaken by the presence of these newcomer these newcomer embrace this nation 's creed and this nation be strengthen
  so regardless of the station that we occupy we all have to try hard we all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizen love this country just as much as we do that they value hard work and family just like we do that their child be just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own
  and that be not easy to do for too many of we it be become safe to retreat into our own bubble whether in our neighborhood or on college campus or place of worship or especially our social medium feed surround by people who look like we and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumption and the rise of naked partisanship and increase economic and regional stratification the splintering of our medium into a channel for every taste all this make this great sort seem natural even inevitable and increasingly we become so secure in our bubble that we start accept only information whether it be true or not that fit our opinion instead of base our opinion on the evidence that be out there
  and this trend represent a third threat to our democracy but politic be a battle of idea that be how our democracy be design in the course of a healthy debate we prioritize different goal and the different mean of reach they but without some common baseline of fact without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent might be make a fair point and that science and reason matter then we be go to keep talk past each other and we will make common ground and compromise impossible
  and be not that part of what so often make politic dispirit how can elect official rage about deficit when we propose to spend money on preschool for kid but not when we be cut taxis for corporation how do we excuse ethical lapse in our own party but pounce when the other party do the same thing it be not just dishonest this selective sorting of the fact it be self defeating because as my mom use to tell i reality have a way of catch up with you take the challenge of climate change in just 8 year we have halve our dependence on foreign oil we have double our renewable energy we have lead the world to an agreement that have the promise to save this planet but without bold action our child will not have time to debate the existence of climate change they will be busy deal with its effect more environmental disaster more economic disruption wave of climate refugee seek sanctuary
  now we can and should argue about the good approach to solve the problem but to simply deny the problem not only betray future generation it betray the essential spirit of this country the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem solve that guide our founder
  it be that spirit bear of the enlightenment that make we an economic powerhouse the spirit that take flight at kitty hawk and cape canaveral the spirit that cure disease and put a computer in every pocket
  it be that spirit a faith in reason and enterprise and the primacy of right over might that allow we to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the great depression that allow we to build a post world war ii order with other democracy an order base not just on military power or national affiliation but build on principle the rule of law human right freedom of religion and speech and assembly and an independent press
  that order be now be challenge first by violent fanatic who claim to speak for islam more recently by autocrat in foreign capital who see free market and open democracy and civil society itself as a threat to their power the peril each pose to our democracy be more far reach than a car bomb or a missile they represent the fear of change the fear of people who look or speak or pray differently a contempt for the rule of law that hold leader accountable an intolerance of dissent and free thought a belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or the propaganda machine be the ultimate arbiter of what be true and what be right
  because of the extraordinary courage of our man and woman in uniform because of our intelligence officer and law enforcement and diplomat who support our troop no foreign terrorist organization have successfully plan and execute an attack on our homeland these past 8 year and although boston and orlando and san bernardino and fort hood remind we of how dangerous radicalization can be our law enforcement agency be more effective and vigilant than ever we have take out ten of thousand of terrorist include bin laden the global coalition we be lead against isil have take out their leader and take away about half their territory isil will be destroy and no one who threaten america will ever be safe
  and to all who serve or have serve it have be the honor of my lifetime to be your commander in chief and we all owe you a deep debt of gratitude
  but protect our way of life that be not just the job of our military democracy can buckle when it give in to fear so just as we as citizen must remain vigilant against external aggression we must guard against a weakening of the value that make we who we be
  and that be why for the past 8 year i have work to put the fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing that be why we have end torture work to close gitmo reform our law govern surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberty that be why i reject discrimination against muslim americans who be just as patriotic as we be
  that be why we can not withdraw from big global fight to expand democracy and human right and woman 's right and lgbt right no matter how imperfect our effort no matter how expedient ignore such value may seem that be part of defend america for the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism be of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression if the scope of freedom and respect for the rule of law shrink around the world the likelihood of war within and between nation increase and our own freedom will eventually be threaten
  so let us be vigilant but not afraid isil will try to kill innocent people but they can not defeat america unless we betray our constitution and our principle in the fight rival like russia or china can not match our influence around the world unless we give up what we stand for and turn ourselves into just another big country that bully small neighbor
  which bring i to my final point our democracy be threaten whenever we take it for grant all of we regardless of party should be throw ourselves into the task of rebuild our democratic institution when vote rate in america be some of the low among advanced democracy we should be make it easy not hard to vote when trust in our institution be low we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politic and insist on the principle of transparency and ethic in public service when congress be dysfunctional we should draw our congressional district to encourage politician to cater to common sense and not rigid extreme
  but remember none of this happen on its own all of this depend on our participation on each of we accept the responsibility of citizenship regardless of which way the pendulum of power happen to be swinge
  our constitution be a remarkable beautiful gift but it be really just a piece of parchment it have no power on its own we the people give it power we the people give it mean with our participation and with the choice that we make and the alliance that we forge whether or not we stand up for our freedom whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law that be up to we america be no fragile thing but the gain of our long journey to freedom be not assure
  in his own farewell address george washington write that self government be the underpinning of our safety prosperity and liberty but from different cause and from different quarter much pain will be take to weaken in your mind the conviction of this truth and so we have to preserve this truth with jealous anxiety that we should reject the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred tie that make we one
  america we weaken those tie when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character be not even willing to enter into public service so coarse with rancor that americans with whom we disagree be see not just as misguide but as malevolent we weaken those tie when we define some of we as more american than other when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt and when we sit back and blame the leader we elect without examine our own role in elect they
  it fall to each of we to be those anxious jealous guardian of our democracy to embrace the joyous task we have be give to continually try to improve this great nation of ours because for all our outward difference we in fact all share the same proud title the most important office in a democracy citizen citizen
  so you see that be what our democracy demand it need you not just when there be an election not just when your own narrow interest be at stake but over the full span of a lifetime if you be tired of argue with stranger on the internet try talk with one of they in real life if something need fix then lace up your shoe and do some organizing if you be disappoint by your elect official grab a clipboard get some signature and run for office yourself show up dive in stay at it
  sometimes you will win sometimes you will lose presume a reservoir of goodness in other people that can be a risk and there will be time when the process will disappoint you but for those of we fortunate enough to have be a part of this work and to see it up close let i tell you it can energize and inspire and more often than not your faith in america and in americans will be confirm
  mine sure have be over the course of these 8 year i have see the hopeful face of young graduate and our new military officer i have mourn with grieve family search for answer and find grace in a charleston church i have see our scientist help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch i have see wound warrior who at point be give up for dead walk again i have see our doctor and volunteer rebuild after earthquake and stop pandemic in their track i have see the young of child remind we through their action and through their generosity of our obligation to care for refugee or work for peace and above all to look out for each other
  so that faith that i place all those year ago not far from here in the power of ordinary americans to bring about change that faith have be reward in way i could not have possibly imagine and i hope your faith have too some of you here tonight or watch at home you be there with we in 2004 in 2008 2012 maybe you still can not believe we pull this whole thing off let i tell you you be not the only one

  to joe biden the scrappy kid from scranton who become delaware 's favorite son you be the first decision i make as a nominee and it be the good not just because you have be a great vice president but because in the bargain i gain a brother and we love you and jill like family and your friendship have be one of the great joy of our life
  to my remarkable staff for 8 year and for some of you a whole lot more i have draw from your energy and every day i try to reflect back what you display heart and character and idealism i have watch you grow up get marry have kid start incredible new journey of your own even when time get tough and frustrating you never let washington get the well of you you guard against cynicism and the only thing that make i prouder than all the good that we have do be the thought of all the amazing thing that you be go to achieve from here
  and to all of you out there every organizer who move to an unfamiliar town every kind family who welcome they in every volunteer who knock on door every young person who cast a ballot for the first time every american who live and breathe the hard work of change you be the good supporter and organizer anybody could ever hope for and i will be forever grateful because you do change the world you do
  and that be why i leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than when we start because i know our work have not only help so many americans it have inspire so many americans especially so many young people out there to believe that you can make a difference to hitch your wagon to something big than yourself
  let i tell you this generation come up unselfish altruistic creative patriotic i've see you in every corner of the country you believe in a fair and just and inclusive america you know that constant change have be america 's hallmark that it be not something to fear but something to embrace you be willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward you will soon outnumber all of we and i believe as a result the future be in good hand
  my fellow americans it have be the honor of my life to serve you i will not stop in fact i will be right there with you as a citizen for all my remain day but for now whether you be young or whether you be young at heart i do have one final ask of you as your president the same thing i ask when you take a chance on i 8 year ago i be ask you to believe not in my ability to bring about change but in your

 for too long a small group in our nation ’s capital have reap the reward of government while the people have bear the cost

 washington flourish but the people do not share in its wealth

 these be the just and reasonable demand of a righteous public

 but for too many of our citizen a different reality exist mother and child trap in poverty in our inner city rust out factory scatter like tombstone across the landscape of our nation an education system flush with cash but which leave our young and beautiful student deprive of knowledge and the crime and gang and drug that have steal too many life and rob our country of so much unrealized potential

 this american carnage stop right here and stop right now

 we be one nation and their pain be our pain   their dream be our dream and their success will be our success   we share one heart one home and one glorious destiny

 the oath of office i take today be an oath of allegiance to all americans

 for many decade we ’ve enrich foreign industry at the expense of american industry

 subsidize the army of other country while allow for the very sad depletion of our military

 we have defend other nation ’s border while refuse to defend our own

 and spend trillion of dollar overseas while america 's infrastructure have fall into disrepair and decay

 we ’ve make other country rich while the wealth strength and confidence of our country have disappear over the horizon

 one by one the factory shutter and leave our shore with not even a thought about the million upon million of american worker leave behind

 the wealth of our middle class have be rip from their home and then redistribute across the entire world

 but that be the past and now we be look only to the future

 we assemble here today be issue a new decree to be hear in every city in every foreign capital and in every hall of power

 from this day forward a new vision will govern our land

 from this moment on it ’s go to be america first

 every decision on trade on taxis on immigration on foreign affair will be make to benefit american worker and american family

 we must protect our border from the ravage of other country make our product steal our company and destroy our job   protection will lead to great prosperity and strength

 i will fight for you with every breath in my body and i will never ever let you down

 america will start win again win like never before

 we will build new road and highway and bridge and airport and tunnel and railway all across our wonderful nation

 we will get our people off of welfare and back to work rebuild our country with american hand and american labor

 we will follow two simple rule buy american and hire american

 we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nation of the world but we do so with the understanding that it be the right of all nation to put their own interest first

 we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow

 we will reinforce old alliance and form new one and unite the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth

 at the bedrock of our politic will be a total allegiance to the united states of america and through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other

 when you open your heart to patriotism there be no room for prejudice

 the bible tell we how good and pleasant it be when god ’s people live together in unity

 we must speak our mind openly debate our disagreement honestly but always pursue solidarity

 when america be united america be totally unstoppable

 there should be no fear we be protect and we will always be protect

 we will be protect by the great man and woman of our military and law enforcement and most importantly we be protect by god

 finally we must think big and dream even big

 in america we understand that a nation be only live as long as it be strive

 we will no long accept politician who be all talk and no action constantly complain but never do anything about it

 the time for empty talk be over

 now arrive the hour of action

 do not let anyone tell you it can not be do   no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america

mr. speaker mr. vice president members of congress the first lady of the united states and citizens of america

 in 9 year the united states will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding 250 year since the day we declare our independence

 it will be one of the great milestone in the history of the world

 but what will america look like as we reach our 250th year what kind of country will we leave for our child

 i will not allow the mistake of recent decade past to define the course of our future

 for too long we have watch our middle class shrink as we have export our job and wealth to foreign country

 we have finance and build one global project after another but ignore the fate of our child in the inner city of chicago baltimore detroit and so many other place throughout our land

 we have defend the border of other nation while leave our own border wide open for anyone to cross and for drug to pour in at a now unprecedented rate

 and we have spend trillion of dollar overseas while our infrastructure at home have so badly crumble

 then in 2016 the earth shift beneath our foot   the rebellion start as a quiet protest speak by family of all color and creed family who just want a fair shot for their child and a fair hearing for their concern

 but then the quiet voice become a loud chorus as thousand of citizen now speak out together from city small and large all across our country

 finally the chorus become an earthquake and the people turn out by the ten of million and they be all unite by one very simple but crucial demand that america must put its own citizen first because only then can we truly make america great again

 die industry will come roar back to life   heroic veteran will get the care they so desperately need

 our military will be give the resource its brave warrior so richly deserve

 crumble infrastructure will be replace with new road bridge tunnel airport and railway gleam across our beautiful land

 our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop

 and our neglect inner city will see a rebirth of hope safety and opportunity

 above all else we will keep our promise to the american people

 at the same time my administration have answer the plea of the american people for immigration enforcement and border security   by finally enforce our immigration law we will raise wage help the unemployed save billion of dollar and make our community safe for everyone   we want all americans to succeed but that can not happen in an environment of lawless chaos   we must restore integrity and the rule of law to our border

 for that reason we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border

 as we speak we be remove gang member drug dealer and criminal that threaten our community and prey on our citizen   bad one be go out as i speak tonight and as i have promise

 to any in congress who do not believe we should enforce our law i would ask you this question   what would you say to the american family that lose their job their income or a love one because america refuse to uphold its law and defend its border

 our obligation be to serve protect and defend the citizen of the united states   we be also take strong measure to protect our nation from radical islamic terrorism

 accord to datum provide by the department of justice the vast majority of individual convict for terrorism relate offense since 9/11 come here from outside of our country   we have see the attack at home from boston to san bernardino to the pentagon and yes even the world trade center

 we have see the attack in france in belgium in germany and all over the world

 it be not compassionate but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from place where proper vetting can not occur   those give the high honor of admission to the united states should support this country and love its people and its value

 we can not allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside america we can not allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremist

 that be why my administration have be work on improved vetting procedure and we will shortly take new step to keep our nation safe and to keep out those who would do we harm

 as promise i direct the department of defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy isis a network of lawless savage that have slaughter muslims and christians and man woman and child of all faith and belief   we will work with our ally include our friend and ally in the muslim world to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet

 i have also impose new sanction on entity and individual who support iran 's ballistic missile program and reaffirm our unbreakable alliance with the state of israel

 finally i have keep my promise to appoint a justice to the united states supreme court from my list of 20 judge who will defend our constitution   i be honor to have maureen scalia with we in the gallery tonight   her late great husband antonin scalia will forever be a symbol of american justice   to fill his seat we have choose judge neil gorsuch a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law   he be confirm unanimously to the court of appeals and i be ask the senate to swiftly approve his nomination

 tonight as i outline the next step we must take as a country we must honestly acknowledge the circumstance we inherit

 ninety four million americans be out of the labor force

 over 43 million people be now live in poverty and over 43 million americans be on food stamp

 more than 1 in 5 people in their prime working year be not work

 we have the bad financial recovery in 65 year

 in the last 8 year the past administration have put on more new debt than nearly all other president combine

 we have lose more than one fourth of our manufacture job since nafta be approve and we have lose 60,000 factory since china join the world trade organization in 2001

 our trade deficit in good with the world last year be nearly $ 800 billion dollar

 and overseas we have inherit a series of tragic foreign policy disaster

 solve these and so many other press problem will require we to work past the difference of party   it will require we to tap into the american spirit that have overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history

 but to accomplish our goal at home and abroad we must restart the engine of the american economy make it easy for company to do business in the united states and much hard for company to leave

 right now american company be tax at one of the high rate anywhere in the world

 my economic team be develop historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our company so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone   at the same time we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class

 we must create a level playing field for american company and worker

 currently when we ship product out of america many other country make we pay very high tariff and taxis but when foreign company ship their product into america we charge they almost nothing

 i just meet with official and worker from a great american company harley davidson   in fact they proudly display five of their magnificent motorcycle make in the usa on the front lawn of the white house

 at our meeting i ask they how be you do how be business   they say that it be good   i ask they far how they be do with other country mainly international sale   they tell i without even complain because they have be mistreat for so long that they have become used to it that it be very hard to do business with other country because they tax our good at such a high rate   they say that in one case another country tax their motorcycle at 100 percent

 they be not even ask for change   but i be

 i believe strongly in free trade but it also have to be fair trade

 the first republican president abraham lincoln warn that the abandonment of the protective policy by the american government will produce want and ruin among our people

 lincoln be right and it be time we heed his word i be not go to let america and its great company and worker be take advantage of anymore

 i be go to bring back million of job   protect our worker also mean reform our system of legal immigration   the current outdated system depress wage for our poor worker and put great pressure on taxpayer

 nation around the world like canada australia and many other have a merit base immigration system   it be a basic principle that those seek to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially   yet in america we do not enforce this rule strain the very public resource that our poor citizen rely upon   accord to the national academy of sciences our current immigration system cost america 's taxpayer many billion of dollar a year

 switch away from this current system of low skilled immigration and instead adopt a merit base system will have many benefit   it will save countless dollar raise worker wage and help struggle family include immigrant family enter the middle class

 another republican president dwight d. eisenhower initiate the last truly great national infrastructure program the building of the interstate highway system   the time have come for a new program of national rebuilding

 america have spend approximately six trillion dollar in the middle east all this while our infrastructure at home be crumble   with this six trillion dollar we could have rebuild our country twice   and maybe even three time if we have people who have the ability to negotiate

 to launch our national rebuilding i will be ask the congress to approve legislation that produce a $ 1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the united states finance through both public and private capital create million of new job

 this effort will be guide by two core principle   buy american and hire american

 tonight i be also call on this congress to repeal and replace obamacare with reform that expand choice increase access low cost and at the same time provide well healthcare

 mandate every american to buy government approve health insurance be never the right solution for america   the way to make health insurance available to everyone be to lower the cost of health insurance and that be what we will do

 obamacare premium nationwide have increase by double and triple digit   as an example arizona go up 116 percent last year alone   governor matt bevin of kentucky just say obamacare be fail in his state it be unsustainable and collapse

 one third of county have only one insurer on the exchange leave many americans with no choice at all

 remember when you be tell that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan

 we now know that all of those promise have be break

 obamacare be collapse and we must act decisively to protect all americans   action be not a choice it be a necessity

 so i be call on all democrats and republicans in the congress to work with we to save americans from this implode obamacare disaster

 here be the principle that should guide the congress as we move to create a well healthcare system for all americans

 first we should ensure that americans with pre existing condition have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for americans currently enrol in the healthcare exchange

 secondly we should help americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credit and expand health savings accounts but it must be the plan they want not the plan force on they by the government

 thirdly we should give our great state governors the resource and flexibility they need with medicaid to make sure no one be leave out

 fourthly we should implement legal reform that protect patient and doctor from unnecessary cost that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drug and bring they down immediately

 finally the time have come to give americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state line create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far well care

 everything that be break in our country can be fix   every problem can be solve   and every hurt family can find healing and hope

 our citizen deserve this and so much more so why not join force to finally get it do   on this and so many other thing democrats and republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the american people

 my administration want to work with member in both party to make childcare accessible and affordable to help ensure new parent have pay family leave to invest in woman 's health and to promote clean air and clear water and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure

 true love for our people require we to find common ground to advance the common good and to cooperate on behalf of every american child who deserve a bright future

 an incredible young woman be with we this evening who should serve as an inspiration to we all

 today be rare disease day and join we in the gallery be a rare disease survivor megan crowley   megan be diagnose with pompe disease a rare and serious illness when she be 15 month old   she be not expect to live past 5

 on receive this news megan 's dad john fight with everything he have to save the life of his precious child   he found a company to look for a cure and help develop the drug that save megan 's life   today she be 20 year old and a sophomore at notre dame

 megan 's story be about the unbounded power of a father 's love for a daughter

 but our slow and burdensome approval process at the food and drug administration keep too many advance like the one that save megan 's life from reach those in need

 if we slash the restraint not just at the fda but across our government then we will be bless with far more miracle like megan

 in fact our child will grow up in a nation of miracle

 but to achieve this future we must enrich the mind and the soul of every american child

 education be the civil right issue of our time

 i be call upon member of both party to pass an education bill that fund school choice for disadvantaged youth include million of african american and latino child   these family should be free to choose the public private charter magnet religious or home school that be right for they

 join we tonight in the gallery be a remarkable woman denisha merriweather   as a young girl denisha struggle in school and fail third grade twice   but then she be able to enroll in a private center for learn with the help of a tax credit scholarship program   today she be the first in her family to graduate not just from high school but from college   later this year she will get her master degree in social work

 we want all child to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like denisha

 but to break the cycle of poverty we must also break the cycle of violence

 the murder rate in 2015 experience its large single year increase in nearly half a century

 in chicago more than 4,000 people be shoot last year alone and the murder rate so far this year have be even high

 this be not acceptable in our society

 every american child should be able to grow up in a safe community to attend a great school and to have access to a high pay job

 but to create this future we must work with not against the man and woman of law enforcement

 we must build bridge of cooperation and trust not drive the wedge of disunity and division

 police and sheriff be member of our community   they be friend and neighbor they be mother and father son and daughter and they leave behind love one every day who worry whether or not they will come home safe and sound

 we must support the incredible man and woman of law enforcement

 and we must support the victim of crime

 i have order the department of homeland security to create an office to serve american victims   the office be call voice victims of immigration crime engagement   we be provide a voice to those who have be ignore by our medium and silence by special interest

 join we in the audience tonight be four very brave americans whose government fail they

 to jamiel jenna susan and jessica   i want you to know we will never stop fight for justice   your loved one will never be forget we will always honor their memory

 finally to keep america safe we must provide the man and woman of the united states military with the tool they need to prevent war and if they must to fight and to win

 i be send the congress a budget that rebuild the military eliminate the defense sequester and call for one of the large increase in national defense spending in american history

 my budget will also increase funding for our veteran

 our veteran have deliver for this nation and now we must deliver for they

 the challenge we face as a nation be great   but our people be even great

 and none be great or braver than those who fight for america in uniform

 to those ally who wonder what kind of friend america will be look no far than the hero who wear our uniform

 our foreign policy call for a direct robust and meaningful engagement with the world   it be american leadership base on vital security interest that we share with our ally across the globe

 we strongly support nato an alliance forge through the bond of two world wars that dethrone fascism and a cold war that defeat communism

 but our partner must meet their financial obligation

 and now base on our very strong and frank discussion they be begin to do just that

 we expect our partner whether in nato in the middle east or the pacific to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operation and pay their fair share of the cost

 we will respect historic institution but we will also respect the sovereign right of nation

 free nation be the good vehicle for express the will of the people and america respect the right of all nation to chart their own path   my job be not to represent the world   my job be to represent the united states of america but we know that america be well off when there be less conflict not more

 we must learn from the mistake of the past we have see the war and destruction that have rage across our world

 the only long term solution for these humanitarian disaster be to create the condition where displace person can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding

 america be willing to find new friend and to forge new partnership where share interest align   we want harmony and stability not war and conflict

 we want peace wherever peace can be find   america be friend today with former enemy   some of our close ally decade ago fight on the opposite side of these world wars   this history should give we all faith in the possibility for a well world

 you ’re boy scouts but you know life you know life

 so look at you who would think this be the boy scouts right so he have a very very interesting life and the company that buy his company be a big conglomerate and they do not know anything about build home and they do not know anything about pick up the nail and the sawdust and sell it and the scrap of wood this be a big conglomerate base in new york city

 and after about a 10 year period there be lose a lot with it it do not mean anything to they and they could not sell it so they call william levitt up and they say would you like to buy back your company and he say yes i would he so badly want it he get bore with this life of yacht and sailing and all of the thing he do in the south of france and other place you will not get bore right you know truthfully you ’re worker you ’ll get bore too believe i of course have a few good year like that be n’t so bad

 but what happen be he buy back his company and he buy back a lot of empty land and he work hard at get zoning and he work hard on start to develop and in the end he fail and he fail badly lose all of his money he go personally bankrupt and he be now much old and i see he at a cocktail party and it be very sad because the hot people in new york be at this party it be the party of steve ross steve ross who be one of the great people he come up and discover really found time warner and he be a great guy he have a lot of successful people at the party

 and i think about it and it ’ exactly true he lose his momentum mean he take this period of time off long year and then when he get back he do not have that same momentum

 in life i always tell this to people you have to know whether or not you continue to have the momentum and if you do not have it that ’ ok because you ’re go to go on and you ’re go to learn and you ’re go to do thing that be great but you have to know about the word momentum

 but the big thing never quit never give up do something you love when you do something you love as a scout i see that you love it but when you do something that you love you ’ll never fail what you ’re go to do be give it a shot again and again and again you ’re ultimately go to be successful

president trump mr. secretary general mr. president world leader and distinguished delegate welcome to new york it be a profound honor to stand here in my home city as a representative of the american people to address the people of the world

 as million of our citizen continue to suffer the effect of the devastating hurricane that have strike our country i want to begin by express my appreciation to every leader in this room who have offer assistance and aid the american people be strong and resilient and they will emerge from these hardship more determined than ever before

 fortunately the united states have do very well since election day last november 8th the stock market be at an all time high a record unemployment be at its low level in 16 year and because of our regulatory and other reform we have more people work in the united states today than ever before company be move back create job growth the like of which our country have not see in a very long time and it have just be announce that we will be spend almost $ 700 billion on our military and defense

 our military will soon be the strong it have ever be for more than 70 year in time of war and peace the leader of nation movement and religion have stand before this assembly like they i intend to address some of the very serious threat before we today but also the enormous potential wait to be unleash

 we live in a time of extraordinary opportunity breakthrough in science technology and medicine be cure illness and solve problem that prior generation think impossible to solve

 but each day also bring news of grow danger that threaten everything we cherish and value terrorist and extremist have gather strength and spread to every region of the planet rogue regime represent in this body not only support terrorist but threaten other nation and their own people with the most destructive weapon know to humanity

 authority and authoritarian power seek to collapse the value the system and alliance that prevent conflict and tilt the world toward freedom since world war ii

 international criminal network traffic drug weapon people force dislocation and mass migration threaten our border and new form of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizen

 to put it simply we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril it be entirely up to we whether we lift the world to new height or let it fall into a valley of disrepair

 we have it in our power should we so choose to lift million from poverty to help our citizen realize their dream and to ensure that new generation of child be raise free from violence hatred and fear

 this institution be found in the aftermath of two world war to help shape this well future it be base on the vision that diverse nation could cooperate to protect their sovereignty preserve their security and promote their prosperity

 it be in the same period exactly 70 year ago that the united states develop the marshall plan to help restore europe those three beautiful pillar they’re pillar of peace sovereignty security and prosperity

 the marshall plan be build on the noble idea that the whole world be safe when nation be strong independent and free as president truman say in his message to congress at that time our support of european recovery be in full accord with our support of the united nations the success of the united nations depend upon the independent strength of its member

 to overcome the peril of the present and to achieve the promise of the future we must begin with the wisdom of the past our success depend on a coalition of strong and independent nation that embrace their sovereignty to promote security prosperity and peace for themselves and for the world

 we do not expect diverse country to share the same culture tradition or even system of government but we do expect all nation to uphold these two core sovereign duty to respect the interest of their own people and the right of every other sovereign nation this be the beautiful vision of this institution and this be foundation for cooperation and success

 strong sovereign nation let diverse country with different value different culture and different dream not just coexist but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect

 strong sovereign nation let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny and strong sovereign nation allow individual to flourish in the fullness of the life intend by god

 in america we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch this week give our country a special reason to take pride in that example we be celebrate the 230th anniversary of our beloved constitution the old constitution still in use in the world today

 this timeless document have be the foundation of peace prosperity and freedom for the americans and for countless million around the globe whose own country have find inspiration in its respect for human nature human dignity and the rule of law

 the great in the united states constitution be its first three beautiful word they be we the people

 generation of americans have sacrifice to maintain the promise of those word the promise of our country and of our great history in america the people govern the people rule and the people be sovereign i be elect not to take power but to give power to the american people where it belong

 in foreign affair we be renew this found principle of sovereignty our government ’s first duty be to its people to our citizen to serve their need to ensure their safety to preserve their right and to defend their value

 as president of the united states i will always put america first just like you as the leader of your country will always and should always put your country first applause

 all responsible leader have an obligation to serve their own citizen and the nation state remain the good vehicle for elevate the human condition

 but make a well life for our people also require we to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people

 the united states will forever be a great friend to the world and especially to its ally but we can no long be take advantage of or enter into a one sided deal where the united states get nothing in return as long as i hold this office i will defend america ’s interest above all else

 but in fulfil our obligation to our own nation we also realize that it ’ in everyone ’s interest to seek a future where all nation can be sovereign prosperous and secure

 america do more than speak for the value express in the united nations charter our citizen have pay the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nation represent in this great hall america ’s devotion be measure on the battlefield where our young man and woman have fight and sacrifice alongside of our ally from the beach of europe to the desert of the middle east to the jungle of asia

 it be an eternal credit to the american character that even after we and our ally emerge victorious from the bloody war in history we do not seek territorial expansion or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on other instead we help build institution such as this one to defend the sovereignty security and prosperity for all

 for the diverse nation of the world this be our hope we want harmony and friendship not conflict and strife we be guide by outcome not ideology we have a policy of principled realism root in share goal interest and value

 that realism force we to confront a question face every leader and nation in this room it be a question we can not escape or avoid we will slide down the path of complacency numb to the challenge threat and even war that we face or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those danger today so that our citizen can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow

 if we desire to lift up our citizen if we aspire to the approval of history then we must fulfill our sovereign duty to the people we faithfully represent we must protect our nation their interest and their future we must reject threat to sovereignty from the ukraine to the south china sea we must uphold respect for law respect for border and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow and just as the founder of this body intend we must work together and confront together those who threaten we with chaos turmoil and terror

 the scourge of our planet today be a small group of rogue regime that violate every principle on which the united nations be base they respect neither their own citizen nor the sovereign right of their country

 if the righteous many do not confront the wicked few then evil will triumph when decent people and nation become bystander to history the force of destruction only gather power and strength

 no one have show more contempt for other nation and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in north korea it be responsible for the starvation death of million of north koreans and for the imprisonment torture killing and oppression of countless more

 we be all witness to the regime ’s deadly abuse when an innocent american college student otto warmbier be return to america only to die a few day later we see it in the assassination of the dictator ’s brother use ban nerve agent in an international airport we know it kidnap a sweet 13 year old japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave she as a language tutor for north korea ’s spy

 if this be not twisted enough now north korea ’s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile threaten the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life

 it be an outrage that some nation would not only trade with such a regime but would arm supply and financially support a country that imperil the world with nuclear conflict no nation on earth have an interest in see this band of criminal arm itself with nuclear weapon and missile

 the united states have great strength and patience but if it be force to defend itself or its ally we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea rocket man be on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime the united states be ready willing and able but hopefully this will not be necessary that ’ what the united nations be all about that ’ what the united nations be for let ’s see how they do

 it be time for north korea to realize that the denuclearization be its only acceptable future the united nations security council recently hold two unanimous 15 0 vote adopt hard hit resolution against north korea and i want to thank china and russia for join the vote to impose sanction along with all of the other member of the security council thank you to all involve

 but we must do much more it be time for all nation to work together to isolate the kim regime until it cease its hostile behavior

 we face this decision not only in north korea it be far past time for the nation of the world to confront another reckless regime one that speak openly of mass murder vow death to america destruction to israel and ruin for many leader and nation in this room

 the iranian government mask a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy it have turn a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically deplete rogue state whose chief export be violence bloodshed and chaos the long suffer victim of iran ’s leader be in fact its own people

 rather than use its resource to improve iranian life its oil profit go to fund hezbollah and other terrorist that kill innocent muslims and attack their peaceful arab and israeli neighbor this wealth which rightly belong to iran ’s people also go to shore up bashar al assad ’s dictatorship fuel yemen ’s civil war and undermine peace throughout the entire middle east

 we can not let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activity while build dangerous missile and we can not abide by an agreement if it provide cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program applause the iran deal be one of the bad and most one sided transaction the united states have ever enter into frankly that deal be an embarrassment to the united states and i do not think you ’ve hear the last of it believe i

 it be time for the entire world to join we in demand that iran ’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction it be time for the regime to free all americans and citizen of other nation that they have unjustly detain and above all iran ’s government must stop support terrorist begin serve its own people and respect the sovereign right of its neighbor

 the entire world understand that the good people of iran want change and other than the vast military power of the united states that iran ’s people be what their leader fear the most this be what cause the regime to restrict internet access tear down satellite dish shoot unarmed student protestor and imprison political reformer

 oppressive regime can not endure forever and the day will come when the iranian people will face a choice will they continue down the path of poverty bloodshed and terror or will the iranian people return to the nation ’s proud root as a center of civilization culture and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again

 the iranian regime ’s support for terror be in stark contrast to the recent commitment of many of its neighbor to fight terrorism and halt its financing

 in saudi arabia early last year i be greatly honor to address the leader of more than 50 arab and muslim nation we agree that all responsible nation must work together to confront terrorist and the islamist extremism that inspire they

 we will stop radical islamic terrorism because we can not allow it to tear up our nation and indeed to tear up the entire world

 we must deny the terrorist safe haven transit funding and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology we must drive they out of our nation it be time to expose and hold responsible those country who support and finance terror group like al qaeda hezbollah the taliban and other that slaughter innocent people

 the united states and our ally be work together throughout the middle east to crush the loser terrorist and stop the reemergence of safe haven they use to launch attack on all of our people

 last month i announce a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in afghanistan from now on our security interest will dictate the length and scope of military operation not arbitrary benchmark and timetable set up by politician

 i have also totally change the rule of engagement in our fight against the taliban and other terrorist group in syria and iraq we have make big gain toward last defeat of isis in fact our country have achieve more against isis in the last eight month than it have in many many year combine

 we seek the de escalation of the syrian conflict and a political solution that honor the will of the syrian people the action of the criminal regime of bashar al assad include the use of chemical weapon against his own citizen even innocent child shock the conscience of every decent person no society can be safe if ban chemical weapon be allow to spread that be why the united states carry out a missile strike on the airbase that launch the attack

 we appreciate the effort of united nations agency that be provide vital humanitarian assistance in area liberate from isis and we especially thank jordan turkey and lebanon for their role in host refugee from the syrian conflict

 the united states be a compassionate nation and have spend billion and billion of dollar in help to support this effort we seek an approach to refugee resettlement that be design to help these horribly treat people and which enable their eventual return to their home country to be part of the rebuilding process

 for the cost of resettle one refugee in the united states we can assist more than 10 in their home region out of the goodness of our heart we offer financial assistance to host country in the region and we support recent agreement of the g20 nation that will seek to host refugee as close to their home country as possible this be the safe responsible and humanitarian approach

 for decade the united states have deal with migration challenge here in the western hemisphere we have learn that over the long term uncontrolle migration be deeply unfair to both the sending and the receive country

 for the send country it reduce domestic pressure to pursue need political and economic reform and drain they of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reform

 for the receiving country the substantial cost of uncontrolle migration be bear overwhelmingly by low income citizen whose concern be often ignore by both medium and government

 i want to salute the work of the united nations in seek to address the problem that cause people to flee from their home the united nations and african union lead peacekeeping mission to have invaluable contribution in stabilize conflict in africa the united states continue to lead the world in humanitarian assistance include famine prevention and relief in south sudan somalia and northern nigeria and yemen

 we have invest in well health and opportunity all over the world through program like pepfar which fund aids relief the president ’s malaria initiative the global health security agenda the global fund to end modern slavery and the women entrepreneurs finance initiative part of our commitment to empower woman all across the globe

 we also thank—(applause)—we also thank the secretary general for recognize that the united nations must reform if it be to be an effective partner in confront threat to sovereignty security and prosperity too often the focus of this organization have not be on result but on bureaucracy and process

 in some case state that seek to subvert this institution ’s noble aim have hijack the very system that be suppose to advance they for example it be a massive source of embarrassment to the united nations that some government with egregious human right record sit on the u.n. human rights council

 the united states be one out of 193 country in the united nations and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more in fact we pay far more than anybody realize the united states bear an unfair cost burden but to be fair if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goal especially the goal of peace this investment would easily be well worth it

 major portion of the world be in conflict and some in fact be go to hell but the powerful people in this room under the guidance and auspex of the united nations can solve many of these vicious and complex problem

 the american people hope that one day soon the united nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world in the meantime we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden militarily or financially nation of the world must take a great role in promote secure and prosperous society in their own region

 that be why in the western hemisphere the united states have stand against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in cuba and embrace the endure dream of the cuban people to live in freedom my administration recently announce that we will not lift sanction on the cuban government until it make fundamental reform

 we have also impose tough calibrate sanction on the socialist maduro regime in venezuela which have bring a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse

 the socialist dictatorship of nicolas maduro have inflict terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country this corrupt regime destroy a prosperous nation by impose a fail ideology that have produce poverty and misery everywhere it have be try to make matter bad maduro have defy his own people steal power from their elect representative to preserve his disastrous rule

 the venezuelan people be starve and their country be collapse their democratic institution be be destroy this situation be completely unacceptable and we can not stand by and watch

 as a responsible neighbor and friend we and all other have a goal that goal be to help they regain their freedom recover their country and restore their democracy i would like to thank leader in this room for condemn the regime and provide vital support to the venezuelan people

 the united states have take important step to hold the regime accountable we be prepared to take further action if the government of venezuela persist on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the venezuelan people

 we be fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationship with many of the latin american country gather here today our economic bond form a critical foundation for advance peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbor

 i ask every country represent here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis we call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedom in venezuela applause

 the problem in venezuela be not that socialism have be poorly implement but that socialism have be faithfully implement applause from the soviet union to cuba to venezuela wherever true socialism or communism have be adopt it have deliver anguish and devastation and failure those who preach the tenet of these discredit ideology only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel system

 america stand with every person live under a brutal regime our respect for sovereignty be also a call for action all people deserve a government that care for their safety their interest and their wellbeing include their prosperity

 in america we seek strong tie of business and trade with all nation of good will but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal

 for too long the american people be tell that mammoth multinational trade deal unaccountable international tribunal and powerful global bureaucracy be the good way to promote their success but as those promise flow million of job vanish and thousand of factory disappear other game the system and break the rule and our great middle class once the bedrock of american prosperity be forget and leave behind but they be forget no more and they will never be forget again

 while america will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nation we be renew our commitment to the first duty of every government the duty of our citizen this bond be the source of america ’s strength and that of every responsible nation represent here today

 if this organization be to have any hope of successfully confront the challenge before we it will depend as president truman say some 70 year ago on the independent strength of its member if we be to embrace the opportunity of the future and overcome the present danger together there can be no substitute for strong sovereign and independent nation nation that be root in their history and invest in their destiny nation that seek ally to befriend not enemy to conquer and most important of all nation that be home to patriot to man and woman who be willing to sacrifice for their country their fellow citizen and for all that be good in the human spirit

 in remember the great victory that lead to this body ’s founding we must never forget that those hero who fight against evil also fight for the nation that they love

 patriotism lead the poles to die to save poland the french to fight for a free france and the brits to stand strong for britain

 today if we do not invest ourselves our heart and our mind in our nation if we will not build strong family safe community and healthy society for ourselves no one can do it for we

 we can not wait for someone else for faraway country or far off bureaucrat we can not do it we must solve our problem to build our prosperity to secure our future or we will be vulnerable to decay domination and defeat

 the true question for the united nations today for people all over the world who hope for well life for themselves and their child be a basic one be we still patriot do we love our nation enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their future do we revere they enough to defend their interest preserve their culture and ensure a peaceful world for their citizen

 one of the great american patriot john adams write that the american revolution be effect before the war commence the revolution be in the mind and heart of the people

 that be the moment when america awake when we look around and understand that we be a nation we realize who we be what we value and what we would give our life to defend from its very first moment the american story be the story of what be possible when people take ownership of their future

 the united states of america have be among the great force for good in the history of the world and the great defender of sovereignty security and prosperity for all

 now we be call for a great reawakening of nation for the revival of their spirit their pride their people and their patriotism

 history be ask we whether we be up to the task our answer will be a renewal of will a rediscovery of resolve and a rebirth of devotion we need to defeat the enemy of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself

 our hope be a word and world of proud independent nation that embrace their duty seek friendship respect other and make common cause in the great share interest of all a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful earth

 this be the true vision of the united nations the ancient wish of every people and the deep yearning that live inside every sacred soul

 when the american people speak all of we should listen and just over one year ago you speak loud and you speak clear on november 8 2016 you vote to make america great again applause you embrace new leadership and very new strategy and also a glorious new hope that be why we be here today

 but to seize the opportunity of the future we must first understand the failure of the past for many year our citizen watch as washington politician preside over one disappointment after another to many of our leader so many who forget whose voice they be to respect and whose interest they be suppose to defend our leader in washington negotiate disastrous trade deal that bring massive profit to many foreign nation but send thousand of american factory and million of american job to those other country

 our leader engage in nation building abroad while they fail to build up and replenish our nation at home they undercut and shortchange our man and woman in uniform with inadequate resource unstable funding and unclear mission they fail to insist that our often very wealthy ally pay their fair share for defense put a massive and unfair burden on the u.s. taxpayer and our great u.s. military

 they neglect a nuclear menace in north korea make a disastrous weak and incomprehensibly bad deal with iran and allow terrorist such as isis to gain control of vast part of territory all across the middle east

 they put american energy under lock and key they impose punishing regulation and crippling taxis they surrender our sovereignty to foreign bureaucrat in faraway and distant capital

 and over the profound objection of the american people our politician leave our border wide open million of immigrant enter illegally million more be admit into our country without the proper vetting need to protect our security and our economy leader in washington impose on the country an immigration policy that americans never vote for never ask for and never approve a policy where the wrong people be allow into our country and the right people be reject american citizen as usual have be leave to bear the cost and to pick up the tab

 on top of everything else our leader drift from american principle they lose sight of america ’s destiny and they lose their belief in american greatness as a result our citizen lose something as well the people lose confidence in their government and eventually even lose confidence in their future

 but last year all of that begin to change the american people reject the failure of the past you rediscover your voice and reclaim ownership of this nation and its destiny

 on january 20th 2017 i stand on the step of the capitol to herald the day the people become the ruler of their nation again applause thank you now less than one year later i be proud to report that the entire world have hear the news and have already see the sign america be come back and america be come back strong

 we be rebuild our nation our confidence and our standing in the world we have move swiftly to confront our challenge and we have confront they head on

 we be once again invest in our defense almost $ 700 billion a record this coming year we be demand extraordinary strength which will hopefully lead to long and extraordinary peace we be give our courageous military man and woman the support they need and so dearly deserve

 we have withdraw the united states from job kill deal such as the trans pacific partnership and the very expensive and unfair paris climate accord and on our trip to asia last month i announce that we will no long tolerate trading abuse

 we have establish strict new vetting procedure to keep terrorist out of the united states and our vetting be get tough each month

 to counter iran and block its path to a nuclear weapon i sanction the islamic revolutionary guard corps for its support of terrorism and i decline to certify the iran deal to congress

 follow my trip to the middle east the gulf state and other muslim majority nation join together to fight radical islamist ideology and terrorist financing we have deal isis one devastating defeat after another the coalition to defeat isis have now recapture almost 100 percent of the land once hold by these terrorist in iraq and syria great job applause great job really good thank you thank you we have a great military we ’re now chase they wherever they flee and we will not let they into the united states

 in afghanistan our troop be no long undermine by artificial timeline and we no long tell our enemy of our plan we be begin to see result on the battlefield and we have make clear to pakistan that while we desire continued partnership we must see decisive action against terrorist group operate on their territory and we make massive payment every year to pakistan they have to help

 our effort to strengthen the nato alliance set the stage for significant increase in member contribution with ten of billion of dollar more pour in because i would not allow member state to be delinquent in the payment while we guarantee their safety and be willing to fight war for they we have make clear that country that be immensely wealthy should reimburse the united states for the cost of defend they this be a major departure from the past but a fair and necessary one necessary for our country necessary for our taxpayer necessary for our own thought process

 our campaign of maximum pressure on the north korean regime have result in the tough ever sanction we have unite our ally in an unprecedented effort to isolate north korea however there be much more work to do america and its ally will take all necessary step to achieve a denuclearization and ensure that this regime can not threaten the world applause thank you this situation should have be take care of long before i get into office when it be much easy to handle but it will be take care of we have no choice

 at home we be keep our promise and liberate the american economy we have create more than 2 million job since the election unemployment be at a 17 year low the stock market be at an all time high and just a little while ago hit yet another all time high the 85th time since my election applause

 and we be see the response we fully expect economic growth have top 3 percent for two quarter in a row gdp growth which be way ahead of schedule under my administration will be one of america ’s truly great weapon

 optimism have surge confidence have return with this new confidence we be also bring back clarity to our thinking we be reassert these fundamental truth

 a nation without border be not a nation applause

 a nation that do not protect prosperity at home can not protect its interest abroad

 a nation that be not prepared to win a war be a nation not capable of prevent a war

 a nation that be not proud of its history can not be confident in its future

 and a nation that be not certain of its value can not summon the will to defend they

 today ground in these truth we be present to the world our new national security strategy base on my direction this document have be in development for over a year it have the endorsement of my entire cabinet

 our new strategy be base on a principle realism guide by our vital national interest and root in our timeless value

 this strategy recognize that whether we like it or not we be engage in a new era of competition we accept that vigorous military economic and political contest be now play out all around the world

 we face rogue regime that threaten the united states and our ally we face terrorist organization transnational criminal network and other who spread violence and evil around the globe

 we also face rival power russia and china that seek to challenge american influence value and wealth we will attempt to build a great partnership with those and other country but in a manner that always protect our national interest

 as an example yesterday i receive a call from president putin of russia thank our country for the intelligence that our cia be able to provide they concern a major terrorist attack plan in st. petersburg where many people perhaps in the thousand could have be kill they be able to apprehend these terrorist before the event with no loss of life and that ’ a great thing and the way it ’s suppose to work that be the way it ’s suppose to work

 but while we seek such opportunity of cooperation we will stand up for ourselves and we will stand up for our country like we have never stand up before applause thank you thank you thank you

 we know that american success be not a forgone conclusion it must be earn and it must be win our rival be tough they ’re tenacious and commit to the long term but so be we

 to succeed we must integrate every dimension of our national strength and we must compete with every instrument of our national power

 under the trump administration america be gain wealth lead to enhance power fast than anyone think with $ 6 trillion more in the stock market alone since the election—$6 trillion

 in addition our strategy call for we to confront discredit and defeat radical islamic terrorism and ideology and to prevent it from spread into the united states and we will develop new way to counter those who use new domain such as cyber and social medium to attack our nation or threaten our society

 the second pillar of our strategy be to promote american prosperity for the first time american strategy recognize that economic security be national security economic vitality growth and prosperity at home be absolutely necessary for american power and influence abroad any nation that trade away its prosperity for security will end up lose both

 the strategy propose a complete rebuilding of american infrastructure our road bridge airport waterway and communication infrastructure and it embrace a future of american energy dominance and self sufficiency

 the third pillar of our strategy be to preserve peace through strength applause we recognize that weakness be the sure path to conflict and unrivaled power be the most certain mean of defense for this reason our strategy break from the damaging defense sequester we ’re go to get rid of that applause

 it call for a total modernization of our military and reverse previous decision to shrink our armed force even as threat to national security grow it call for streamline acquisition eliminate bloated bureaucracy and massively build up our military which have the fundamental side benefit of create million and million of job

 and our strategy emphasize strengthen alliance to cope with these threat it recognize that our strength be magnify by ally who share principle and our principle and shoulder their fair share of responsibility for our common security

 fourth and finally our strategy be to advance american influence in the world but this begin with build up our wealth and power at home

 america will lead again we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but we will champion the value without apology we want strong alliance and partnership base on cooperation and reciprocity we will make new partnership with those who share our goal and make common interest into a common cause we will not allow inflexible ideology to become an obsolete and obstacle to peace

 we will pursue the vision we have carry around the world over this past year a vision of strong sovereign and independent nation that respect their citizen and respect their neighbor nation that thrive in commerce and cooperation root in their history and branch out toward their destiny

 that be the future we wish for this world and that be the future we seek in america applause

 with this strategy we be call for a great reawakening of america a resurgence of confidence and a rebirth of patriotism prosperity and pride

 and we be return to the wisdom of our founder in america the people govern the people rule and the people be sovereign what we have build here in america be precious and unique in all of history never before have freedom reign the rule of law prevail and the people thrive as we have here for nearly 250 year

 every american have a role to play in this grand national effort and today i invite every citizen to take their part in our vital mission together our task be to strengthen our family to build up our community to serve our citizen and to celebrate american greatness as a shine example to the world

 as long as we be proud and very proud of who we be how we get here and what we be fight for to preserve we will not fail

 if we do all of this if we rediscover our resolve and commit ourselves to compete and win again then together we will leave our child and our grandchild a nation that be strong well free prouder and yes an america that be great than ever before

 god bless you thank you very much thank you applause

president trump thank you klaus very much it ’ a privilege to be here at this forum where leader in business science art diplomacy and world affair have gather for many many year to discuss how we can advance prosperity security and peace

 i ’m here today to represent the interest of the american people and to affirm america ’s friendship and partnership in build a well world

 like all nation represent at this great forum america hope for a future in which everyone can prosper and every child can grow up free from violence poverty and fear

 over the past year we have make extraordinary stride in the u.s. we ’re lift up forget community create exciting new opportunity and help every american find their path to the american dream the dream of a great job a safe home and a well life for their child

 after year of stagnation the united states be once again experience strong economic growth the stock market be smash one record after another and have add more than $ 7 trillion in new wealth since my election consumer confidence business confidence and manufacture confidence be the high they have be in many decade

 since my election we ’ve create 2.4 million job and that number be go up very very substantially small business optimism be at an all time high new unemployment claim be near the low we ’ve see in almost half a century african american unemployment have reach the low rate ever record in the united states and so have unemployment among hispanic americans

 the world be witness the resurgence of a strong and prosperous america i ’m here to deliver a simple message there have never be a well time to hire to build to invest and to grow in the united states america be open for business and we be competitive once again

 the american economy be by far the large in the world and we ’ve just enact the most significant tax cut and reform in american history we ’ve massively cut taxis for the middle class and small business to let working family keep more of their hard earn money we lower our corporate tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent as a result million of worker have receive tax cut bonus from their employer in amount as large as $ 3,000

 the tax cut bill be expect to raise the average american ’s household income by more than $ 4,000 the world ’s large company apple announce plan to bring $ 245 billion in overseas profit home to america their total investment into the united states economy will be more than $ 350 billion over the next five year

 now be the perfect time to bring your business your job and your investment to the united states this be especially true because we have undertake the most extensive regulatory reduction ever conceive regulation be stealth taxation the u.s. like many other country unelected bureaucrat and we have believe i we have they all over the place and they ’ve impose crush and anti business and anti worker regulation on our citizen with no vote no legislative debate and no real accountability

 in america those day be over i pledge to eliminate two unnecessary regulation for every one new regulation we have succeed beyond our high expectation instead of 2 for 1 we have cut 22 burdensome regulation for every 1 new rule we be free our business and worker so they can thrive and flourish as never before we be create an environment that attract capital invite investment and reward production

 america be the place to do business so come to america where you can innovate create and build i believe in america as president of the united states i will always put america first just like the leader of other country should put their country first also

 but america first do not mean america alone when the united states grow so do the world american prosperity have create countless job all around the globe and the drive for excellence creativity and innovation in the u.s. have lead to important discovery that help people everywhere live more prosperous and far healthy life

 as the united states pursue domestic reform to unleash job and growth we be also work to reform the international trading system so that it promote broadly share prosperity and reward to those who play by the rule

 we can not have free and open trade if some country exploit the system at the expense of other we support free trade but it need to be fair and it need to be reciprocal because in the end unfair trade undermine we all

 the united states will no long turn a blind eye to unfair economic practice include massive intellectual property theft industrial subsidy and pervasive state lead economic planning these and other predatory behavior be distort the global market and harm business and worker not just in the u.s. but around the globe

 just like we expect the leader of other country to protect their interest as president of the united states i will always protect the interest of our country our company and our worker

 we will enforce our trade law and restore integrity to our trading system only by insist on fair and reciprocal trade can we create a system that work not just for the u.s. but for all nation

 as i have say the united states be prepared to negotiate mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement with all country this will include the country in tpp which be very important we have agreement with several of they already we would consider negotiate with the rest either individually or perhaps as a group if it be in the interest of all

 my administration be also take swift action in other way to restore american confidence and independence we be lift self impose restriction on energy production to provide affordable power to our citizen and business and to promote energy security for our friend all around the world no country should be hold hostage to a single provider of energy

 america be roar back and now be the time to invest in the future of america we have dramatically cut taxis to make america competitive we be eliminate burdensome regulation at a record pace we be reform the bureaucracy to make it lean responsive and accountable and we be ensure our law be enforce fairly

 we have the good college and university in the world and we have the good worker in the world energy be abundant and affordable there have never be a well time to come to america

 we be also make historic investment in the american military because we can not have prosperity without security to make the world safe from rogue regime terrorism and revisionist power we be ask our friend and ally to invest in their own defense and to meet their financial obligation our common security require everyone to contribute their fair share

 my administration be proud to have lead historic effort at the united nations security council and all around the world to unite all civilized nation in our campaign of maximum pressure to de nuke the korean peninsula we continue to call on partner to confront iran ’s support for terrorist and block iran ’s path to a nuclear weapon

 we ’re also work with ally and partner to destroy jihadist terrorist organization such as isis and very successfully so the united states be lead a very broad coalition to deny terrorist control of their territory and population to cut off their funding and to discredit their wicked ideology

 i be pleased to report that the coalition to defeat isis have retake almost 100 percent of the territory once hold by these killer in iraq and syria there be still more fighting and work to be do and to consolidate our gain we be committed to ensure that afghanistan never again become a safe haven for terrorist who want to commit mass murder to our civilian population i want to thank those nation represent here today that have join in these crucial effort you be not just secure your own citizen but save life and restore hope for million and million of people

 when it come to terrorism we will do whatever be necessary to protect our nation we will defend our citizen and our border we be also secure our immigration system as a matter of both national and economic security

 america be a cutting edge economy but our immigration system be stick in the past we must replace our current system of extend family chain migration with a merit base system of admission that select new arrival base on their ability to contribute to our economy to support themselves financially and to strengthen our country

 in rebuild america we be also fully commit to develop our workforce we be lift people from dependence to independence because we know the single good anti poverty program be a very simple and very beautiful paycheck

 to be successful it be not enough to invest in our economy we must invest in our people when people be forget the world become fractured   only by hear and respond to the voice of the forget can we create a bright future that be truly share by all

 the nation ’s greatness be more than the sum of its production a nation ’s greatness be the sum of its citizen the value pride love devotion and character of the people who call that nation home

 from my first international g7 summit to the g20 to the u.n. general assembly to apec to the world trade organization and today at the world economic forum my administration have not only be present but have drive our message that we be all strong when free sovereign nation cooperate toward share goal and they cooperate toward share dream

 thank you and god bless you all thank you very much applause thank you very much

 mr schwab thank you mr. president for this inspiring speech as it be tradition at the forum i will ask you one or two question

 and my first question be why be the tax reform why have it be of such a high priority for your administration

 president trump well first of all klaus i want to congratulate you this be an incredible group of people we have dinner last night with about 15 leader of industry none of whom i know but all of whom i ’ve read about for year and it be truly an incredible group but i think i have 15 new friend so this have be really great what you ’ve do and put it together the economic forum

 the tax reform be a dream of a lot of people over many year but they be n’t able to get it do many people try and ronald reagan be really the last to make a meaningful cut and reform and ours be cut and reform we emphasize cut but the reform be probably almost as important we ’ve want to do it it be very tough politically to do it hard to believe that would be but it be very very tough that ’s why it have not be do in close to 40 year

 and once we get it go it be go and the big and i would not say a total surprise but one of the big thing that happen and take place be at&amp;t and some other come out very early and they say they be go to pay thousand and thousand of dollar to people that work for their company and you have 300,000 400,000 500,000 people work for these company and all of a sudden it become like a big waterfall a big beautiful waterfall where so many company be do it and even today they just announce many more but every day they announce more and more and now it ’ a fight for who ’s go to give the most it start at 1,000 and now we have they up to 3,000

 this be something that we do not anticipate oftentime in business thing happen that you do not anticipate usually that ’ a bad thing but this be a good thing this come out of nowhere nobody ever think of this as a possibility even it be n’t in the equation we wait we say wait until february 1st when the check start come in and people klaus have a lot more money in their paycheck because it ’s not just a little money this be a lot of money for people make a living do whatever they may be do

 and we really though february 1st it be go to kick in and everybody be go to be well we have n’t even get there yet and it ’s kick in and it ’s have an incredible impact on the stock market and the stock price we ’ve set 84 record since my election record stock market price mean we hit new high 84 different time out of a one year period and that ’ a great thing and in all fairness that be do before we pass the tax cut and tax reform

 so what happen be really something special then as you know and as i just say apple come in with $ 350 billion and i tell you i speak with tim cook i say tim i will never consider this whole great run that we ’ve make complete until you start build plant in the u.s. and i will tell you this move up very substantially but when i hear 350 i think he be talk i think they be talk $ 350 million and by the way that ’ a nice sized plant not the great but not bad and they say no sir it ’ $ 350 billion i say that be something

 well we have tremendous amount of money include my newfound friend from last night great company they ’re all invest when one of the gentleman say he ’s put in $ 2 billion because of the tax cut i say to myself wow he ’ actually the cheap one in the group because they ’re put in massive number of billion of dollar

 so i think you have a brand new united states you have a united states where people from all over the world be look to come in and invest and there ’ just nothing like what ’s happen

 and i just want to finish by i have a group of people that have be so i have a whole lot of they so i will not introduce because then i ’ll insult at least half of they but i ’ve have a group of people that work so hard on this and other thing

 and we ’re really do we have a great first year so successful in so many different way and there ’ a tremendous spirit when you look at all of the different chart and poll and you see as an example african american unemployment at the historic low it ’s never have a period of time like this same with hispanic woman at a 17 year low it ’ very heartwarming to see but there ’ a tremendous spirit in the united states i would say it ’ a spirit like i have never witness before i ’ve be here for awhile i have never witness the spirit that our country have right now

 so i just want to thank you all and all those that be pour billion of dollar into our country or ten dollar into our country we thank you very much thank you

 mr schwab mr. president i will ask you maybe a personal question but before do so i ’d just like to

 president trump sound very interesting

 mr schwab acknowledge that

 president trump i do not know about this one

 mr schwab i would like to acknowledge the strong presence of your cabinet member

 president trump yes

 mr schwab who tremendously contribute to the discussion the last inaudible

 president trump good i would like to do that that ’ very nice

 mr schwab yeah now

 president trump steven wilbur gary robert even my general and my various other general you know we ’re make our military protection a little bit well for we too so thank you very much do everybody understand that i think so thank you all for be here

 mr schwab now my maybe personal question would be what experience from your past have be most useful in prepare you for the presidency

 president trump well be a businessman have be a great experience for i i ’ve love it i ’ve always love business i ’ve always be good at build thing and i ’ve always be successful at make money i ’d buy thing that would fail that would be failure and i ’d turn they around and try and get they for the right price and then i ’d turn they around and make they successful and i ’ve be good at it and that take a certain ability

 and you know historically i guess there ’s never really be a businessman or businessperson elect president it ’s always be a general or a politician throughout history it ’s always be a general you have to be a general but mostly it be politician you never have a businessman

 and then in all fairness i be say to klaus last night have the oppose party to i win some of whom you back some of the people in the room instead of be up almost 50 percent the stock market be up since my election almost 50 percent rather than that i believe the stock market from that level the initial level would have be down close to 50 percent that ’s where we be head i really believe that because they be go to put on massive new regulation you could not breathe it be choke our country to death and i be able to see that klaus as a businessperson

 the other thing be i ’ve always seem to get for whatever reason a disproportionate amount of press or medium laughter throughout my whole life somebody will explain someday why but i ’ve always get a lot laughter and as businessman i be always treat really well by the press the number speak and thing happen but i ’ve always really have a very good press and it be n’t until i become a politician that i realize how nasty how mean how vicious and how fake the press can be as the camera start go off in the background laughter

 but overall i mean the bottom line somebody say well they could not have be that bad because here we be we’re president and i think we ’re do a really great job with my team i have a team of just tremendous people and i think we ’re do a very special job and i really believe it be time and it be time to do that job because i do not think the united states would have do very well if it go through four or eight more year of regulation and really a very anti business group of people

 we have a very pro business group we have regulation cut to a level in the history of our country klaus this be report recently in one year we ’ve cut more regulation in my administration than any other administration in four eight or sixteen year in the one case we ’ve cut more regulation in one year and we have a way to go i mean we ’re probably 50 percent do

 and we ’re go to have regulation there ’ nothing wrong with rule and regulation you need they but we ’ve cut more than any administration ever in the history of our country and we still have a way to go so i think between that and the tremendous tax cut we ’ve really do something

 and one other thing i say and i see it last night with some of the leader and the businesspeople i think i ’ve be a cheerleader for our country and everybody represent a company or a country have to be a cheerleader or no matter what you do it ’s just not go to work and the reason i ’m a cheerleader be because it ’ easy because i love our country and i think we ’re just do really well

 and we look forward to see you in america special place and where you be be a special place also

 in america we know that faith and family not government and bureaucracy be the center of the american life our motto be in god we trust

 and we celebrate our police our military and our amazing veteran as hero who deserve our total and unwavering support

 young patriot like preston teach all of we about our civic duty as americans preston ’s reverence for those who have serve our nation remind we why we salute our flag why we put our hand on our heart for the pledge of allegiance and why we proudly stand for the national anthem

 americans love their country and they deserve a government that show they the same love and loyalty in return

 for the last year we have seek to restore the bond of trust between our citizen and their government

 work with the senate we be appoint judge who will interpret the constitution as write include a great new supreme court justice and more circuit court judge than any new administration in the history of our country

 i will not stop until our veteran be properly take care of which have be my promise to they from the very beginning of this great journey

 all americans deserve accountability and respect and that be what we be give they so tonight i call on the congress to empower every cabinet secretary with the authority to reward good worker and to remove federal employee who undermine the public trust or fail the american people

 in our drive to make washington accountable we have eliminate more regulation in our first year than any administration in history

 we have end the war on american energy and we have end the war on clean coal we be now an exporter of energy to the world

 we also believe that patient with terminal condition should have access to experimental treatment that could potentially save their life

 people who be terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure i want to give they a chance right here at home it be time for the congress to give these wonderful americans the right to try

 one of my great priority be to reduce the price of prescription drug in many other country these drug cost far less than what we pay in the united states that be why i have direct my administration to make fix the injustice of high drug price one of our top priority price will come down

 america have also finally turn the page on decade of unfair trade deal that sacrifice our prosperity and ship away our company our job and our nation ’s wealth

 and we will protect american worker and american intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rule

 as we rebuild our industry it be also time to rebuild our crumble infrastructure

 america be a nation of builder we build the empire state building in just 1 year be it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 year just to get a permit approve for a simple road

 i be ask both party to come together to give we the safe fast reliable and modern infrastructure our economy need and our people deserve

 tonight i be call on the congress to produce a bill that generate at least $ 1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need

 every federal dollar should be leverage by partner with state and local government and where appropriate tap into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit

 any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process get it down to no more than two year and perhaps even one

 together we can reclaim our building heritage we will build gleam new road bridge highway railway and waterway across our land and we will do it with american heart american hand and american grit

 we want every american to know the dignity of a hard day ’s work we want every child to be safe in their home at night and we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love

 we can lift our citizen from welfare to work from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity

 as tax cut create new job let we invest in workforce development and job training let we open great vocational school so our future worker can learn a craft and realize their full potential and let we support work family by support pay family leave

 cj great work now let we get the congress to send you some reinforcement

 over the next few week the house and senate will be vote on an immigration reform package

 in recent month my administration have meet extensively with both democrats and republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform base on these discussion we present the congress with a detailed proposal that should be support by both party as a fair compromise one where nobody get everything they want but where our country get the critical reform it need

 here be the four pillar of our plan

 the first pillar of our framework generously offer a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrant who be bring here by their parent at a young age that cover almost three time more people than the previous administration under our plan those who meet education and work requirement and show good moral character will be able to become full citizen of the united states

 the second pillar fully secure the border that mean build a wall on the southern border and it mean hire more hero like cj to keep our community safe crucially our plan close the terrible loophole exploit by criminal and terrorist to enter our country and it finally end the dangerous practice of catch and release

 the third pillar end the visa lottery a program that randomly hand out green card without any regard for skill merit or the safety of our people it be time to begin move towards a merit base immigration system one that admit people who be skilled who want to work who will contribute to our society and who will love and respect our country

 the fourth and final pillar protect the nuclear family by end chain migration under the current break system a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited number of distant relative under our plan we focus on the immediate family by limit sponsorship to spouse and minor child this vital reform be necessary not just for our economy but for our security and our future

 in recent week two terrorist attack in new york be make possible by the visa lottery and chain migration in the age of terrorism these program present risk we can no long afford

 it be time to reform these outdated immigration rule and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century

 these four pillar represent a down the middle compromise and one that will create a safe modern and lawful immigration system

 for over 30 year washington have try and fail to solve this problem this congress can be the one that finally make it happen

 most importantly these four pillar will produce legislation that fulfill my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that put america first so let we come together set politic aside and finally get the job do

 these reform will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction

 in 2016 we lose 64,000 americans to drug overdose 174 death per day seven per hour we must get much tough on drug dealer and pusher if we be go to succeed in stop this scourge

 my administration be commit to fight the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need the struggle will be long and difficult but as americans always do we will prevail

 as we have see tonight the most difficult challenge bring out the good in america

 we see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the holets family of new mexico ryan holets be 27 year old and an officer with the albuquerque police department he be here tonight with his wife rebecca last year ryan be on duty when he see a pregnant homeless woman prepare to inject heroin when ryan tell she she be go to harm her unborn child she begin to weep she tell he she do not know where to turn but badly want a safe home for her baby

 in that moment ryan say he feel god speak to he you will do it because you can he take out a picture of his wife and their four kid then he go home to tell his wife rebecca in an instant she agree to adopt the holets name their new daughter hope

 ryan and rebecca you embody the goodness of our nation thank you and congratulation

 as we rebuild america ’s strength and confidence at home we be also restore our strength and stand abroad

 around the world we face rogue regime terrorist group and rival like china and russia that challenge our interest our economy and our value in confront these danger we know that weakness be the sure path to conflict and unmatched power be the sure mean of our defense

 for this reason i be ask the congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military

 as part of our defense we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal hopefully never have to use it but make it so strong and powerful that it will deter any act of aggression perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the country of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapon unfortunately we be not there yet

 last year i also pledge that we would work with our ally to extinguish isis from the face of the earth one year later i be proud to report that the coalition to defeat isis have liberate almost 100 percent of the territory once hold by these killer in iraq and syria but there be much more work to be do we will continue our fight until isis be defeat

 army staff sergeant justin peck be here tonight near raqqa last november justin and his comrade chief petty officer kenton stacy be on a mission to clear building that isis have rig with explosive so that civilian could return to the city

 clear the second floor of a vital hospital kenton stacy be severely wound by an explosion immediately justin bound into the booby trap building and find kenton in bad shape he apply pressure to the wound and insert a tube to reopen an airway he then perform cpr for 20 straight minute during the ground transport and maintain artificial respiration through 2 hour of emergency surgery

 kenton stacy would have die if not for justin ’s selfless love for a fellow warrior tonight kenton be recover in texas raqqa be liberate and justin be wear his new bronze star with a v for valor staff sergeant peck   all of america salute you

 terrorist who do thing like place bomb in civilian hospital be evil when possible we annihilate they when necessary we must be able to detain and question they but we must be clear terrorist be not merely criminal they be unlawful enemy combatant and when capture overseas they should be treat like the terrorist they be

 in the past we have foolishly release hundred of dangerous terrorist only to meet they again on the battlefield include the isis leader al baghdadi

 so today i be keep another promise i just sign an order direct secretary mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facility at guantánamo bay

 i be also ask the congress to ensure that in the fight against isis and al qa’ida we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorist wherever we chase they down

 our warrior in afghanistan also have new rule of engagement along with their heroic afghan partner our military be no long undermine by artificial timeline and we no long tell our enemy our plan

 last month i also take an action endorse unanimously by the senate just month before i recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel

 shortly afterwards dozen of country vote in the united nations general assembly against america ’s sovereign right to make this recognition american taxpayer generously send those same country billion of dollar in aid every year

 that be why tonight i be ask the congress to pass legislation to help ensure american foreign assistance dollar always serve american interest and only go to america ’s friend

 as we strengthen friendship around the world we be also restore clarity about our adversary

 when the people of iran rise up against the crime of their corrupt dictatorship i do not stay silent america stand with the people of iran in their courageous struggle for freedom

 i be ask the congress to address the fundamental flaw in the terrible iran nuclear deal

 my administration have also impose tough sanction on the communist and socialist dictatorship in cuba and venezuela

 but no regime have oppress its own citizen more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in north korea

 north korea ’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missile could very soon threaten our homeland

 we be wage a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happen

 past experience have teach we that complacency and concession only invite aggression and provocation i will not repeat the mistake of past administration that get we into this dangerous position

 we need only look at the depraved character of the north korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to america and our ally

 otto warmbier be a hardworke student at the university of virginia on his way to study abroad in asia otto join a tour to north korea at its conclusion this wonderful young man be arrest and charge with crime against the state after a shameful trial the dictatorship sentence otto to 15 year of hard labor before return he to america last june horribly injure and on the verge of death he pass away just day after his return

 otto ’s parents fred and cindy warmbier be with we tonight along with otto ’s brother and sister austin and greta you be powerful witness to a menace that threaten our world and your strength inspire we all tonight we pledge to honor otto ’s memory with american resolve

 finally we be join by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime his name be mr. ji seong ho

 in 1996 seong ho be a starve boy in north korea one day he try to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scrap of food in the process he pass out on the train track exhaust from hunger he wake up as a train run over his limb he then endure multiple amputation without anything to dull the pain his brother and sister give what little food they have to help he recover and eat dirt themselves permanently stunt their own growth later he be torture by north korean authority after return from a brief visit to china his tormentor want to know if he have meet any christians he have and he resolve to be free

 seong ho travel thousand of mile on crutch across china and southeast asia to freedom most of his family follow his father be catch try to escape and be torture to death

 today he live in seoul where he rescue other defector and broadcast into north korea what the regime fear the most the truth

 today he have a new leg but seong ho i understand you still keep those crutch as a reminder of how far you have come your great sacrifice be an inspiration to we all

 seong ho ’s story be a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom

 it be that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 year ago give birth to a special place call america it be a small cluster of colony catch between a great ocean and a vast wilderness but it be home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea that they could rule themselves that they could chart their own destiny and that together they could light up the world

 that be what our country have always be about that be what americans have always stand for always strive for and always do

 atop the dome of this capitol stand the statue of freedom she stand tall and dignified among the monument to our ancestor who fight and live and die to protect she

 monument to washington and jefferson to lincoln and king

 memorial to the hero of yorktown and saratoga to young americans who shed their blood on the shore of normandy and the field beyond and other who go down in the water of the pacific and the sky over asia

 and freedom stand tall over one more monument this one this capitol this live monument to the american people

 a people whose hero live not only in the past but all around we defend hope pride and the american way

 they work in every trade they sacrifice to raise a family they care for our child at home they defend our flag abroad they be strong mom and brave kid they be firefighter police officer border agent medic and marines

 but above all else they be americans and this capitol this city and this nation belong to they

 our task be to respect they to listen to they to serve they to protect they and to always be worthy of they

 americans fill the world with art and music they push the bound of science and discovery and they forever remind we of what we should never forget the people dream this country the people build this country and it be the people who be make america great again

 as long as we be proud of who we be and what we be fight for there be nothing we can not achieve

 as long as we have confidence in our value faith in our citizen and trust in our god we will not fail

 our family will thrive

 our people will prosper

 and our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free

 we believe in the rule of law and we support the man and woman of law enforcement applause

 we believe every american have the right to grow up in a safe home and attend a good school and to have access to a really great job

 and we know that for americans nothing absolutely nothing be out of reach because we do not know the meaning of the word quit we do n’t quit and the republican party certainly have not quit because if we do we would not be here today we ’d be sit home say boy that be a tough year instead of that be one of the great year in the history of politic in the history of our country for a party what we ’ve do and what we ’ve accomplish i do not think it ’s be do and certainly not by much we have a year that be almost i would think unlike any

 it be a tremendous success and i give everybody in this room the credit and i give certainly these people behind i tremendous credit for what take place especially in that last month that be a month of tremendous pressure and that be people that be able to act under pressure my favorite type of person they be able to act under tremendous pressure

 so i just want to thank you all because that ’ what it be all about and you know it be interesting while we have a great year we be not be give credit for it regulation at a level that nobody have ever do in one year we knock out more regulation than anybody supreme court justice judge all over so many different record so many success

 but when we get the great tax cut bill and we call it the tax cut and jobs bill we get that it be like put it all in a box and wrap it with a beautiful ribbon we start get credit not only for that but for all of the other thing that we do during the year it ’ amazing the way that happen i be surprised actually

 but we get a lot of credit from a lot of people and all of a sudden they ’re say while we have a lot of accomplishment”—and then they go on to do the thing but the fact is—(laughter)—you understand that but we really do we get a lot of credit it all come together in that final month and so i give everybody in this room really kudo

 we ’re a nation of builder and dreamer and striver and fighter and together we ’re build a safe strong and very proud america already since the election we ’ve create 2.4 million job that ’ unthinkable applause and that do not include all of the thing that be happen you ’re go to see number that get even well

 and when i make that statement the other night there be zero movement from the democrats they sit there stone cold no smile no applause you would have think that on that one they would have sort of at least clap a little bit which tell you perhaps they ’d rather see we not do well than see our country do great and that ’s not good that ’s not good we have to change that applause

 and as i say we ’ve eliminate more regulation in our first year than any administration have ever eliminate and that mean four year eight year or in one instance sixteen year in one year we ’ve knock out more regulation it ’ an amazing thing and i happen to think that that be every bit as important toward our success as the tax cut

 i have many business friend and many people in business that come to i and they say that include small business they say the fact that they no long have to go through year of turmoil in getting approve and get approval and get rule change and get all sort of thing and get old while they ’re wait to get they the fact that all of that be go be probably as important or even more important to the massive tax cut we ’ve get people so that ’ something

 we ’ve sign into law the big tax cut and reform in american history and i have to say include in there be the individual mandate we repeal it that ’ a big one applause that ’s so big by itself that would be a big achievement and we sort of take it as well that be include

 and anwr one of the great potential field anywhere in the world applause and i never appreciate anwr so much a friend of mine call up who ’s in that world and in that business and say be it true that you ’re think about anwr i say yeah i think we ’re go to get it but you know he say be you kid that ’ the big thing by itself he say ronald reagan and every president have want to get anwr approve

 and after that i say oh make sure that ’ in the bill laughter it be amazing how that have an impact that have a very big impact on i paul i really do not care about it and then when i hear that everybody want it for 40 year they ’ve be try to get it approve and i say make sure you do not lose anwr laughter

 but it ’ great for the people of alaska and senator sullivan and senator murkowski be here someplace where be they but they be very happy camper senator applause good senator thank you they work very

 leader ryan and don young

 the president where ’s don young he ’ such a quiet guy where be don laughter don young also don thank you

 audience member inaudible all along

 the president so no we be always go to get it we never have a problem with it but if you think about that by itself be a big bill the individual mandate by itself be a big powerful bill that be just add on to what we do with the massive tax cut

 i want to thank senate finance chairman and a very spectacular man orrin hatch applause where ’s orrin orrin orrin be i love listen to he speak he say once i be the single great president in his lifetime now he ’ a young man so it ’s not that much but—(laughter and he actually once say i ’m the great president in the history of our country and i say do that include lincoln and washington he say yes i say i love this guy laughter i love he but he be he ’ a special guy

 and house ways and means chairman kevin brady for their incredible work applause kevin where be you kevin that’s what a job i ’d call kevin night after night kevin what about this what about that you be always there he be work what do you average sleep for about four week about maybe nothing i think he have no average but you do a great job nobody know it well than you kevin thank you

 maybe we ’ll do a phase two i do n’t know we ’ll do a phase two be you ready for that kevin huh i think you ’re ready laughter we ’ll get they even low but we be proud of you

 here in west virginia as a result of our tax cut the typical family of four will save roughly $ 2,000 a year to lower tax rate for hardworke americans we nearly double the standard deduction for everyone now the first $ 24,000 earn by a married couple be completely tax free and when i come into this beautiful building just a little while ago one of the people say you know i just get a check and i have $ 221 more than i have last year at this time in my envelope applause

 and that one really that ’ what we be wait we be wait for february and then we get hit with these corporation give tremendous bonus to everybody that nancy pelosi call crumb that be a bad that could be like deplorable do that make sense deplorable and crumbs”—those two word they seem to have a resemblance i hope it have the same meaning but she call it crumb when people be get $ 2,000 and $ 3,000 and $ 1,000 that ’ not crumb that ’ a lot of money

 we also double the child tax credit and that ’s so helpful to so many we ’ve go from one of the high business tax rate anywhere in the world to one of the most competitive one of the low one so that our great worker and company can compete and win against anyone

 we ’ve now give they the tool to go out and win and that ’ what they ’re do and they ’re also pour back a lot of you folk you see davos the other day they ’re come back i believe i bring hundred of billion of dollar with i back from europe back from switzerland when i go there the other day to make a speech they ’re so excited about this country and what ’s happen here and they would never ever have come

 in fact if the oppose party have win the election you would have have tremendous new rule and regulation put on everything and other thing would have happen and instead of go up almost 50 percent your stock market in my opinion would have go down 50 percent i really believe that because they be stifle it they be get prepare to stifle even bad than it be

 the change to our business tax alone be expect to raise average household income by $ 4,000 roughly 3 million worker have already receive tax cut bonus and raise total thousand and thousand of dollar per worker and that ’s just over the past six week alone

 because of our tax cut apple be invest $ 350 billion in the united states they ’re bring $ 240 billion back—$240 billion they ’re go to pay a tax of $ 38 billion mitch—$38 billion but they ’re go to invest a total of $ 350 billion and when i first hear the number i say you do not mean billion you mean $ 350 million because i ’ve be say to tim cook tim we get to build plant here you know for $ 350 million you could build a beautiful plant but for $ 350 billion they ’re go to build a lot of plant and this would have never happen without we and the work you ’ve do and they ’re hire 20,000 worker by the way applause

 and two day ago exxonmobil in addition to many other just announce that they be invest $ 50 billion in the united states so the good news just keep on roll in and it ’s go to

 and i want to thank senator tim scott for opportunity zone our tax plan encourage this investment where be tim what a good guy tim be applause tim see he over there someplace thank you tim but we ’re invest in distressed community to create more job for those who have too often be leave behind and tim work hard on that

 we want every american to know the dignity of work the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well do and we ’re reach our hand all across the aisle in pursuit of common ground and commonsense reform for the good of all americans all americans

 we can reform our prison system to help those who have serve their time get a second chance at life and i ’ve watch this and i ’ve see it and i ’ve study it and people get out of prison and they make a mistake and not all some be very bad but many be very good and they come home and they can not get a job it ’ sad they can’t there’s they can not get a job

 now the good thing we ’ve do to fix that paul be the fact that the economy be just boom i mean that fix it well than any program we can do anything we can do at all but the economy be so strong now and so good and so many company be move in that i really believe that problem it ’ a big problem be go to solve itself but we ’re work on it

 we can invest in workforce development job training and open new vocational school because we want every american to be able to reach their full god give potential vocational school today you have community college and you have all of the when i be grow up we have vocational school

 and when i be go to school i remember i be in high school and there be people in class one person in particular he be n’t like the great student and he just be n’t and yet i see he one day and he be able to fix a car engine blindfold and everybody else be say that ’s amazing how talented he be he have a different kind of a talent and we should have vocational school you learn mechanical you learn bricklaying and carpentry and all of these thing we do not have that very much anymore

 and i think the word vocational be a much well word than in many case a community college a lot of people do not know what a community college mean or represent so we ’re work very hard on vocational school so that when all these company move into this country we ’re go to have a workforce that know exactly what they ’re do

 in addition to that when they move in we ’re give they incentive to also train people themselves because in many way that ’s the good way to do it in wisconsin we have a great company move in they make all of the apple iphones and they ’re go to have a big program they ’re go to have a tremendous program to teach people how to do this because it ’ a whole new skill and it will be very successful

 we can reduce the price of prescription drug and ensure that terminally ill patient have a right to try applause so important right to try you know those drug they sit in there for 12 13 14 year and a person be terminally ill they have two month leave and under the old system they do not want to give they even an experimental medicine because they ’re afraid they ’re go to be hurt well they ’re not go to be around for two month

 so they ’ll sign a waiver and we ’re go to give they the hope of find something you have people and i ’ve know people like this they travel all over the world to try and find a cure and we have great experimental drug but it will be year before they come on to the market

 so it ’s call right to try and i hope you folk can approve it and i hope you agree with it but i think it ’ so important it ’ so important applause and scott gottlieb be head it up and it’s and the other thing you get be you learn pretty quickly how effective it be do it work but you learn it really very quickly so right to try

 we can fix bad trade deal and negotiate new one that be fair and the most important word to i on trade be reciprocal because we have deal where company will send in a motorbike and we charge they nothing but when we send a harley davidson or a motorbike to those country they charge we 100 percent tax that ’ not fair so they ’ll send their motorbike or something into we zero we send it to them—100 percent that ’ not fair trade that ’ not fair

 so i like the word reciprocal if they ’re go to do it to we we ’re go to do it to they and what ’s go to happen be your number be go to either come down or we ’re go to make a lot of money and either one be okay as far as i ’m concerned

 we can rebuild our crumble infrastructure and we will streamline the horrible approval process roadway that take 12 13 14 year to get approve we use to build they in three month and now it take year and year of approval we ’re go to bring that down ideally to one year two year be our goal but one year be our real goal and we can get it do under budget and we want to get it do ahead of schedule because you do not have too many of they under budget and ahead of schedule

 we can deliver for our police our veteran and our brave servicemember and finally after decade of wait we can finally pass immigration reform that protect our country defend our border and modernize our immigration rule to serve the need of american worker and of american family so important

 one of the strength of the republican party be that we ’re a big tent with many diverse view but the one thing we can all agree on and that ’ that in every decision we make our high priority to serve and to protect the american people

 we want an immigration policy that ’ fair equitable but that ’s go to protect our people we want people come into our country base on merit and base on the fact that they be go to love our country and they respect our people and our country we do not want visa lottery pick a lottery ticket pick a lottery we do not want that so we want it base on merit applause

 we have a chance now to pass into law the immigration reform that the american people have be demand for decade and that many of you have be work on for your entire career we have a great opportunity as a republican party as the republican party we have a great opportunity we ’re get very little help from the democrats but i hope after i leave this room we ’re go to get a call from these people say let ’s go

 you know they talk a good game we have to get help from the other side or we have to elect many more republican that ’s another way of do it applause really that ’s another way of do it and base on the number we just see we have a real chance of do that you know 18 be go to be very interesting but we ’ve get to do one or the other either they ’re go to have to come on board because they talk a good game with daca but they do n’t produce

 and so either they come on board or we ’re just go to have to really work and we ’re go to have to get more people so we can get the kind of number that we need to pass in a much easy fashion legislation and to get it do we ’ll all have to make some compromise along the way to get it do this way now to get it do the other way if we win more we do not have to compromise so much okay with the tax bill we get what we want because we have essentially a unanimous vote

 but we have to go and we have to get it do and get it do properly and we ’re go to have to compromise unless we elect more republicans in which case we can have it just the way everybody in this room want it we have to be willing to give a little in order for our country to gain a whole lot

 if we ’re united if we work together for the good of the nation and we can fulfill our sacred duty to the country and to our incredible voter we have really fulfil a solemn promise

 as you know i have put forward an immigration framework base on many month of meeting and work with tom cotton and work with john cornyn who be in the office the other day and david perdue incredible people and bob goodlatte who ’s out here someplace really incredible people and it ’ a strong bill but it ’ a very fair bill and it protect our border we have to protect our border applause

 it include reform that be overwhelmingly popular with the voter include democrats the democrats want to have the real democrats they want to have their border protect but it include democrats independent republicans americans want an immigration system that work for everybody and they want safety

 and by the way they also want a strong military and we have to be very powerful on our military you know our military have be deplete over the last long period of time even beyond obama it ’s be deplete we ’ve get to build up this should not be a party thing this should be common sense without our military we might not be here talk we have to have a strong military

 and i think we ’re very much on our way from the one standpoint we ’re go for funding which we need and i think we ’ll get it but we have a lot of fighting on that from the other side and we can not even think about it we need a strong and powerful military and we ’re go to have far more powerful than we be ever before applause

 nearly 7 in 10 americans support an immigration reform package that include a permanent solution on daca and i ’ve be hear about daca for so many year some people call it dreamer it ’ not dreamer do not fall into that trap it ’ just much different than dreamer and i say the other night you know we have dreamer too we have dreamer in this country too you can not forget our dreamer i have a lot of dreamer here applause

 but daca we want to take care of daca and i hope we will we need the support of the democrats in order to do it and they might not want to do it they talk like they do but i do not think they do but we ’re go to find out very soon

 we want something that be very very tough and strong in term of the border we need to end chain migration and we need to cancel the terrible visa lottery applause

 and those be the four pillar that i talk about the other night we call they the white house framework a plan that will finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century

 the republican position on immigration be the center mainstream view of the american people with some extra strength at the border and security at the border add in what we ’re ask for and what the american people be plead for be sanity and common sense in our immigration system we want immigration rule that protect our community defend our security and admit people who will love our country and contribute to our society

 i know that the senate be plan to bring an immigration bill on the floor to the floor in come week and i ’m ask that the framework we submit with great flexibility great flexibility work with both party that something very positive will come out of it for our country for everybody for our country and i think that can happen

 if the democrats choose to filibuster a framework that include a generous path to citizenship or something that be not fair we be not go to approve it we ’re just not go to approve it

 so we ’ll either have something that ’ fair and equitable and good and secure or we ’re go to have nothing at all and this have be go on for many year it do not make sense however to have nothing at all because this be something that people want

 so we will be demonstrate that we be very very serious one of the reason i give a number that be i think a very generous number be because i want to see whether or not they be interested in approve that because if they do not approve something within that sphere that mean very simply that they ’re not look to approve it at all they want to use it for an election issue but it ’ now an election issue that will go to our benefit not their benefit applause

 but make no mistake i will not rest until we have deliver for the citizen of our great country so many different thing immigration the strong military we ’ve do an awfully good job of protect our second amendment that be in question during the campaign you remember and we have do a very very good job applause

 for the last 12 month i have keep one promise after another and we ’re just getting start so often i ’ll see and i must say six seven month ago they be say he do not fulfill his promise on this or that i say i ’ve only be here for four month you know other people be there for eight year and they would finally get something pass i be there four month you know this paul and they be say he do not fulfill a promise

 but now we ’ve fulfil far more promise than we promise laughter and they ’re have a hard time with that we have seriously fulfil promise i call it promise plus laughter

 and one of the thing we ’re do that ’s so important and mitch have work so hard on and don and everybody be the justice the judge all over the country we ’re fill up the court with really talented people who understand and read the constitution for what it say applause

 so it ’s really not talk about that much but it be a tremendous impact it ’ have already a tremendous impact and we have incredible people line up just line up that be get ready to go into the court and in many way mitch i think it ’s go to be one of the most important thing if not the most important thing that we ’re do

 defense be always the most got to be the most john right but what we ’re do with the court i think be go to go down as one of the great achievement so i want to thank you for that thank you applause

 and not only be we protect america at home we ’re protect our interest abroad it ’ time to finally end the dangerous defense sequester it would be wonderful if we could go back to a budget—(applause)—in order to fully fund our military and do it properly and order properly and have it over a period of time and do it the right way so at some point i hope we ’re go to be able to do that and it should work

 and in order to defeat terrorist we ’re also ask congress to ensure that we continue to have all necessary power and everything we need to defeat and detain the terrorist we can not treat terrorist like common criminal they be really unlawful enemy combatant applause

 when you see what they do and the way they do it and the level of ferocity we can not treat they the way we do the ordinary criminal and as you see on tuesday i ’ve sign an order keep open our very secure detention facility at guantanamo bay applause it ’ another promise keep

 and there be one more very important promise we ’re keep no long be we make apology for america we do not apologize anymore applause we ’re proud of our history we ’re confident in our value and we ’re grateful to our hero and we be determined to create a bright future for all of our people we be restore the bond of love and loyalty that unite we all as friend as neighbor as citizen as americans because when americans be united nothing nothing at all nothing can stop we we win applause

 as i say the other night we be a nation that build the empire state building in one year actually to be exact it be we build it in less than a year would you believe it work 24 hour around the clock

 we build the hoover dam in record time we build the golden gate bridge we link our nation together with railroad and highway we dig out the panama canal we ’re the nation that win two world wars defeat fascism and communism and put satellite into space and plant our great american flag on the face of the moon we ’ve heal the sick cure disease and care for the poor like no other nation we ’ve lift million into prosperity and deliver million into freedom

 this be our legacy this be our birthright and this be the foundation on which we build our very glorious future because together we be indeed make america great again

 no i ’ve have it too often you ’ll have one person and you can hardly even hear he in fact the big really disturbance be you people you know why he ’ll say something nobody hear he because it ’ all and then the crowd will start scream at he and then all of a sudden we stop for and that ’s okay you have to show your spirit right you have to show your spirit it ’ true applause

 so we pass the big tax cut in the history of our country and it be call tax cut and reform and i say to our people do not use the word reform because we be go to call it the tax reform act i say no wonder for 45 year nothing have be pass because people want tax cut and they do not know what reform mean reform can mean you ’re go to pay more tax so i convince politician who have do this all their life and they do a great job in many case but this be one they be go the tax reform act of whatever year we want to put okay

 so they have the tax reform act and that be it and now it be call the tax act tax cut act and jobs we have to add job into it because we ’re pick up a tremendous number of jobs—2.7 million job since the election 2.7 applause

 so now people hear tax cut and it have be popular remember it start off a little slow then it get pass and we have some great help i will say we have some great help in the senate in the house we have guy here today we have a lot of congressman we have a lot of senator we have a lot of help and we get it pass

 just it be not easy we do not have one democrat vote and i think that ’s go to cost they in the midterm i know that whoever win the presidency have a disadvantage for whatever reason in the midterm you know what happen i ’m try to figure it out because historically if you win the presidency you do n’t do well two year later and you know what we can not let that happen applause and i know what happen i finally figure it out nobody have be able to explain it it just happen statistically almost all of the time for many year

 what happen be you fight so hard to win the presidency you fight fight fight and now only two year that ’s a very short period and by the time you start campaign it ’ a year and now you get to go and fight again but you just win so nobody have that same drive that they have so you end up not do that well because the other side be go they’re craze and by the way they ’re craze anyway these people they be really craze laughter and applause right

 so because i keep try to say why be this but it ’ just there so the great enthusiasm you know you ’re sit back you ’re watch television maybe i do not have to vote today we just win the presidency and then we get clobber and we can not let that happen we get clobber in 18 and we can not let that happen only because we be so happy we pass so many thing honestly and i ’ll say i’ll use the word my administration as oppose to i my administration i think have have the most successful first year in the history of the presidency i really believe that i really believe it i really believe it applause so i mean judge regulation everything

 and the beautiful thing about the tax cut be nobody think we could do it because again we have to get 100 percent of our vote and nobody think we could do it and frankly i mean to i we get it and it ’s turn out to be one of the most popular thing and by the way for the republicans in this room of which i assume would you say be it 99 percent matt or 100 percent huh i would hope it ’ close to you know what hey we probably have some democrats that want to come over we have a great governor from west virginia that leave the democratic party big jim and he come over to the republican party applause

 so people be sit there and they ’re say oh we just have that great victory eh let ’s not vote let ’s go to a movie we ’re the republican party we ’re go to do great and then they end up lose

 so you got to keep up the enthusiasm now what happen by the way they lose and then you have the presidential election come up again and you clobber they because everybody get off their ass and they get out and they work right and they work and they work and work and work and you end up win the presidency again and we should do that hopefully we ’re go to do that very easily

 but never we have to worry right now we have a big race come up in 18 you have to get out you have to just get that enthusiasm keep it go applause

 see the word really be complacent people get complacent it ’ a natural instinct you just win and now you ’re happy and you ’re complacent do not be complacent okay do not be complacent because if they get in they will repeal your tax cut they will put judge in that you would not believe they ’ll take away your second amendment which we will never allow to happen applause they ’ll take away your second amendment applause

 audience donald trump donald trump

 the president remember that they will take away thank you they will take away those massive tax cut and they will take away your second amendment by the way if you only have a choice of one what would you rather have the second amendment or the tax cut go ahead second amendment tax cut second amendment applause i ’m go to leave it at the second amendment i do not want to get into that battle all right

 we ’re go to say you want matt we ’re go to say you want the second amendment the most but we ’re go to get they all and remember this—(applause)—remember this we ’ve get you know somebody get on television recently and they say actually this be the first time i can remember trump make campaign promise he may be the only person that actually fulfil more promise than he make i think that ’ true applause i fulfil more promise

 but we have a very crooked medium we have a crooked candidate too by the way but we have a very very crooked medium

 audience lock she up lock she up lock she up

 the president i will say this folk everything that ’s turn out now it ’ amazing that ’s come full circle boy have they commit a lot of atrocity when you look applause right when you look have they do thing that be wrong

 but remember this not only do we get the tax cut which everybody say we would not get and by the way repeal in that tax cut the individual mandate which be a tremendous thing applause

 this be where you ’re force to pay in order not to have healthcare okay be that great you pay for the privilege of not have healthcare so you ’re subsidize lot of other people that ’ go i know people come up to i with tear in their eye they ’re say i ’m force to pay not to have healthcare very unfair

 and by the way we ’re have tremendous plan come out now healthcare plan at a fraction of the cost that be much well than obamacare applause and except for one senator who come into a room at 3 o’clock in the morning and go like that we would have have healthcare too

 audience booo

 the president we would have have healthcare too think of that but i think we may be well off the way we ’re do it it ’ piece by piece by piece obamacare be just be wipe out the individual mandate essentially wipe it out applause so i think we may be well off and people be get great healthcare plan and we ’re not finish yet

 but remember one person walk into a room when he be suppose to go this way and he say he be go this way and he walk in and he go this way and everyone say what happen what be that all about boy oh boy who be that i do n’t know i do n’t know i do n’t know i do not want to be controversial so i will not use his name okay laughter what a mess but it ’s all happen anyway it ’s all happen anyway

 and we ’ve at the same time eliminate a record number of job kill regulation and people be go back to work applause right people be go back to work so and you know the fake news always if i say something that ’s like a little off next day headline he misrepresent ”—i have to be careful

 by the way you do not mind if i go off script a little bit because you know it ’ sort of boring it ’ a little boring applause got this beautiful speech everything be wonderful but a little boring we have to you know

 but we give they their dignity back and that ’ why our country be do record business we ’re do record business we ’re do business and you have to look at the fundamental company be pour back into this country they ’re pour back not like i mean when do you hear about car company come back into michigan and come to ohio and expand applause when do you hear you never hear that you hear they ’re leave i ’ve be talk about it for 20 year

 and then everybody say he can not get elect he can not do it you need 270 vote you need electoral college which by the way be much tough than the popular vote the popular vote actually would be so much easy you go three or four state and you just go and you just do great job hillary forget that you know she go to these state i say what ’s she do why do she keep go back to california laughter crazy

 next time they ’re go to remember iowa they ’re go to remember ohio applause remember they spend a lot of time in pennsylvania to no avail applause they spend a lot of money they spend a lot of money in north carolina the great state of north carolina applause we do very well there we have a great person in the room mark meadows from north carolina applause he ’ around here where ’s mark where ’s mark and deb and we have jim jordan warrior warrior all applause we have a lot of great we have a lot of great people here but you know we just we hit a chord

 and if you remember 2011 probably that be the beginning of what we ’ve do and hopefully at the end of a period of time people be go to say thank you because it be not easy we ’re fight a lot of force they ’re force that be do the wrong thing they ’re just do the wrong thing i do not want to talk about what they have in mind but they do the wrong thing but we ’re do what ’ good for our country for the long term viability and survival like for instance $ 700 billion get approve for our military our military be go to hell applause

 they just keep go kerry kerry may be the bad negotiator i ’ve ever see laughter how about this guy how about and obama of course he ’ the one but how about $ 1.8 billion in cash do you ever see what like a million dollar in hundred dollar bill a lot of people do it as a promotion it ’ a lot it ’ big it ’ like big laughter now take that go to $ 1.8 billion in cash $ 1.8 billion for what for what why do we do this why do we do it

 anyway we do not certify and lot of interesting thing be happen with that whole mess but we have to treat people that treat we well we treat they well people that treat we badly we treat they much bad than they can ever imagine that ’ the way it have to be applause that ’ the way it have to be

 we officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel applause you know every president campaign on we ’re go to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel everybody for many president you ’ve be read it and then they never pull it off and i now know why

 our nation ’s motto be in god we trust applause and this week our nation lose an incredible leader who devote his life to help we understand what those word really mean leader he be a leader he be a great man

 we will never forget the historic crowd that voice the energy and the profound faith of a preacher name billy graham applause great man and great family franklin graham great family and they be for we i ’ll tell you they be for we right from the beginning they be for we

 as a young man billy decide to devote his life to god that choice not only change his life it change our country and indeed it even change the world

 everywhere you go all over the country in city small and large americans of all faith reach out to our creator for strength for inspiration and for healing great time for healing in time of grief and hardship we turn to prayer for solace and for comfort

 in recent day our entire nation have be fill with terrible pain and sorrow over the evil massacre in a great community parkland florida this senseless act of mass murder have shock our nation and break our heart

 this week i have the honor of meet with student from marjory stoneman douglas high school with family who have lose their child in prior shooting great family great people and with member of the local community right here in washington d.c. our whole nation be move by their strength and by their courage

 we listen to their heart wrench story ask they for idea and pledge to they and i can speak for all of the senator and congressman and congresswoman all of the people in this room that be involve in this decision that we will act we will do something we will act

 with we on wednesday be one of the family whose daughter do not come home last week a beautiful young woman name meadow pollack incredible family i have they in the oval office incredible people you ’ve probably see her picture she have a beautiful beautiful smile and a beautiful life so full of promise

 we wish there be something anything we could do to bring meadow and all of the other back there be not enough tear in the world to express our sadness and anguish for her family and for every family that have lose a precious love one no family should ever save and ever have to go in and suffer the way these family have suffer they ’ve suffer beyond anything that i ’ve ever witness

 a father drop his daughter off at school kiss her goodbye wave to she she ’s walk up the path and never see she alive again get a call can not believe it think it ’ a nightmare want to wake up from the nightmare

 so we want to hear idea from americans of all background and belief about how we can improve security at our school tackle the issue of mental health because this be a sick person very sick and we have a lot of warning about he be sick this be n’t a surprise to the people that know he this be not even a little bit in fact some say be surprised it take so long so what be we do what be we do we want to ensure that when there be warn sign we can act and act very quickly

 why do we protect our airport and our bank our government building but not our school applause it ’ time to make our school a much hard target for attacker we do not want they in our school applause we do not want they

 when we declare our school to be gun free zone it just put our student in far more danger applause far more danger well train gun adept teacher and coach and people that work in those building people that be in the marines for 20 year and retire people in the army the navy the air force the coast guard people that be adept adept with weaponry and with gun they teach i mean i do not want to have 100 guard stand with rifle all over the school you do a conceal carry permit applause

 and this would be a major deterrent because these people be inherently coward if they think like if this guy think that other people would be shoot bullet back at he he would not have go to that school he would not have go there it ’ a gun free zone it say this be a gun free zone please check your gun way far away and what happen be they feel safe there ’s nobody go to come at they

 this way you may have and remember if you use this school as an example this be a very big school with tremendous floor area and a lot of acreage it ’ a big big school good school a big big school you ’d have to have 150 real guard look you have one guard he do not turn out to be too good i will tell you that he turn out to be not good he be not a credit to law enforcement that i can tell you that i can tell you applause

 but as i ’ve be talk about this idea and i feel it ’ a great idea but some people that be good people be oppose to it they do n’t like the idea of teacher do it but i ’m not talk about teacher you know cnn go on they say donald trump want all teacher okay fake news folk fake news fake news

 i do not want a person that ’s never handle a gun that would not know what a gun look like to be arm but out of your teaching population out of your teaching population you have 10 percent 20 percent of very gun adept people military people law enforcement people they teach they teach applause

 and something i think of this morning you know what else and i think of it since i find and watch peterson the deputy who do not go into the school because he do not want to go into the school okay he be test under fire and that be n’t a good result

 but you know what i think of as soon as i see that these teacher and i ’ve see they at a lot of school where they have problem these teacher love their student and the student love their teacher in many case these teacher love their student and these teacher be talente with weaponry and with gun and they feel safe and i ’d rather have somebody that love their student and want to protect their student than somebody stand outside that do not know anybody and do not know the student and frankly for whatever reason decide not to go in even though he hear lot of shot be fire inside

 the teacher and the coach and other people in the building the dean the assistant dean the principal they can they love their people they want to protect these kid and i think we ’re well with that and this may be 10 percent or 20 percent of the population of teacher et cetera it ’ not all of they but you would have a lot and you would tell people that they ’re inside and the beauty be it ’s conceal nobody would ever see it unless they need it it ’s conceal

 so this crazy man who walk in would not even know who it be that have it that ’ good that ’ not bad that ’ good and a teacher would have shoot the hell out of he before he know what happen applause they love their student they love those student folk remember that they love their student

 and i ’m tell you that would work because we need offensive capability we can not just say oh it ’ a gun free school we ’re go to do it a little bit well because then you say what happen outside the student now leave school and you get a thousand student you get 3,500 at the school we ’re talk about but you have a thousand student stand outside the teacher be out there also if a madman come along we have the same problem but it ’ outside of the school or they drive car there be a lot of thing that can happen

 i want to stop it and i know it ’ a little controversial to say but i have to say since i start this two day ago a lot of people that be totally opposed to it be now agree they love their student they do not want their student to be kill or to be hurt applause

 so we have to do something that work and one of the big measure that we will do and everybody in this room i think have to agree and there ’ nobody that love the second amendment more than i do and there ’s nobody that respect the nra they ’re friend of mine they back we all they ’re great people they ’re patriot applause but they ’re great people but we really do have to strengthen up really strengthen up background check we have to do that applause

 and we have to do for the mentally ill we have to do very very we do not want to people that be mentally ill to be have any form of weaponry we have to be very strong on that applause

 so we ’re go to do that and i really believe that congress be go to get it through this time and they have a different leader they have somebody that want to get it through not somebody that ’s just all talk no action like so many of these folk this be somebody that want to get it through

 but i also want to protect we need a harden site it have to be harden it can not be soft because they ’ll sneak in through a window they ’ll sneak in some way and again you ’re stand there totally unprotected

 you know the five great soldier from four year ago three of they be world class marksman they be on a military base in a gun free zone they be ask to check their gun quite far away and a maniac walk in gun blaze kill all of five of they he would not of have a chance if these world class marksman have on a military base access to their gun and i ’m go to look at that whole policy on military basis if we can n’t have applause all five be kill all five the guy would not have have a chance

 but we ’re go to look at that whole military base gun free zone if we can not have our military hold gun it ’ pretty bad we have a number of instance on military basis you know that so we want to protect our military we want to make our military strong and well than it ’s ever be before applause

 we also need to create a culture in our country that cherish life and human dignity that ’ part of what we ’re talk about applause a culture that condemn violence and never glorify violence we need to foster real human connection and turn classmate and colleague into friend and neighbor that want to fight for we

 we ’re not just have a conversation about school safety you ’ve have conversation in all fairness i ’m pretty new on this job we ’re here a little more than a year i ’ve be watch this stuff go on for 20 year the president get up everybody be enthusiastic for the first couple of day then it fade fade fade nothing ever get do we want to see if we can get it do let ’s get it do right applause we really owe it to our country and i ’ve be watch for a long time see a lot of word and i ’ve see very little action

 and you know if you think about most of its just common sense it ’ not do you love gun do hate gun it ’ common sense it ’ all common sense and some of the strong advocate about what i ’m say be the strong advocate i know they very well political people the strong advocate for the second amendment but this be common sense

 in addition to secure our school we ’re also implement a strategy to secure our street we want our kid to be safe everywhere they go whether they ’re in a classroom walk home from school or just outside play with their friend applause every child deserve to grow up in a safe community surround by a love family and to have a future fill with opportunity and with hope applause thank you thank you just not fair

 reduce violent crime in america be a top priority for my administration and we will do whatever it take to get it do no talk we ’re go to do what it take to get it do applause

 as you ’ve see pretty well report that we ’re significantly increase gun prosecution by tremendous percentage and we ’re work to get violent offender off our street and behind bar and get they behind bar quickly for a long time or get they the hell out of our country applause

 in 2017 we bring case against more violent offender than any administration in a quarter of a century more than any administration and we ’re just gear up we have tough people i ’ll tell you what when you deal with ms-13 the only thing they understand be toughness they do not want anything all they understand be toughness if that ice agent or border patrol agent be tough than they they respect he we get the tough guy you ’ve ever see we get tough applause they do n’t respect anything else and they should not be in our country they be let in for year they should not be and we ’re get they out

 our administration prosecute more people for federal firearm charge than have be do in more than a decade and again we ’re just gear up we ’ve convict 1,200 gang member and nearly 500 human trafficker applause you know what human trafficking who would think that we have this in this age and with our foreign partner we ’ve help charge or arrest more than 4,000 member of the savage gang that we talk about ms-13

 now they do n’t like gun you know why they ’re not painful enough these be animal they cut people they cut they they cut they up in little piece and they want they to suffer and we take they into our country because our immigration law be so bad and when we catch they it ’s call catch and release we have to by law catch they and then release they catch and release and i can not get the democrats and nobody have be able to for year to approve common sense measure that when we catch these animal killer we can lock they up and throw away the key applause

 in 2017 our brave ice officer arrest more than 100,000 criminal alien who have commit ten of thousand of crime and believe i these be great people they can not the law be just against we they ’re against they ’re against safety they do not make sense and you meet with democrats and they ’re always fight for the criminal they ’re not fight for law abide citizen they ’re always fight for the criminal applause do not make sense

 here be just some of the criminal charge and conviction for the alien arrest by ice 11,000 charge or conviction for sex crime 48,000 for assault 13,000 for burglary and 1,800 for kill people

 we ’re crack down on sanctuary city can you believe this applause where they protect that ’s another one because we want our city to be sanctuary for law abide americans not for criminal applause

 and by the way the senate democrats and the house democrats have totally abandon daca they ’ve total they do not even talk to i about it they have totally abandon you know we get the reputation like daca it ’ not republican we ’ll let i tell you it be republican because we want to do something about daca get it solve after all these year

 the democrats be be totally unresponsive they do not want to do anything about daca i ’m tell you and it ’ very possible that daca will not happen and it ’s not because of the republicans it ’s go to be because of the democrats and frankly you well elect more republicans folk or it will never happen applause

 the democrats vote in favor of sanctuary city in other word they vote to protect criminal alien instead of vote to protect the american citizen

 to secure our country we be call on congress to build a great border wall to stop dangerous drug and criminal from pour into our country applause and now they ’re willing to give we the wall but they do not want to give we any of the law to keep these people out

 so we ’re go to get the wall but they do not want to give we all of the other chain migration lottery think of a lottery you have a country they put name in you think they ’re give we their good people not too many of you people be go to be in a lottery so we pick out people then they turn out to be horrendous and we do not understand why

 they ’re not give we their good people folk they ’re not give we i mean use your head they ’re give we it ’ a lottery i do not want people come into this country with a lottery i want people come into this country base on merit base on merit applause

 i want people and we all want to be admit people who have skill who can support themselves financially who can contribute to our economy who will love our people and who will share our value who will love our country applause

 i do not want people who drive a car at 100 mile an hour down the west side highway and kill 8 innocent victim and destroy the life of 14 more nobody talk about that nobody ever talk about the people that have be so horribly injure who lose leg and arm in manhattan where i use to spend my time

 i know it very well the stretch along the west side highway people run in order to stay in shape they want to be healthy they want to look good they ’re run all the time i see it they run we work in different way laughter but they run no but think of this they run and they ’re so they want to be fit they ’re proud people they want to be fit and they ’re run up and down west side highway it ’ beautiful it ’ a beautiful thing

 and this maniac take a car go down the highway and just turn to a right and he kill eight but he really badly wound 12 to 14 other people

 so somebody think of it run to stay in shape leave the house be jog along work hard end up go home two month later with no leg or with no arm or with two leg miss nobody ever talk about that they talk about the people rightfully that be kill but they do not talk about the people whose life have be just change just change they do n’t talk about that

 so to the brave agent and officer thank you for protect we all

 last year my commission on combat the incredible crisis of opioid issue 56 recommendation my administration agree with all of the commission ’s goal and we ’ve work aggressively to put they into action

 today i ’m here to announce additional step that we ’re take as part of our nationwide initiative to address the opioid crisis and by the way the drug crisis the general drug crisis

 first we ’re take action to reduce drug demand by prevent americans from become addict in the first place so important that include increase federal funding for the development of non addictive painkiller and we have to come up with a solution where we come up with a painkiller that ’s not so addictive and we can do it we ’re not that far off we can do it these thing be incredibly addictive so we ’re go to find that answer also

 here with we today be jim and jean mozer they lose their beautiful son adam to a fentanyl overdose his addiction begin with prescription pill he find in their kitchen cabinet they have since begin the zero left initiative to help family get rid of excess painkiller jim and jean we ’re sorry for your loss a great boy he ’ a great boy and we applaud your strength and your leadership and where be you where be you come on up come on up here come on up here applause tell we about your boy

 ms mozer adam be our old son he be a great kid he be a smart kid grow up out in rural east kingston new hampshire he have a degree in actuarial science which as many of you know that ’s the science of forecasting risk

 he be the kind of kid that make you feel really good about yourself you give he five minute you really like he and you know he just make a bad choice one night as smart as he be he find his way into our kitchen cabinet and sadly the rest be history he get hook on it and have to go to the street eventually and he find fentanyl

 and he ’s be go for two and a half year and we miss he every day thank you

 the president thank you darling you take care of yourself okay

 ms mozer thank you

 the president thank you thank you very much applause thank you appreciate it and so many case like that

 we ’re also take action to prevent addiction by address the problem of overprescribe applause and our department of justice be look very seriously into bring major litigation against some of these drug company we ’ll bring it at a federal level applause some state be already bring it but we ’re think about bring it at a very high federal level and we ’ll do a job

 we ’re go to cut nationwide opioid prescription by one third over the next three year we ’re also go to make sure that virtually all prescription reimburse by the federal government follow good practice for prescribing we ’ll ensure that opioid addiction be not subsidize by the american taxpayer applause

 the good way so important and the good way to beat the drug crisis be to keep people from get hooked on drug to begin with as part of that effort—(applause)—so important and this have be something that i ’ve be very strongly in favor of spend a lot of money on great commercial show how bad it be so that kid see those commercial during the right show on television or wherever the internet when they see these commercial they—“i do not want any part of it that ’s the least expensive thing we can do where you scare they from end up like the people in the commercial and we ’ll make they very very bad commercial we ’ll make they pretty unsavory situation and you ’ve see it before and it ’s have an impact on smoking and cigarette you see what happen to the body you see what happen to the mind

 so we ’re announce a new website crisisnextdoor.gov where americans can share their story about the danger of the opioid addiction and addiction
 but we ’re think about do really a largescale rollout of commercial that show how bad it be for the kid and when they see those commercial hopefully they ’re not go to be go to drug of any kind drug of any kind and we ’ll save a lot of life and we ’ll make their life a lot easy

 this epidemic can affect anyone and that ’ why we want to educate everyone
 the second part of our initiative be to reduce the supply of illicit drug ninety percent of the heroin in america come from our southern border where eventually the democrats will agree with we and we ’ll build the wall to keep the damn drug out applause

 audience build that wall build that wall build that wall

 the president it ’ pretty amazing they do not want to go with daca because they do n’t care about daca but they ’re try to tie the wall to daca and daca to the wall and they want to keep daca for the campaign instead of get it approve which we could do very easily the republicans be totally in favor of do something substantial for daca but the democrats like it as a campaign issue so they do not get it approve and they want to tie it to the wall which be okay with i but both should get approve they do not want it to be approve remember what i say they do not want it to be approve they want to make it part of the campaign well we ’ll make it part of the campaign also and we ’ll win because we ’re go to win on those issue applause

 my administration be also confront thing call sanctuary city that shield dangerous criminal and every day sanctuary city release illegal immigrant and drug dealer trafficker and gang member back into our community they ’re protect by these city and you say what be they do they ’re safe haven for just some terrible people some terrible people and they ’re make it very dangerous for our law enforcement officer you see it all the time

 as the people of new hampshire have learn firsthand end sanctuary city be crucial to stop the drug addiction crisis and your governor who be great the number be go down in new hampshire i do not know if you ’ve see it but the number be go down chris we be just stand up chris applause it ’ really one of the few bright spot where the number actually be go down and that ’ a tremendous achievement thank you chris applause

 accord to a recent dartmouth study the sanctuary city of lawrence massachusetts be one of the primary source of fentanyl in six new hampshire county ice recently arrest 15 ms-13 gang member these be not good people folk okay these be bad bad people they do n’t use gun they ’d rather use knife because it ’ more painful and it take long these be bad people in boston massachusetts which be a place where you have sanctuary city

 i ’m repeat my call on congress to block fund for sanctuary city and to close the deadly loophole that allow criminal back into our country and into our country in the first place applause

 you know some thing be very understandable we have lot of issue where we ’re on both side of an issue and you can understand the other side even though you do n’t agree sanctuary city be hard to understand for people because they do not get it they do not get it you see what ’s go on in california how terrible it be how dangerous it be and they ’re all try to protect sanctuary city

 and whether it ’ kate steinle or so many other they ’d be around today if these people be n’t allow back into our country through in this case the southern border at least five time and look at the damage and then look at this verdict look at the verdict can you believe the verdict

 so we have to get a lot smart we have to get a lot tough and speak of tough because here with we today be ice agent derek dunn derek work with state police to uncover a major drug smuggling operation in lawrence massachusetts applause where ’s derek derek where ’s derek come here derek i love tough guy we need tough guy come here derek applause
 agent dunn just want to say thank for everyone be here and it ’s be a battle it ’s be an absolute battle for our counterpart here at dea and fbi and everybody all the law enforcement state police and the local police it ’s be an absolute battle we all work together and we ’re go to get this solve applause

 the president thank you he do not know he be go to do that laughter and you do not know you be go to do that but that ’s in honor of your boy right you make a big impact

 i also want to mention ice agent ron morin and manchester police detective patrick maguire they help lead the team that arrest a terrible human trafficker who use opioid to harm in a very violent way his victim thank you both for bring the trafficker to a very strong and swift justice
 where be you guy thank you applause stand up fella thank you thank you

 we ’re also shut down illegal online marketplace and prevent drug that come from china and other country from bypass our border and we ’re get very tough on it it ’ not that we have a choice we do not have a choice we can be nice and we can be soft and weak and you ’re not go to have a country leave so we have to strengthen up and strengthen up our law so that we can do what we have to do we have to stop this from happen

 drug trafficker kill so many thousand of our citizen every year and that ’ why my department of justice will be seek so many much tough penalty than we ’ve ever have and we will be focus on the penalty that i talk about previously for the big pusher the one that be really kill so many people and that penalty be go to be the death penalty applause

 if you look at if you look at other country i’ve get to know the leader of many country and i will not mention name but you know the country i ’m talk about i go around how be your drug problem we do not have much of a drug problem what do you mean you do not have a drug problem well we do n’t have i say how come we have zero tolerance for drug dealer i say what do that mean that mean we have the death penalty for drug dealer we do not have a drug problem

 take a look at some of these country where they do n’t play game they do not have a drug problem we have court case that last 10 year and then they get out at the end we get to be tough we have to be smart we have to change the law and we ’re work on that right now the department of justice be work very very hard on that

 but the ultimate penalty have to be the death penalty now maybe our country be not ready for that it ’ possible it ’ possible that our country be not ready for that and i can understand it maybe although personally i can not understand that but there be people that be good people that be strong smart people and they would differ with most of we but i think unless you do that unless you have really really powerful penalty lead by the death penalty for the really bad pusher and abuser we be go to get nowhere and i ’m tell you we be go to get somewhere

 company must also be hold accountable the department of justice recently create a task force to coordinate investigation and lawsuit against manufacturer and other bad actor that harm our citizen

 and i can tell you that jeff sessions who ’ here with we now feel so strongly about this and they ’re work very hard and very effectively on that and so we appreciate that very much thank you thank you jeff applause thank you

 i can think of nothing more important the third part of our initiative be to get lifesaving help to those who need it we ’re go to make sure our first responder have access to lifesave overdose reverse drug which by the way be amazing

 the president thank you very much

 mr kelly thank you appreciate it applause

 the president thank you mike it ’ amazing generous and i ’ve watch the police and the fire they come around and they ’ve become so good at it but i ’ve see people that be just about dead wake up

 now the problem be they then go back in many case to the drug and they do it again and again and again but we have to work on that we have to work on that very very strongly

 i also want to recommend and commend a richmond base company kaléo for donate more than 300,000 dose of their overdose reverse drug to first responder which have already save more than 5,000 life in a very short period of time

 my administration have make clear that medical provider can share crucial information with family member about an overdose so that their love one can help they get into treatment we need treatment

 we ’re make medically assist treatment more available and affordable and we continue to increase competition and drive down drug price and we ’re drive they down we ’re go to have a major news conference probably at the white house in about a month because all of you people and i ’m talk about prescription drug not necessarily the drug that we ’re talk about here but we pay as a country so much more for drug because of the drug lobby and other reason and the complexity of distribution which be basically another term for say how do we get more money

 and if you compare our drug price to other country in the world in some case it ’ many time high for the exact same pill or whatever it be in the exact same package make in the exact same plant and we ’re go to change that

 and i would like to ask secretary azar just to come up and mention opioid but also talk about how we ’re get your drug price down and we ’ve already save billion of dollar for our country and it ’s reflect in much low drug price watch what ’s go to happen over a short period of time this man be one of the great professional run an incredibly successful drug company who know well than the guy run the drug company eli lilly that ’ your company right or be

 secretary azar it be

 the president now you ’re on the other side though so nobody know well the most respected man in that industry and we get he to work because he love our country

 would you tell they a little bit about what you have plan for drug price and also opioid in term of stoppage please secretary applause

 secretary azar well thank you mr. president and you know you ’ve do a lot already to tackle this issue of drug pricing so last year the fda approve more generic drug than it ever have in its history and that bring price down for patient for the system for everybody applause

 the president great

 secretary azar you also change the rule so our senior citizen pay less out of pocket for their drug that ’s $ 3.2 billion that they ’re pay less out of pocket for their drug when they go to the pharmacy applause

 and then we ’re go to be roll out as you mention in about a month a whole slate of other proposal around how we decrease the price of drug and how we bring discount that the middleman right now be get how those will go to our patient to individual

 now we ’re attack this with the same level of action determination and resolve that you ’re bre to the opioid crisis and that ’s where we ’re focus on prevention and get that one third few illegal opioid prescription to our people the second be the stop the illicit flow of these opioid into our country and the third be compassionate treatment for people evidence base science base compassionate treatment that can help people recover and stay away from relapse

 so thank you mr. president for your leadership applause

 the president thank you alex you ’ll be see drug price fall very substantially in the not too distant future and it ’s go to be beautiful
 and i want to thank also scott gottlieb scott be work on different thing but one of they be call right to try do you know what right to try be these be for people that be terminally ill and there be very very good look combination of thing or pill medicine potential cure and they ’re terminal and they ’re not go to be live much long and we do not have the right to give they these experimental drug or these early stage drug that really show promise for whatever reason but they say because they do not want to harm somebody if you can believe it they do not want to harm so the people will oftentime go to foreign land foreign country they ’ll do anything they want hope they want hope right to try

 so we ’re work with congressman greg walden and numerous other senator and congressman and i think we ’re go to have good luck the democrats have be push back on it but i think many of they be also come along it ’s call right to try a patient be terminal there ’s good progress make with a certain drug we ’re go to make it possible for that patient to get that drug and maybe it ’s go to work it ’ hope it ’ incredible they ’ve be talk about this for year and year and year we ’re go to get it approve so important all right applause

 to far expand treatment i ’m also call on congress to change the restrictive 1970s era law that prevent medicaid from pay for care at certain treatment facility with more than 16 bed it ’ such an important factor

 in the meantime my administration be grant waiver to state so they can help people who need treatment now governor

 we ’re also go to help inmate leave prison get treatment so they can have a second chance to become productive law abide citizen and what we ’ve really do for the inmate you know it ’ very hard for they to get out of jail and get a job

 what we ’ve really do for they well than anything we can sign any legislation that we can pass demand that you hire we’re get a great economy it have not be this good in many many year some people say it ’s never be this good

 and what ’s happen be as you see unemployment be way down and people be start to hire inmate and the result be incredible some of these employer be call up say wow what great people we ’re give they a second chance it ’ very very important so the tremendous economy be help we very much with that program

 we want every american—(applause)—thank you we want every american to be able to be able to reach their full god give potential and we will succeed together as one people one nation and one great american family because americans never give in and we never ever give up this group never give up right never give up your boy applause

 we have pass the big tax cut and reform in american history we ’ve start the construction of a major border wall and we have greatly strengthen border security

 we have secure record funding for our military—$700 billion this year and $ 716 billion next year our military will soon be more powerful than it have ever be before

 in other word the united states be strong safe and a rich country than it be when i assume office less than two year ago

 we be stand up for america and for the american people and we be also stand up for the world

 this be great news for our citizen and for peace love people everywhere we believe that when nation respect the right of their neighbor and defend the interest of their people they can well work together to secure the blessing of safety prosperity and peace

 each of we here today be the emissary of a distinct culture a rich history and a people bind together by tie of memory tradition and the value that make our homeland like nowhere else on earth

 that be why america will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance control and domination

 i honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own custom belief and tradition the united states will not tell you how to live or work or worship

 we only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return

 from warsaw to brussels to tokyo to singapore it have be my high honor to represent the united states abroad i have forge close relationship and friendship and strong partnership with the leader of many nation in this room and our approach have already yield incredible change

 with support from many country here today we have engage with north korea to replace the specter of conflict with a bold and new push for peace

 in june i travel to singapore to meet face to face with north korea ’s leader chairman kim jong un

 we have highly productive conversation and meeting and we agree that it be in both country interest to pursue the denuclearization of the korean peninsula since that meeting we have already see a number of encourage measure that few could have imagine only a short time ago

 the missile and rocket be no long fly in every direction nuclear testing have stop some military facility be already be dismantle our hostage have be release and as promise the remain of our fall hero be be return home to lay at rest in american soil

 i would like to thank chairman kim for his courage and for the step he have take though much work remain to be do the sanction will stay in place until denuclearization occur

 i also want to thank the many member state who help we reach this moment a moment that be actually far great than people would understand far great but for also their support and the critical support that we will all need go forward

 a special thank to president moon of south korea prime minister abe of japan and president xi of china

 in the middle east our new approach be also yield great stride and very historic change

 follow my trip to saudi arabia last year the gulf country open a new center to target terrorist financing they be enforce new sanction work with we to identify and track terrorist network and take more responsibility for fight terrorism and extremism in their own region

 the uae saudi arabia and qatar have pledge billion of dollar to aid the people of syria and yemen and they be pursue multiple avenue to end yemen ’s horrible horrific civil war

 ultimately it be up to the nation of the region to decide what kind of future they want for themselves and their child

 for that reason the united states be work with the gulf cooperation council jordan and egypt to establish a regional strategic alliance so that middle eastern nation can advance prosperity stability and security across their home region

 thank to the united states military and our partnership with many of your nation i be pleased to report that the bloodthirsty killer know as isis have be drive out from the territory they once hold in iraq and syria we will continue to work with friend and ally to deny radical islamic terrorist any funding territory or support or any mean of infiltrate our border

 the ongoing tragedy in syria be heartbreaking our share goal must be the de escalation of military conflict along with a political solution that honor the will of the syrian people in this vein we urge the united nations lead peace process be reinvigorate but rest assure the united states will respond if chemical weapon be deploy by the assad regime

 i commend the people of jordan and other neighboring country for host refugee from this very brutal civil war

 as we see in jordan the most compassionate policy be to place refugee as close to their home as possible to ease their eventual return to be part of the rebuilding process this approach also stretch finite resource to help far more people increase the impact of every dollar spend

 every solution to the humanitarian crisis in syria must also include a strategy to address the brutal regime that have fuel and finance it the corrupt dictatorship in iran

 iran ’s leader sow chaos death and destruction they do not respect their neighbor or border or the sovereign right of nation instead iran ’s leader plunder the nation ’s resource to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the middle east and far beyond

 the iranian people be rightly outraged that their leader have embezzle billion of dollar from iran ’s treasury seize valuable portion of the economy and loot the people ’s religious endowment all to line their own pocket and send their proxy to wage war not good

 iran ’s neighbor have pay a heavy toll for the region ’s regime ’s agenda of aggression and expansion that be why so many country in the middle east strongly support my decision to withdraw the united states from the horrible 2015 iran nuclear deal and re impose nuclear sanction

 the iran deal be a windfall for iran ’s leader in the year since the deal be reach iran ’s military budget grow nearly 40 percent the dictatorship use the fund to build nuclear capable missile increase internal repression finance terrorism and fund havoc and slaughter in syria and yemen

 the united states have launch a campaign of economic pressure to deny the regime the fund it need to advance its bloody agenda last month we begin re impose hard hit nuclear sanction that have be lift under the iran deal additional sanction will resume november 5th and more will follow and we ’re work with country that import iranian crude oil to cut their purchase substantially

 we can not allow the world ’s lead sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet ’s most dangerous weapon we can not allow a regime that chant death to america and that threaten israel with annihilation to possess the mean to deliver a nuclear warhead to any city on earth just can not do it

 we ask all nation to isolate iran ’s regime as long as its aggression continue and we ask all nation to support iran ’s people as they struggle to reclaim their religious and righteous destiny

 this year we also take another significant step forward in the middle east in recognition of every sovereign state to determine its own capital i move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem

 the united states be commit to a future of peace and stability in the region include peace between the israelis and the palestinians that aim be advance not harm by acknowledge the obvious fact

 america ’s policy of principle realism mean we will not be hold hostage to old dogma discredit ideology and so call expert who have be prove wrong over the year time and time again this be true not only in matter of peace but in matter of prosperity

 we believe that trade must be fair and reciprocal the united states will not be take advantage of any long

 for decade the united states open its economy the large by far on earth with few condition we allow foreign good from all over the world to flow freely across our border

 yet other country do not grant we fair and reciprocal access to their market in return even bad some country abuse their openness to dump their product subsidize their good target our industry and manipulate their currency to gain unfair advantage over our country as a result our trade deficit balloon to nearly $ 800 billion a year

 for this reason we be systematically renegotiate break and bad trade deal

 last month we announce a groundbreake u.s.-mexico trade agreement and just yesterday i stand with president moon to announce the successful completion of the brand new u.s.-korea trade deal and this be just the beginning

 many nation in this hall will agree that the world trading system be in dire need of change for example country be admit to the world trade organization that violate every single principle on which the organization be base while the united states and many other nation play by the rule these country use government run industrial planning and state own enterprise to rig the system in their favor they engage in relentless product dumping force technology transfer and the theft of intellectual property

 the united states lose over 3 million manufacturing job nearly a quarter of all steel job and 60,000 factory after china join the wto and we have rack up $ 13 trillion in trade deficit over the last two decade

 but those day be over we will no long tolerate such abuse we will not allow our worker to be victimize our company to be cheat and our wealth to be plunder and transfer america will never apologize for protect its citizen

 the united states have just announce tariff on another $ 200 billion in chinese make good for a total so far of $ 250 billion i have great respect and affection for my friend president xi but i have make clear our trade imbalance be just not acceptable china ’s market distortion and the way they deal can not be tolerate

 as my administration have demonstrate america will always act in our national interest

 i speak before this body last year and warn that the u.n. human rights council have become a grave embarrassment to this institution shield egregious human right abuser while bash america and its many friend

 our ambassador to the united nations nikki haley lay out a clear agenda for reform but despite report and repeat warning no action at all be take

 so the united states take the only responsible course we withdraw from the human rights council and we will not return until real reform be enact

 for similar reason the united states will provide no support in recognition to the international criminal court as far as america be concern the icc have no jurisdiction no legitimacy and no authority the icc claim near universal jurisdiction over the citizen of every country violate all principle of justice fairness and due process we will never surrender america ’s sovereignty to an unelected unaccountable global bureaucracy

 america be govern by americans we reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism

 around the world responsible nation must defend against threat to sovereignty not just from global governance but also from other new form of coercion and domination

 in america we believe strongly in energy security for ourselves and for our ally we have become the large energy producer anywhere on the face of the earth

 the united states stand ready to export our abundant affordable supply of oil clean coal and natural gas

 opec and opec nation be as usual rip off the rest of the world and i do n’t like it nobody should like it we defend many of these nation for nothing and then they take advantage of we by give we high oil price not good

 we want they to stop raise price we want they to start lower price and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on we be not go to put up with it these horrible price much long

 reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation that be why we congratulate european state such as poland for lead the construction of a baltic pipeline so that nation be not dependent on russia to meet their energy need germany will become totally dependent on russian energy if it do not immediately change course

 here in the western hemisphere we be commit to maintain our independence from the encroachment of expansionist foreign power

 it have be the formal policy of our country since president monroe that we reject the interference of foreign nation in this hemisphere and in our own affair the united states have recently strengthen our law to well screen foreign investment in our country for national security threat and we welcome cooperation with country in this region and around the world that wish to do the same you need to do it for your own protection

 the united states be also work with partner in latin america to confront threat to sovereignty from uncontrolled migration tolerance for human struggling and human smuggling and trafficking be not humane it ’ a horrible thing that ’s go on at level that nobody have ever see before it ’ very very cruel

 illegal immigration fund criminal network ruthless gang and the flow of deadly drug illegal immigration exploit vulnerable population hurt hardworke citizen and have produce a vicious cycle of crime violence and poverty only by uphold national border destroy criminal gang can we break this cycle and establish a real foundation for prosperity

 we recognize the right of every nation in this room to set its own immigration policy in accordance with its national interest just as we ask other country to respect our own right to do the same which we be do that be one reason the united states will not participate in the new global compact on migration migration should not be govern by an international body unaccountable to our own citizen

 ultimately the only long term solution to the migration crisis be to help people build more hopeful future in their home country make their country great again

 currently we be witness a human tragedy as an example in venezuela more than 2 million people have flee the anguish inflict by the socialist maduro regime and its cuban sponsor

 not long ago venezuela be one of the rich country on earth today socialism have bankrupt the oil rich nation and drive its people into abject poverty

 virtually everywhere socialism or communism have be try it have produce suffering corruption and decay socialism ’s thirst for power lead to expansion incursion and oppression all nation of the world should resist socialism and the misery that it bring to everyone

 in that spirit we ask the nation gather here to join we in call for the restoration of democracy in venezuela today we be announce additional sanction against the repressive regime target maduro ’s inner circle and close advisor

 we be grateful for all the work the united nations do around the world to help people build well life for themselves and their family

 the united states be the world ’s large giver in the world by far of foreign aid but few give anything to we that be why we be take a hard look at u.s. foreign assistance that will be head up by secretary of state mike pompeo we will examine what be work what be not work and whether the country who receive our dollar and our protection also have our interest at heart

 move forward we be only go to give foreign aid to those who respect we and frankly be our friend and we expect other country to pay their fair share for the cost of their defense

 the united states be committed to make the united nations more effective and accountable i have say many time that the united nations have unlimited potential as part of our reform effort i have tell our negotiator that the united states will not pay more than 25 percent of the u.n. peacekeeping budget this will encourage other country to step up get involve and also share in this very large burden

 and we be work to shift more of our funding from assess contribution to voluntary so that we can target american resource to the program with the good record of success

 only when each of we do our part and contribute our share can we realize the u.n. ’s high aspiration we must pursue peace without fear hope without despair and security without apology

 look around this hall where so much history have transpire we think of the many before we who have come here to address the challenge of their nation and of their time and our thought turn to the same question that run through all their speech and resolution through every word and every hope it be the question of what kind of world will we leave for our child and what kind of nation they will inherit

 the dream that fill this hall today be as diverse as the people who have stand at this podium and as varied as the country represent right here in this body be it really be something it really be great great history

 there be india a free society over a billion people successfully lift countless million out of poverty and into the middle class

 there be saudi arabia where king salman and the crown prince be pursue bold new reform

 there be israel proudly celebrate its 70th anniversary as a thriving democracy in the holy land

 in poland a great people be stand up for their independence their security and their sovereignty

 many country be pursue their own unique vision build their own hopeful future and chase their own wonderful dream of destiny of legacy and of a home

 the whole world be rich humanity be well because of this beautiful constellation of nation each very special each very unique and each shine brightly in its part of the world

 in each one we see awesome promise of a people bind together by a share past and work toward a common future

 as for americans we know what kind of future we want for ourselves we know what kind of a nation america must always be

 in america we believe in the majesty of freedom and the dignity of the individual we believe in self government and the rule of law and we prize the culture that sustain our liberty a culture build on strong family deep faith and fierce independence we celebrate our hero we treasure our tradition and above all we love our country

 inside everyone in this great chamber today and everyone listen all around the globe there be the heart of a patriot that feel the same powerful love for your nation the same intense loyalty to your homeland

 the passion that burn in the heart of patriot and the soul of nation have inspire reform and revolution sacrifice and selflessness scientific breakthrough and magnificent work of art

 our task be not to erase it but to embrace it to build with it to draw on its ancient wisdom and to find within it the will to make our nation great our region safe and the world well

 to unleash this incredible potential in our people we must defend the foundation that make it all possible sovereign and independent nation be the only vehicle where freedom have ever survive democracy have ever endure or peace have ever prosper and so we must protect our sovereignty and our cherished independence above all

 when we do we will find new avenue for cooperation unfold before we we will find new passion for peacemake rise within we we will find new purpose new resolve and new spirit flourish all around we and make this a more beautiful world in which to live

 so together let we choose a future of patriotism prosperity and pride let we choose peace and freedom over domination and defeat and let we come here to this place to stand for our people and their nation forever strong forever sovereign forever just and forever thankful for the grace and the goodness and the glory of god

 thank you god bless you and god bless the nation of the world

 thank you very much thank you applause

the president just a short time ago i have the honor of preside over the swearing in of five new great american citizen it be a beautiful ceremony and a move reminder of our nation ’s proud history of welcome legal immigrant from all over the world into our national family

 i tell they that the beauty and majesty of citizenship be that it draw no distinction of race or class or faith or gender or background all americans whether first generation or tenth generation be bind together in love and loyalty friendship and affection

 we be all equal we be one team and one people proudly salute one great american flag we believe in a safe and lawful system of immigration one that uphold our law our tradition and our most cherished value

 unfortunately our immigration system have be badly break for a very long time over the decade many president and many lawmaker have come and go and no real progress have be make on immigration

 we be now live with the consequence and they be tragic bring about by decade of political stalemate partisan gridlock and national neglect

 there be a humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border that require urgent action thousand of child be be exploit by ruthless coyote and vicious cartel and gang one in three woman be sexually assault on the dangerous journey north in fact many love mother give their young daughter birth control pill for the long journey up to the united states because they know they may be rape or sexually accosted or assault nearly 50 migrant a day be be refer for urgent medical care

 vast quantity of lethal narcotic be flood through our border and into our community include meth cocaine heroin and fentanyl drug kill 78,000 americans a year and cost our society in excess of $ 700 billion heroin alone kill 300 americans a week 90 percent of which come across our southern border we can stop heroin

 illegal immigration reduce wage and strain public service the lack of border control provide a gateway and a very wide and open gateway for criminal and gang member to enter the united states include the criminal alien who murder a brave california police officer only a day after christmas

 i ’ve get to know and love angel mom dad and family who lose love one to people illegally in our country i want this to end it ’s get to end now these be not talk point these be the heartbreaking reality that be hurt innocent precious human being every single day on both side of the border

 as a candidate for president i promise i would fix this crisis and i intend to keep that promise one way or the other our immigration system should be the subject of pride not a source of shame as it be all over the world our immigration system should be the envy of the world not a symbol of disunity and dysfunction

 the good news be these problem can all be solve but only if we have the political courage to do what be just and what be right

 both side in washington must simply come together listen to each other put down their armor build trust reach across the aisle and find solution

 it be time to reclaim our future from the extreme voice who fear compromise and demand open border which mean drug pour in human trafficking and a lot of crime

 that be why i be here today to break the logjam and provide congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis on the southern border if we be successful in this effort we will then have the good chance in a very long time at real bipartisan immigration reform and it will not stop here it will keep go until we do it all

 the proposal i will outline today be base on first and foremost on input from our border agent and homeland security professional and professional they be they know what they ’re do it be a compassionate response to the ongoing tragedy on our southern border

 in recent week we have meet with large number of democrat lawmaker to hear their idea and suggestion by incorporate the priority of rank and file democrats in our plan we hope they will offer their enthusiastic support and i think many will

 this be a commonsense compromise both party should embrace the radical left can never control our border i will never let it happen wall be not immoral in fact they be the opposite of immoral because they will save many life and stop drug from pour into our country

 our plan include the follow $ 800 million in urgent humanitarian assistance $ 805 million for drug detection technology to help secure our port of entry an additional 2,750 border agent and law enforcement professional 75 new immigration judge team to reduce the court backlog of believe it or not almost 900,000 case however the whole concept of have lengthy trial for anyone who set one foot in our country unlawfully must be change by congress it be unsustainable it be ridiculous few place in the world would even consider such an impossible nightmare

 our plan include critical measure to protect migrant child from exploitation and abuse this include a new system to allow central american minor to apply for asylum in their home country and reform to promote family reunification for unaccompanied child thousand of whom wind up on our border doorstep

 to physically secure our border the plan include $ 5.7 billion for a strategic deployment of physical barrier or a wall this be not a 2,000 mile concrete structure from sea to sea these be steel barrier in high priority location much of the border be already protect by natural barrier such as mountain and water we already have many mile of barrier include 115 mile that we be currently build or under contract   it will be do quickly   our request will add another 230 mile this year in the area our border agent most urgently need   it will have an unbelievable impact

 if we build a powerful and fully design see through steel barrier on our southern border the crime rate and drug problem in our country would be quickly and greatly reduce   some say it could be cut in half   because these criminal drug smuggler gang and trafficker do not stop at our border they permeate throughout our country and they end up in some place where you ’d least expect they they go all over our country a steel barrier will help we stop illegal immigration while safely direct commerce to our lawful port of entry

 many of these security idea have be propose by democrats themselves and all of they have be support by democrats in the past include a physical barrier wall or fence

 furthermore in order to build the trust and goodwill necessary to begin real immigration reform there be two more element to my plan

 number one be three year of legislative relief for 700,000 daca recipient bring here unlawfully by their parent at a young age many year ago this extension will give they access to work permit social security number and protection from deportation most importantly

 secondly our proposal provide a three year extension of temporary protected status or tps this mean that 300,000 immigrant whose protect status be face expiration will now have three more year of certainty so that congress can work on a large immigration deal which everybody want republicans and democrats and our farmer and vineyard will not be affect because lawful and regulated entry into our country will be easy and consistent

 that be our plan border security daca tps and many other thing straightforward fair reasonable and common sense with lot of compromise senate majority leader mitch mcconnell have pledge to bring this bill to a vote this week in the united states senate

 our proposal be not intend to solve all of our immigration challenge this plan solve the immediate crisis and it be a horrible crisis it be a humanitarian crisis like we rarely see in our country and it provide humanitarian relief deliver real border security and immediately reopen our federal government

 if we be successful in this effort then we can start the border broad project of remake our immigration system for the 21st century once the government be open and we have make a down payment on border security and immigration reform start to happen i plan to convene weekly bipartisan meeting at the white house so we can do a finished product a great product a product that we can all be proud of have to do with that elusive immigration problem

 whatever we do i can promise you this i will never forget that my first duty and ultimate loyalty be to you the american people any reform we make to our immigration system will be design to improve your life make your community safe and make our nation more prosperous and secure for generation to come

 thank you and god bless america   thank you

 on friday it be announce that we add another 304,000 job last month alone almost double what be expect an economic miracle be take place in the united states and the only thing that can stop it be foolish war politic or ridiculous partisan investigation

 if there be go to be peace and legislation there can not be war and investigation it just do not work that way

 this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirm the more than 300 highly qualified nominee who be still stick in the senate some after year of waiting the senate have fail to act on these nomination which be unfair to the nominee and to our country

 tonight i be ask you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizen and to our country

 no issue well illustrate the divide between america ’s work class and america ’s political class than illegal immigration wealthy politician and donor push for open border while live their life behind wall and gate and guard

 meanwhile work class americans be leave to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduce job low wage overburden school and hospital increase crime and a deplete social safety net

 tolerance for illegal immigration be not compassionate it be cruel one in three woman be sexually assault on the long journey north smuggler use migrant child as human pawn to exploit our law and gain access to our country

 human trafficker and sex trafficker take advantage of the wide open area between our port of entry to smuggle thousand of young girl and woman into the united states and to sell they into prostitution and modern day slavery

 in the last 2 year our brave ice officer make 266,000 arrest of criminal alien include those charge or convict of nearly 100,000 assault 30,000 sex crime and 4,000 killing

 we be join tonight by one of those law enforcement hero ice special agent elvin hernandez when elvin be a boy he and his family legally immigrate to the united states from the dominican republic at the age of eight elvin tell his dad he want to become a special agent today he lead investigation into the scourge of international sex trafficking elvin say   if i can make sure these young girl get their justice i ’ve do my job thank to his work and that of his colleague more than 300 woman and girl have be rescue from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic trafficker have be put behind bar in the last year

 special agent hernandez please stand we will always support the brave man and woman of law enforcement and i pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our hero from ice

 my administration have send to the congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border

 it include humanitarian assistance more law enforcement drug detection at our port close loophole that enable child smuggling and plan for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast area between our port of entry in the past most of the people in this room vote for a wall but the proper wall never get build i ’ll get it build

 this be a smart strategic see through steel barrier not just a simple concrete wall it will be deploy in the area identify by border agent as have the great need and as these agent will tell you where wall go up illegal crossing go way down

 san diego use to have the most illegal border crossing in the country in response and at the request of san diego resident and political leader a strong security wall be put in place this powerful barrier almost completely end illegal crossing

 the border city of el paso texas use to have extremely high rate of violent crime one of the high in the country and consider one of our nation ’s most dangerous city now with a powerful barrier in place el paso be one of our safe city

 simply put wall work and wall save life so let ’s work together compromise and reach a deal that will truly make america safe

 as we work to defend our people ’s safety we must also ensure our economic resurgence continue at a rapid pace

 no one have benefit more from our thrive economy than woman who have fill 58 percent of the new job create in the last year all americans can be proud that we have more woman in the workforce than ever before and exactly one century after the congress pass the constitutional amendment give woman the right to vote we also have more woman serve in the congress than ever before

 as part of our commitment to improve opportunity for woman everywhere this thursday we be launch the first ever government wide initiative focus on economic empowerment for woman in develop country

 to build on our incredible economic success one priority be paramount reverse decade of calamitous trade policy

 we be now make it clear to china that after year of target our industry and steal our intellectual property the theft of american job and wealth have come to an end

 therefore we recently impose tariff on $ 250 billion of chinese good and now our treasury be receive billion of dollar a month from a country that never give we a dime but i do not blame china for take advantage of we i blame our leader and representative for allow this travesty to happen i have great respect for president xi and we be now work on a new trade deal with china but it must include real structural change to end unfair trade practice reduce our chronic trade deficit and protect american job

 another historic trade blunder be the catastrophe know as nafta

 i have meet the man and woman of michigan ohio pennsylvania indiana new hampshire and many other state whose dream be shatter by nafta for year politician promise they they would negotiate for a well deal but no one ever try until now

 our new u.s.-mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american worker bring back our manufacturing job expand american agriculture protect intellectual property and ensure that more car be proudly stamp with four beautiful word make in the usa

 tonight i be also ask you to pass the united states reciprocal trade act so that if another country place an unfair tariff on an american product we can charge they the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to we

 both party should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of america ’s crumble infrastructure

 i know that the congress be eager to pass an infrastructure bill and i be eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment include investment in the cutting edge industry of the future this be not an option this be a necessity

 the next major priority for i and for all of we should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drug and to protect patient with pre existing condition

 already as a result of my administration ’s effort in 2018 drug price experience their single large decline in 46 year

 but we must do more it be unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other country for the exact same drug often make in the exact same place this be wrong unfair and together we can stop it

 i be ask the congress to pass legislation that finally take on the problem of global freeloading and deliver fairness and price transparency for american patient we should also require drug company insurance company and hospital to disclose real price to foster competition and bring cost down

 no force in history have do more to advance the human condition than american freedom in recent year we have make remarkable progress in the fight against hiv and aids scientific breakthrough have bring a once distant dream within reach my budget will ask democrats and republicans to make the need commitment to eliminate the hiv epidemic in the united states within 10 year together we will defeat aids in america

 tonight i be also ask you to join i in another fight that all americans can get behind the fight against childhood cancer

 joining melania in the gallery this evening be a very brave 10 year old girl grace eline every birthday since she be 4 grace ask her friend to donate to st. jude children ’s research hospital she do not know that one day she might be a patient herself last year grace be diagnose with brain cancer immediately she begin radiation treatment at the same time she rally her community and raise more than $ 40,000 for the fight against cancer when grace complete treatment last fall her doctor and nurse cheer with tear in their eye as she hang up a poster that read last day of chemo grace you be an inspiration to we all

 many childhood cancer have not see new therapy in decade my budget will ask the congress for $ 500 million over the next 10 year to fund this critical life save research

 to help support work parent the time have come to pass school choice for america ’s child i be also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide pay family leave so that every new parent have the chance to bond with their newborn child

 there could be no great contrast to the beautiful image of a mother hold her infant child than the chill display our nation see in recent day lawmaker in new york cheer with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be rip from the mother ’s womb moment before birth these be live feel beautiful baby who will never get the chance to share their love and dream with the world and then we have the case of the governor of virginia where he basically state he would execute a baby after birth

 to defend the dignity of every person i be ask the congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late term abortion of child who can feel pain in the mother ’s womb

 let we work together to build a culture that cherish innocent life and let we reaffirm a fundamental truth all child bear and unborn be make in the holy image of god

 the final part of my agenda be to protect america ’s national security

 over the last 2 year we have begin to fully rebuild the united states military with $ 700 billion last year and $ 716 billion this year we be also get other nation to pay their fair share for year the united states be be treat very unfairly by nato but now we have secure a $ 100 billion increase in defense spending from nato ally

 as part of our military build up the united states be develop a state of the art missile defense system

 under my administration we will never apologize for advance america ’s interest

 for example decade ago the united states enter into a treaty with russia in which we agree to limit and reduce our missile capability while we follow the agreement to the letter russia repeatedly violate its term that be why i announce that the united states be officially withdraw from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty or inf treaty

 perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement add china and other or perhaps we can’t–-in which case we will outspend and out innovate all other by far

 as part of a bold new diplomacy we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula our hostage have come home nuclear testing have stop and there have not be a missile launch in 15 month if i have not be elect president of the united states we would right now in my opinion be in a major war with north korea with potentially million of people kill much work remain to be do but my relationship with kim jong un be a good one and chairman kim and i will meet again on february 27 and 28 in vietnam

 two week ago the united states officially recognize the legitimate government of venezuela and its new interim president juan guaido

 we stand with the venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom and we condemn the brutality of the maduro regime whose socialist policy have turn that nation from be the wealthy in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair

 here in the united states we be alarm by new call to adopt socialism in our country america be found on liberty and independence–-not government coercion domination and control we be bear free and we will stay free tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country

 one of the most complex set of challenge we face be in the middle east

 our approach be base on principled realism not discredit theory that have fail for decade to yield progress for this reason my administration recognize the true capital of israel and proudly open the american embassy in jerusalem

 thank you god bless you god bless america and good night




the president   thank you very much everybody   before we begin i ’d like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in china   we ’ve have a negotiation go on for about two day   it ’s go extremely well   who know what that mean because it only matter if we get it do   but we ’re very much work very closely with china and president xi who i respect a lot   very good relationship that we have   and we ’re a lot close than we ever be in this country with have a real trade deal

 we ’re cover everything all of the point that people have be talk about for year that say could not be do whether it be theft or anything   anything   the unfairness   we ’ve be lose on average $ 375 billion a year with china   a lot of people think it ’ $ 506 billion   some people think it ’ much more than that   we ’re go to be level the playing field

 the tariff be hurt china very badly   they do not want they   and frankly if we can make the deal it ’d be my honor to remove they   but otherwise we ’re have many billion of dollar pour into our treasury   we ’ve never have that before with china   it ’s be very much of a one way street

 so that ’s happen   and the relationship with china be very good but i think they finally respect our country   they have not respect we for a long time   not for a long time

 the uk and the u.s. as you probably have be see and hearing we ’re agree to go forward and preserve our trade agreement   you know all of the situation with respect to brexit and the complexity and the problem   but we have a very good trading relationship with the uk and that ’s just be strengthen far

 so with the uk we ’re continue our trade and we be go to actually be increase it very substantially as time go by   we expect that the uk will be very very substantially increase as it relate to trade with the united states   the relationship there also be very good

 we have a lot of great announcement have to do with syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate   and that will be announce over the next 24 hour   and many other thing   a lot of positive thing be go on

 we ’re work on a summit   and you know all about the summit   it will be in vietnam hanoi   and we will we ’ll be meet in hanoi   we ’ll be meet in hanoi   i think a lot of you will be go i suspect   and i hope we have the same good luck as we have in the first summit   a lot be do in the first summit   no more rocket go up   no more missile go up   no more testing of nuclear   get back our remain the remain of our great hero from the korean war   and we get back our hostage

 but we hope we ’re go to be very much equally as successful   i ’m in no rush for speed   we just do not want testing   the sanction as you know remain   everything be remain   china have be help we and russia have be help we   and south korea i think you can say have be we ’ve be work very closely with south korea with japan

 but china russia on the border have really be at least partially live up to what they ’re suppose to be do   and that ’ okay as per the united nations

 so we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of february and i think that will be a very successful one   i look forward to see chairman kim   we have also establish a very good relationship which have never happen between he or his family and the united states   they have really take advantage of the united states   billion of dollar have be pay to they   and we will not let that happen

 but we think that north korea and chairman kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force economic power   their location between south korea and then russia and china right smack in the middle be phenomenal

 and we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future   so i look forward to see chairman kim in vietnam

 today i ’m announce several critical action that my administration have take to confront a problem that we have right here at home   we fight war that be 6,000 mile away war that we should have never be in in many case   but we do not control our own border

 so we ’re go to confront the national security crisis on our southern border   and we ’re go to do it one way or the other we have to do it not because it be a campaign promise which it be   it be one of many by the way not my only one   we ’re rebuild the military our economy be thrive like never before

 you look at other economy they ’re do terribly and we ’re do phenomenally   the market be up tremendously today not that that ’ anything but you know because i ’ll go back in and they ’ll say oh the market just go down   but the market be get close to the new high that we create   we have all the record   we have every record   but we ’re get close to that point again where we ’ll create new record

 so our country be do very well economically   and we ’ve do a lot   but one of the thing i say i have to do and i want to do be border security because we have tremendous amount of drug flow into our country much of it come from the southern border   when you look and when you listen to politician in particular certain democrats they say it all come through the port of entry   it ’ wrong   it ’ wrong   it ’ just a lie   it ’ all a lie

 they say wall do n’t work   wall work 100 percent   whether it ’s el paso i really be smile because the other night i be in el paso we have a tremendous crowd and tremendous crowd   and i ask the people many of whom be from el paso but they come from all over texas   and i ask they   i say let i ask you as a crowd when the wall go up be it well   you be there some of you   it be not only well it be like 100 percent well   you know what they do

 but that ’ only one example   there be so many example   in el paso they have close to 2,000 murder right on the other side of the wall   and they have 23 murder   it ’ a lot of murder but it ’ not close to 2,000 murder right on the other side of the wall in mexico

 so everyone know that wall work   and there be well example than el paso frankly   you just take a look   almost everywhere   take a look at israel   they ’re build another wall   their wall be 99.9 percent effective they tell i 99.9 percent   that ’ what it would be with we too

 the only weakness be they go to a wall and then they go around the wall   they go around the wall and in   okay   that ’ what it be   it ’ very simple   and a big majority of the big drug the big drug load do not go through port of entry   they can not go through port of entry   you can not take big load because you have people we have some very capable people the border patrol law enforcement look

 you can not take human traffic woman and girl you can not take they through port of entry   you can not have they tie up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van   they open the door   they look   they can not see three woman with tape on their mouth or three woman whose hand be tie

 they go through area where you have no wall   everybody know that   nancy know it   chuck know it   they all know it   it ’ all a big lie   it ’ a big con game

 you do not have to be very smart to know you put up a barrier the people come in and that ’s it   they can not do anything unless they walk left or right and they find an area where there ’s no barrier and they come into the united states   welcome

 we ’ve detain more people   our border agent be do such incredible work   our military have be incredible   we put up barbed wire on top of certain old wall that be there   we fix the wall and we load it up with barbed wire   it ’ very successful

 but our military have be fantastic and i want to thank they   and it ’ very necessary   we ’ve break up two caravan that be on their way   they just be break   they ’re in the process of break up   we have another one that we have n’t be able to break up yet

 we ’ve be actually work with mexico much well than ever before   i want to thank the president   i want to thank mexico   they have their own problem   they have the large number of murder that they ’ve ever have in their history almost 40,000 murder   forty thousand   and they get to straighten that out and i think they will

 but i just want to thank the president because he ’s be help we with these monstrous caravan that have be come up   we have one that it be up to over 15,000 people   it ’s largely break up   other have get through   and in tijuana you have a lot of people stay there   if we do n’t have the wall up and if we do n’t have the wall secure and strengthen they would have walk right through they ’d be welcome to the united states

 one of the thing we ’d save tremendous just a tremendous amount on would be send the military   if we have a wall we do not need the military because we ’d have a wall

 so i ’m go to be sign a national emergency   and it ’s be sign many time before   it ’s be sign by other president from 1977 or so   it give the president the power

 there ’s rarely be a problem   they sign it nobody care   i guess they be not very exciting   but nobody care   they sign it for far less important thing in some case in many case   we ’re talk about an invasion of our country with drug with human trafficker with all type of criminal and gang

 we have some of the great people i know   they ’ve be with i from the beginning of my campaign almost from the first week   the angel moms   unfortunately we have new angel moms   one incredible woman just show i her daughter who we ’re talk about kill in the year of 18   i say i have not see you before   she say no i ’m new   i say that ’ too bad   it ’ too bad   it ’ so sad

 stand up just for a second   show how beautiful your girl be   thank you

 i have such respect for these people   angel moms angel dads angel families   i have great respect for these people   these be great people   these be great people   they ’re fight for their child that have be kill by people that be illegally in this country

 and the press do not cover they they do not want to incredibly   and they ’re not treat the way they should be   they ’re fight for other people because they do not want what happen to their child or husband or anybody

 we have one young lady whose husband please stand up   your husband be just kill in maryland   incredible man   just kill   beautiful child will not be see their father again

 these be brave people   these be people that they do not have to be here   they do not have to be do this   they ’re do it for other people   so i just want to thank all of you for be here okay   i really do   i want to thank you   incredible people

 last year 70,000 americans be kill at least i think the number be ridiculously low by drug include meth and heroin and cocaine fentanyl   and one of the thing that i do with president xi in china when i meet he in argentina at a summit before i even start talk about the trade it be a trade meeting   it go very well but before i talk about trade i talk about something more important

 i say listen we have tremendous amount of fentanyl come into our country   it kill ten of thousand of people i think far more than anybody register   and i ’d love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list   and their criminal list be much tough than our criminal list   their criminal list a drug dealer get a thing call the death penalty   our criminal list a drug dealer get a thing call how about a fine

 and when i ask president xi i say do you have a drug problem   no no no   i say you have 1.4 billion people   what do you mean you have no drug problem   no we do not have a drug problem   i say why death penalty   we give death penalty to people that sell drug   end of problem

 what do we do   we set up blue ribbon committee   lovely man and woman they sit around a table they have lunch they eat they dine and they waste a lot of time   so if we want to get smart we can get smart   you can end the drug problem   you can end it a lot fast than you think

 but president xi have agree to put fentanyl on his list of deadly deadly drug   and it ’ a criminal penalty   and the penalty be death   so that ’s frankly one of the thing i ’m most excited about in our trade deal if you want to know the truth   i think maybe there ’s no more important point

 we ’re go to make billion of dollar with this trade deal   it ’s go to be great for our country and great for china i hope   their market be down close to 40 percent   our market be way up   we ’ve pick up since my election trillion of dollar of worth   trillion   many trillion   and china have lose trillion of dollar   but i want it to be good for china and i want it to be good for the united states   so we ’ll see what happen

 china be come here next week by the way   they ’re come home the trader   and then china be come here next week   and then i ’ll be meet with president xi at some point after that to maybe for some remain deal   we ’ll make they directly one on one ourselves

 so we ’re go to be sign today and registering national emergency   and it ’ a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drug invasion of gang invasion of people and it ’ unacceptable

 and by sign the national emergency something sign many time by other president many many time   president obama in fact we may be use one of the national emergency that he sign have to do with cartel   criminal cartel   it ’ a very good emergency that he sign   and we ’re go to use part of it in our dealing on cartel   so that would be a second national emergency   but in that case it ’ already in place

 and what we want really want to do be simple   it ’ not like it ’s complicated   it ’ very simple we want to stop drug from come into our country   we want to stop criminal and gang from come into our country   nobody have do the job that we ’ve ever do   i mean nobody have do the job that we ’ve do on the border

 and in a way what i do by create such a great economy and if the oppose party get in this economy would be down the tube   you know i hear a lot of people say oh well   but maybe the previous administration   let i tell you the previous administration it be head south and it be go fast   we would have be down the tube   the regulation be strangle our country   unnecessary regulation

 by create such a strong economy you just look at your television or see what ’s go on today it ’ through the roof   what happen be more people want to come so we have far more people try to get into our country today than probably we ’ve ever have before   and we ’ve do an incredible job in stop they but it ’ a massive number of people

 if we have the wall it would be very easy   we would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that i would be able to have few people   we would not need all of this incredible talent some of whom be sit in the first row   you would not need all of this incredible talent   we would get we would get thousand of law enforcement people include border patrol   you put they in different area you have they do different thing   law enforcement and border patrol

 and i want to thank law enforcement and i want to thank border patrol and i want to thank ice   ice be abuse by the press and by the democrats   and by the way we ’re go to be take care of ice   you know we talk about the new bill   we ’re go to be take care of ice   they want to get rid of ice   and the bill be just the opposite of that   a lot of good thing happen

 so that ’s the story   we want to have a safe country   i run on a very simple slogan make america great again   if you ’re go to have drug pour across the border if you ’re go to have human trafficker pour across the border in area where we have no protection in area where we do not have a barrier then very hard to make america great again

 but we ’ve do a fantastic job but we have n’t be give the equipment   we have n’t be give the wall   and in the bill by the way they do not even fight we on most of the stuff   port of entry   we have so much money we do not know what to do with it   i do not know what to do with all the money they ’re give we   it ’ crazy

 the only place they do not want to give as much money $ 1,375,000,000   sound like a lot but it ’s not so much although we ’re put it to much well use than it use to be   a lot of the past administration they have it be easy to get and they do not build or they do n’t do what they could have do   it would have be great   it would have be great to have do it early but i be a little new to the job a little new to the profession

 and we have a little disappointment for the first year and a half   people that should have step up do not step up   they do not step up and they should have   would have be easy   not that easy but it would have be a lot easy   but some people do not step up   but we ’re step up now

 so we have a chance of get close to $ 8 billion   whether it ’s $ 8 billion or $ 2 billion or $ 1.5 billion it ’s go to build a lot of wall   we ’re get it do   we ’re right now in construction with wall in some of the most important area   and we have renovate a tremendous amount of wall make it just as good as new   that ’s where a lot of the money have be spend on renovation   in fact we be restrict to renovating which be okay   but we ’re go to run out of area that we can renovate pretty soon   so and we need new wall

 so i want to thank everybody for be here   i want to thank in particular the angel moms and dads for be here   thank you very much   we have great respect for you   the real country our real country the people that really love our country they love you   so i just want you to know that   i know how hard you fight and i know how hard a fight you ’re have

 i also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do   believe i our country love you and they respect you greatly   and we ’re give you a lot of surplus   we ’re give you surplus military equipment which a lot of people do not like give previous to this administration   but hundred of million of dollar of surplus equipment   and as we get it as you know we send it down   and you have much well protection   but i really appreciate you be here

 so the order be sign   and i ’ll sign the final paper as soon as i get into the oval office   and we will have a national emergency and then we will then be sue and they will sue we in the ninth circuit even though it should not be there   and we will possibly get a bad ruling and then we ’ll get another bad ruling   and then we ’ll end up in the supreme court and hopefully we ’ll get a fair shake   and we ’ll win in the supreme court just like the ban   they sue we in the ninth circuit and we lose and then we lose in the appellate division and then we go to the supreme court and we win

 and it be very interesting because yesterday they be talk about the ban   because we have a ban   it ’ very helpful   madam secretary be that right   without the ban we ’d have a big problem   we have a ban on certain area certain country depend on what ’s go on in the world   and we win

 but somebody say president trump lose on the ban   well he be right i lose at the low court   he he do not say that we ultimately win at the united states supreme court   they do not want to say that   they do not want to go that far   they be say how i lose   the person sit right up here donald trump lose on the ban   yeah i do   and then i lose a second time you should have say that too   and then it go to the supreme court and i win   do not want to take it that far   but we win on the ban and we win on other thing too

 the probably easy one to win be on declare a national emergency because we ’re declare it for virtual invasion purpose drug trafficker and gang   and one of the thing just to finish we have remove thousand of ms-13 gang monster   thousand   they ’re out of this country   we take they out by the thousand   and they be monster

 okay   do you have any question   yeah   john go ahead

 q     mr. president inaudible

 aide   yes we do   there you go

 q     you be prepare   mr. president a lot of the money

 the president   be you say i be prepare

 q     with the microphone and prepare for question

 the president   oh i think you mean i be prepare   i could not believe you say that

 q     laughs   no no no   laughter

 the president   people do not like say that

 q     you be prepare for question

 the president   i be prepare   i ’m always prepare

 q     a lot of the money that go to count toward your $ 8 billion be money that ’s be reprogramme in the dod budget   how can you guarantee to military family and to our man and woman of the military that none of the money that would be reprogramme to a wall will take away from other technology other renovation construction that be desperately need in our military

 the president   yeah   so john we have certain fund that be be use at the discretion of general at the discretion of the military   some of they have not be allocate yet and some of the general think that this be more important   i be speak to a couple of they   they think this be far more important than what they be go to use it for   i say what be you go to use it for   and i will not go into detail but it do not sound too important to i

 plus if you think i ’ve get $ 700 billion for the military in year one and then last year $ 716 billion   and we ’re rebuild our military but we have a lot   and under the previous administration our military be deplete badly deplete   and they be not spend i mean they have a much less they have a much small amount of money

 so when i get $ 700 billion and then $ 716 billion and this year it ’s go to be pretty big too because there ’ few thing more important than our military   you know i ’m a big deficit believer and all of that but before we really start focus on certain thing we have to build up our military   it be very badly deplete   and we ’re buy all new jetfighter all new missile all new defensive equipment   we have we ’ll soon have a military like we ’ve never have before

 but when you think about the kind of number you ’re talk about so you have $ 700 billion $ 716 billion when i need $ 2 billion $ 3 billion of out that for a wall which be a very important instrument very important for the military because of the drug that pour in   and as you know we have specific rule and regulation where they have drug and what you can do in order to stop drug   and that ’ part of it too

 we ’re take a lot of money from that realm also   but when you have that kind of money go into the military this be a very very small amount that we ’re ask for

 yeah go ahead   go ahead   abc   not nbc   i like abc a little bit more not much   come on abc   not much   pretty close

 q     mr. president what do you say to those include some of your republican ally who say that you be violate the constitution with this move and set a bad precedent that will be abuse by possibly democratic presidents in the future   marco rubio have make this point

 the president   well not too many people   yeah   not too many people have say that   but the court will determine that

 look i expect to be sue   i should not be sue   very rarely do you get sue when you do national emergency   and then other people say oh if you use it for this now what be we use it for   we get to get rid of drug and gang and people   it ’ an invasion   we have an invasion of drug and criminal come into our country that we stop but it ’ very hard to stop   with a wall it would be very easy

 so i think that we will be very successful in court   i think it ’ clear   and the people that say we create precedent well what do you have   fifty six   there be a lot of time well that ’s create precedent   and many of those be far less important than have a border   if you do not have a border you do not have a country

 you know we fight before i get here we fight all over the world to create border for country but we do not create a border for our own country

 so i think what will happen be sadly we ’ll be sue and sadly it ’ll go through a process   and happily we ’ll win i think

 go ahead   let ’s go   let ’s hear it nbc   come on

 q     thank you mr. president   i just want to say in the past when president obama try to use executive action as it relate to immigration you say the whole concept of executive order it ’ not the way the country be suppose to be run   you say you ’re suppose to go through congress and make a deal   will you concede that you be unable to make the deal that you have promise in the past and that the deal you ’re end up with now from congress be less than what you could have have before a 35 day shutdown

 the president   no   look i go through congress   i make a deal   i get almost $ 1.4 billion when i be not suppose to get one dollar not one dollar   he ’s not go to get one dollar   well i get $ 1.4 billion   but i ’m not happy with it   i also get billion and billion of dollar for other thing port of entry lot of different thing   the purchase of drug equipment   more than we be even request

 in fact the primary fight be on the wall   everything else we have so much as i say i do not know what to do with it we have so much money   but on the wall they skimp

 so i do i be successful in that sense but i want to do it fast   i could do the wall over a long period of time   i do not need to do this   but i ’d rather do it much fast   and i do not have to do it for the election   i ’ve already do a lot of wall for the election 2020   and the only reason we ’re up here talk about this be because of the election because they want to try and win an election which it look like they ’re not go to be able to do   and this be one of the way they think they can possibly win be by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense

 and i think that i just want to get it do fast that ’s all

 okay   yes ma’am go ahead

 q     thank you mr. president

 the president   thank you

 q     roberta rampton from reuters   i want to ask about china   do you feel that enough progress have be make in the talk to head off the increase in tariff schedule for march 1

 the president   well you know you ’re talk to the wrong person because i happen to like tariff okay   i mean we ’re take in billion and billion of dollar in tariff from china   and our steel industry now as an example we tax dump steel much of it come from china at 25 percent   our steel industry be so vibrant now again they ’re build plant all over the united states   it ’ a beautiful thing   and from a defensive standpoint and from any standpoint you need steel

 you know you can do without certain industry   our country can not do without steel

 so i love tariff but i also love they to negotiate   and right now china be pay we billion of dollar a year in tariff   and i have n’t even start

 now here ’ the thing if we make a deal they will not have to pay   you know it ’ll be a whole different story   they will not be pay that but we ’ll have a fair deal   there will not be intellectual property theft   there will not be so many other thing that have go on   and no other president have do this   no other you know we do not have a deal with china   you have the wto one of the bad trade deal ever make probably even bad than nafta if that ’ believable which you know hard to believe because i think nafta be just a disaster   it be a total disaster for our country

 and now we make the usmca which be go to be a terrific a great deal   and by the way the usmca from mexico that ’s united states mexico canada that ’s where the money be come from not directly but indirectly for the wall   and nobody want to talk about that   because we ’re save billion and billion of dollar a year if congress approve that deal

 now they might now want to approve a deal just because they ’ll say one of the thing i ’m think of do this have never be do before no matter how good a deal i make with china if they sell i beijing for one dollar if they give i 50 percent of their land and every ship that they ’ve build over the last two year which be a lot and they give they to i free the democrats will say what a lousy deal that ’ a terrible deal

 like zte i get a billion more than a billion dollar penalty in a short period of time   and the democrats say oh should ’ve get more   when i make that deal i say this be incredible   i just get i get over a billion dollar penalty plus they have to change their board of director   they have to change their top management   but they have to pay over a billion dollar   i say what a deal   it take like a week   and the democrats do not even know there be a problem with zte

 i ’m the one that find they   i ’m the one that settle it   over a billion dollar   and president xi call i and he say it would be important to he if they could get a deal   and we make a deal pay like in a short period of time

 the democrats go out and say oh they should ’ve do well   so what i ’m think of do be get chuck schumer get nancy pelosi have they bring two or three of their brilliant representative   and we ’ll all go down together and what we ’ll do be we ’ll negotiate   i ’ll put they in the room and let they speak up   because any deal i make with china if it ’s the great it ’s go to be well than any deal that anybody ever dream possible or i ’m not go to have a deal   it ’ a very simple

 but any deal i make with china schumer be go to stand up and say oh it should ’ve be well   it should ’ve be well   and you know what   that ’ not acceptable to i   so i ’m think about do something very different   i do not think it ’s ever be i just do not want to be second guess   but that ’s not even second guess that ’ call politic   sadly i ’d probably do the same thing to they okay

 but any deal i make toward the end i ’m go to bring schumer at least offer he and pelosi   i ’m go to say please join i on the deal

 and by the way i just see our new attorney general be sit in the front row   please stand up bill   applause   such an easy job he ’s get   he ’s get the easy job in government   thank you and congratulation   that be a great vote yesterday   thank you very much

 q     mr. president

 the president   yes go ahead   go ahead

 q     in your remark sir you say that you be too new to politic early in your administration when you would ’ve prefer that this be do   be that an admission of how you might be change on the job   and

 the president   well i ’m learn   i mean i be learn   do not forget it ’s not like i ’ve do this for a senator come into my office and say sir i ’ve be run for office for 30 year   i ’ve win seven out of seven   i do lose a couple when i be young   i say well i ’ve win one out of one   but you know i never do politic before   now i do politic   i will tell you i ’m very disappointed at certain people a particular one for not having push this fast

 q     be you refer to speaker ryan sir

 the president   but i ’ve learn who

 q     speaker ryan

 the president   let ’s not talk about it

 q     okay

 the president   what difference do it make   but they should have push it fast   they should have push it hard   and they do n’t   they do n’t

 if they would have it would have be a little bit well   in the meantime i ’ve build a lot of wall   i have a lot of money and i ’ve build a lot of wall   but it would ’ve be nice to have get do   and i would like to see major immigration reform and maybe that ’ something we can all work on bill where we all get together and do major immigration reform not just for a wall for a barrier for port of entry for other thing

 we have a real problem   we have catch and release   you catch a criminal and you have to release they   we have so many other thing   you have chain migration where a bad person come in bring 22 or 23 or 35 of his family member because he have his mother his grandmother his sister his cousin his uncle they ’re all in

 you know what happen on the west side highway   that young wise guy drive over and kill eight people and horribly injure nobody talk about that horribly like loss of leg and arm go 60 mile an hour he make a right turn into a park on the west side highway along the hudson river in new york   he have many people bring in because he be in the united states   it ’s call chain migration

 and then you have the lottery   it ’ a horror show because when country put people into the lottery they ’re not put you in they ’re put some very bad people in the lottery   it ’ common sense   if i run a country and if i have a lottery system of people go to the united states i ’m not go to put in my star i ’m go to put in people i do not want   the lottery system be a disaster   i ’m stick with it

 q     mr. president could you tell we

 the president   it should have wait   it should have never happen   okay

 q     mr. president could you tell we to what degree some of the outside conservative voice help to shape your view on this national emergency

 the president   i would talk about it   look sean hannity have be a terrific terrific supporter of what i do   not of i   if i change my view he would not be with i

 rush limbaugh i think he ’ a great guy   here ’ a guy who can speak for three hour without a phone call   try do that sometime   for three hour he speak   he ’s get one of the big audience in the history of the world   i mean this guy be unbelievable   try speak for three hour without take call   take call be easy   okay i ’ll answer this one   i ’ll answer that one   he go for three hour and he ’s get an audience that ’ fantastic

 q     should they be

 the president   wait

 q     should they be decide policy sir

 the president    they do not decide policy   in fact if i go opposite i mean they have somebody ann coulter   i do not know she   i hardly know she   i have n’t speak to she in way over a year   but the press loves say ann coulter   probably if i do speak to she she ’d be very nice   i just do not have the time to speak to she   i would speak to she i have nothing against she

 in fact i like she for one reason when they ask she like right at the beginning who be go to win the election she say donald trump   and the two people that ask she that question smile   they say you ’re kid be n’t you   nope   donald trump

 so i like she but she ’ off the reservation   but anybody that know she understand that   but i have n’t speak to she   i do not follow she   i do n’t talk to she   but the press love to bring up the name ann coulter   and you know what   i think she ’ fine   i think she ’ good   but i just do not speak to she

 laura have be great   laura ingraham   tucker carlson have be great   i actually have a couple people on cnn that have be very good   i have some on msnbc   the other day they do a great report of i   i say where the hell do that come from   i think it be the only one in over a year

 so the crazy thing be i just have as you know rasmussen 52 percent in the poll   it ’ my high poll number   and people get what we ’re do   they get it   they really get it   and i ’m honor by it

 yes   jim acosta

 q     thank you mr. president   i wonder if you could comment on this disconnect that we seem to have in this country where you be present information about what ’s happen at the border call it an invasion talk about woman with duct tape over their mouth and so on and yet there ’ a lot of report out there there ’ a lot of crime datum out there there ’ a lot of department of homeland security datum out there that show border crossing at a near record low

 the president   that ’s because of we   but it ’s still

 q     that show undocumented immigrant commit crime at low level

 the president   excuse i   it ’ still massive number of crossing

 q     that show undocumented criminal or undocumented immigrant commit crime at low level than native bear americans   what do you say

 q     i believe in fact and statistic and datum but

 the president   okay   any more   quick let ’s go

 q     let i just ask you this what do you say to your critic who say that you be create a national emergency that you ’re concoct a national emergency here in order to get your wall because you could not get it through other way

 the president   i ask the angel moms what do you think   do you think i ’m create something

 ask these incredible woman who lose their daughter and their son   okay

 participant   this be real

 the president   because your question be a very political question because you have an agenda   you ’re cnn   you ’re fake news   you have an agenda   the number that you give be wrong

 take a look at our federal prison population   see how many of they percentage wise be illegal alien   just see   go ahead and see   it ’ a fake question

 yes   go ahead

 q     can i ask a follow up

 q     thank you mr. president   just to follow up on that unify crime reporting statistic number from your own border patrol number from this government show that the amount of illegal immigrant be down there be not violence on the border and that most

 q     i understand what you ’re i understand what you ’re say

 the president   a mile away from where i go

 q     i be there   i understand   that ’s not the question   the question be

 the president   do we forget about that

 q     no i ’m not forget about it   i ’m ask you to clarify where you get your number because most of the dea crime reporting statistic that we see show that drug be come across at the port of entry that illegal immigration be down and the violence be down

 the president   okay

 q     so what do you base your fact on

 the president   okay let i come on let ’s go   sort of sort of

 q     and secondly

 the president   no no   you get one   you get one   ready

 q     well the second question be

 the president   just sit down   wait   sit down   sit down

 q     could you please answer it

 the president   sit down   you get one question

 i get my number from a lot of source like homeland security primarily   and the number that i have from homeland security be a disaster   and you know what else be a disaster   the number that come out of homeland security kirstjen for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration billion and billion of dollar a month   billion and billion of dollar   and it ’ unnecessary

 q     so your own government stat be wrong be you say

 the president   no no   i use many stat   i use many stat

 q     could you share those stat with we

 the president   let i tell you you have stat that be far bad than the one that i use   but i use many stat but i also use homeland security

 all right next question

 q     and do you wait a minute   just a quick follow up

 the president   go ahead   no   go   please

 q     thank you mr. president   i just want to bring you back to china for a second   the white house put out a statement today talk about the march 1st deadline   the other day though you give the possibility that maybe this could slide   be you eye a possible extension 30 day maybe 60 day   what be the status there   or be march 1st the deadline

 the president   yeah   very good question   so it ’ a very big deal   i guess you could say it ’s like must be the big deal ever make if you think   trade with china how big do that get   although if you look the uscma be right up there   but it ’ very complicated   there be many many point that we ’re bring up that nobody ever bring up or think to bring up but they ’re very important because we be on the wrong side of every one of they

 there be a possibility that i will extend the date   and if i do that if i see that we ’re close to a deal or the deal be go in the right direction i would do that at the same tariff that we ’re charge now   i would not increase the tariff

 q     let i also ask you about the debt sir because it ’s go from a shade under $ 20 trillion from when you take office   now it ’ a shade over $ 22 trillion and head in the wrong direction   what be your plan to reverse it

 the president   well it ’ all about growth   but before i

 q     inaudible

 the president   really focus on that and you have to remember president obama put on more debt on this country than every president in the history of our country combine   so when i take over we have one man that put on more debt than every other president combine   combine they all   so you can not be talk about that   but i talk about it because i consider it very important

 but first i have to straighten out the military   the military be deplete   and if we do n’t have a strong military that hopefully we will not have to use because it ’ strong if we do n’t have a strong military you do not have to worry about debt you have big problem   so i have to straighten out the military   that ’ why i do the $ 700- and $ 716 billion   but growth will straighten it out

 you see last month the trade deficit go way down   everybody say what happen   well what ’s happen be growth   but before i can focus too much on that a very big expense be military   and we have no choice but to straighten out our military

 q     be growth the only answer sir or be inaudible

 the president   yes ma’am go ahead

 q     thank you mr. president   on north korea back on the last summit you guy come out with a pretty general agreement

 the president   yes

 q     i be wonder what you think have you know be accomplish since the last summit   and then

 the president   a lot

 q     be we go to be see anything concrete

 the president   a lot have be accomplish   okay

 q     on denuclearization

 the president   yeah   a lot have be accomplish   we ’re deal with they we ’re talk to they

 when i come into office i meet right there in the oval office with president obama   and i sit in those beautiful chair and we talk   it be suppose to be 15 minute   as you know it end up be many time long than that

 and i say what ’s the big problem   he say by far north korea   and i do not want to speak for he but i believe he would have go to war with north korea   i think he be ready to go to war   in fact he tell i he be so close to start a big war with north korea   and where be we now   no missile   no rocket   no nuclear testing   we ’ve learn a lot

 but much more importantly than all of it much more important much much more important that that be we have a great relationship   i have a very good relationship with kim jong un   and i ’ve do a job   in fact i think i can say this prime minister abe of japan give i the most beautiful copy of a letter that he send to the people who give out a thing call the nobel prize   he say i have nominate you or respectfully on behalf of japan i be ask they to give you the nobel peace prize   i say thank you   many other people feel that way too   i ’ll probably never get it but that ’s okay

 they give it to obama   he do not even know what he get it for   he be there for about 15 second and he get the nobel prize   he say oh what do i get it for   with i i probably will never get it

 but if you look at idlib province in syria i stop the slaughter of perhaps 3 million people   nobody talk about that   they do n’t talk about that   russia and iran and syria be go to go in and perhaps destroy 3 million people in order to get 45,000 terrorist   and i hear about it from a woman who have her parent and her brother live there and she say please please   and i think i say no it can not happen   what be you talk about   no they ’re go to get   and i come home and i read a certain paper where the story be there that they be actually form to go into to really to really do big destruction   and i put out a statement that you well not do it

 and in all fairness to russia and iran and syria they do n’t attack   or they ’re do it surgically at least   save a lot of people   we do a lot of good work   this administration do a tremendous job and we do not get credit for it   but i think the people understand what we do

 so prime minister abe give i i mean it ’ the most beautiful five letter five page letter   nobel prize   he send it to they   you know why   because he have rocket ship and he have missile fly over japan   and they have alarm go off you know that   now all of a sudden they feel good they feel safe   i do that

 and it be a very tough dialogue at the beginning   fire and fury   total annihilation   my button be big than your and my button work   remember that   you do n’t remember that   and people say trump be crazy   and you know what it end up be   a very good relationship   i like he a lot and he like i a lot   nobody else would have do that

 the obama administration could not have do it   number one they probably would not have do it   and number two they do not have the capability to do it

 so i just want to thank everybody   i want to wish our attorney general great luck and speed and enjoy your life   laughter   bill good luck   a tremendous reputation   i know you ’ll do a great job   thank you very much   and thank you everybody   thank you very much   thank you

president trump   thank you very much   mr. president mr. secretary general distinguished delegate ambassador and world leader

 seven decade of history have pass through this hall in all of their richness and drama   where i stand the world have hear from president and premier at the height of the cold war   we have see the foundation of nation   we have see the ringleader of revolution   we have beheld saint who inspire we with hope rebel who stir we with passion and hero who embolden we with courage all here to share plan proposal vision and idea on the world ’s big stage

 like those who meet we before our time be one of great contest high stake and clear choice   the essential divide that run all around the world and throughout history be once again throw into stark relief   it be the divide between those whose thirst for control delude they into think they be destine to rule over other and those people and nation who want only to rule themselves

 i have the immense privilege of address you today as the elect leader of a nation that prize liberty independence and self government above all   the united states after having spend over two and a half trillion dollar since my election to completely rebuild our great military be also by far the world ’s most powerful nation   hopefully it will never have to use this power

 americans know that in a world where other seek conquest and domination our nation must be strong in wealth in might and in spirit   that be why the united states vigorously defend the tradition and custom that have make we who we be

 like my beloved country each nation represent in this hall have a cherish history culture and heritage that be worth defend and celebrate and which give we our singular potential and strength

 the free world must embrace its national foundation   it must not attempt to erase they or replace they

 look around and all over this large magnificent planet the truth be plain to see if you want freedom take pride in your country   if you want democracy hold on to your sovereignty   and if you want peace love your nation   wise leader always put the good of their own people and their own country first

 the future do not belong to globalist   the future belong to patriot   the future belong to sovereign and independent nation who protect their citizen respect their neighbor and honor the difference that make each country special and unique

 it be why we in the united states have embark on an exciting program of national renewal   in everything we do we be focus on empower the dream and aspiration of our citizen

 thank to our pro growth economic policy our domestic unemployment rate reach its low level in over half a century   fuel by massive tax cut and regulation cut job be be produce at a historic rate   six million americans have be add to the employment roll in under three year

 last month african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment reach their low rate ever record we be marshal our nation ’s vast energy abundance and the united states be now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world   wage be rise income be soar and 2.5 million americans have be lift out of poverty in less than three year

 as we rebuild the unrivaled might of the american military we be also revitalize our alliance by make it very clear that all of our partner be expect to pay their fair share of the tremendous defense burden which the united states have bear in the past

 at the center of our vision for national renewal be an ambitious campaign to reform international trade   for decade the international trading system have be easily exploit by nation act in very bad faith   as job be outsource a small handful grow wealthy at the expense of the middle class

 in america the result be 4.2 million lose manufacturing job and $ 15 trillion in trade deficit over the last quarter century   the united states be now take that decisive action to end this grave economic injustice   our goal be simple we want balanced trade that be both fair and reciprocal

 we have work closely with our partner in mexico and canada to replace nafta with the brand new and hopefully bipartisan u.s.-mexico canada agreement

 tomorrow i will join prime minister abe of japan to continue our progress in finalize a terrific new trade deal

 as the united kingdom make preparation to exit the european union i have make clear that we stand ready to complete an exceptional new trade agreement with the uk that will bring tremendous benefit to both of our country   we be work closely with prime minister boris johnson on a magnificent new trade deal

 the most important difference in america ’s new approach on trade concern our relationship with china   in 2001 china be admit to the world trade organization   our leader then argue that this decision would compel china to liberalize its economy and strengthen protection to provide thing that be unacceptable to we and for private property and for the rule of law   two decade later this theory have be test and prove completely wrong

 not only have china decline to adopt promise reform it have embrace an economic model dependent on massive market barrier heavy state subsidy currency manipulation product dumping force technology transfer and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secret on a grand scale

 as just one example i recently meet the ceo of a terrific american company micron technology at the white house   micron produce memory chip use in countless electronic   to advance the chinese government ’s five year economic plan a company own by the chinese state allegedly steal micron ’s design value at up to $ 8.7 billion   soon the chinese company obtain patent for nearly an identical product and micron be ban from sell its own good in china   but we be seek justice

 the united states lose 60,000 factory after china enter the wto   this be happen to other country all over the globe

 the world trade organization need drastic change   the second large economy in the world should not be permit to declare itself a develop country in order to game the system at other expense

 for year these abuse be tolerate ignore or even encourage   globalism exert a religious pull over past leader cause they to ignore their own national interest

 but as far as america be concern those day be over   to confront these unfair practice i place massive tariff on more than $ 500 billion worth of chinese make good   already as a result of these tariff supply chain be relocate back to america and to other nation and billion of dollar be be pay to our treasury

 the american people be absolutely committed to restore balance to our relationship with china   hopefully we can reach an agreement that would be beneficial for both country   but as i have make very clear i will not accept a bad deal for the american people

 as we endeavor to stabilize our relationship we ’re also carefully monitor the situation in hong kong   the world fully expect that the chinese government will honor its bind treaty make with the british and register with the united nations in which china commit to protect hong kong ’s freedom legal system and democratic way of life   how china choose to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future   we be all count on president xi as a great leader

 the united states do not seek conflict with any other nation   we desire peace cooperation and mutual gain with all   but i will never fail to defend america ’s interest

 one of the great security threat face peace love nation today be the repressive regime in iran   the regime ’s record of death and destruction be well known to we all   not only be iran the world ’s number one state sponsor of terrorism but iran ’s leader be fuel the tragic war in both syria and yemen

 at the same time the regime be squander the nation ’s wealth and future in a fanatical quest for nuclear weapon and the mean to deliver they   we must never allow this to happen

 to stop iran ’s path to nuclear weapon and missile i withdraw the united states from the terrible iran nuclear deal which have very little time remain do not allow inspection of important site and do not cover ballistic missile
 follow our withdrawal we have implement severe economic sanction on the country   hope to free itself from sanction the regime have escalate its violent and unprovoked aggression   in response to iran ’s recent attack on saudi arabian oil facility we just impose the high level of sanction on iran ’s central bank and sovereign wealth fund

 all nation have a duty to act   no responsible government should subsidize iran ’s bloodlust   as long as iran ’s menacing behavior continue sanction will not be lift they will be tighten   iran ’s leader will have turn a proud nation into just another cautionary tale of what happen when a rule class abandon its people and embark on a crusade for personal power and rich

 for 40 year the world have listen to iran ’s ruler as they lash out at everyone else for the problem they alone have create   they conduct ritual chant of death to america and traffic in monstrous anti semitism   last year the country ’s supreme leader state israel be a malignant cancerous tumor that have to be remove and eradicate it be possible and it will happen   america will never tolerate such anti semitic hate

 fanatic have long use hatred of israel to distract from their own failure   thankfully there be a grow recognition in the wide middle east that the country of the region share common interest in battle extremism and unleash economic opportunity   that be why it be so important to have full normalize relation between israel and its neighbor   only a relationship build on common interest mutual respect and religious tolerance can forge a well future

 iran ’s citizen deserve a government that care about reduce poverty end corruption and increase job not steal their money to fund a massacre abroad and at home

 after four decade of failure it be time for iran ’s leader to step forward and to stop threaten other country and focus on build up their own country   it be time for iran ’s leader to finally put the iranian people first

 america be ready to embrace friendship with all who genuinely seek peace and respect

 many of america ’s close friend today be once our grave foe   the united states have never believe in permanent enemy   we want partner not adversary   america know that while anyone can make war only the most courageous can choose peace

 for this same reason we have pursue bold diplomacy on the korean peninsula i have tell kim jong un what i truly believe that like iran his country be full of tremendous untapped potential but that to realize that promise north korea must denuclearize

 around the world our message be clear america ’s goal be last america ’s goal be harmony and america ’s goal be not to go with these endless war war that never end

 with that goal in mind my administration be also pursue the hope of a bright future in afghanistan   unfortunately the taliban have choose to continue their savage attack   and we will continue to work with our coalition of afghan partner to stamp out terrorism and we will never stop work to make peace a reality

 here in the western hemisphere we be join with our partner to ensure stability and opportunity all across the region   in that mission one of our most critical challenge be illegal immigration which undermine prosperity rip apart society and empower ruthless criminal cartel

 mass illegal migration be unfair unsafe and unsustainable for everyone involve the send country and the deplete country   and they become deplete very fast but their youth be not take care of and human capital go to waste

 the receive country be overburden with more migrant than they can responsibly accept   and the migrant themselves be exploit assault and abuse by vicious coyote   nearly one third of woman who make the journey north to our border be sexually assault along the way   yet here in the united states and around the world there be a grow cottage industry of radical activist and non governmental organization that promote human smuggling   these group encourage illegal migration and demand erasure of national border

 today i have a message for those open border activist who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice your policy be not just   your policy be cruel and evil   you be empower criminal organization that prey on innocent man woman and child   you put your own false sense of virtue before the life wellbee and of countless innocent people   when you undermine border security you be undermine human right and human dignity

 many of the country here today be cope with the challenge of uncontrolled migration   each of you have the absolute right to protect your border and so of course do our country   today we must resolve to work together to end human smuggling end human trafficking and put these criminal network out of business for good

 to our country i can tell you sincerely we be work closely with our friend in the region include mexico canada guatemala honduras el salvador and panama to uphold the integrity of border and ensure safety and prosperity for our people   i would like to thank president lópez obrador of mexico for the great cooperation we be receive and for right now put 27,000 troop on our southern border   mexico be show we great respect and i respect they in return

 the u.s. we have take very unprecedented action to stop the flow of illegal immigration   to anyone consider crossing of our border illegally please hear these word do not pay the smuggler   do not pay the coyote   do not put yourself in danger   do not put your child in danger   because if you make it here you will not be allow in you will be promptly return home   you will not be release into our country   as long as i be president of the united states we will enforce our law and protect our border

 for all of the country of the western hemisphere our goal be to help people invest in the bright future of their own nation   our region be full of such incredible promise dream wait to be build and national destiny for all   and they be wait also to be pursue

 throughout the hemisphere there be million of hardworking patriotic young people eager to build innovate and achieve   but these nation can not reach their potential if a generation of youth abandon their home in search of a life elsewhere   we want every nation in our region to flourish and its people to thrive in freedom and peace

 in that mission we be also commit to support those people in the western hemisphere who live under brutal oppression such as those in cuba nicaragua and venezuela

 accord to a recent report from the u.n. human rights council woman in venezuela stand in line for 10 hour a day wait for food   over 15,000 people have be detain as political prisoner   modern day death squad be carry out thousand of extrajudicial killing

 the dictator maduro be a cuban puppet protect by cuban bodyguard hide from his own people while cuba plunder venezuela ’s oil wealth to sustain its own corrupt communist rule

 since i last speak in this hall the united states and our partner have build a historic coalition of 55 country that recognize the legitimate government of venezuela

 to the venezuelans trap in this nightmare please know that all of america be unite behind you   the united states have vast quantity of humanitarian aid ready and wait to be deliver   we be watch the venezuela situation very closely   we await the day when democracy will be restore when venezuela will be free and when liberty will prevail throughout this hemisphere

 one of the most serious challenge our country face be the specter of socialism   it ’ the wrecker of nation and destroyer of society

 event in venezuela remind we all that socialism and communism be not about justice they be not about equality they be not about lift up the poor and they be certainly not about the good of the nation   socialism and communism be about one thing only power for the rule class

 today i repeat a message for the world that i have deliver at home america will never be a socialist country

 in the last century socialism and communism kill 100 million people   sadly as we see in venezuela the death toll continue in this country   these totalitarian ideology combine with modern technology have the power to excise exercise new and disturbing form of suppression and domination

 for this reason the united states be take step to well screen foreign technology and investment and to protect our datum and our security   we urge every nation present to do the same

 freedom and democracy must be constantly guard and protect both abroad and from within   we must always be skeptical of those who want conformity and control   even in free nation we see alarming sign and new challenge to liberty

 a small number of social medium platform be acquire immense power over what we can see and over what we be allow to say   a permanent political class be openly disdainful dismissive and defiant of the will of the people   a faceless bureaucracy operate in secret and weaken democratic rule   medium and academic institution push flat out assault on our history tradition and value

 in the united states my administration have make clear to social medium company that we will uphold the right of free speech   a free society can not allow social medium giant to silence the voice of the people and a free people must never ever be enlist in the cause of silence coerce canceling or blacklist their own neighbor

 as we defend american value we affirm the right of all people to live in dignity   for this reason my administration be work with other nation to stop criminalize of homosexuality and we stand in solidarity with lgbtq people who live in country that punish jail or execute individual base upon sexual orientation

 we be also champion the role of woman in our society   nation that empower woman be much wealthy safe and much more politically stable   it be therefore vital not only to a nation ’s prosperity but also be vital to its national security to pursue woman ’s economic development

 guide by these principle my administration launch the woman ’s global development and prosperity initiatives   the w gdp be first ever government wide approach to woman ’s economic empowerment work to ensure that woman all over the planet have the legal right to own and inherit property work in the same industry as man travel freely and access credit and institution

 yesterday i be also pleased to host leader for a discussion about an ironclad american commitment protect religious leader and also protect religious freedom   this fundamental right be under grow threat around the world   hard to believe but 80 percent of the world ’s population live in country where religious liberty be in significant danger or even completely outlawed   americans will never fire or tire in our effort to defend and promote freedom of worship and religion   we want and support religious liberty for all

 americans will also never tire of defend innocent life   we be aware that many united nations project have attempt to assert a global right to taxpayer fund abortion on demand right up until the moment of delivery   global bureaucrat have absolutely no business attack the sovereignty of nation that wish to protect innocent life   like many nation here today we in america believe that every child bear and unborn be a sacred gift from god

 there be no circumstance under which the united states will allow international entry entity to trample on the right of our citizen include the right to self defense   that be why this year i announce that we will never ratify the u.n. arms trade treaty which would threaten the liberty of law abide american citizen   the united states will always uphold our constitutional right to keep and bear arm   we will always uphold our second amendment

 the core right and value america defend today be inscribe in america ’s found document   our nation ’s founder understand that there will always be those who believe they be entitle to wield power and control over other tyranny advance under many name and many theory but it always come down to the desire for domination   it protect not the interest of many but the privilege of few

 our founder give we a system design to restrain this dangerous impulse   they choose to entrust american power to those most invest in the fate of our nation a proud and fiercely independent people

 the true good of a nation can only be pursue by those who love it by citizen who be root in its history who be nourish by its culture commit to its value attach to its people and who know that its future be theirs to build or theirs to lose   patriot see a nation and its destiny in way no one else can

 liberty be only preserve sovereignty be only secure democracy be only sustain greatness be only realize by the will and devotion of patriot   in their spirit be find the strength to resist oppression the inspiration to forge legacy the goodwill to seek friendship and the bravery to reach for peace   love of our nation make the world well for all nation

 so to all the leader here today join we in the most fulfilling mission a person could have the most profound contribution anyone can make lift up your nation   cherish your culture   honor your history   treasure your citizen make your country strong and prosperous and righteous   honor the dignity of your people and nothing will be outside of your reach

 when our nation be great the future will be bright our people will be happy and our partnership will be strong

 with god ’s help together we will cast off the enemy of liberty and overcome the oppressor of dignity   we will set new standard of live and reach new height of human achievement we will rediscover old truth unravel old mystery and make thrill new breakthrough   and we will find more beautiful friendship and more harmony among nation than ever before

 my fellow leader the path to peace and progress and freedom and justice and a well world for all humanity begin at home

 thank you   god bless you   god bless the nation of the world   and god bless america   thank you very much

president trump   thank you very much   thank you

 well thank you all for be here   we ’ve have a tremendous three day in new york at the united nations   i want to thank the secretary general   it ’s be really incredible what ’s be take place   and he ’s be a fantastic host to a lot of country

 the meeting i have on a bilat or close be pretty staggering   i think we set a new record but you ’ll have to check that out   the we meet very very for pretty extended period of time either two and two one on one or just about at that level with pakistan poland new zealand singapore egypt south korea united kingdom india iraq argentina germany brazil france japan ukraine honduras el salvador saudi arabia jordan bahrain kuwait qatar oman uae chile colombia ecuador and peru   other than that we be not too busy over the last three day

 and unfortunately the press do not even cover it   you know we have we ’ve make some fantastic deal like with japan   for farmer we have a tremendous trade deal with japan   and that do not get cover because you waste your time on nonsense

 the pmi manufacturer index have go substantially up which be an incredible larry kudlow wherever you may be larry please stand up   he just give i these number   and exist new home sale be through the roof   just come out   oil price have go down ever since the saudi arabia incident and they ’ve go down very substantially   so we have plenty of oil   but those number be surprising to you larry   and the extent of the increase   be that a correct statement   so thank you larry kudlow

 we think we ’ll make this little announcement to you because important   you know the so call whistleblower   the one that do not have any first class or first rate or second tier information from what i understand   you ’ll have to figure that out for yourself   but i ’ve speak with leader kevin mccarthy and the republicans many of they and we be go to do this anyway but i ’ve inform they all of the house member that i fully support transparency on the so call whistleblow information even though it be supposedly second hand information which be sort of interesting

 and other thing have come out about the whistleblower that be also maybe even more interesting   but also insist on transparency from joe biden and his son hunter on the million of dollar that have be quickly and easily take out of ukraine and china   millions of dollar   million and million of dollar take out very rapidly while he be vice president   and i think they should have transparency for that   i ’ve inform the leader about that

 and additionally i demand transparency from democrats who go to ukraine and attempt to force the new president who i meet and be an outstanding person   i just meet a little while ago some of you be there   i think he ’s go to be outstanding   he get elect on the basis of corruption   he want to end corruption in ukraine and i think that ’ great

 but they go there and they want to force the new president to do thing that they want under the form of political threat   they threaten he if he do n’t do thing   now that ’ what they ’re accuse i of but i do not do it   i do not threaten anybody   in fact the press be ask question of the president of ukraine   and he say no pressure   i use the word pressure   i think he use the word push but he mean pressure but it ’s the same thing   no push no pressure no nothing   it ’ all a hoax folk   it ’ all a big hoax

 and the sad thing about this hoax be that we work so hard with all of these country and i mean really hard   this have be i ’ve be up from early in the morning to late in the evening and meet with different country all for the good of our country and the press do not even cover all of this   and it ’ disappear it ’ really disappointing also to those country that be with we and spend so much time with we

 so we want transparency   we ’ve inform kevin mccarthy about transparency   and we say vote for it   so i think you ’ll have close to 100 percent of the republican vote i hope

 and it get almost no attention but in may cnn report that senators robert menendez richard durbin and patrick leahy write a letter to ukraine ’s prosecutor general express concern at the closing of four investigation they say be critical   in the letter they imply that their support for u.s. assistance to ukraine be at stake and that if they do not do the right thing they would not get any assistance   gee do n’t that sound familiar   do n’t that sound familiar

 and chris murphy who i ’ve be deal with on gun you know so nice   he ’ always oh no we want to work it out   we want to work it out   but they ’re too busy waste their time on the witch hunt   so senator chris murphy literally threaten the president of ukraine that if he do n’t do thing right they will not have democrat support in congress   so you ’re go to look all of this up

 one other thing i ’m just go off of certain note and element of what we ’ve be do over the last three day but this just come up a few minute ago the amazon washington post just put out a fake article that acting director of national intelligence joseph maguire who i ’ve get to know and he ’ a tough cookie and i be surprised i be shocked to hear this be go to quit blame the white house for something that they would not let he talk openly freely   and i be shock because i know joe and he ’ tough   a tough guy

 and i be really surprised to hear he be go to quit   before i could even either talk to he or talk to anybody else he put out a statement i do not speak to joe yet but he say at no time have i consider resign my position   in other word the story in the washington post be a fake

 at no time have i consider resign my position since assume this role on august 16 2019   i have never quit anything in my life and i be not go to start now   i ’m committed to lead the intelligence community to address the diverse and complex threat face our nation   that ’ from the acting director of national intelligence a very good man joseph maguire

 so we ’re have a great period of time   our country be the strong it ’s ever be economically   our number be phenomenal   wilbur thank you   and larry   everybody   the number be phenomenal   our economy be the strong in the world   we ’re the large economy in the world

 have my opponent win we would be second right now because china be catch we so rapidly we would ’ve be second by this time   and unless somebody do a very poor job as president we ’re go to be first for a long way because we ’ve pick up trillion and trillion of dollar in value and worth of our country and china have lose trillion and trillion of dollar and million of job and their supply chain   and they want to make a deal

 this year america come to the united nations strong than we have ever be before since my election the united states have not only bring our economy to a level that we have never see the most job that we ’ve ever have you know you ’ve hear i say it many time african american asian american hispanic american the good unemployment number we ’ve ever have   and the most and good employment number 160 million very close to that number in job   we ’ve never be anywhere close

 wage be up and inequality be down   something that people do not like write about   but wage be up   i use to speak during the campaign and i ’d talk about wage where people be make less money three year ago than they be make 21 year 22 year ago and they ’d have two job and three job   when i say three year ago i ’m talk into the area sometime prior to the election   and they be do very badly   and now for the first time in many year wage be up and employment be up and unemployment be down   and it ’ a beautiful thing to watch

 in a week of active and ambitious diplomacy here at the united nations america renew our friendship   we advance our value greatly and make clear to everyone that the united states will always defend our citizen to promote prosperity

 i meet with prime minister boris johnson at length of the united kingdom continue our discussion on a magnificent new bilateral trade deal   so we ’ll see what happen with respect to brexit but i suspect we ’ll have a fantastic deal with the uk it should be much big than it have be over the last number of year   over the last 20 year frankly   it should be a much big deal

 that ’s true with many country   we ’re go to have much big trade deal with a lot of country that have an opportunity to come   and they all want to do business with the united states especially now

 early today i stand alongside prime minister abe of japan a friend of mine a great gentleman   have a great reelection   and we sign a terrific new trade deal which tremendously help our farmer and rancher and technology   the technology company be really big beneficiary

 we also hold very productive conversation with leader of pakistan india   and many other nation be achieve strong tie of fair and reciprocal trade   and with respect to pakistan and india we talk about kashmir   and whatever help i can be i say i offer whether it ’ arbitration or mediation or whatever it have to be i ’ll do whatever i can   because they ’re at very serious odd right now and hopefully that ’ll get well

 you look at the two gentleman head those two country two good friend of mine i say fellas work it out   just work it out   those be two nuclear country   they ’ve get to work it out

 this week we also make incredible stride on national security with president duda of poland   we sign a joint declaration advance defense cooperation   and crucially poland have agree to put up 100 percent of the money something i do not think you ’ve ever hear say before   but they ’re go to put up 100 percent of the money of host additional u.s. military personnel that we ’ll be take from various other country   we will not have more over we ’ll have we ’ll be move they around

 poland be build we phenomenal new facility   they ’re spend everything and they ’re go to really do a job   but we ’ll be move a few thousand soldier and poland will be pay that for it

 together with prime minister lee of singapore i sign an important agreement extend our defense cooperation   this have not be change in many year   then yesterday i meet with prospective member of the middle east strategic alliance which be a group that i know very well i know all of they   and through this effort the nation of the middle east be take more responsibility for secure their own future and their own neighborhood   and they ’re also reimburse we and pay we for a lot of the military work that we incredibly do

 but because we ’re now independent energy wise we ’re energy independent we have very few boat go over the middle east   we use to have they go through the straits all the time   and you probably notice that every once in a while they go after somebody else ’s   they have not go after ours yet if they do they ’ve get big problem   but we have very few boat go over there   they be say the other day they ’ve never attack an american boat and i ’m not ask for trouble   but if they do they know they have far big trouble   but then they say but you know we do not see very many american boat over here anymore

 this week also bring extraordinary progress to nation of our own hemisphere   in recent day we ’ve achieve historic asylum cooperation agreement with el salvador guatemala and honduras   we be with el salvador today   a great young gentleman become the president   he ’ strong and tough and he ’s take care of crime   he be really something today   i be very impressed with he   and likewise with honduras who we meet   we sign a cooperation agreement with both and also with guatemala

 we ’re work with our partner in central america to ensure that asylum seeker can pursue relief as close to their home country as possible   that ’ll make a tremendous difference at our southern border

 and mexico i have to say president lopez obrador have be outstanding an outstanding partner   and he ’s do a great job in mexico   the cartel be way down and the number our secretary be here now the number be way down   way way down   and we ’re do that without the help of congress mean the democrats in congress who will not give we a single vote to take care of loophole

 we have loophole that be so horrible and it would be so easy to fix   and they know they should be fix but they do not want to do because they do not want to give trump any credit because it ’s all about the election   that ’ all they care about   they do n’t care about our country they care about the election

 and the sad part be with all of the tremendous work that we ’ve do this weekend whether it ’ secretary mnuchin or secretary pompeo who have some outstanding outstanding meeting with all of this tremendous work that we ’ve do the press do not even cover it   and the democrats do this hoax during the united nations week   it be perfect   because this way it take away from these tremendous achievement that we ’re take care of do that we ’re involve in in new york city at the united nations

 so that be all plan like everything else   it be all plan   and the witch hunt continue but they ’re getting hit hard in this witch hunt because when they look at the information it ’ a joke   impeachment   for that   when you have a wonderful meeting or you have a wonderful phone conversation

 i think you should ask   we actually you know that be the second conversation   i think you should ask for the first conversation also   i can not believe they have n’t although i hear there ’ a there ’ a rumor out they want the first conversation   it be beautiful   it be just a perfect conversation

 but i think you should do that   i think you should do and i think you should ask for vp pence ’s conversation because he have a couple conversation also   i can save you a lot of time   they ’re all perfect   nothing be mention of any import other than congratulation   but the word be that they ’re go to ask for the first phone conversation   you can have it anytime you need it   and also mike pence ’s conversation which be i think one or two of they   they be perfect   they be all perfect

 it ’ very sad what the democrats be do to this country they ’re divide   they ’re belittle   they ’re demean our country   so many leader come up to i today and they say sir what you go through no president have ever go through   and it ’ so bad for your country   people laugh at the stupidity of what they ’ve ask for   and here we could do asylum   we could do all of these different thing so easily   we could do asylum quickly   we could do loophole get rid of they

 instead we actually make deal with mexico and with guatemala el salvador honduras   and we ’re do it with they instead of with our congress but we ’re do it   we get it do

 the wall be be build by the way   it get little coverage   i go to the border   it ’s go up in new mexico   it ’s go up in arizona   it ’s go up in california believe it or not   they really want that wall in california in san diego   as soon as it be complete they say we do not want a wall   they be beg i for a wall   i should take it out and move it to another location

 we be with the governor speak to he a lot but the governor of texas lieutenant governor of texas attorney general of texas the senator of texas cornyn ted cruz   and we ’re build an incredible wall   that ’s go to number one it ’s go to look great   it ’s go to be virtually impossible to cross unless you ’re one hell of a mountain climber   it ’ very tough   it ’s go to be very tough to get people and drug over those wall because they ’re the real deal

 i go to the secretary of homeland security and he get all his people together   i say give i four wall your optimum   every single thing include   and they give i 20 percent less 20 percent less and 20 percent less meaning less cost   they come back they say this be the wall sir   this would be the good   we have the panel on top which be anti climb panel   i do not know if you notice the steel on top   we have a different design for a different area but this anti climb be very tough   they ’ve we have people go out and real climber tell we which be the tough to climb   but these be anti climb panel   very tough to get across

 and the wall be go up many mile a week   and we hope to have over 400 but maybe as much as 500 mile which we ’ll pretty much do it because you have a lot of natural barrier you have mountain you have really rough river   you have some really rough land that you can not cross very easily   so they serve as their natural wall   but we we ’ll have we think over 400 but we could even have 500 mile

 to combat the malice corruption of both the venezuelan and iranian dictatorship today i issue proclamation suspend the entry into the united states of senior regime official and their family

 and far to promote american value on monday i be proud to be the first president in history to host a meeting at the united nations

 i ’m so surprised first president for this   i can not believe that i ’m first   i speak to franklin graham about that   i can not believe it

 at the united nations on protect religious freedom and liberty for people around the world

 while some partisan and unelected bureaucrat in washington may choose to fight every day against the interest and belief of the american people my administration be stand up for the american people like no administration have in many many year   you forgot the american people   you totally forget the american people

 this week every every week i really can say of my presidency we ’re stand up for american prosperity american security and the american way of life   and together with our friend and partner we ’re build a more peaceful prosperous and promise future

 we have a tremendous relationship now with a lot of nation that be very happy with what ’s go on and that include in south america where they ’ve be so helpful where nobody think this would be possible   the relationship with mexico be an example or el salvador or honduras or guatemala   nobody even know about it   yet we send they hundred of million of dollar and all we get back be caravan of people pour in

 we have tremendous we have tremendous it be terrible   and we ’ve get that stop and the country be now help we   and we stop those payment by the way   we do not pay those country that money anymore   but i will tell you if they ’re as good as they seem to be they ’re really do a job on crime and stop the wrong people from leave and come to the united states we ’ll be help they a lot with economic development project and other thing

 so with that we have a tremendous three day   it be beautiful to see   make a lot of new friend   i read you a list of all the country i see pretty much one on one   and it ’s be very busy but it ’s be very very fruitful

 so we could take a couple of question i ’d love some question on some of the thing that we accomplish at unga instead of the witch hunt the phony witch hunt question which i know that ’ what you want to ask because it ’ probably well for you but it ’s not well for the country

 so maybe we ’ll take a few a few question   please

 q     thank you mr. president   you suggest that you do not do anything wrong in the course of your conversation with the ukrainian president   but can you explain to the american people why it be appropriate for an american president to ask a foreign leader for information about a political rival and what you would have say if you discover that barack obama perhaps have ask a foreign leader for information about you before your campaign for the presidency

 president trump   yeah   well that ’ what he do be n’t it really   when you think about it

 look that whole witch hunt be start and hopefully that ’ll all come out   but there ’s be some fantastic book write that just come out whether you will look at gregg jarrett or mccarthy ’s book that just just come out recently and so many other book   and a lot of book be come out when you start read those book you see what they do to we   what they ’ve do to this country be a disgrace   they ’ve hurt this country very badly   and no other president should have to go through what i ’ve go through

 the president the new president of ukraine be look to stop corruption   there ’ a lot of corruption go on and there be corruption   i just tell you about senator that threaten he with vote and no money come into ukraine if they do thing   that ’ really what people be try to say that i do but the only difference be i do not do it   you take a look at that call it be perfect   i do not do it   there be no quid pro quo but there be with biden and there be with these senator   and they threaten   they say you do this you do that   we ’re not go to give you vote   that ’ that ’s the real deal

 so we have an honest group of people that have be malign   and you know it ’ a lot of people say i ’ll do even well   i ’m very happy   yesterday i guess we have a 53 poll and a lot of people say add 10 point to anything   anybody vote for trump you can add anytime you get a poll you can add 10 point or 7 point or 6 point   take it any way you want   but i do not know if i consider that to be a compliment but in one way it be a compliment

 and i guess that ’ what happen in the last election far more people come to vote than anybody think possible

 q     so why should the american people then be comfortable with an american president ask a foreign leader for information about an american citizen

 president trump   well i think you can look at your senator and you can look at biden and you can look at all these other people   but what we ’re look for be corruption   an investigation start call the russian witch hunt affectionately   and it be a total phony scam   it be set up by people within the government to try and stop somebody from getting elect

 and after that person namely i win and convincingly win at 306 to 223 in the electoral college which by the way when you run a race if you ’re run electoral you know if you go by the college electoral college that ’ a much different race than run popular vote   and it ’s like the hundred yard dash or the mile   you train differently

 and i can not help it that my opponent do not go to wisconsin and should have go much more to michigan and pennsylvania and other place   but that ’s the way it be   we win election convincingly   convincingly   and then you have the text message on well if she do n’t win we ’ve get an insurance policy how bad be that   you know the insurance policy   that ’ sort of what have be take place over the last number of year the insurance policy

 no there be a lot of very dishonest people   we ’re the one that play it straight   and you know what   the million of people out there that be look at what ’s go on those people understand it   they see it   and they think it ’ disgust   and our people be be hurt and our country be be hurt

 when nancy pelosi allow her position to be take over by radical far leave socialist or bad that ’ pretty bad   that ’ pretty bad especially when the senator and all of these other people have actually do what they ’re accuse i of do which i do n’t do

 i ’m go to have mike pompeo say a couple of word   i ’m go to have steve mnuchin say a couple of word   and then we ’ll do a couple of more question

 secretary pompeo   mr. president i think i ’d start by talk about iran   we have a productive week   we see the europeans take a position with respect to the attack that take place in saudi arabia make clear this be iran just as president trump and i have be say and have now join we in say that the exist jcpoa framework be not go to work it ’s not go to solve the world ’s problem it ’s not go to create middle east stability

 then we have a good set of meeting with our middle east ally as well   the president join for a meeting of the gcc where we talk again about how we can help deter   we want peace   we want a peaceful resolution with the islamic republic of iran   we ’re hope we can get that way   in the end it ’ll be up to the iranians to make that decision whether they ’ll choose violence and hate and the president say in his speech yesterday to the general assembly if their bloodthirst will continue

 we hope that ’ the inaudible   we hope we can get the opportunity to negotiate with they and get an outcome that ’s good for both of they for the united states to make sure that they never have a nuclear weapon and that they can not foment their terror with ballistic missile and in the way they have all around the world   and i think we make real progress unite the world on that here over these past few day   thank you

 president trump   thank you

 secretary mnuchin   as secretary pompeo say on iran we have very good discussion with all of our ally about the sanction program which be the maximum pressure and unity on the sanction program   the europeans make it very clear they would not do anything without our consent

 and then on the economic front we have the entire economic team here for all the meeting secretary ross larry kudlow ambassador lighthizer just leave to go back to d.c.   he ’s work hard on try to get usmca pass   but we have a lot of productive discussion   the japanese trade deal and a lot of discussion on invest in the u.s. more job in the u.s. and more trade   thank you

 president trump   okay   go ahead please

 q     thank you   kristina partsinevelos fox business   i want to focus on market because i ’ll leave it to everybody else to talk about impeachment   market react positively after you speak about china and that it would happen soon than rather than unexpectedly

 yet you have the foreign minister of china say that they have no intention of you know unseat the united states   and yet they ’re invest heavily in infrastructure and military

 president trump   not anymore maybe

 q     but what what be different this time though

 president trump   and maybe they just say that kristina

 q     what be different this time though   the fact that you ’re say it ’s progress

 president trump   oh i just think it ’s progress   i think they want to make a deal   they ’re lose their supply chain   you know it ’s getting kill

 q     do you have something specific

 the president   well i do not want to say that   but i can tell you that these two man and in this case more specifically steve we ’re have some very good conversation
 and i guess it ’s next week that a group be come in and the week after   so we have a lot of we have a lot of talk go on and also by telephone

 they want to make a deal   and you know why they want to make a deal   because they ’re lose their job and because their supply chain be go to hell   and company be move out of china and they ’re move to lot of other place include the united states   and that ’ not good that ’ far bad than they think

 and by the way in the meantime we ’re take in billion and billion of dollar in tariff   we ’re take in tremendous number in tariff   and we ’re help our farmer who get target   now by the way china be start to buy our agricultural product again   they ’re start to go with the beef and all of the different thing pork   very big on pork

 but if you look and if you see and they actually put out i think a statement   but they ’re start very heavy to buy our ag again   no they want to make a deal   and they should want to make a deal   the question be do we want to make a deal

 q    if usmca do not pass through congress be that it for nafta

 president trump   well that would be a shame   well i do not want to answer that question but you know how i feel about nafta   i think nafta be the bad trade deal ever make although i also happen to think world trade organization be not one of the great   not one of the great   that be the creation of china which go like a rocket ship from the day they sign   it be it be terrible

 but no we ’re go to find out   that ’s go to be a very interesting question with nancy and chuck and all of these people focus on the witch hunt because they can not beat we at the ballot   they can not beat we at the ballot   and they ’re not go to win the presidential   we ’re have great poll   we have internal poll that be ohio iowa   pennsylvania be look good   north carolina

 we just win two race that a lot of people we think we be go to lose both of those race   one be down 17 point three week before the race and he end up win by a substantial margin by a substantial margin   and dan bishop

 and then we have a second race as you know and he be up one or two point and end up win by what be it   twenty five point or some incredible i ’ll ask you folk because i do not want to be inaccurate   otherwise i ’ll have a front page story we have break news   trump exaggerated

 but he win by many many point   and he be lead by maybe two maybe three but he win by in the twenty   so it ’ it ’s be so we ’re look great in north carolina look great in florida

 and you have one or two congressman democrats say listen we can not beat they at the election so let ’s impeach he   right   do not you hear al green   that ’ a beauty   he ’ a real beauty that guy   but he say very distinctively it ’ all it be all over the place   i do not know they ’re try to lose that tape i guess

 but he say we can n’t   essentially he say we can not beat he   let ’s impeach he   that ’ pretty that ’ pretty dangerous stuff

 steve go ahead

 q     thank you sir   you have express some concern about the precedent of release the transcript

 president trump   yeah   i do n’t like it

 q     why do you go ahead and do it

 president trump   because i be get such fake news and i just think it would be well   and now they ’re ask for the first phone conversation and i ’ll release that too if it ’ important to you   but they ’re ask for because i have a conversation previous on a previous election plateau that he have hit   the the current president hit a couple of different plateaus   and i speak to he previous to the call that we release which be a very innocent call very very innocent very nice call

 and as he say we be i be not push   i be not push mean pressure   he be not pressure at all

 but i do n’t like the concept of release call because when a president or prime minister or a king or a queen call the united states you do n’t like to say gee we ’re go to release your call to the fake news medium and they ’re go to make you look like a fool   what happen be it ’ hard to do business that way   you want to have people feel comfortable

 so i hate it but you folk be say such lie such horrible thing about a call that be so innocent and so nice   in fact lindsey graham say to i when he read it it be very interesting   he ’ a good man   he ’ a smart man   he say i can not believe it   i never know you could be this really nice to a person   he say i can not believe it   you be so nice   i do not think you have that in you to be so nice

 i be nice   i ’m nice to a lot of people   people do not understand that   but i be   but he be shock that it be such a nice call   there he say there be nothing here   and all fair people say the same thing

 but i do n’t like the precedent steve   i do n’t like it where you ’re deal with head of state and to think that their call be go to be release   but i feel that and you know we speak to ukraine about it   mike actually call up his counterpart and we speak to ukraine about it because we want to because they could have be if that they do not want we to do it we would not have do it

 but he actually say that be a very innocent call   you can release it all you want

 q     and be you now brace for long impeachment saga

 president trump   well i think we win   i think it be dead   it be dead   the mueller report no obstruction no collusion   you look at all of the thing that happen

 corey lewandowski be fantastic the other day as a person that they have be torment   you look at all the people that they ’ve torment all the legal fee   people come here with bright eye they want to make life so great for other people   and they leave where they spend hundred of thousand of dollar in legal fee that they do not have   and it ’ a sad thing   what these democrats have do to ruin life be so sad

 i ’ve see people with only good intention   they come to washington because they want to make the united states and the world a well place   and they go home they be dark   they get hit by mueller ’s subpoena   i think there be 2,500 subpoena or some ridiculous number   five hundred people be interview and yet they do not interview joe biden and his son

 if you ’re democrat you have automatic protection   that ’s year and year of people put in certain people into position   but when you look at all of the all of the trauma that these faker of course and the press look the press be much of the press be not only fake it ’ corrupt   these story they write be corrupt they ’re so wrong   and they know that

 you know it use to be i use to get great press until i run for politic   i mean i use to be the king of get good press   i be very good at it   and i get good   i mean they cover i well for what otherwise i probably would not be here

 and once i run i say boy this be incredible   but if you see the way they treat my family use to be treat great   my family work so hard   the people that work with i these people all of these people they work so hard   they ’ve do such a good

 look we have the great economy we ’ve ever have   we have a military two and a half trillion dollar   we ’ve rebuild our military   you do not hear the vet complain   we get choice approve   it could not be approve

 but when you see what happen with the viciousness and when you see little adam schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic smart guy by the way stand at the mic and act like he ’ so serious   and then he go into a room with nadler and they must laugh their ass off   they must laugh their ass off

 but it ’ so bad for our country   people have say rush limbaugh great man sean hannity say it   a lot of people have say it   mark levin   they say they do not know if one man anywhere in the world with all the man they know or woman that could handle what i ’ve have to handle

 and i think that ’s true but i handle it   to i it ’ like put on a suit

 all right how about one more question   a question on the economy   a question on the economy

 last night at my direction the united states military successfully execute a flawless precision strike that kill the number one terrorist anywhere in the world qasem soleimani

 soleimani be plot imminent and sinister attack on american diplomat and military personnel but we catch he in the act and terminate he

 under my leadership america ’s policy be unambiguous to terrorist who harm or intend to harm any american we will find you we will eliminate you we will always protect our diplomat service member all americans and our ally

 for year the islamic revolutionary guard corps and its ruthless quds force under soleimani ’s leadership have target injure and murder hundred of american civilian and servicemen

 the recent attack on us target in iraq include rocket strike that kill an american and injure four american serviceman very badly as well as a violent assault on our embassy in baghdad be carry out at the direction of soleimani

 soleimani make the death of innocent people his sick passion contribute to terrorist plot as far away as new delhi and london

 today we remember and honor the victim of soleimani ’s many atrocity and we take comfort in know that his reign of terror be over

 soleimani have be perpetrate act of terror to destabilize the middle east for the last 20 year what the united states do yesterday should have be do long ago a lot of life would have be save

 just recently soleimani lead the brutal repression of protestor in iran where more than a thousand innocent civilian be torture and kill by their own government

 we take action last night to stop a war we do not take action to start a war

 i have deep respect for the iranian people they be a remarkable people with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential we do not seek regime change however the iranian regime ’s aggression in the region include the use of proxy fighter to destabilize its neighbor must end and it must end now

 the future belong to the people of iran those who seek peaceful coexistence and cooperation not the terrorist warlord who plunder their nation to finance bloodshed abroad

 the united states have the good military by far anywhere in the world we have good intelligence in the world if americans anywhere be threaten we have all of those target already fully identify and i be ready and prepare to take whatever action be necessary and that in particular refer to iran

 under my leadership we have destroy the isis territorial caliphate and recently american special operations forces kill the terrorist leader know as al baghdadi the world be a safe place without these monster

 america will always pursue the interest of good people great people great soul while seek peace harmony and friendship with all of the nation of the world

 thank you god bless you god bless our great military and god bless the united states of america thank you very much thank you

as long as i be president of the united states iran will never be allow to have a nuclear weapon

 good morning i ’m pleased to inform you the american people should be extremely grateful and happy no americans be harm in last night ’s attack by the iranian regime we suffer no casualty all of our soldier be safe and only minimal damage be sustain at our military basis

 our great american force be prepare for anything iran appear to be stand down which be a good thing for all party concern and a very good thing for the world

 no american or iraqi life be lose because of the precaution take the dispersal of force and an early warning system that work very well i salute the incredible skill and courage of america ’s man and woman in uniform

 for far too long all the way back to 1979 to be exact nation have tolerate iran ’s destructive and destabilizing behavior in the middle east and beyond those day be over iran have be the lead sponsor of terrorism and their pursuit of nuclear weapon threaten the civilized world we will never let that happen

 last week we take decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threaten american life at my direction the united states military eliminate the world ’s top terrorist qasem soleimani as the head of the quds force soleimani be personally responsible for some of the absolutely bad atrocity

 he train terrorist army include hezbollah launch terrorist strike against civilian target he fuel bloody civil war all across the region he viciously wound and murder thousand of u.s. troop include the planting of roadside bomb that maim and dismember their victim

 soleimani direct the recent attack on us personnel in iraq that badly wound four service member and kill one american and he orchestrate the violent assault on the us embassy in baghdad in recent day he be plan new attack on american target but we stop he

 soleimani ’s hand be drench in both american and iranian blood he should have be terminate long ago by remove soleimani we have send a powerful message to terrorist if you value your own life you will not threaten the life of our people

 as we continue to evaluate option in response to iranian aggression the united states will immediately impose additional punish economic sanction on the iranian regime these powerful sanction will remain until iran change its behavior

 in recent month alone iran have seize ship in international water fire an unprovoked strike on saudi arabia and shoot down two us drone

 iran ’s hostility substantially increase after the foolish iran nuclear deal be sign in 2013 and they be give $ 150 billion not to mention $ 1.8 billion in cash instead of say thank you to the united states they chant death to america in fact they chant death to america the day the agreement be sign

 then iran go on a terror spree fund by the money from the deal and create hell in yemen syria lebanon afghanistan and iraq the missile fire last night at we and our ally be pay for with the fund make available by the last administration the regime also greatly tighten the rein on their own country even recently kill 1,500 people at the many protest that be take place all throughout iran

 the very defective jcpoa expire shortly anyway and give iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout iran must abandon its nuclear ambition and end its support for terrorism the time have come for the united kingdom germany france russia and china to recognize this reality

 they must now break away from the remnant of the iran deal or jcpoa and we must all work together toward make a deal with iran that make the world a safe and more peaceful place we must also make a deal that allow iran to thrive and prosper and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential iran can be a great country

 peace and stability can not prevail in the middle east as long as iran continue to foment violence unrest hatred and war the civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the iranian regime your campaign of terror murder mayhem will not be tolerate any long it will not be allow to go forward

 today i be go to ask nato to become much more involve in the middle east process over the last three year under my leadership our economy be strong than ever before and america have achieve energy independence these historic accomplishment change our strategic priority these be accomplishment that nobody think be possible and option in the middle east become available we be now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world we be independent and we do not need middle east oil

 the american military have be completely rebuild under my administration at a cost of $ 2.5 trillion us armed forces be strong than ever before our missile be big powerful accurate lethal and fast under construction be many hypersonic missile

 the fact that we have this great military and equipment however do not mean we have to use it we do not want to use it american strength both military and economic be the good deterrent

 three month ago after destroy 100 percent of isis and its territorial caliphate we kill the savage leader of isis al baghdadi who be responsible for so much death include the mass beheading of christians muslims and all who stand in his way he be a monster al baghdadi be try again to rebuild the isis caliphate and fail

 ten of thousand of isis fighter have be kill or capture during my administration isis be a natural enemy of iran   the destruction of isis be good for iran and we should work together on this and other shared priority

  so the theory be you could not beat she great campaigner remember the last campaign she be go to be take out she be always go to be take out then she win and people say how do that happen do not happen with he
  but she get so friendly toward i in fact one of the ad i still have i ’m put it in the archive as one of the good ad i ’ve ever make laughter and she try to convince people that we be good friend but josh end up win by five or six point
  you be unbelievable you be tough and you be something and one of the great supporter on the impeachment hoax be josh hawley he be incense actually i watch it he be incense at what they be do and what they be say
  and those be the one you know i have some that say oh i wish you do not make the call and that ’ okay if they need that it ’ incorrect it ’ totally incorrect and then you have some that use religion as a crutch they never use it before an article write today never hear he use it before but today you know it ’ one of those thing but you know it ’ a fail presidential candidate so thing can happen when you fail so badly run for president
  but josh hawley i want to thank you you be right from the beginning man do i make a good choice applause thank you josh tremendous future a man who be brilliant and who actually be deceive to an extent come from a great state utah where my poll number have go through the roof and one of the senator poll number and not this one go down big you see that you see that mike
  but mike lee be a brilliant guy he ’ difficult laughter whenever i sign bill you know we do sign a lot of legislation that ’ it ’ big and it ’ powerful but it ’ sort of everybody have to approve it and i see 99 to 1 laughter 99 to 1 i say do not tell i who ’s the one laughter be it mike yes laughter and he always have a good reason for it too by the way but he be he ’ incredible and right at the beginning he know we be right mike and i appreciate it very much you ’re just fantastic and say hello to the people of utah and tell they i ’m sorry about mitt romney i ’m sorry laughter and applause okay
  we can say that mike lee be by far the most popular senator from the state but you ’ve do a fantastic job mike in many way in many way
  a young woman who i do not know at all but she ’s be so supportive and i ’ve have great support from other people in that state and she ’s be so supportive and she ’s be downright nasty and mean about the unfairness to the president and kelly loeffler i appreciate very much thank you applause great
  she see it very early on and we have i do not know if we have other senator here but we get a hell of a lot of congressman and i ’ll go over they quickly but they have they have also be you know it help when we win 197 to nothing that ’s get to be a first kevin right be that like a first
  the republicans have this image see i say democrats be lousy politician because they have lousy policy open border sanctuary city they have horrible policy who the hell can win oh their new policy be raise taxis they want to raise taxis you know all my life i be n’t in politic but i ’d say if you ’re a politician you want to say we ’re go to lower taxis they want to raise taxis
  so they have open border sanctuary city raise everybody ’s taxis get rid of everybody ’s healthcare a hundred and eighty million people in the united states and they ’re really happy and we ’re go to give you a healthcare that ’s go to cost more money than the country could make in 30 year if it really do well that ’ one year
  so i ’ve always say they ’re lousy politician but they do two thing they be vicious and mean vicious these people be vicious adam schiff be a vicious horrible person nancy pelosi be a horrible person and she want to impeach a long time ago when she say i pray for the president i pray for the she do not pray she may pray but she pray for the opposite laughter but i doubt she pray at all
  and these be vicious people but they do two thing they stick together historically i ’m not talk now they stick together like glue that ’ how they impeach because they have whatever the number be 220 people so if they do not lose anybody they ’ll be able to impeach anybody you could be george washington you could have just win the war and they say let ’s get he out of office and they stick together and they ’re vicious as hell and they ’ll probably come back for more but maybe not because the republican party ’s poll number mitch have now go up more than any time i think since 2004 2005 and you know what happen then
  but in normal time decade you would call it that be a little unusual time it be for a very short period the republicans sic party party ’s poll number and donald trump ’s poll number be the high i ’ve ever have they so maybe they be it ’ no way to get your poll number up it ’ not worth it because from my family ’s standpoint it ’s be very unfair for my family it ’s be very unfair to the country
  think of it a phone call a very good phone call i know bad phone call this be a phone call with many people i think mike pompeo be probably on the call where be mike mike pompeo be on the call many people be on the call i know there be many people they even have apprenti bring up an old favorite word of mine the apprentice they have apprenti they have people on these call and i know there be many
  when i speak to the head of a nation and they have many people on nbsp;i mean also on do you think they just in the case of ukraine he ’ a new president seem like a very nice person by the way his whole thing be corruption he ’s go to stop corruption we even have a treaty 2001 1999 it ’ a treaty sign treaty that we will work together to root out corruption in ukraine
  i probably have a legal obligation mr. attorney to report corruption but they do not think it ’ corrupt when a son that make no money that get throw out of the military that have no money at all be work for $ 3 million up front $ 83,000 a month and that ’ only ukraine then go to china pick up $ 1.5 billion then go to romania i hear and many other country
  they think that ’ okay because if it be be ivanka in the audience be ivanka here boy my kid could make a fortune laughter they could make a fortune it ’ corrupt but it ’ not even that it ’ just general corruption
  and the other thing as mention in the call and something that i ’ve tell mike pence our great vice president i would tell he all the time and i tell he when he go on the trip because he be over there he never mention anything about this when you have your meeting it ’ a terrible thing
  but i tell mike i say mike we ’re give they money and you know you ’re always tear about that because we have our country to build we have our city to build and our road to fix but we ’re give they money tell i why be not germany pay money why be n’t france why be n’t united kingdom pay money why be n’t they pay money why be we pay they money be that a correct statement mike
  i say find out what the hell be go on and i tell that to all of my people omb i say i ask that question how much be germany pay why be not germany pay why be the united states always the sucker because we ’re a bunch of sucker but that ’s turn around fast but it make it hard when stuff like this happen because you want to focus and you want to focus perfectly
  think what we could have do if the same energy be put into infrastructure prescription drug price think of what we could have do and i ’m now talk both side think of what we could have do if we have the same genius because it ’ genius
  i will say it ’ genius on the other side maybe even more so because they take nothing and bring i to a final vote of impeachment that ’ a very ugly word to i it ’ a very dark word very ugly they take nothing they take a phone call that be a totally appropriate call i call it a perfect call because it be and they bring i to the final stage of impeachment
  but now we have that gorgeous word i never think a word would sound so good it ’s call total acquittal applause total acquittal
  so so i want to if i could real fast just introduce a few of the people i have to start with i have to start with kevin man do you do a job lucky you ’re there lucky you ’re there because it would not have work out if you do not have the right people i ’ll tell you kevin mccarthy have do an incredible job applause really stand up

  and that ’s where it come up the great word of all insurance policy so he say but i ’m afraid we can not take the risk she may lose it ’ like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you ’re 40 in other word if i win they be go to do exactly what they do to we they be go to try and overthrow the government of the united states a duly elect president
  and if i do n’t fire james comey we would have never find this stuff because when i fire that sleazebag all hell break out they be rat on each other they be run for the hill let ’s see what happen let ’s see what happen it ’ in the hand of some very talented people we ’re go to have to see what happen
  but i can tell you in my opinion these be the crookedest most dishonest dirty people i ’ve ever see they say this be strzok god hillary should win 100 million to one this be about i this be an agent from the fbi look how they let she off thirty three thousand email delete nothing happen to she nothing happen it ’ unbelievable
  but think of that god hillary should win when these guy be investigate hillary then they go to work for mueller the two of they and when muller find out that everybody know that they be 100 percent this way he let they go but they delete all of their email and text message
  so when we get the phone they be all delete could you imagine the treasure trove they illegally delete so they leave they leave bob mueller he have the look but he do not have a lot of other thing always have the look mr. g man
  and i love the fbi and the fbi love i 99 percent it be the top scum and the fbi people do not like the top scum
  so think of that 100 million to one and he ’s investigate i and then god trump be a loathsome human being be n’t he these be the people look at i i ’m really not a bad person and page say yes he ’ awful how would you like to have that this be just this be the good stuff there ’s stuff a hundred time bad than that these be all dirty people
  and now i just hear that they ’re sue the united states of america because they be interfere with we ’re not go to let it happen just not go to let it happen we can not let this happen to our country we can n’t applause
  so i ’m go to leave now and i do not know if any of you have anything to say you could say it but this be sort of a day of celebration because we go through hell
  and i ’m sure that pelosi and cryin chuck i ’ve know this guy all the the only time i ever see he cry be when it be appropriate know he for a long time cryin chuck but i ’m sure they ’ll try and cook up other thing they ’ll go through the state of new york they ’ll go through other place they ’ll do whatever they can because instead of want to heal our country and fix our country all they want to do in my opinion it ’ almost like they want to destroy our country we can not let it happen
  jim jordan do you want to say something go ahead huh mark
  representative meadow no i just i want to just say that this reflection today it be a small reflection of the kind of support you have all across the country we ’ve get your back applause
  the president well thank you thank you thank you applause
  this be a highly partisan situation pelosi say i copy it down exactly before the impeachment she want to impeach from day one by the way do not let it fool you you know she say no the impeachment be a very serious thing i say she want to impeach watch
  impeachment be so divisive to the country that unless there ’ something so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan bipartisan it be 197 to nothing and other than one fail presidential candidate and i call that half a vote because he actually vote for we on the other one but we have one fail presidential candidate that ’ the only half a vote we lose so we have almost 53 to nothing we have 197 to nothing and the only one that vote against be a guy that can not stand the fact that he run one of the bad campaign in the history of the presidency
  but she say there ’ something so compelling it have to be so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan i do not think we should go down that path because it divide the country she be right about that nbsp;“and it ’ just not worth it that be nancy pelosi a year ago right
  and i think it ’ a shame i think it ’ a shame but as i say if we can put this genius to work on road and highway and bridge and all of the thing we can do prescription drug you know we have secretary azar be here and i want to thank he for this but we have first time in 51 year where drug price actually come down last year first time in 51 year but what we can do work with both party in congress be would be unbelievable it would be unbelievable all we can do
  and i know chuck grassley be work very hard on it and mitch be work very hard on it but what we can do be be incredible what we can do just generally we ’ve do so much without it we ’ve rebuild our military we ’ve cut regulation at a level that nobody think possible we ’ll always protect our second amendment we all know that
  but i just want to tell you that it ’ an honor to be with you all i want to apologize to my family for have they have to go through a phony rotten deal by some very evil and sick people and ivanka be here and my my son and my whole family and that include barron applause that include barron who be up there as a young boy

my fellow americans tonight i want to speak with you about our nation ’s unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that start in china and be now spread throughout the world

 today the world health organization officially announce that this be a global pandemic

 we have be in frequent contact with our ally and we be marshal the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the american people

 this be the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history i be confident that by count and continue to take these tough measure we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizen and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus

 from the beginning of time nation and people have face unforeseen challenge include large scale and very dangerous health threat this be the way it always be and always will be it only matter how you respond and we be respond with great speed and professionalism

 our team be the good anywhere in the world at the very start of the outbreak we institute sweeping travel restriction on china and put in place the first federally mandate quarantine in over 50 year we declare a public health emergency and issue the high level of travel warning on other country as the virus spread its horrible infection

 and take early intense action we have see dramatically few case of the virus in the united states than be now present in europe

 the european union fail to take the same precaution and restrict travel from china and other hotspot as a result a large number of new cluster in the united states be seed by traveler from europe

 after consult with our top government health professional i have decide to take several strong but necessary action to protect the health and wellbeing of all americans

 to keep new case from enter our shore we will be suspend all travel from europe to the united states for the next 30 day the new rule will go into effect friday at midnight these restriction will be adjust subject to condition on the ground

 there will be exemption for americans who have undergo appropriate screening and these prohibition will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other thing as we get approval anything come from europe to the united states be what we be discuss these restriction will also not apply to the united kingdom

 at the same time we be monitor the situation in china and in south korea and as their situation improve we will reevaluate the restriction and warning that be currently in place for a possible early opening

 early this week i meet with the leader of health insurance industry who have agree to waive all copayment for coronavirus treatment extend insurance coverage to these treatment and to prevent surprise medical billing

 we be cut massive amount of red tape to make antiviral therapy available in record time these treatment will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus

 additionally last week i sign into law an $ 8.3 billion funding bill to help cdc and other government agency fight the virus and support vaccine treatment and distribution of medical supply testing and testing capability be expand rapidly day by day we be move very quickly

 the vast majority of americans the risk be very very low young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus the high risk be for elderly population with underlie health condition the elderly population must be very very careful

 in particular we be strongly advise that nursing home for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visit in general old americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded area

 my administration be coordinate directly with community with the large outbreak and we have issue guidance on school closure social distancing and reduce large gathering

 smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow

 every community face different risk and it be critical for you to follow the guideline of your local official who be work closely with our federal health expert and they be the good

 for all americans it be essential that everyone take extra precaution and practice good hygiene each of we have a role to play in defeat this virus wash your hand clean often use surface cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough and most of all if you be sick or not feel well stay home

 to ensure that work americans impact by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship i will soon be take emergency action which be unprecedented to provide financial relief this will be target for worker who be ill quarantined or care for other due to coronavirus

 i will be ask congress to take legislative action to extend this relief

 because of the economic policy that we have put into place over the last three year we have the great economy anywhere in the world by far

 our bank and financial institution be fully capitalize and incredibly strong our unemployment be at a historic low this vast economic prosperity give we flexibility reserve and resource to handle any threat that come our way

 this be not a financial crisis this be just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world

 however to provide extra support for american worker family and business tonight i be announce the follow additional action i be instruct the small business administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firm affect by the coronavirus

 effective immediately the sba will begin provide economic loan in affected state and territory these low interest loan will help small business overcome temporary economic disruption cause by the virus to this end i be ask congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $ 50 billion

 use emergency authority i will be instruct the treasury department to defer tax payment without interest or penalty for certain individual and business negatively impact this action will provide more than $ 200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy

 finally i be call on congress to provide americans with immediate payroll tax relief hopefully they will consider this very strongly

 we be at a critical time in the fight against the virus we make a life save move with early action on china now we must take the same action with europe we will not delay i will never hesitate to take any necessary step to protect the life health and safety of the american people i will always put the wellbeing of america first

 if we be vigilant and we can reduce the chance of infection which we will we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus the virus will not have a chance against we

 no nation be more prepared or more resilient than the united states we have the good economy the most advanced healthcare and the most talented doctor scientist and researcher anywhere in the world

 we be all in this together we must put politic aside stop the partisanship and unify together as one nation and one family

 as history have prove time and time again americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity

 our future remain bright than anyone can imagine act with compassion and love we will heal the sick care for those in need help our fellow citizen and emerge from this challenge strong and more unified than ever before

 god bless you and god bless america thank you

the president thank you very much everyone thank you thank you

 a beautiful day in the rose garden appreciate everybody be here today i ’d like to provide an update to the american people on several decisive new action we ’re take in our very vigilant effort to combat and ultimately defeat the coronavirus

 we ’ve be work very hard on this we ’ve make tremendous progress when you compare what we ’ve do to other area of the world it ’ pretty incredible a lot of that have to do with the early designation and the closing of the border

 and as you know europe be just designate as the hotspot right now and we close that border a while ago so that be lucky or through talent or through luck call it whatever you want but through a very collective action and share sacrifice and national determination we will overcome the threat of the virus

 i also announce wednesday night follow the advice of our medical professional who be do a tremendous job and we appreciate it very much that we ’re suspend the entry of foreign national who have be to europe in the last 14 day from enter the united states citizen permanent resident and our family and even the family return from europe will be subject to extra screening as well self isolation for a period of 14 day

 as the world health organization confirm today many of the thing that what we say be 100 percent correct include our designation before they of europe like our early very aggressive action with china this measure will save countless life i appreciate a number of the folk behind i a number of the people behind i say that that save a lot of life that early designation

 but it be only the beginning of what we ’re really do and now we ’re in a different phase we have some very old and obsolete rule that we have to live with it work under certain circumstance but not under mass circumstance they be there for a long time they be in place for a long time and we ’re break they down now and they ’re very usable for certain instance but not for this

 to unleash the full power of the federal government in this effort today i be officially declare a national emergency two very big word the action i be take will open up access to up to $ 50 billion of very importantly very important and a large amount of money for state and territory and locality in our share fight against this disease

 in furtherance of the order i ’m urge every state to set up emergency operation center effective immediately you ’re go to be hear from some of the large company and great retailer and medical company in the world they ’re stand right behind i and to the side of i

 i ’m also ask every hospital in this country to activate its emergency preparedness plan so that they can meet the need of americans everywhere the hospital be very engaged new york and various other place be also various engaged i just speak with governor cuomo we have a very good conversation and we ’re work very strongly with many state include new york

 the emergency order i be issue today will also confer broad new authority to the secretary of health and human services the secretary of hhs will be able to immediately waive provision of applicable law and regulation to give doctor hospital all hospital and healthcare provider maximum flexibility to respond to the virus and care for patient

 this include the follow critical authority


	 the ability to waive law to enable telehealth a fairly new and incredible thing that ’s happen in the in the not so distant past i tell you what they ’ve do with telehealth be incredible it give remote doctor visit and hospital check in
	 the power to waive certain federal license requirement so that doctor from other state can provide service and state with the great need number two
	 the ability to waive requirement that critical access hospital limit the number of bed to 25 and the length of stay to 96 hour
	 the ability to waive the requirement of a three day hospital stay prior to admission to a nursing home big thing
	 the authority to waive rule that hinder hospital ability to bring additional physician on board or obtain need office space they can do as they want they can do what they have to do they know what they have to do now they do not have any problem get it do
	 the authority to waive rule that severely restrict where hospital can care for patient within the hospital itself ensure that the emergency capacity can be quickly establish


 we ’ll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they ’re entitle to no resource will be spare nothing whatsoever

 ten day ago i bring together the ceo of commercial lab at the white house and direct they to immediately begin work on a solution to dramatically increase the availability of test other country have call we and work with we and they ’re do similar thing or will be do similar thing

 as a result of that action today we ’re announce a new partnership with private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the coronavirus we want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely quickly and conveniently but we do not want people to take a test if if we feel that they should not be do it and we do not want everyone run out and take only if you have certain symptom

 use federal emergency authority the fda approve a new test for the virus we do this within hour after receive the application from roche a process that would normally take week we therefore expect up to a half a million additional test will be available early next week we ’ll be announce location probably on sunday night

 i want to thank roche a great company for their incredible work i ’d also like to thank thermo fisher the fda ’s goal be to hopefully authorize their application within 24 hour it’ll go very quickly it ’s go very quickly which will bring additionally 1.4 million test on board next week and 5 million within a month i doubt we ’ll need anywhere near that

 at the same time we ’ve be in discussion with pharmacy and retailer to make drive thru test available in the critical location identify by public health professional the goal be for individual to be able to drive up and be swab without have to leave your car

 i want to thank google google be help to develop a website it ’s go to be very quickly do unlike website of the past to determine whether a test be warrant and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location

 we have many many location behind we by the way we cover the this country in large part so the world by the way we ’re not go to be talk about the world right now but we cover very very strongly our country store in virtually every location

 google have 1,700 engineer work on this right now they ’ve make tremendous progress our overriding goal be to stop the spread of the virus and to help all americans who have be impact by this

 again we do not want everybody take this test it ’ totally unnecessary and this will pass this will pass through and we ’re go to be even strong for it we ’ve learn a lot a tremendous amount have be learn

 i want to thank deborah birx and i want to ask she maybe to come up and say a few word as to what ’s happen dr. birx be a highly respect person i ’ve get to know she very well over the last six day and what we ’ve do be rebuild something that be very old very old fashion somewhat obsolete certainly obsolete when it come to the kind of number that we ’re talk about

 dr. birx please thank you deborah

 dr birx thank you mr. president it ’ a pleasure to be here with all of you

 i think you know at the beginning of this epidemic hhs through cdc proactively develop an assay build on the exist flu surveillance system that surveillance system be then convert to diagnostic system

 but last tuesday see the spread of the virus around the globe the president realize that our current approach to testing be inadequate to need to meet the need of the american public he ask for an entire overhaul of the testing approach he immediately call the private sector laboratory to the white house as note and charge they with develop a high throughput quality platform that can meet the need of the american public

 we be grateful to labcorp and quest for take up the charge immediately after the meeting and within 72 hour bring additional testing access particularly to the outbreak area of washington state and california and now across the country

 we be also very grateful to the university and large hospital system that take up the charge to develop their own quality test make available by new fda guidance this have result in expand testing across new york california washington colorado and you see sometimes those drive thru option that have be make available through these high throughput option

 follow the meeting last week major commercial laboratory equipment and diagnostic company take immediate action to adopt and develop new testing system last night the initial company roche receive fda approval move from request to development to approval in record time

 this innovative approach center fully on unleash the power of the private sector focus on provide convenient testing to hundred of thousand of americans within short turnaround time in less than two week together we have develop a solution that we believe will meet the future need testing need of americans

 i understand how difficult this have be i be part of the hiv aids response in the 80 we know from diag from first find case in 1981 it take we to almost 1985 to have a test it take we another 11 year to have effective therapy it be because of the lesson learn from that that we be able to mobilize and bring those individual that be key to the hiv response to this response

 i understand that a lot of this behind the scene action over the last couple of week be invisible to the press and the american people but this intense effort have not only result in innovative solution but an automate high throughput system bring the availability of these quality coronaviral testing to the american people at unprecedented speed

 finally i want you to know in south korea they do have large number of test available over the last several week their positivity rate be between 3 and 4 percent with labcorp and quest expand testing their positivity rate be between 1 and 2 percent

 so we want to also announce this new approach to testing which will start in the screen website up here facilitate by google where client and patient and people that have interest can go fill out a screening questionnaire move down for symptom or risk factor yes they would move down this and be tell where the drive thru option would be for they to receive this test the lab will then move to the high throughput automate machine to be able to provide result in 24 to 36 hour

 that be the intent of this approach we have see it work just in our own united states and we want to bring this across the continent

 thank you very much

 the president thank you very much deborah great

 i ’d like to maybe have tony do you want to come up you ’ve become a i think everybody out here know you pretty well but tony have be do a tremendous job work long long hour and you ’ve see a lot happen but this have be it ’s be a great experience and work with you have be terrific

 tony please

 dr fauci thank you very much mr. president this be an example of another example of what i ’ve be refer to in my discussion with many of you in the audience as a proactive lean forward aggressive try to stay ahead of the curve

 and what you ’re see now with this order be that we ’re go to be able to remove the constraint so that people at the state and the local level the individual physician all the way up through the federal government will have as many constraint as possible remove for they to do everything they possibly can so that we can implement the thing that we ’ve be talk about the containment the mitigation so that as i ’ve say many time that curve that i refer to that go up we do not want to have that curve we want to suppress it down to that small mound

 and i think what we ’ve do today be something that be go to be a very important element in have we be successful in do that

 we still have a long way to go there will be many more case but we ’ll take care of that and ultimately as the president say this will end but what ’s go on here today be go to help it to end soon than it would have

 thank you

 the president thank you very much tony

 it ’ important to remember that they be there for we when we be grow up mr. president they help we with our homework they tuck we in at night they cheer we on as we pursue education cheer we on in our career and now it ’ time for we to be there with they and to recognize that senior with chronic health condition be the most vulnerable and americans can make a difference so wash your hand use common sense look after the most vulnerable

 and mr. president i know i join you in say that every american should be proud of this incredible public private partnership that ’s go to speed access of testing to million of americans in the week ahead

 and together as you ’ve say many time together we ’ll get through this together we ’ll put the health of america first

 the president thank you mike thank you very much

 seema where be seema i ’d like you to maybe take that a step far please on nursing home thank

 administrator verma thank you well thank you to the president for the declaration it allow my agency cms that run medicare and medicaid and have oversight of all of the nation ’s healthcare facility to suspend regulation that can get in the way of treat patient during this time

 these temporary national blanket waiver be reserve for the rare of circumstance and they represent a massive mobilization of our country ’s resource to combat this terrible virus and the flexibility we be offer will be a god send to the provider clinician and facility on the frontline of this fight

 and later cms be go to be issue guidance direct nursing home to temporarily restrict all visitor and non essential personnel with a few exception such as end of life situation

 we fully appreciate that this measure represent a severe trial for resident of nursing home and those who love they but we be do what we must to protect our vulnerable elderly thank you

 the president thank you very much seema

 as i say in my address to the nation the other night all americans have a role to play in defeat this virus our most effective weapon right now be to limit the damage to our people and our country and slow the spread of the virus itself

 the choice we make the precaution we put into place be critical to overcome the virus reduce its spread and shorten the duration of the pandemic which be what it be

 the cdc have publish guideline on the coronavirus.gov to enable it ’s coronavirus.gov and it ’ very very heavily use right now i will say to enable every american to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves their family and their community while the risk to young and healthy americans remain very low we ’ve learn a lot about this over the last two week anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to old americans and those with underlie health condition and those who be most at risk they have not do very well old americans who be especially if they have a health problem they have not do well

 we must take all precaution and be responsible for the action that we take and that we see other people take we want to prevent the spread and transmission of the disease

 it ’ incredible what’s sport what ’s happen with the sporting world where so many of the great sport that we ’ve get so used to at this time of the year they ’re not go to be meet and they ’ve do a great service actually but that would be another way that it could be problem could be cause

 but this be why i outline on wednesday night my admiss administration’s the fact that we ’ve issue a requirement suspending all medically unnecessary visit to various place but in particular nursing home we should all be work off the same playbook when it come to protect americans we have to

 we need to be consistent in adopt measure to limit the spread of the virus the virus be the same whether it ’s spread in city town or rural community the tool and tactic for attack it be similar no matter where you go no matter where you go you have some hotspot throughout the world right now that people would have never think possible and they ’re be very seriously affect

 key among these effort be break chain of transmission between people these measure have be adopt by many company university and school and we want to protect the safety and the health of their employee and their student i encourage everyone to follow the guideline we ’ve issue by cdc and these commonsense measure a lot of it be common sense

 for the area where the virus be spread the cdc be advise community to postpone large gathering postpone assembly social function and sporting event stagger recess and lunch for school that be not cancel limit in person meeting increase schedule cleaning and cancel work sponsor travel among numerous other step that can be take

 americans be the strong and most resilient people on earth and in the come week we will all have to make change and sacrifice but these short term sacrifice will produce long term gain

 and again i ’ve say we ’re learn a lot for the future and future problem like this or bad or worse it could get bad the next eight week be critical we can learn and we will turn a corner on this virus

 some of the doctor say it will wash through it will flow through interesting term and very accurate i think you ’re go to find in a number of week it ’s go to be a very accurate term

 in time of hardship the true character of america always shine through we live in the company of the great hero and the most inspiring citizen anywhere in the world we want to take care of our people we want to draw on the strength of our history draw on the strength of our people and we will get through this all together we will just get through it so much progress have already be make

 and frankly the number because of step that have be take be at a level that a lot of people be surprised especially when you compare they with other place with far small population

 the spirit and the will of our nation be unbreakable we will defeat this threat when america be test america rise to the occasion

 and to those family and citizen who be worried and concerned for themselves and their loved one i want you to know that your federal government will unleash every authority resource and tool at its disposal to safeguard the life and health of our people

 so we ’re with you every step of the way no nation be more prepared or more equipped to face down this crisis as you know we be rate number one in the world

 we ’re also help other nation many other nation we ’re help they a lot and they ’re do okay in some case in some case they ’re not do well at all but we ’re work with a lot of group of people and a lot of other nation

 with faith and heart and hope and love and determination we will succeed we will prevail we will be very very successful and we ’ll learn for the future

 thank you all very much if you have any question we can take some

 go ahead john please and if you ’d like to ask some of the folk up here it would be fine please

 q mr. president where be you with the house bill yesterday we talk to you in the oval office you be oppose to it what have happen since then and what ’s the holdup on that

 the president well we just do not think they ’re give enough we do not think the democrats be give enough we ’re negotiate we think we have something but all of a sudden they do not agree to certain thing that they agree to so we could have something but we do not think they ’re give enough they ’re not they ’re not do what ’ right for the country

 q and if i could ask dr. fauci

 q inaudible

 the president go ahead please

 q thank you mr. president you just mention waive interest for student loan

 the president yeah

 q you talk about buy oil from the from the spr or add to the spr what other specific target measure be your administration think about take the treasury secretary steve mnuchin say today that you ’re just in the second inning of thing that you might be undergo

 the president yeah well that ’ true and we be look at many different thing as you know you know some of they they ’ve be write about very widely but we ’re go to be release a paper in about two hour state quite a few other step very important one

 q mr. president

 please go ahead

 q like what sir if you would not mind

 the president please go ahead

 q thank you so much mr. president i want to i want to know if you be in contact with the brazilian president bolsonaro after a member of his delegation who be with you saturday be test positive

 and also senat i want to ask another question if you ’ll let i senator lindsey graham and also senator scott rick scott be self isolating be you plan to take any kind of precautionary measure to protect you and also your staff who be there with he

 the president no we have no symptom whatsoever and we have we have a great meeting with the president of brazil bolsonaro great guy very a very tremendous he ’s do he ’s do a fantastic job for brazil

 and as you know he test negative meaning nothing wrong this morning and we get that word too because we do have dinner with he we be sit next to each other for a long period of time

 q but be you in contact with he over the coronavirus crisis

 the president no we we have we ’re talk about it country to country but we do discuss if he have a problem it be report that he may have it and he do n’t fortunately

 q thank you so much mr. president dr. fauci say early this week that the lag in testing be in fact a failing do you take responsibility for that

 and when can you guarantee that every single american who need a test will be able to have a test what ’s the date of that

 the president yeah no i do not take responsibility at all because we be give a a set of circumstance and we be give rule regulation and specification from a different time it be not mean for this kind of an event with the kind of number that we ’re talk about and what we ’ve do be redesign it very quickly with the help of the people behind i and we ’re now in very very strong shape

 i think we ’ll be announce as i say sunday night and this will start very quickly and we we ’ll have we ’ll have the ability to do in the million over a very very quick period of time so no

 and what we have do and we be go to be leave a very indelible print for the future in case something like this happen again but it be a and that ’s not the fault of anybody and frankly the old system work very well for small number much small number but not for these kind of number

 tony maybe you ’d like to say something

 q by sunday night will you have

 the president tony please

 q yes please by sunday night will every american be able to get a test

 dr fauci so just to reiterate what i say to many of you multiple time it ’ inaudible of a system this system be not design for what it be design for it work very well the cdc design a good system

 if you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance be you have to embrace the private sector.&amp and this be exactly what you ’re see because you can not do it without it

 so when i say that i mean the system be not design for what we need now look forward the system will take care of it

 q and mr. president with respect you ’ve be /p&gt

 the president and interestingly if you go back please if you go back to the swine flu it be nothing like this they do not do test like this and actually they lose approximately 14,000 people and they do not do the testing they start think about testing when it be far too late

 what we ’ve do and one of the reason i think people be respect what we ’ve do we ’ve do it very early we ’ve get it very early and we ’ve also keep a lot of people out

 q mr. president

 the president yes please go ahead please

 q mr. president the last administration say that they have test a million people at this point you ’ve be

 the president well ask they how they

 q thank you mr. president i want to ask you about the european travel ban that go into effect at

 the president yeah

 q: midnight tonight and the exemption that you ’ve offer to the uk there be 17 country that be in the so call schengen zone that have few coronavirus case than the uk and just in the past 24 hour the uk have add 208 coronavirus case to their total why do they mr. president deserve an exemption and would you consider add they to this travel ban list

 the president well that be recommend to i by a group of professional and we be look at it base on the new number that be come out and we may have to include they in the list of country that we will you could say ban or whatever it be during this period of time

 but yeah their number have go up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hour so we may be add that and we may be add a couple of other and we may frankly start think about take some off

 go ahead

 q thank you mr. president i ’m a correspondent with hong kong phoenix tv you have be mention you have mention that the number in china have be decrease and china have make tremendous progress in the past two week

 the president it ’ true

 q i ’m wonder how much confidence do this give you to control the virus in the united states and do you see the datum china have be share with the united states have be helpful

 the president i think it have be helpful we ’ve be work very much with china i ’ve speak as you know with president xi they go through hell and their number be start to look very good they ’re really they ’re really look very good we ’re very happy about that we be share datum yes in fact we ’re share quite a bit of datum include the fact that some of our pharmaceutical company be work over there right now with large group of people

 yeah go ahead please

 q thank you mr. president you speak with canadian prime minister trudeau yesterday

 the president yes i do

 q do you discuss the potential closing of the border between canada and the u.s. and by extension be you consider way to salvage the $ 2 billion daily trade between the two country

 the president so we do not discuss the border we ’ve have a very good relationship just about finish with the usmca as you know he call actually he call i to tell i that i think that be the primary reason for the call

 at the time his wife have not be diagnose and she ’ a lovely lady wonderful lady great lady and since then i ’ve hear read that the result be that she have it and i be a little surprised i think he be surprised also we do discuss it prior to she ’s go to be fine but he think that she would not most likely have the virus unfortunately she do

 but we do not discuss the border yesterday no

 go ahead please

 if you have any question for these great genius up here you should even a business question relate to what we ’re talk about

 q mr. president ross palombo from abc news miami as a relatively new floridian what be your message today to the cruise line industry and the travel industry that florida depend upon and since senator rick scott and miami dade mayor carlos giménez have the same exposure as you and they be self isolate what ’s your message to they that they should not be

 the president well i do not know that i have exposure but i do n’t have any of the symptom and we do have a white house doctor and i should say many white house doctor frankly and i ask they that same question and they say you do not have any symptom whatsoever and we do not want people without symptom to go and do the test the test be not insignificant

 as far as the cruise line business we ’re with they all the way it ’ a great business it ’ a great u.s. business frankly and i know how important they be to the country that include airline but the cruise line business obviously be hit very hard

 we have a tremendous success out in oakland where we move it vice president pence do a fantastic job with that we work with uk we work with canada they take their people back and canada have approximately 600 people uk likewise take a large number of people back to the united kingdom

 and we have people quarantine it be a big operation and it work out really you do not hear about it anymore it work out really well

 mike you may even want to say something about that because that be really do properly

 the vice president well thank you mr. president and that program with the grand princess the ship be continue to be administer in the high standard orderly way as the president direct and americans that need treatment have receive they

 i speak to the governor of iowa today and some of those who now have be clear be able in proper supervision to be return to iowa where they ’re make arrangement for they to do that other in texas other in georgia again it ’ another example of the extraordinary cooperation of governor abbott governor gavin newsom governor brian kemp of georgia

 but to add to that the president direct i last saturday to travel down to miami we meet with all the leader of the cruise line industry several cruise line have announce a 60 day pause in operation our department of homeland security have praise they for do that because of the unique health challenge particularly present to senior with underlying condition

 we have a proposal from the cruise line industry but they ’re currently consider what other step that they might take perhaps even similar to what those other line have take we ’re anticipate some response on that in the next 24 hour

 but as the president say the american people cherish our cruise line industry the man and woman who work on the ship the man and woman who work on the shore all the economy that be so benefit by a vibrant cruise line industry

 and what the president have direct we to do be whether there whether there be a pause in the moment as some cruise line be do and as we all continue to discuss we want to work with the cruise line industry to ensure that when we come through this that cruise line and the medical service that be available and for the passenger and all of the crew that cruise line be safe than ever before and can prosper for many year to come

 the president go ahead please

 q this question be for drs fauci and birk sic birx dr. fauci base on what you currently know what be the trajectory for when this outbreak will peak how long will the american people have to remain on this emergency footing

 and for dr. birx as the administration try to get its arm around this test kit shortage issue the next glaring need could be respirator and related hospital equipment so what be the administration do right now to ramp up production of respirator and that kind of equipment should this outbreak persist

 dr fauci so when you have an outbreak like this particularly if you ’re try to interfere with it it ’ really impossible to predict the time element of when it ’s go to peak and when it ’s naturally go to go down

 so if you look at the situation where country really do not get to the point of try to contain and mitigate very well you see a peak over several week and then down again over other several week what we ’re try to do with the effort that we ’re do be to blunt that peak

 and i mention it many time and i think it ’ important and appropriate for i to mention it again because it answer your question when you talk about prevent infection from without in which be the kind of travel restriction we ’re talk about then how do you handle what you already have in your country you continue some sort of containment but you also do mitigation and you try to proportion it to the area where there be the most infection

 the success of that and how much you make this turn into this be go to give you the amount of time if we ’re successful it ’ll be less if we ’re not successful it ’s go to be more but these kind of thing generally run out in a few month hopefully we ’ll make it several week eight nine whatever week but i can not give you a number because it depend on how successful we be

 dr birx great thank you it ’ a great question and dr. fauci and i have work together a very long time and continue it ’ a privilege to work with he every day

 so i think you can learn very and i appreciate there be some graphic do by some of the reporting over the last several day if you align the datum from china with the datum with south korea you can start to see almost a complete overlay of that datum and so that ’ what we ’re track very closely as well as italy but you have an excellent question

 i just want to make one note in south korea i want to repeat only 4 percent of the test be positive that mean 96 percent of the people have a different respiratory disease because we ’re in the middle of flu season cold season and all of the other respiratory disease that we get every day

 in labcorp and quest ’s early datum they ’re run about 1 to 2 percent positive that mean that we have a lot more other respiratory disease out there besides the coronavirus and that ’ why the screening be critical but even with the screening we ’re go to low run what we think be very low rate

 needless to say though we ’re take it extraordinarily seriously to plan for what could come not what dr. fauci talk about blunt the curve that make it much less high need at that peak of the curve that we ’re all plan for

 so we ’re in full inventory of all of our asset by the president unlocking and this emergency order and the secretary of hhs ’s ability it unlock all of those stockpile those need what the va have what the dod have what the national guard have and what every hospital have

 and the hospital emergency preparedness plan allow they to defer elective issue to keep those hospital bed open for those who might need it so we ’re in full planning mode for each of those thing

 the president and i might add that we ’re in the process and in some case have already do it order a large number of respirator just in case we hope we do not need they but we ’ve order a large number

 yeah go ahead please

 q thank you very much mr. president in your speech to the nation you mention the situation in china and south korea have improve and you ’re think about remove the restriction also the warning

 the president right

 q: in place right now when can we expect that announcement and how do you see the overall progress that asian country make

 the president well some be make progress some be not as you know but some be make progress and as they make progress as they get down to the number that we all think be right that they know be right we know be right we’ll be open it up and some be really move along rapidly we hope to be able to open thing up as quickly as possible

 go ahead please go ahead

 q thank you mr. president i ’d like to ask secretary azar and dr. fauzi sic just how

 the president that be inaudible laughs

 q dr. fauci okay

 the president right well

 q all right

 the president well not 100 percent but 90 percent

 q right

 the president go ahead

 q this affect the elderly primarily and in that sense it ’ an unusual disease be any specific research be do as to why it affect our senior citizen more than other

 dr fauci so i do not mean to diminish your question but we already know why it would affect senior citizen more because when you talk about anything that require a robust immune system as you get old your immune system be not as potent as it be when you be young and that ’s the reason why when you talk about even influenza which we have extraordinary experience with over decade and decade the people who be very vulnerable be the elderly and those with underlying condition

 the same thing hold true for a variety of other disease why cancer be more prevalent in some in mostly in old individual because the immune system that screen for it be less robust so it really be something that be kind of well know over a lot of study

 the president okay oan please oan

 q mr. president the chinese official be express some tone of discontent with how where the source of this virus have come from and they ’re spin some odd narrative what be your response to the chinese official who be do that and have they signal any kind of resistance to upcoming trade talk in response to how we ’re handle this virus

 the president no we have our deal with china they ’re go to be buy $ 250 billion worth of good and $ 50 billion from our farmer and that ’ a great deal for our country it ’ about time somebody do that and frankly phase two we ’ll start negotiate

 i do read one article but i do not think that article be representative certainly not of my conversation with president xi and they know where it come from we all know where it come from

 q thank you mr. president yamiche alcindor from pbs newshour

 the president yes

 q my first question be you say that you do not take responsibility but you do disband the white house pandemic office and the official that be work in that office leave this administration abruptly so what responsibility do you take to that and the official that work in that office say that you that the white house lose valuable time because that office be disband what do you make of that

 the president well i just think it ’ a nasty question because what we ’ve do be and tony have say numerous time that we ’ve save thousand of life because of the quick closing and when you say i i do not do it we have a group of people i could

 q it ’ your administration

 the president i could ask perhaps my administration but i could perhaps ask tony about that because i do not know anything about it i mean you say you say we do that i do not know anything about it

 q you do not know about the

 the president we ’re spend i do n’t know it ’ the

 q: about the reorganization that happen at the national security council

 the president it ’ the it ’ the administration perhaps they do that.vyou know people let people go you use to be with a different newspaper than you be now you know thing like that happen

 q but this be a this be an org-

 the president okay please go ahead

 q this be an organization at the national security council

 the president we ’re do a great job let i tell you these professional behind i and the these great incredible doctor and business people the good in the world and i can say that whether it ’ retailer or lab or anything you want to say these be the good of the world we ’re do a great job

 we have 40 people right now forty compare that with other country that have many many time that amount and one of the reason we have 40 and other have and again that number be go up just so you understand and a number of case which be very small relatively speak it ’s go up but we ’ve do a great job because we act quickly we act early and there ’ nothing we could have do that be well than close our border to highly infect area

 please go ahead

 q thank you mr. president vanessa jaklitsch for ntn24 for latin america country

 the president yes sure

 q: and also for spain la razón and antena 3 i would like to ask you two very brief question one for how long we ’re go to have the emergency i mean the national emergency and

 the president i hope not long but it ’s there now and it give tremendous power for thing that we need tremendous power actually and the stafford act and various other thing that we ’re involve with and have study and memorize in so many different way and form it give the kind of power that we need to get rid of this virus

 and we ’re go to do it very quickly and i hope we will not need it very long but whatever it take

 q so for now we still do not know for how long and i something very important i want to ask you be like how do you think do you really think it ’ essential coordinating with other country and learn from the lesson that they already suffer the same situation country

 the president yeah

 q: of course like china and south korea but now recently

 the president sure

 q: italy and spain and how

 the president well italy be have a

 q: be that coordination do thank you so much mr. president

 the president italy be have a very yeah we ’re in touch with italy and you know it ’ a it ’ a country that we love.&amp we have tremendous million and million of people originally origin from italy and we ’re work with they they ’re in a very they ’re in probably relatively speak the tough position of all

 we ’re in touch with everybody we ’re in touch with when i say everybody we ’re in touch with many of the country that you know about that you ’re write about and they ’re call we ask for advice they ’re ask for the advice of the people behind i

 the president we and there be somebody that they say have it i have no idea who he be but i take picture and it last for literally second i do not know the gentleman that we ’re talk about i have no idea who he be i have not see the picture i say there ’ a picture of somebody but i take sometimes hundred of picture a day and that night i be take hundred of picture so i just do n’t know

 now i do sit with the president for probably two hour but he have test negative so that ’ good

 q it ’ just a matter of

 the president please go ahead

 q and the domestic travel sir

 the president go ahead please

 q the travel the first part of the question be domestic travel

 the president i would say if you stay home it ’ not bad it ’ not bad now there be certain part of the country that be essentially have no have zero problem washington have be very tough in particular a nursing home and but washington the state of washington have be very tough it ’s be a big percentage of when you talk about the 40 death that ’s be have be a big percentage of the death as you know very well and they all come from a very certain area unfortunately

 please go ahead

 q mr. president

 the president go ahead okay

 q thank you very much mr. president

 the president yes

 q cordelia lynch sky news you talk this week about the uk do a good job in tackle coronavirus in light of the rise case be you change your mind about that you also just speak about possible travel restriction have you discuss when they might be put in place

 the president well in light of the result as we discuss before in light of the result we ’re go to be look at it and i know the task force be look at it very strongly the vice president everybody it be look good but they ’ve the result have be build up pretty rapidly so we ’ll we ’ll be take another look at that yes absolutely

 go ahead please

 q mr. president thank you i want to first follow up on jeff ’s question because the person you be stand next to whether you know who he be or not test positive for coronavirus dr. fauci say this morning if you stand next to somebody who test positive you should self isolate and get a test you say your white house doctor be tell you something different who should americans listen to

 and my second question be

 the president i think they have to listen to their doctor and i think they should not be jump to get the test unless it ’ necessary but i think they have to listen to their doctor and i mean i do not know the i have n’t see the picture somebody say there ’ a picture with somebody take a picture with i but i have not see it but i can tell you

 q well doctor have say you might have it even if you do n’t have symptom

 the president well

 q be you be selfish by not getting test and potentially expose

 the president well i do not say i be not go to be test

 q be you go to be

 the president most likely yeah most likely

 q when do you think that will happen

 the president not for that reason but because i think i will do it any way fairly soon

 q will you let we know the result

 the president we ’re work on that we ’re work out a schedule

 q my second question mr. president

 the president you go ahead please

 q that be a follow up

 the president go ahead

 q inaudible off mic

 the president yeah

 q i know there ’s be a lot of talk about testing i just want to make sure we ’re clear though because we ’ve be hear from doctor who say as of today they still can not get patient test who need a test so as of today can everyone who a doctor want to have test get test and if not when when will doctor

 the president well that ’s be true for a while but i ’ll let mike why do not you answer that mike please

 the vice president well as the president say and dr. fauci have articulate the nature of our current system where the cdc have sample send and test be perform or state lab perform test or in some case university and hospital lab perform test be generally adequate for an infectious disease or for people get diagnostic work do but give the sheer scale of this the president task we with bring together this extraordinary public and private partnership

 today by some estimate when you add all the lab together and today the president make it possible for every state in the country and their state lab to authorize lab across their state to do coronavirus testing

 we we ’re estimate somewhere between 15- and 20,000 test a day be able to be perform but very soon with the program that be announce today americans will be able to visit one of the site close to they as describe on the website if they ’re symptomatic if the questionnaire indicate it to be able to have a test there and these incredible company will process the test and they ’ll receive that information

 but for now the good advice that we can give for people be to speak to their doctor as the president just say and if the doctor indicate that physician if it ’s not a university hospital or otherwise authorize lab can contact the state lab and again every state lab in the country can perform test today

 but what the president charge we with when i be tasked to take over the white house coronavirus task force be open up test all across the country and the president say a few day ago that we make it clear that any american that want to get a test would be able clinically to get a test because i literally hear from the governor of washington state who say the doctor in washington state be say that if you be only mildly symptomatic they would not order a test and fortunately the president direct cdc to clarify that

 now anyone in consultation with their physician regardless of their symptom can request a test and their doctor will contact those agency those lab in their state but very soon americans will be able to go to these these drive in site and be able to obtain and participate in a test

 dr. birx be there more to amplify that

 dr birx no i think i think that ’s perfectly say i think just to review one more time about the testing with labcorp and quest i think many of you have be to a doctor ’s office and see the little box outside what they do be they deliver both the specimen collection piece because remember it ’ a nasal swab it ’ not a tube of blood so they ’ve deliver that to doctor office and hospital and then they will arrange to pick that up

 the important piece in this all be they ’ve go from a machine that may have a low throughput to the potential to have automated extraction i know you do not want all of these detail but it ’ really key for the laboratory people it ’ an automated extraction of the rna that then run in an automate way on the machine with no one touch it and the result come out at the other end

 so sample to machine to result that cut out a lot of the manual piece that be happen that be delay the test result

 q and so with that what ’s the timeline like from when you ’re test to when you get result like next week what should people expect

 dr birx well with the prior testing it be take several day because the test be slow we believe with this test because of its throughput that the testing can be from start remember it have to transport to the laboratory that will run it and then we ’re hope that all can be finish within 24 hour which be very similar to other test that you receive today

 these be not point of care test we be work on point of care test but we have to realize point of care test take six month or more to develop so we ’re not wait for those we ’re still diagnose this on nucleic acid so as an antibody this be actually the antigen the actual virus in your nose that we ’re amplify

 the president i think you have to remember though we ’re work very closely with state and you have a small form and more targeted form of government go in and do it like in new york where the relationship be very good like gavin newsom where he make some very complimentary because that ’ california he make some really complimentary comment the other day about how we ’re work together we work on the ship together but we work on a lot of other thing together have to do with this

 and we ’re well really the relationship that we have i can not think of a bad relationship we ’re help they we ’re fund they in some case depend on what it be you ’re talk about and we ’re all work together very closely so we ’ve do really i think a tremendous job of teamwork with the different state

 all right one or two more and if you have if you have question for these folk do anybody have a question for the folk up here who have a question up here you have okay go ahead if you have a question go ahead

 q thank you i have one for you as well

 the president okay i think i know you would

 q laughs no but i do have one for they because i have not hear this yet

 the president i be wait for that go ahead

 q because i have not hear this yet

 the president ask they first please

 q yes i will okay with regard to the ceo can you please tell we when you expect to see item like hand sanitizer that have be go out of stock very quickly back on the shelf there have be a lot of report about that

 and for you mr. president could you talk about a potential bailout for the cruise industry you have suggest that could happen be that something you ’re still look at and how much would that be

 the president well i do not suggest that it could happen but i can tell you it ’ an industry that be very badly impact by what ’s go on with the virus and it ’ a great industry it ’ a very important industry and we will be help they and we will be help the airline industry if we have to assume we have to

 so far people have not be ask but if they should be ask we ’ll we want to make sure our airline be very strong and then one day and one day all of a sudden it be not look so good

 interestingly we be just talk i be talk to doug and the number they ’re do from the retailing standpoint i guess because of this your business be like the opposite all of you have do you’ve been sell a lot of a lot of stuff do you want to answer the question as to the hand sanitizer

 mr mcmillon sure yeah specifically the area where we ’re see pressure in the supply chain be surface cleaner clean supply paper good in particular hand sanitizer be go to be very difficult to have 100 percent in stock on for some time we ’re still replenish it and ship it but as soon as it hit the store it ’s go the same thing be true for the category i just mention so all of the retailer will be work hand in hand with the supplier to bring that to the market as fast as we can

 q what be your advice though for americans who be seek those item what be your advice they ’re sell out online they ’re sell out in the store what

 mr mcmillon i think i think this team have give you other example of what people can do to fight back against this virus and you should look at the entire list

 the president please

 dr fauci please i mean obviously it sound very simplistic but wash your hand as often as you possibly can and i know you ’re not always in a position to be able to wash your hand but wash they as much as you can if you do n’t have the alcohol wipe try and get they if you can not get they just try as well as possible to do it i mean you get to do the good you can

 the president alex please

 secretary azar well just general preparedness you know you want to wash your hand you want to keep distance from people and if you ’re around someone sick keep away from they just basic basic public health

 no these guy be sell a lot of toilet paper i do not know there seem tony do you need to give some guidance that toilet paper be not an effective protection against get the coronavirus laughs they ’re sell out but the soap and water hot water soap 20 second that ’ how you do it

 the president okay one more go ahead go ahead no over here behind you behind you

 q thank you very much mr. president you have a great team of course

 the president that ’ true thank you

 q my question be to mr. president be you happy from the chinese response what correctly really tell you what really happen those day

 and second prime minister modi or india have close border until april 15th if you have speak with the prime minister of india and if they have need any help

 and finally sir any message for the small business because they be lose some business because of this thank you sir

 the president well on small business the small business administration be now stack with money to help they and we ’re go to make the money readily available if they need it small business

 we have a great time in india it be an incredible two day and he ’ a great friend of mine and he ’ a friend of his people because he be greet incredibly warmly as be i and that stadium that be an incredible event and i love be with he so just say hello to he but we we talk about everything we talk about far more than just border

 and as far as president xi likewise he ’ a friend of mine i believe that we be deal in good faith and we just work to as you know and as i just say we just work an incredible deal a big deal one of the big deal ever make of any kind big even by the standard of some of the people here the deal with china but i think that they want to get to the bottom of thing also

 we ’re work our drug company our pharmaceutical company be work very closely with china and with india as you know and with all over the world and they ’re all over the world these be magnificent company that be very very knowledgeable

 and it ’s we ’re very lucky to have they because i think you ’re go to come up with whether it ’ therapeutic or whether it ’s just help help get well and then ultimately a vaccine which take a little bit long because of the test period and a couple of other reason you ’re go to have it very quickly because of the great knowledge and they ’ll have it very quickly they ’ve make a tremendous amount of progress

 thank you all very much we appreciate it thank you thank you very much

the president thank you very much everyone my administration will do everything possible to help those community get back on their foot we ’re speak with the governor and representative fema be already on its way and they get there as soon as we hear the word i say get out there so fema be there and you know the great job that fema do it ’s really something very special

 so we just want to say warm condolence and we ’re with you all the way it ’ a tough deal that be a bad bed level five that be a bad group that ’s as high as it get it be a bad grouping of tornado something that ’ something incredible the power the horrible destructive power

 america be continue to make critical progress in our war against the virus over the weekend the number of daily new infection remain flat nationwide flat hospitalization be slow in hotspot like new york new jersey michigan and louisiana this be clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus be work and that americans be follow the guideline it ’s be incredible what they ’ve do

 you look at the chart and the chart be and the model from early on prediction be 100 thousand and 120,000 people look like if they do well they be go to unfortunately perish and we ’re go to be hopefully way way below that number so that will be a sign of people do thing right but it ’s still just a horrible thing all over the world a hundred and eighty four country

 this be all a tribute to our wonderful healthcare advisor and expert who have be with we right from the beginning we appreciate it so much in fact dr. fauci be here maybe i could ask tony to say a few word before we go any far

 thank you very much tony please

 dr fauci thank you mr. president just one a couple of thing and then i just want to make a comment about something that happen yesterday

 you ’re go to hear from dr. birx soon about the number that we ’ve be talk about and how thing be start to balance off and i think the more as we go by each day i think we ’re go to see and again i never like to get ahead of myself or of dr. birx but it look like even though we ’ve have a really bad week last week remember when i be speak to you before i be say this be really a bad week there ’s still go to be a lot of death but we ’re start to see in some area now that kind of flattening particularly in a place that be a hotspot like new york that ’ the first thing

 the second thing be that i have a really very very productive conversation with the congressional black caucus this morning for about an hour and they really want to know what exactly be we go to be do in the immediate as well as the long range about the health disparity and the discrepancy both in infection and in poor outcome in the minority in general but specifically african american

 and i mean i make it very clear to they that what we have to do be focus on get the resource where the vulnerable be to be able to get testing do to be able to get the appropriate identification where proper and where appropriate to isolate and contact trace if we can but also to help mitigate in a community that be suffer and suffer much more disproportionately

 so i just want to get that out of the way

 the other point i want to make be that i have an interview yesterday that i be ask a hypothetical question and hypothetical question sometimes can get you into some difficulty because it ’ what would have or could have the nature of the hypothetical question be if in fact we have mitigate early could life have be save and the answer to my question be as i always do and i ’m do right now perfectly honestly say yes i mean obviously if you mitigation help

 i ’ve be up here many time tell you that mitigation work so if mitigation work and you instigate and you initiate early you will probably have save more life if you initiate it later you probably would have lose more life if you initiate at a certain time

 that be take as a way that maybe somehow something be at fault here

 so let i tell you from my experience and i can only speak from my own experience be that we have be talk before any meeting that we have about the pro and the con the effectiveness or not of strong mitigation so discussion be go on mostly among the medical people about what that would mean

 the first and only time that dr. birx and i go in and formally make a recommendation to the president to actually have a quote shutdown in the sense of not really shutdown but to really have strong mitigation we discuss it obviously there would be concern by some that in fact that might have some negative consequence nonetheless the president listen to the recommendation and go to the mitigation

 the next second time that i go with dr. birx in to the president and say fifteen day be not enough we need to go thirty day obviously there be people who have a problem with that because of the potential secondary effect nonetheless at that time the president go with the health recommendation and we extend it another 30 day

 so i can only tell you what i know and what my recommendation be but clearly as happen all the time there be interpretation of that response to a hypothetical question that i just think it would be very nice for i to clarify because i do not have the chance to clarify

 thank you

 q the date on that

 dr fauci excuse i

 q the date

 dr fauci you know to be honest with you i do not even remember what the date be but i can just tell you the first and only time that i go in and say we should do mitigation strongly the response be yes we ’ll do it

 q and what do he do be that the travel restriction

 dr fauci no the travel restriction be separate that be whether or not we want to go into a mitigation stage of 15 day of mitigation the travel be another recommendation when we go in and say we probably should be do that and the answer be yes and then another time be we should do it with europe and the answer be yes and the next time we should do it with the uk and the answer be yes

 q in this interview you say there be pushback

 dr fauci yeah

 q where do that pushback come from

 dr fauci no it wasn’t that be the wrong choice of word you know what it be when people discuss not necessarily in front of the president when people discuss they say well you know this be go to have maybe a harmful effect on this or on that so it be a poor choice of word there be n’t anybody say no you should not do that

 q be you do this voluntarily or do the president

 dr fauci no i ’m do it

 q:—or vice president ask you to do this

 dr fauci everything i do be voluntarily please do not even imply that

 q so mr. president the question be

 the president and by the way the travel ban that be early the travel ban be do early

 q you could not give we a date when he talk to you

 the president and if you look at statistic i happen to write a couple of they down if you look at statistic so on january 6th that ’s long before the date you ’re talk about there be cdc issue a travel notice for wuhan china a notice before there be even a confirmed case of the virus in the united states that ’ on january 6th this be all document because we have so much fake news i like to document thing january 6th long before the date we ’re talk about cdc issue travel notice to wuhan for wuhan

 on january 11th we have zero case in the united states zero we do not have any case so there be no case report that we know of this be january 11th the cdc issue a level one travel notice health for health while there be still no confirmed case so we have zero case people want i to act i ’m suppose to close down the economy the great economy in the history of the world and we do not have one case confirm in the united states that ’ january 11th

 on january 17th the cdc begin implement public health entry screening at three major u.s. airport that receive the great volume of passenger from wuhan at my instruction there be not a single case of the coronavirus in the united states so on january 17th there be n’t a case and the fake news be say oh he do not act fast enough well you remember what happen because when i do act i be criticize by nancy pelosi by sleepy joe biden i be criticize by everybody in fact i be call xenophobic i be ask biden to please define that for i i be call other thing by democrats and some other not too many other actually so that by the medium definitely

 now on january 21st this be long before the time we ’re talk because when tony be talk i believe he ’s talk about the end of february on january 21st okay still early there be one case of the virus at that time we call it the wuhan virus right wuhan there be one case in the whole united states we have one case this be all document it all come from you a lot of it come from you people

 on january 21st the cdc activate an emergency operation center there be just one case one person that ’ why that ad be such a phony there be one person in the united states you know they use the ad there ’ only one person that statement be make at that time one case in the whole united states one case i ’m suppose to shut down the government the big the big economy in the history of the world shut it down we have one case

 seven case be on january 31st now on january 21st there be a case not one person have die you hear that steve right not one person

 so we have this massive country the united states of america we have the great economy in the world big than china ’s by a lot right?—because of what we ’ve do over the last three and a half year prior to the virus but include the virus so we have the big economy the great economy we ’ve ever have the high employment number the good employment number good unemployment number also the good of everything

 so on january 31st think of it not one person have die not one nobody die not one jon i do not think you ’ll find any this be report by cdc confirm by the news which do not mean anything to i because they do not tell the truth but cdc report january 31st not one person have die
 and i issue a travel restriction from china think of it so nobody die and i issue you can not get early than that

 so we have nobody die and i say china you can not come in i ’m sorry because i see what be go on it be n’t so much what i be tell it be that i see what be go on and i do not like it but i do not speak to tony about it do not speak to very many people about it i do not like it

 so what do i do ready january 31st in the united states not one person have die because of the again the wuhan virus so i issue travel restriction on that date even though nobody die and i get brutalize over it by the press because i be way too early i should not have do it brutalize by the press but you know sort of i’ve be brutalize for the last four year i use to do well before i decide to run for politic but i guess i ’m do okay because to the good of my knowledge i ’m the president of the united states despite the thing that be say

 so then first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 year we do first mandatory in 50 year the same restriction that the democrats and the medium call xenophobic now joe biden say he ’ a racist he call i a racist because i say we ’re shut down entry from china we ’re shut it down he call i xenophobic and he call i racist and other thing

 since then on a friday night two week ago joe biden issue a state-—it be not he he do not write it i ’m sure he do not even know that it be issue but the people from his campaign who be smart the people that write those little pr release be pretty smart reasonably good not the good but they ’re not bad but they issue a statement say that joe biden agree that the pres-—that president trump be right to close it down to china now he do that

 now he issue it on friday night we ’ve all hear about that jon friday night right in fact his be later friday night than i ever release mine on friday night okay

 q inaudible seem pretty late

 the president so he do he do it pretty late i mean you know like at 11 o’clock in the evening or something you know that ’ pretty late anyway so joe biden issue and it ’ one of those thing

 but in february nancy pelosi say we should come to chinatown this be late february come to chinatown we think it ’ very safe come here let ’s all have the big parade chinatown parade probably refer to san francisco and that ’s it

 but i take this action early and so the story in the new york times be a total fake it ’ a fake newspaper and they write fake story and someday hopefully in five year when i ’m not here those paper be all go out of business because nobody be go to want to read they but now they like they because they write about i

 now with that i have a couple of interesting we have a few clip that we ’re just go to put up we could turn the light a little bit low i think you ’ll find they interesting and then we ’ll answer some question i ’ll ask you some question because you ’re so guilty but forget it but most importantly we ’re go to get back onto the reason we ’re here which be the success we ’re have okay

 please you could put it on thank you

 a video be play

 so we could give you hundred of clip like that from governor include democratic or democrat as i call they governor which be actually the correct term we could give you hundred of clip just like that we have they we do not want this to go on too long but i just want to say it’s you know it ’ very sad when people write false story like in that case i guess it be get mostly from the new york times which be a highly i mean if you have libel law they would have be out of business even before they ’ll end up go out of business so it ’ too bad

 but we could have give you you see the statement we have hundred of statement hundred of statement include from democrats and democrat governor

 and if you look they be all say we need ventilator we need you do not hear ventilator anymore they have all the ventilator they need which we be right about we say you ’re ask for too many you do not need that and in all fairness these two people right here dr. birx dr. fauci they say i do not think they need that many ventilator and i say i agree

 at one point and i ’m not knock new york for this but they be ask you remember?—40,000 ventilator and that ’s more than they have all over the country and we get they a lot of ventilator and nobody have complain

 we get they as you know beautiful we build hospital room all over the country the governor of louisiana john bel edwards be very nice he say you know what you do not have to build a second hospital because good news be happen they ’re not able to fill the bed they need two hospital we build one it be perfect we ’re get we’re just start the other i call he up i say do you think we should build the second one i do not think you ’re go to need it he say let i get back he get back we do not need it

 with governor cuomo in all good spirit and faith he want to have the jacob javits center do and we build 2,900 incredible bed incredible then we make it we make it covid and or to be exactly accurate covid-19 and which be a lot of work we have to change the ductwork we have to seal up certain area we have to put area of rooftop thing over the bed we do a lot of work and we have it but they never really have too much use for it

 and they call also mayor de blasio rightfully he call he say would it be possible to get more medical help so now not only be we build facility we’re they’re ask we for help because they ’re unable to man it and we get he the help we get mayor de blasio a lot of help

 then when the javits center be not use much and then as you know the mercy and we take the mercy and we take the comfort and we make they both los angeles and new york we make they covid adaptable which be not easy to do and we do not get almost any people send there they do not need they at the beginning because they do not need it for anything but this because there be few accident few motorcycle few everything

 and what we do be like an incredible job but they do not need they it turn out they be there we be ready you know the expression they have an expression ready willing and able we be ready willing and able what the army corps of engineers do be a miracle what what fema do be a miracle what the doctor do

 so i get a call two day ago from the mayor of new york he say could you help we even more with medical personnel and we send i think it be 448 doctor nurse and respiratory expert real expert and i get a call from the mayor and he say i want to tell you incredible these people be incredible he say they lift the spirit of the hospital worker from new york city like nothing i ’ve ever see he’s he be unbelievable what he say it be really appreciate and i let they know that i let the military people he say they go in there so brave so incredible they lift the spirit of everybody

 we do all of this work but when you read the phony story you nobody nobody acknowledge this and it do not have to be acknowledge from my standpoint but it do have to be acknowledge from the great work that these doctor nurse the army corps of engineers fema all these people they ’ve do this incredible job and they should not be abuse because you take a look at what ’s happen nobody be ask for ventilator except outside of our country

 outside of our country they ’re call i every country they ’re call i so many country and i ’m go to try and help they because we have thousand of ventilator be build but nobody be ask for ventilator nobody be ask for bed because we build hospital i think we build 20,000 bed in a period of a couple of week

 the job they ’ve do be incredible with all of that be say i ’m get along very well with governor and if i would n’t mike pence have a call today with the governor and it be like a 10 i say how be it he say it ’ a 10 he be one of my expression actually but he say it be like a 10

 and i ’m sure you people be probably on the call although you be not suppose to be but you be sit in somebody ’s office listen to it because every time we have these and you know and you would know that for week those call have be very good but there be n’t a raise voice there be not even a statement of like we think you should do this or that i hear it be like just a perfect phone call it might not be report that way they ’ll say i think that somebody maybe slightly raise do not even raise a voice

 my only point of say this because i want to get back to why we ’re here the press have not treat these incredible people who ’ve do such a great job they have not treat they fairly they ’re way off we be way ahead of schedule

 and remember this because the times story be a fake but everything remember this everything we do i be criticize because i be too early if i wait long it would have be you would have be critic-—if i go way early if i go three month early i would have be criticize you know criticize for be way too early

 so with all of that be say we understand it i think i ’ve educate a lot of people as to the press and i would love to be able to say that we have a very honest press honestly jon there ’d be nothing i would be more proud of if the press would work and i do n’t mind be criticize but not when they ’re wrong not when people have do a great job

 yes

 q can i just ask you about the video because i ’ve never see a video like that play in this room it look a bit like a campaign ad who who produce that video for you

 the president that be do by a group in the office and it be do just by we just put some clip together   i could give you i’ll bet you i have over 100 more clip even well than they they be just piece together over the last two hour that be just oh we have far well than that that ’ nothing compare to some of they

 q but this be produce here in the white house by

 the president yeah this be do by dan and a group of people and they just put it together in a period of probably less than two hour

 q why do you feel the need to do that

 the president because we ’re get fake news and i like to have it correct they ’re say what a great job we ’re do and the medium these be the governor of california governor of new jersey governor of new york

 look in new york we work very close with andrew in new york ventilator we’re go to be probably we didn’t they do not have a problem we get they tremendous number of thousand but we get they a tremendous number of ventilator you do not hear ventilator be a problem bed be go to be a problem i mean i ’m happy about it the javits center which be incredible be almost empty because they do not need they that ’ good news not bad news i’m you know i ’m not say gee i wish more people be there i do not want more people there

 we bring in the boat we bring in the comfort and the comfort be originally not suppose to be for this at all the coronavirus it be not suppose to be for that at all they call they say could we have it that be a number of week ago we say we do not think you need it but if you need it we ’ll do it then they say could you get the medical personnel to run the javits center could you get the medical personnel to run the ship we say if it ’ necessary we will and we do there be military personnel that ’ the one that mayor de blasio be so great to in term of his statement i mean i really appreciate his statement he be so impressed with they and i be too the level of genius and bravery they ’re great people the military people

 and we piece that together i would say it take less than two hour it be do in house

 steve

 q but just to be clear this be produce by government employee by people here at the white house this campaign style video here

 the president i would not use the word produce all they do be take some clip and they just run they for you and the reason they do be to keep you honest now i do not think that ’s go to work it ’s not go to have any impact but just think of it you hear the clip you hear what i say they say i act late on close down the country

 some people wish we never close it down now if we do n’t we would have lose hundred of thousand of people you know interestingly so i’m i’m against that we do the right thing everything we do be right if we would have close down

 q you do not think you make any mistake along the way here you think everything you do be right

 the president well well look governor should have have ventilator they choose not to have they we be able to get they ventilator you have not hear other than you know there be a lot of panic a lot of screaming we want ventilator they get the ventilator you do not have that anymore and the surge be suppose to be come now and if they do need ventilator jon we ’ve get almost 10,000 that be ready to rock we have people stand with those ventilator right now if you need 2,000 in new york which you do n’t but if you do we can have they here in less than 24 hour we ’re ready to rock this be a great this be a great military and beyond that operation

 let ’s get back to the regular should not we get back to the regular we could talk about this but all i ’m do be this i could have give you like those be four or five clip that we just play for you i could have give you hundred of people i mean gavin be on television two day ago with one of your competitor singing praise he say look you know the question be ask in a negative way he say look i know what you want to say but want i to say but he ’s be really good it ’ hard for i to say that in fact it ’ impossible for i to say it gavin newsom the governor of california

 i have many clip from many i have some clip from anthony that i do not want to put up which be really good i think anthony would be the first one to say when i close the country to china when i close the the china ban whatever you want to call it anthony say i save a lot of life by do that i mean be i correct i do not want to put word in anthony ’s mouth by the way and i like he

 today i walk in and i hear i ’m go to fire he i ’m not fire i think he ’ a wonderful guy

 q but why do you tweet something that say fire fauci why do you

 q you retweete the hashtag firefauci

 the president i retweete somebody i do not know they say fire it do not matter

 q do you notice that when you retweete it

 the president yeah i notice everything

 q so you retweete it even though it say time to fire fauci

 the president no no that ’ somebody ’s opinion all that be be an opinion

 q but you read it and you elevate it

 the president no i be call about that i say i ’m not fire he in fact if you ask your friend in the office in the public relation office i be immediately call upon that and i say no i like he i think he ’ terrific because this be a person ’s view not everybody be happy with anthony not everybody be happy with everybody

 but i will tell you we have do a job the like of which nobody have ever do the mobilization get of equipment all of the thing we ’ve do nobody have ever do a job like this

 we have 50 governor and territory by the way people do not ever mention that we have territory we have 50 governor and territory and many of those governor be democrats and they can not find anything to complain about and honestly many of they do not do their job i ’ll let you know someday let ’s see what happen but i may let you know who ’s not do their job i can tell you the one that be good both republican and democrat and the one who do not know what they ’re do but we help some of the one that do not know what they ’re do they should have have their own stockpile and now if they want we can build they stockpile of ventilator

 the hard thing be a ventilator because it ’ expensive it take a while to get we get they and nobody believe we do

 now many of the governor be ask for far too many and we say they be ask for far too many we talk and we say you say very strongly that they just do not need that many you say they do not need that many bed deborah

 so that ’s it   steve go ahead

 q to be clear you and dr. fauci be on the same page

 the president yeah we have be from the beginning i do not know what it be exactly but if i put somebody ’s opinion up you know i do not mind controversy i think controversy be a good thing not a bad thing but i want it to be honest controversy

 now when i get a call i get a call not very quickly nobody you know see that as be any big deal they say how be you do with dr. fauci i say i ’m do great and i do not talk to dr. fauci even until we just get here dr. fauci ask one of the people if he could get up and speak and he do

 q so he say that once you

 the president and they totally misinterpret he i see what they do

 q can i can i ask you he say the question be hypothetical but what he be just acknowledge be that life would have be save if the mitigation practice be put into place early that seem obvious do you not agree with that

 the president here ’s the thing no no what he really be say though but how could you have do it look i just go over stat with you right here right here

 how do you close it up you have no death and no case on january 11th doctor would you recommend close the united states of america oh this must be terrible how many case do we have none how many death do we have none

 january 17th go back another week on january 17th this be 10 day before i do the little bit less than 10 day before i do the ban i do a ban on china you think that be easy i then do a ban on europe and a lot of people say that be an incredible thing to do because you look at spain and by the way we ’re do very well because when you look at all of those flat graph and you add it all up the united states be very low and per capita we ’re very low we ’re do very well

 but how do you close up the united states of america so on january 6th no death on january 11th no death and no no case on january 17th no case no case no death i ’m suppose to close up the united states of america when i have no case

 q you do not close down until the middle of march should you have close it down earlier?”—that ’s the question

 the president i close down from china

 q it ’ not about january

 the president excuse i i close it down from china and by the way some people think i should have wait long and maybe ride it out i disagree with they okay but it be think of i mean that be an alternative you know there be a lot of people that would have say let ’s ride it out now i ’ll give you the good news if i would have do that it would have be i think catastrophic because their number be anthony 1.6 to 2.2 million people would have die if we try to do that

 and i do this last time cut it in half do not say 2.2 million cut it in more than half say a million people die well that ’ much more than the civil war cut it in half take the million and cut it in half that ’ 500,000 people would have die now that number we would have reach okay that would have be easy to reach if we do nothing so we do the right thing and our timing be very good

 but here ’ the one thing and you have to say this when you ask i why do not you do this?”—how come when i do the ban on china and some very very institute some very tough thing how come nancy pelosi a month later be in chinatown say let ’s all march this be not go to happen how come we have many of the expert from cnn and many other network if you call cnn a network i do n’t personally but we have cnn we have many other place and they ’re all say he do not need to do it he do not need to do it

 all i ’m say be this how do you close down the great economy in the history of the world when on january 17th you have no case and no death when on january 21st you have one case and no death one case think of it now we ’re suppose to close down the country

 but here ’s what happen when on january 31st i institute the ban joe biden go crazy he say you do n’t need the ban you he do not go crazy like he have he do not even know what the hell the ban be but he so he do not go crazy but he do say

 q your ban buy you time

 the president he do call i xenophobic

 q what do you do with that time

 the president wait a minute he call i xenophobic he call i a racist because he have since apologize and he say i do the right thing so when you say why do not you do this every democrat think i make a mistake when i do it i save ten of thousand maybe hundred of thousand of life by do that

 q but what do you do with that time that you buy the argument be that you buy yourself some time and you do not use it to prepare hospital you do not use it to ramp up testing right now

 the president you ’re so you’re so

 q:—nearly 20 million people be unemployed

 the president you ’re so disgraceful it ’ so disgraceful the way you say that

 q ten of thousand of americans be dead

 the president let i just listen

 q how be this sizzle reel

 the president i just go over it

 q:—or this rant suppose to make people feel confident

 the president i just go over it

 q:—in an unprecedented crisis

 the president nobody think we should do it and when i do it

 q but what do you do with the time that you buy

 the president you know what we do

 q the month of february that

 the president you know what we do

 q that video have a gap the entire month of february

 the president what do you do what do you do when you have no case in the whole united states when you

 q you have case in february

 the president on january 30th

 q what do your administration do in february with the time that your travel ban buy you

 the president a lot

 q what

 the president a lot and in fact we ’ll give you a list what we do in fact part of it be up there we do a lot

 q it be n’t in the video the video have a gap

 the president look look you know you ’re a fake you know that your whole network the way you cover it be fake and most of you and not all of you but the people be wise to you that ’s why you have a low a low approval rating than you ’ve ever have before time probably three

 q twenty million people now be unemployed

 the president and when you ask i that question

 q ten of thousand of people be dead mr. president

 the president let i ask you this why do n’t biden why do biden apologize why do he write a letter of apology

 q i do not think the unemployed people right now care about why joe biden do not apologize to you sir

 the president why do the democrats think that i act too quickly you know why because they really think that i act too quickly we have do a great job

 q so get we the list of what you do in february

 the president now i could’ve i could ’ve keep it open and i could ’ve do what some country be do they ’re getting beat up pretty badly i could have keep it open i think of keep it open because nobody have ever hear of close down a country let alone the united states of america but if i would have do that we would have have hundred of thousand of people that would right now be dead

 we ’ve do this right and we really we really have do this right the problem be the press do not cover it the way it should be

 go ahead one more question steve go ahead

 q there ’ a debate over what authority you have to order the country reopen what authority do you have

 the president well i have the ultimate authority but we ’re go to get into that in a minute we ’re go to just finish this up we ’re go to tell you about other thing that we ’ve do right

 but i will say this have we say let ’s just keep go and let ’s not do a closing”—whether it ’ 2.2 that they at one point predict as an outside or 1.6 at a low number you cut it all the way down to 6- or 7- or 800,000 take just a fraction of the number that could have happen it literally would have be more than the civil war it would have be a disaster

 so the minimum number be 100,000 and i think i feel pretty good that we ’re go to be substantially below anthony the 100,000 and i hope we will

 all right so today the department of health and human services be announce five new contract to procure large number of additional ventilator under the defense production act which we use a lot by the way which you do not like to talk about in addition to the 1,300 we receive today we receive today 1,300 additional ventilator now we ’re probably not go to need they but we can add that to our stockpile which be very big and we can move it around should the surge take place and should it be a very substantial surge we ’re ready to we’re ready to rock

 the contract be with general electric hillrom medtronic resmed and vyaire combine with the dpa contract that we announce last week with general motors and philips and two other contract with hamilton and zoll we ’re add 6,190 ventilator to the strategic national stockpile of which we have a lot already thousand close to 10,000 but this will be add by may 8th another 29,000 by the end of may and more than 120,000 total we will have by the end of the year

 now we ’re go to help other country we ’re go to help state if they need it we may help some state stockpile you know they ’re suppose to buy their own stockpile they have state stockpile they ’re suppose to be use that and unfortunately most of the state be n’t there and a lot of people do not want to talk about it but they be not there we will talk about it at the right time if you want to i at this point i ’m more focused on get past this nightmare of a epidemic or a pandemic anything you want to call it we get to get past it

 no one who have need a ventilator have not get a ventilator think of that you know you hear all about ventilator ventilator we need ventilator because they do not have they because the state should have have they no one who have need a ventilator have not get a ventilator no one who have need a hospital bed have be deny a hospital bed that ’s not even really our responsibility

 now if we can help we ’re go to do it but that ’ where the army corps of engineers do such a great job we build over 20,000 bed in fact we build thousand more than we ’ve actually need to be safe we want to be safe and we really they rise to this incredible occasion

 i mean we build more bed than we think we think in louisiana we be go heavy and again when i call the governor i say maybe we should not build that second hospital because we do not want to build it if you do n’t need it he call back he say i do not think we ’re go to need it they have 1,000 room 1,000 bed and they use a lot of they but they do not need the other one so we stop it because we do not want to waste

 but we ’re prepared to build thousand more should we need it i do not think we ’re go to need it because it look like we ’re plateaue and maybe even in many case come down

 in addition we ’ve order a total of 60 mobile decontamidation sic]—-contamination system so the decontamination system from battelle in ohio be an incredible thing because it take the mask and up to 20 time you can decontaminate a mask and i ’ve be ask from the beginning why can not we sterilize and sanitize these mask and it turn out we can and there be a great company in ohio they send we some great equipment and they ’re do that now

 and now we ’re go to have more than 33 million n95 mask per week will be clean decontaminate and it ’ll be great it ’ something that frankly i think people should have think of a long time ago

 five more flight land today as part of the project air bridge our massive air lift operation to bring personal protective equipment into the united states which have now deliver nearly half a million n95 mask 370 million glove 25 million surgical mask and 4.9 million gown so we have million of gown glove mask all surgical equipment come in should the state need it

 now the state the state be suppose to be buy their own stuff but should they need it we be ready to give they because we ’re build up our stockpile again like crazy

 remember i and you see the story i inherit this administration mike myself the whole administration we inherit a stockpile where the cupboard be bare there be nothing and i say it and i ’ll say it again just like we do not have ammunition we do not have medical supply we do not have ventilator we do not have a lot of thing that should have be have and you can read your own story on that because you know what happen they do not want to spend the money but we do

 to date we ’ve facilitate the supply of more than 38 million n95 mask nationwide this week we ’ll be send 2 million n95 mask to the commonwealth of pennsylvania the vice president will go into more detail he ’s get great detail on that and i think it ’ a pretty amazing story we have a lot of mask already in stock and we have more come

 we ’re far expand hospital surge capacity in key area of the opening and we have a portion of certain va hospital and non veteran coronavirus patient include at the east orange new jersey medical center as well as facility in manhattan and brooklyn they ’re ready they ’re able they ’re beautiful hopefully we will not need too many of they because frankly we build everything that the governor want and in many case it ’ too much we tell they it be too much but we want to err on the side of caution

 the united states have now conduct nearly 3 million test for the virus three million the most of any nation we be perform approximately 150,000 test every single day and our rate of testing be especially high in area hard hit by the virus if you look and that ’s really and it have hit some area the virus very very hard for example per capita testing in new york be high than the rest of the world

 the nih cdc and fda be also currently validate several antibody test that will allow we to determine whether someone have already have the virus and potentially become immune to infection we ’re look at that the antibody test be go to be very interesting over the next short while a lot of thing be be develop as we speak

 in the race to develop effective treatment the drug company gilead announce that its drug remdesivir have show promising result very promising in compassionate use setting in addition the fda have just grant emergency use authorization for a device that remove certain protein from the bloodstream possibly prevent a patient ’s immune system from overreact to the virus and damage vital organ which be a big problem

 furthermore over the last seven day my administration have deploy roughly 28 million dose of hydroxychloroquine from our national stockpile we have million of dose that we buy and many people be use it all over the country and just recently a friend of mine tell i he get well because of the use of that that drug so who know and you combine it with z pak you combine it with zinc depend on your doctor ’s recommendation and it ’s have some very good result i ’ll tell you

 i think if anybody recommend it other than i it would be use all over the place to be honest with you i think the fact that i recommend it i probably set it back a lot but it ’ a lot of good thing that be happen with it a lot of good test

 scientist be also pursue a blood therapy know as convalescent plasma convalescent plasma this therapy use antibody from the blood of recover patient to treat those who be sick and this be something that actually be a very old procedure but it ’s do in a very modern way

 during this difficult time we ’re also work to ensure that the 2020 census be complete safely and accuracy   we may be ask for an extension because obviously they can not be do very much right now they would not even be allow to do it so the census we ’re go to be ask for a delay a major delay i think how can you possibly be knock on door for a long period of time now

 the census bureau recently make the decision to temporarily suspend its field operation data collection activity to help stop the spread in addition while million of americans continue to complete their questionnaire online the census bureau have ask congress for a 120 extension i do not know that you even have to ask they this be call an act of god this be call a a situation that have to be they have to give in i think 120 day be not nearly enough

 my administration be also take bold action to help american worker on friday americans begin receive the cash payment authorize by a historic $ 2 trillion relief bill

 by the end of the week nearly 80 million americans will receive a total of $ 147 billion and from what the secretary of the treasury tell i that ’s very much on time and go very nicely he ’ll be speak in a moment and payment these payment go directly into the bank and the bank account of these people million of additional payment will follow the typical family of four will receive $ 3,400 that ’s for a family of four that ’s something

 additionally through our paycheck protection program which be a tremendous success and they should extend it and increase it this have be a tremendous success so successful that the bank be take a little bit long to distribute the money but it ’s go rapidly

 we ’ve now process over $ 200 billion in loan to help small business retain their worker now we urgently need lawmaker to set aside the partisan agenda and to replenish this program with new fund because it ’ really something that have be an incredible success and they need more money to keep it go to take care of these business and keep they keep they open

 i want to thank the many governor health professional scientist and business leader for their incredible hard work and input over the past month and even long beyond a month mike i would say you know we ’ve be work together with a lot of for it seem like forever

 i ’ve be have many discussion with my team and top expert and we ’re very close to complete a plan to open our country hopefully even ahead of schedule and that ’s so important

 we will soon finalize new and very important guideline to give governor the information they need to start safely open their state my administration ’s plan and correspond guideline will give the american people the confidence they need to begin return to normal life that ’ what we want we want to have our country open we want to return to normal life our country be go to be open and it ’s go to be successfully open and we ’ll be explain over a very short number of day exactly what be go to be

 we ’ve also as you probably hear develop a committee we ’re actually call it a number of committee with the most prominent people in the country the most successful people in the various field and we ’ll be announce they tomorrow

 this weekend the united states also help facilitate an unprecedented agreement among the 23 nation of opec plus that ’s opec plus additional energy produce nation represent many of the world ’s large oil produce country to stabilize oil market and we have in fact and i think you ’ve see a big stabilization over the last couple of day

 together country around the world will cut oil production by approximately 20 million barrel people be say 10 million but we think that the number that they ’ll actually hit be go to be close to 20 million barrel a day and that will help a lot with save job all over texas and oklahoma and north dakota and many of other other of our big energy state

 this historic action will help nearly 11 million american worker who be support by the u.s. oil and gas industry it ’ a very monumental agreement i want to thank saudi arabia and the king of saudi arabia the crown prince of saudi arabia both i want to thank president putin of russia and i want to thank a very good friend of mine a man who ’s become a friend of mine the president of mexico show great flexibility president lópez obrador he show great flexibility and and tremendous intelligence do what he do it be not that easy for he and i want to thank mexico and the president this be a very historic deal very historic so we ’ll see how it all go

 in this time and challenge and we be certainly in a time probably like we have n’t be in many many decade we be strengthen and sustain by the bond of love and loyalty that unite all americans i ’m so proud of the american people

 everywhere you look you see the patriotism of our people shine through and the courage of our doctor and nurse on the frontline and the dedication of our food supply worker and in the commitment of every citizen to achieve victory over the virus that ’ what ’s go to happen it ’s go to happen soon than people think and we ’re go to be smart about it very very smart about it we ’re go to be safe about it we ’re go to be listen also to the great doctor and medical professional

 together we ’re beat back the invisible enemy and we ’re pave the way for great resurgence really a great resurgence for american prosperity our country want to go back they want to go back to work they ’re go to go back safely and that ’ what we want

 i ’d like now to ask vice president pence to say a few word follow by dr. fauci and dr. birx i think before we before we do this because i know there ’ an emergency where they want steve to come so what i ’ll do be i ’ll ask steve to come up secretary of the treasury you can talk a little bit and then maybe take a couple of question about what ’s happen tell they the success we ’re have

 thank you very much

 secretary mnuchin thank you mr. president and mr. vice president as you announce we be very pleased that we be ahead of schedule on deliver the economic impact payment these be what be know as the check in the mail that we want to deliver in direct direct deposit

 i ’d also like to announce the progress we ’re make on the new sba program the ppp let i just remind everybody this be a brand new program that be now one week old

 we have distribute and confirm $ 230 billion of loan to over 4,600 lender participate that be multiple and multiple of anything that the sba have ever do in in one year before and i especially want to thank the broad base community bank that be participate again over 4,600 bank

 if you have n’t have your loan process you will get it process this week as the president say we ’ve go back to congress and ask they for more money to make sure that every business have access to this

 let i also comment for the state we be distribute out half the money this week to the state that ’s a week ahead of time and we ’ll deliver the other half of the money to the state next week

 and then let i just finally comment we ’ve be very work very closely with the federal reserve last week we announce expand facility and new facility that total $ 2.3 trillion of liquidity and in particular i ’d just like to highlight a main street lending facility that will be for company between one worker and 10,000 people so mid sized business and also a municipal facility for state and local government to be able to access fund give the shortage that they have

 so with that i ’m happy to answer any question

 the president you have any question for steve please

 q secretary mnuchin thank you sir both speaker pelosi and minority leader schumer have say that they ’re in negotiation with you right now on additional funding for these small business loan for that package leader mcconnell though have say that nothing should be add to the package they should just be specific to small business loan what be the opinion of your administration should there be some sort of horse trading here or should it just be small business loan

 secretary mnuchin well the president ’s view and the vice president ’s and my view be this be a bipartisan program this sba program it be n’t a republican program it be n’t a democrat program it be a bipartisan program we ’ve commit to small business we should top up that program now i know the democrats want to talk about more money for hospital and state right now we ’re just send the money out to the hospital and state they have not come close to use that money and i know the president and vice presidents have say once we get the sba do we can go into another funding bill

 the president have talk about potentially add infrastructure and other thing we think there be a likelihood we will need more money and we will we will sit down and try to get a bipartisan bill but this be important we deliver on small business fifty percent of the people work for small business

 q thank you sir

 q what ’s the emergency that the president say you have to go for the president say you have an emergency meeting

 the president negotiation

 q over this bill

 secretary mnuchin yeah well or because we do not want to run out of money we ’ve use about $ 220 billion of the $ 350 billion we do not want to run out of that money we do not want to create panic that people will not get it so that ’ why we want to we want to top that up and we ’ve ask for another $ 250 billion for that program

 and again let i just remind you every dollar we spend in this program we save a dollar of unemployment insurance so even though we ’re ask for $ 250 billion it really will not cost that much

 q could i follow up

 q what be your do you have concern about lift the guideline too soon and what ’s the economic impact i understand the economic argument for get people back to work obviously but what ’s the economic risk of lift they too early and see then a spike in case again

 secretary mnuchin well of course there ’ economic risk in both direction we review with the president today a very broad list of over 100 business people that be go to help advise the president on what need to be do to reopen the economy

 we want to make sure and again the combination of economic impact payment small business payment enhanced unemployment insurance the president make very clear we want to make sure that hardworke americans have liquidity while we wait to reopen the government

 q so do you believe the government should be re-—or that the country excuse i should be reopen on may 1

 secretary mnuchin i ’ve have discussion with the president i know he ’s consider it and i believe he ’s go to make a decision later in the week

 the president we have to do everything have to be safe we want safe

 q what be your advice to the president

 secretary mnuchin my advice be as soon as it ’ ready to open and base upon the medical professional and and again we ’re work very closely with the president and outside business leader to develop a plan

 q i just wonder i want to ask you mr. president what you think what if you could sketch for we what reopen the economy look like do you think it ’s go to be everything open or do you think

 the president well i ’ll be do that over the next few day because we ’ll probably be make a statement about that and exactly what it look like

 i know what that look like but i also want to get the advice in a sense we have some of the the big from every business on this council we ’re actually set up a number of different council or committee i guess you could call they and we have a lot of smart people i think that they will give we some also good advice but no we want to be very very safe at the same time we get to get our country open

 q yeah i understand that mr. president do you think there be a possibility then that what you do be you open it incrementally do you think people will go back to restaurant to concert the cinema

 the president i do think so eventually they will yeah

 q and let i ask one final

 the president i think eventually they will do that and i think we ’re go to boom i think we ’re go to i think it ’s go to go quickly our people want to get back to work and i think there ’ a pen up demand like there have not be in a long time

 and that ’ why and that ’ why you see the stock market i mean to think that the stock market be at the level it be right now with all that this world and this country have go and look at the european union how badly decimated they ’ve be look at other country look at china by the way i ’ve see the number look at china look at how these country have be just decimate by this

 and to think that the stock market be at this tremendously high number not that much you know it be look a little bleak for a while but it it hit a certain point and then start go up i think that ’ a great tribute to the fact that there ’ a demand

 yeah

 q mr. president thank you sir in regard to some of your tweet early today and i think it be steve ’s question my question to you be what provision in the constitution give the president the power to open or close state economy and then

 the president numerous provision we ’ll give you a legal brief if you want

 q and then we’ll be look forward to that sir but follow up what happen if you say for instance we want state to reopen but california or new york do not open what would you do then

 the president well i think everybody want to open i mean i guess you know that could happen but i do not think that would happen

 go ahead please

 q it ’s be state that have close order school close it ’s be state that have order business like restaurant and bar close

 the president that ’s because i let that happen because i would have prefer that i let that happen but if i want to i could have close it up but i let that happen and i like the way they ’ve do it and the seven that remain really in sort of a semi lockdown if you look at those state they ’ve really do a very good job they ’re very much different from a new york or from other place where they ’ve be hit very hard

 q so you ’re prepared then to bigfoot state and say i order you to open your school i order to force kid to be able to go

 the president go ahead please yeah

 q yes mr. president follow up on that there be two consortium of state today california oregon and washington on the west coast northeastern state totally represent about 100 million people who have say they ’re go to cooperate and decide when to reopen those state

 the president well they can decide but

 q do that undermine what you ’re try to do

 the president no not at all let i just tell you very simple i ’m go to put it very simply the president of the united states have the authority to do what the president have the authority to do which be very powerful the president of the united states call the shot

 if we be not here for the state you would have have a problem in this country like you ’ve never see before we be here to back they up and we ’re back and we ’ve more than back they up we do a job that nobody ever think be possible it ’ a decision for the president of the united states

 now with that be say we ’re go to work with the state because it ’ very important you have local government they ’re pinpoint it ’ really you talk about it ’s like a microchip they be pinpoint we have local government that hopefully will do a good job and if they do n’t do a good job i ’d step in so fast but no they can not do anything without the approval of the president of the united states

 q but mr. president

 the president go ahead please

 q so if some state refuse to reopen and you order they to the 10th amendment of the constitution say all power that do not reside in the president or congress reside in the state how do you overcome that

 the president well if some state refuse to open i would be i would like to see that person run for election they ’re go to open they ’re go to all open

 q so that ’ a valid inaudible

 the president i think that ’ something that ’s not go to happen they want to open they have to open they have to get open every one of those state the people want to go and they want to

 now some will be be in a different situation you have i will not name state now but i will over the next two or three day i ’m go to be very specific but you have some state where this be not the kind of a problem than it be in new york or louisiana or michigan or other place that get hit very hard illinois get hit very hard but all state want to open and they want to open as soon as possible but they want to open safely and so do i.

 yeah please

 q thank you mr. president today the french president emmanuel macron say that he will keep the shutdown in france until the middle of may do that mean that the u.s. will keep the ban from flight from

 the president no france get hit very hard france get hit very hard and again he have to do what he have to do he ’ a friend of mine but france spain have just be decimate you look at what ’s happen in italy it ’ a very well know fact what happen in italy no they be hit very hard

 our job right now be to execute the $ 2.3 billion which we can add several trillion dollar with the fed

 the one area we be particularly concerned about be the small business program quite frankly it ’ even more incredibly popular and successful than we anticipate so the president want to be very clear we have money for that and once we get do with that we will review with the president if there be more money that need to be to support this economy to support hardworke americans we will work with congress to get that in time

 the president and steve do you want to talk about phase four

 the president i think i take my own advice on the ban i do not know

 q:—the social the social distancing i ’m talk about the shut down

 q not of travel but of activity so my question be as you make this next decision which you have say may be the most difficult or important decision of your presidency will you assure the american people that you will again take the advice of the doctor of dr. fauci of dr. birx will you take the advice of the health expert before you do that

 the president i will and many other people also but i will absolutely take their advice

 q but would you go against they

 the president please go ahead

 q yes mr.

 q would you go against their recommendation if they say you need another 15 or 30 day would you

 the president i do not think it would be likely because i think we ’re not very far from be on the same page

 please

 q yes mr. president one thing that governor cuomo say today be that state do not have the capacity to do the mass covid-19 testing ahead of a reopening as

 the president well they have to do it look they ’re suppose to be do it

 q he say he can not purchase the diagnostic test or equipment

 the president yeah i know i know

 q:—and need federal help so will the state get that

 the president well they they may need help but

 q will they get it

 the president but they ’re there they ’re on ground they ’ve get local mayor local representative they have people that do it

 q but he need the supply

 the president and what we do last time be unprecedented we literally rebuilt test we we rebuild a whole industry because we inherit nothing what we inherit from the previous administration be totally break which somebody should eventually say not only be the cupboard bare as i say but we inherit broken testing now we have great testing

 i just leave the top executive at abbott who would have think that would have happen where they have such a great test as that

 and in fact what i ’ll do i think unless you have any further question for the secretary of the treasury do you have anybody for steve anybody

 q mr. secretary mnuchin

 the president be that for the secretary of the treasury or for i

 q for secretary mnuchin yeah yes sir

 the president because if it ’s for i we can wait

 q it ’s for secretary mnuchin

 the president we have to get he back to work okay

 q yes sir for secretary mnuchin a question

 secretary mnuchin yes

 q:—from one of my colleague who ’s not able to be in the room they ’re curious about the sba rule that prevent small casino from get some of this relief be that something that you ’re take a look at be there go to be a change to the

 secretary mnuchin so no not small casino but there be such thing as small tavern and restaurant that have literally you know small gaming thing and we be come out with some additional guidance on that but i want to be clear it ’ not small casino

 q thank you sir

 q secretary mnuchin

 q secretary

 secretary mnuchin yes

 q there be a letter that some house republicans send this weekend about the liquidity for a mortgage servicer

 secretary mnuchin yes

 q be can you explain what you ’re look at on that front

 secretary mnuchin sure so i think i comment on this a week or so ago we have a subcommittee task force at fsoc that specifically study this issue we have all the appropriate people on it ginnie mae have automatically take some action we ’ve have conversation with the fhfa as to what they ’re go to do for fannie and freddie and we ’ve say that to the extent they need certain authority from the treasury we will accommodate that

 so we’re we’re very aware of the issue quite frankly we ’ve be study this issue way before covid and have concern about some of these non bank servicer not be well capitalize but we ’re go to we’re go to make sure that the market function properly

 q thank you sir we have see in a number of these relief bill that democrats and republicans have be able to push forward different non coronavirus specific funding priority be you try to keep fund specific to coronavirus and then if there be go to be other addition for instance a change to labor rule be something that many on the left want some of the right be wonder if they should also if you should also be push for you know their prefer add ons

 secretary mnuchin well i think our expectation have always be this be covid relate some people have a rather broad view of what covid related be because it have impact almost every single business i mean i think we’ve the president have talk about the kennedy center which be a good institution obviously that be not the major priority in the bill but they be hit with covid relate

 so but no the president have instruct we want to be very specific in the next bill it ’ covid relate item

 q it ’s be report

 the president well we do not want to do the kennedy center just so you understand and that that be do the democrats want it in we do not want that but they want it in and we have to agree in order to get something do for the worker but we want this to be for the worker and for company that employ the worker that ’ what we ’re look for we ’re not look for extraneous nonsense

 q it ’s be report that you argue at the time the china ban be be discuss that that be too disruptive to the global economy be that accurate

 secretary mnuchin let i be clear i have nothing to do with the china ban i be n’t on the task force at the time i ’m not even sure i be i think i be travel at the time but i never have any i be not part i do become very active and after the china ban but that report in the new york times be not accurate

 q you do not weigh in beforehand

 secretary mnuchin i be not part of the task force at that time and i be i be not involve as a matter of fact i think i may have be travel

 q secretary mnuchin there ’ a proposal make by senator hawley to get direct payment to employer to pay people who have be lay off and to keep people on payroll do the administration support that proposal

 secretary mnuchin well again that be the ppp the ppp be basically send money to small business—50 percent of american worker to keep those people pay and it ’ the most efficient way every dollar as i say we do through that it ’ one less dollar of unemployment and more importantly we want those people to have be associate with the business so as soon as the president be ready to open up the economy those business be together we do not want those business to fall apart that ’s why this be such a successful program and we want congress to put more money in

 the president but be you talk about unemployment you ’re talk about the unemployment

 q inaudible senator hawley

 the president send it indirectly to the state   we would have prefer that it be send directly to the people the democrats want it to be send through the unemployment system and you know i ’ve talk to you about it we have 40 year old equipment in many of those system they ’re run by the state but i ’m hear they ’re get the money out anyway

 secretary mnuchin so some some of they be and some of the state be n’t and we encourage you know we ’re work with the state to try to update their computer but it ’ a it ’ a long haul

 the president okay thank you steve

 the president well i do not think that ’s go to happen i think it ’ very extreme but she ’s do it and i think it ’s go to be over a long way before we have to start think about it too much it be strong it ’ a very strong position to take but they ’re make a lot of progress in michigan so let ’s see how it all work

 q what be the status of the funding for the world health organization

 the president we ’re go to be talk about that very soon i ’m get a full report i ’m not happy with the world health organization i ’m not happy with the world trade organization either we ’ve be rip off by everybody

 and we have this country for so many year have be rip off by everybody whether it ’ a world health or world trade and they ’re like i call they the bobbsey twins they ’d look at our country for year and year we have people that do nothing about it we ’re do a lot about it so we ’ll have a report

 and we ’ll also we’re also talk about the world trade organization but we ’ve make a lot of progress there we ’re now win case for the first time because they know i ’ll leave if we do not get treat fairly

 this country our country be at a point where we rarely if ever win the lawsuit within the world trade organization but now we ’re win a lot of they because they know i ’m not i’m not play game we will pull out if we have to we just win a 7 billion dollar lawsuit which be very nice

 q do you expect a decision this week on cut funding for the who

 q because you ’ve say well you ’ve be ask and it appear that there be no

 the president how do you know there be no consequence

 q what be the consequence mr. president for the misinformation

 the president no you start off by say why be there no consequence

 q because you ’ve be ask this a few time so i ’m follow up on your response why be there no consequence for china

 the president how do you know there be no consequence

 q because we ’ve ask you

 the president you ’re go to find out

 q and you ’ve say you’ve say that do not want to have an consequence because you suggest trade

 the president i would not tell you you ’d probably be the last person on earth i ’d tell

 q so you ’re say there will be consequence

 the president go ahead uh yeah please

 q mr. president actually this be a question for mr. vice president do you agree with the president ’s statement and his understanding of federalism that his power be total like in the way he describe it be there anything you ’d like to add or any context you ’d like to add to the way he be discuss that

 the vice president i support the president ’s leadership under the national emergency declaration that he sign

 and we ’re stand before you today the first time in american history when all 50 state have issue emergency declaration and the territory this be an unprecedented time in the life of the nation

 and fortunately as the president have reflect and our health expert will continue to reflect because the american people have heed the president ’s coronavirus guidelines for america because state governor have take those and implement they even in state where there be not a significant outbreak and implement additional measure as we provide they with datum about case and good practice we’re make real progress as a country

 q but it sound like you think his power be a little bit more circumscribed than totally

 the president well make no mistake about it in the long history of this country the authority of the president of the united states during national emergency be unquestionably plenary and you can look back through time of war and other national emergency and as the president say we ’ll happily brief that

 but in the day ahead what the president have charge we to do be to work with our health expert we ’re go to bring together an extraordinary group of american business leader to counsel the president and then work with the cdc we ’re go to produce new guideline base upon the datum for every state and territory in this nation we ’re go to give they guidance and as the president have indicate we ’ll continue to respect the leadership and partnership that we forge with every governor in america

 but this be an unprecedented time but i have to tell you when you look at the fact despite the heartbreaking loss of more than 22,000 americans when you look at the fact of what the health expert tell we this could be i think i only can feel a sense of gratitude to the american people gratitude to the extraordinary team that have counsel this president the step that president trump have take the policy that governor have implement all across america

 i mean we be discuss today at the task force that when you look at the european union as a whole they have nearly three time the mortality rate that the united states of america have today and that be a tribute to our extraordinary healthcare worker their dedication their tireless work but it ’ also a tribute to the fact that the american people put into practice the mitigation effort that the president counsel the nation to do on the advice of our good scientist now more than a month ago and our hospital be not overwhelmed and be not overwhelmed at this hour

 and i have to tell you that stand here today i could not be more proud to stand alongside this president and to be a part of this team that have serve the american people during this challenging hour

 and i just say to you to every american look on as we see the number level and maybe even begin to go down i just encourage you to keep do what you ’re do because of the sacrifice that americans and american family have make through these mitigation effort you ’re save life and you ’re see our nation through this time

 the president go ahead

 q sir do the state tell you you’ve been talk to the governor quite a bit do those coalition of state on the west coast and in the northeast do they tell you what they be go to be announce before they announce it

 the vice president governor phil murphy and the governor of connecticut express today that they be go to be speak on a and discuss on a regional basis what their recommendation would be and we assure they today

 q do they alert the white house about that though sir

 the vice president we assure they today on our conference call with i think 48 governor that be with we today for the well part of an hour and a half we tell they that what the president would be produce have direct to be produce be additional guideline for the state certify by the cdc that would inform those governor and local community and mayor about the good way forward base on the unique circumstance that those state and those community be face

 i think what ’ clear be the american people have see the experience in washington state where this really all begin for we and in california and now the extraordinary challenge in the greater new york city area include new jersey and connecticut the challenge in new orleans and louisiana and detroit still chicago part of houston

 but they ’re also see that in each one of those case that the mitigation effort be truly work and so we’ll we’ll work with those we’ll work with those state and in some case it ’ll make perfect sense for they to work together on a regional basis

 q any idea why they do not let you know ahead of time what they be plan

 the president well you do not know that you do not know that

 the vice president but but the president the president will be

 q inaudible

 the president you do not know that i ’m sorry

 the vice president i ’m sorry i do not hear your question

 q mr. president can you tell we do they let you know

 the president you do not know that no you make a statement you do not know that

 the vice president i do not hear your i do not hear your statement i ’m sorry

 the president and we would and we would like to have their cooperation and we be go to have their cooperation they will cooperate perfectly watch

 the vice president i and let i just affirm what the president say we hear it again today in what i think be our ninth conference call with governor be i think every american would be proud to see the partnership that this president have forge with governor across the country i mean it be an extraordinary statement

 and you ’ll see some datum when admiral polowczyk get up in just a few moment but the flow of resource from around the world that we ’ve move into area that have face challenge i mean this president have direct we to ensure that every state have what they need when they need it and the spirit that i hear again from republicans and democrat governor today be reflective of that partnership

 and as we move forward to the president ’s goal of reopen america we expect the same kind of partnership in the interest of the nation

 the president all right go ahead with the face mask go ahead

 q sir if you can hear i through the mask

 the president well it ’ an amazing thing but a lot of people have some very big constitutional problem with it you know that it ’ an amazing thing and it would be actually as you know other country be think about use something similar but not as good

 q which other country be think about something similar

 the president i hear singapore be singapore be no singapore have a little bit of a setback because they have a they have a break you know that and but they ’ll take care of it i know i know the folk in singapore they ’re do a great job and they ’re go to put it back very quickly but singapore and other country be look at other thing and some country be do other thing

 q would you prefer that americans use some other system

 the president well i do not want to get into that because we have a whole constitutional thing we have more of a constitutional problem than a mechanical problem but we will be make a determination on that that ’s something we ’re go to be discuss with a lot of people over the next four week that would be a very accurate way of do it but a lot of people have a problem with it

 yeah please go ahead

 q a testing question maybe for dr. fauci as well can you talk about where the antibody test be and how quickly that will be inaudible

 the president well it ’s move along i think i can speak because i i have to leave move along quickly move along well it ’ a test that ’s be go along for many many year except now we have very modern very incredible version of it but that ’s move on the antibody test have move along very well

 okay anymore covid-19 covid-19

 yeah steve

 q one soldier on the theodore roosevelt have die have have you determine the status of captain crozier the former commander

 the president well that ’s go through the navy as i understand it the navy be go to be make decision on all of that and they have a break in i do not think the ship should have be stop in vietnam when you have a pandemic to be honest with you you know i do not think the captain should have be write letter he ’ not ernest hemingway as i say before and he should not have be write letter

 and i do not think i do not know who give the order to stop in vietnam but they stop in vietnam and all of a sudden they get on and now you have over 500 sailor and and people on the ship that be affect i do not know whose idea that be but that be n’t such a good idea in the middle of a pandemic

 yes please jon go ahead jon

 q just one last on this question of constitutionality i ’m just wonder what change your view because

 the president nothing change it no no i know exactly what you ’re go to say nothing change it the fact that i want to rely on state or maybe will or maybe have and the fact that we ’ve get on that ’ one thing the fact that i do not want to use the power be another thing look

 q but you say from the standpoint of the constitution

 the president yes constitution

 q:—you think it should be up to the governor

 the president constitutionally you can look at constitutionally you can look at federalism you can look at it any different way jon the fact that i do not want to exert my power be much different we have the power

 you ask do the federal government have the power the federal government have absolute power it have the power as to whether or not i ’ll use that power we ’ll see i would rather

 q so if new york want to stay closed down you can

 the president jon i would rather work with the state because i like go down to a local government that ’ why with i guess it ’ now seven state not eight that because south carolina do you know they go away from what we discuss the last time so that ’ why i look at the individual state they ’re do a very good job they ’re really do a very good job i ’d rather have they make the decision

 now the fact that i ’d rather have that ’ fine but i have the absolute right to do if i want to i may not want to we have a very good relationship now we ’ll see what happen

 if you notice the few state you ’re talk about they ’re all with democrat governor but if governor be do a good job and they control it well because you do not have somebody in washington say set up a testing site in the parking lot of a walmart and we ’re in washington and they ’re in a state that ’s very far away that ’s really it should be and it should have always be and i ’ve always say it be

 but the relationship we have now with the state and governor be very good and we ’ll be announce over the next very short period of time exactly what we ’re go to be do

 okay a couple of more go ahead

 q on coronavirus and joe biden he ’ the presumptive democratic nominee do you have any plan yet on when you ’ll start share or when the white house will start share some of that information about the coronavirus your presidential daily brief

 the president well nobody have call about coronavirus about from their standpoint look they have the h1n1 which be swine flu and that be a big failure that be a tremendous failure they have a lot of failure and you take a look at what you take a look at the history and you know 17,000 people die and you talk about late they be so late they be late like it never even exist that be a that be a big problem cause a lot of other people a big problem too

 so you know if joe biden would like a briefing i ’d certainly get he a briefing i do not know what he ’d do with it

 yeah please

 q so be jared and ivanka on serve on the new task force and how be you go to balance

 the president no

 q what

 the president no they ’re not no

 q okay

 the president yeah yes go ahead please

 q i just want to clarify so in early conversation there be a description of multiple different council or task task force can you just explain exactly what the structure be and who be go to be on it

 the president well you have mike ’s task force which be the white house task force which really bring we up to this point brilliantly i must say deal with governor and deal with governor all the way through and i be on many of those call and every call get well and well and well it be hostile at the beginning by the time we finish i mean today ’s call be a very good call a very friendly call i think everyone be online

 and again you do not have anybody drive you crazy say they ’re not get ventilator they ’re not get all of the different thing they need more bed they have a lot of bed right now

 q inaudible hospital who doctor who say they do not have the supply that they need

 the president and we always err and i think it ’ important for you know we always err on the sake of give they more even when we do not think we do not think new york need the bed that they be ask for we do not think they need the ventilator that they ask for and we be right

 now on ventilator we ’re ready to march i tell you this we ’re ready to march we have 10,000 ventilator we ’re ready to move they anywhere in the country when we need they if we need they we ’re also build a lot of ventilator and that ’s go to be use at some point i believe you know we ’re go to have stockpile include state stockpile if they want to work out some kind of an arrangement with we but we ’re also go to help other country whether it ’ italy or spain or other france be have a big problem they all desperately need germany too they need ventilator

 so we ’re go to have a lot of ventilator we have a lot you hear the number we have a lot come next week next week we have a tremendous amount come

 okay final question steve

 q and on the task force i’d ask for the task how the task force be go to be structure be it one

 the president no then we have in addition to that we have a number of committee we ’ll have a transportation committee we ’re go to have a manufacturing committee you ’ll see it tomorrow

 we ’re also have a religious leader committee we have a great group of religious leader we ’re have committee with religious leader you ’ve be see what ’s go on with the church and all of that and we ’re go to have a faith leader committee

 and so we have we’re go to have a few committee i ’ll call they committee and then ultimately we ’re go to make decision so we ’re go to make decision fairly quickly and i think they ’re go to be the correct decision i hope so

 steve

 q so you form the economic task force tomorrow when do you want they to have recommendation for you

 the president soon soon and they already know what i want

 q next week or

 the president and so when we form when you say form i do not have to give they instruction these be very sophisticated people these be the good people in their field so i do not have to say gee let’s we just meet and we ’re go to meet in two week and here ’ what we ’re i say here ’s what i want we ’ve already tell they and they ’re the

 q what do you tell they you want

 the president:—the good name in the various business and profession and religion i mean they’re these be the great name the people that i think probably know the good

 so we ’ve call they and we ’re go to be speak to they very soon and we want they to have if it ’ question or statement we want they to have that for we and we will have either a response or maybe i mean ideally we ’re go to be learn from they and we ’ll be able to do that and put they put everything we learn from those call into our new guideline

 so we ’re go to have new guideline come soon i think it ’s go to be very good i think it ’s go to be very smooth and i hope it ’s go to be very safe

 thank you all very much thank you thank you

 q any thought on stanley chera sir any thought on stanley chera

 the president stanley chera be a friend of mine for a long time he ’ a great real estate person pass away be a great real estate person great great sort of a legend in new york real estate

 he call i a couple of week ago say he test positive stanley be in his early- to mid-80s i guess and stanley go to the hospital and he never come out he go into a coma he be unconscious for a long period of time and he never make it a great man he leave very charitable really a great philanthropist a very very successful person in manhattan in the real estate business so i get to know he a lot

 he be so excited when his friend from new york become the president of the united states he be like like a young boy and he be not a young boy but he be like a young boy he be so excited he think we ’d do such a good job and he be so happy and he he be very proud of what we ’ve do in this administration

 but he be test positive and unfortunately he he do not make it it ’ a very to i it ’ a very sad thing

 thank you all very much thank you

 q thank you

 the vice president thank you mr. president as the president mention the task force today speak to 48 of the nation ’s governor on that call we reflect on the fact that all all 50 state have emergency declaration in place which be a first for american history $ 5.2 billion have be distribute to the state under the stafford act and it be a productive call and reflective of president trump ’s ongoing direction for we to work closely with the state to make sure the state in the area most impact by the coronavirus have what they need when they need it

 we speak about the issue of testing and supply and i ’m go to ask dr. deborah birx to come forward as well as admiral polowczyk to reflect on both of those topic for you dr. birx have be lead an effort from the task force from early on on rapidly expand testing

 it be early on that the president form that public private partnership with commercial lab and as we stand here today more than 2.5 million test have be perform and when we add in the estimate of lab that we have to assume with reasonable protection projection have not yet report into the cdc we think that number could be close to 3 million test that have be perform

 as have be mention the new 15 minute test we be we be work closely with abbott laboratories that the president and our team meet with today here at the white house to rapidly increase the availability of cartridge abbott be produce roughly 50,000 cartridge a day fema acquire an initial supply of that and distribute those to the state but we ’re work with the state to not only distribute what ’s be make but also work with other supplier to create additional cartridge

 a point that i ’ll ask dr. birx to expand on in just a moment be the fact that beyond the new 15 minute test by abbott laboratories beyond what we expect to be a new antibody test which may well be approve by the fda in just a matter of day and an antibody test that would be produce at the rate of 20 million test a month the reality be that those commercial laboratory that the president bring in here the well part of two month ago and initiate that public- and private partnership with have be produce hundred of thousand of test every single week

 but as dr. birx and our team have apprehend we believe at this point in time that of the roche equipment that be out there that do the high speed testing and we inform governor of this today we think that that some 20 percent of that capacity be not be use

 and with regard to the abbott m2000 system we tell the governor today that we think 75 percent of that laboratory capacity that exist in the united states today be not be utilize by our governor so we send a very clear message to governor today to reach out to their hospital reach out to their lab to identify the presence of the roche amplicor 500 and the abbott m2000 to get those activate

 we literally estimate that although we ’re do over 110,000 test a day in the united states that if our if our governor and state lab would simply activate the machine that be already there we could double the amount of testing in the united states literally overnight and so i know that governor team watch these briefing and we ’ll remind they very respectfully again to identify those lab and we have a we have a team that now be deploy reach out to lab to see if we can activate all of those lab

 secondly on the subject of supply i’ve say it a couple of time from this podium today but let i say it one more time president trump ’s direction to we in deal with the state on personal protective equipment and ventilator have be to make sure that state have what they need when they need it and we recognize that while we all watch the overall curve of the coronavirus in america understandably the national number the reality be this outbreak have take place in its own individual curve first on the west coast then the new york city area then louisiana michigan and now we continue to contend with it in chicago and houston and other metropolitan area it have give we the opportunity to ensure that personal protective equipment and ventilator be make available on a critical basis

 and i have to tell you we ’re incredibly proud of the effort and the partnership with state that have we stand here today that no one who have require a ventilator have be deny a ventilator in the united states of america

 at this point we have just short of 7,000 ventilator in the strategic national stockpile but as as admiral polowczyk will detail we ’re already begin to receive newly manufacture ventilator we ’ll get another thousand in this week by the middle of may we ’ll literally have another 8,000 ventilator available for deployment around the country

 i ’m go to let he describe to you the specific detailing of those resource but but i want to i want to share these number most especially for our healthcare worker around the country in the area most impact by the coronavirus so that you know the resource be surge into the hospital system at the point of the need and we will continue to do just that

 so let i recognize dr. birx to reflect on the datum and also on maybe some comment on testing and then admiral polowczyk if you can step up and then you ’ll describe the supply we ’ll hear from dr. fauci again and then take a few question

 dr birx great thank you mr. vice president i do not know if we can get the first slide on cumulative case yes thank you so much

 i want to show you a different way of look at it today obviously we look at case count per 100,000 americans in each of our state and metro area but i want you to see in absolute number how much the new york new jersey metro area dwarf all other metro area

 and so you can not even see chicago detroit or boston all of those metro area be under 25,000 case you can see that the new york new jersey metro area be about almost 250,000 when you bring those case together almost a log more and that ’ why you hear we talk a lot about the metro area of new york and new jersey and the county of rockland and westchester and suffolk and nassau and bergen new jersey and why we ’re so focused on get resource to that metro area

 if i could see the next slide then so if i take new york and new jersey metro area out this be the other metro area that we have be track very closely i want to show this to you so that you could see how those curve be already start to plateau

 so if you look at detroit if you look at philadelphia if you look at louisiana louisiana be in green detroit be in gray you can see across the board across these metro area across metro area with have a high concentration of individual this be what the american people in these large city have do where it be more difficult often to socially distance and we ’re just really impressed by the work of the mayor and the governor to make this happen

 i also want you to see this because you can clearly see chicago and boston and so chicago be in the orange and boston be in the yellow they be cross detroit and that ’ why we have be very much focused on the need of those area and there be one and providence be also in that category it ’ difficult for they to for you to see you they because they ’re much far down on the slide

 but the high if you look at the axis on this slide it ’ 25,000 the axis on the last slide be 300,000 and so that ’ why i really want people to understand each of these epidemic minor these small epidemic in each of the metro area we’re tracking independently as well as any epidemic and outbreak that be happen in some of our other state

 so i just want you to have that perspective of how significant the new york new jersey issue be and why we ’ve be track that so closely but i also want to assure all of the other state that we ’re track they also very closely and really work with the governor and mayor and across and that ’ why i want you to see that not only be the curve flatten in some of those major metropolitan area but they ’re start to decrease and this be what we ’re very excited about these be case we also know that mortality will lag and so we ’re really track also the number of individual who have succumb to the covid-19

 i also want to really note here that yes our mortality be less when you combine european country equal to the size of the united states and i think this be really two thing one it ’ the incredible work of the american people that it ’s also the incredible work of our healthcare provider and the system of each of these hospital that have the resource and the ability to respond to the need of the covid-19 patient and i think you can really see the superb healthcare delivery that be happen by the low mortality

 just to mention really quickly about testing because you ’ve hear i before talk about it and then it be a little bit misquoted and misaligned but there be multiple abbott machine so i ’m go to be very clear having spend year in the laboratory the high throughput machine which be the roche 6800 and the 88-—i think it ’ the 8800 on roche and the abbott m2000 these be the machine that run between 500 and 1,000 assay at a time

 the abbott company work really hard three week ago in get a million test out there to be utilize and they can make a million test a week for all of our laboratory that have these platform and so far to date somewhere around 250,000 test have be utilize in three week worth of work and that ’ why we ’ve really be appeal to the to the laboratory director to really bring all those machine on

 last week dr. fauci and his incredible team of researcher have agree to really reach out and find additional roche and abbott high throughput machine that be in research institution and do critical research work to bring they online also to supplement the other laboratory work to create a mosaic and a complete strategy that bring together the high throughput platform with the medium throughput platform with what be the low throughput but rapid platform which be this id now

 id now be not go to be the answer to the number of test that we need over the next few week those run a test every 15 minute and we can get about 55,000 cartridge a day

 but i just get do say that these other machine of which we have hundred of can run 500 to 1,000 in a single timeframe and so we need to bring all of these assay together and a team have be create to call every single laboratory and every single research institution across the united states to define the complete capacity in every single state because it should not be our expectation that every governor understand exactly everything that ’s in his state but we have to understand everything in every state in order to be able to meet the need of the american people as we increase testing

 now i know you all know that in three week we go from 300,000 test total to 3 million test total in three week we know that we have to far increase that that have be do really by hhs and admiral giroir and the team up there and we ’re go to supplement that team to really bring on all of the additional resource and platform that we have in the united states of america just like we do with ventilator to bring all of the capacity to bear so that we can also continue to increase testing

 also of course as these epidemic be si-—decrease you can also be able to use more and more testing for surveillance but i do want to call out the 19 state that be not ever represent in these graphic in by and large the state have be continue to do containment and outbreak investigation

 and i ’ve be able to talk to many of those state and i just remind all of we when i talk to each one of these state health official where they be find outbreak be in nursing home and so we really know to need to continue to protect and we continue to test in nursing home because we know that that ’ a particularly vulnerable group and it ’ a group we ’re often now that we ’re begin to understand asymptomatic transmission

 no one be intend to pass the virus on to other but we know in essential worker around the united states people be unknowingly infect and then pass the virus on and so those be the one that be very interested in find and you might say well how do you find they because they do n’t have symptom and so this be where we really have to increase surveillance in a very deliberative and understand way

 and so we ’re really look what be sentinel surveillance site i think we can see where there ’ outbreak because once people have symptom you can see they but where do you do sentinel surveillance so that you find they before they have symptom this be what we have do for decade in hiv and it ’ what ’s allow we right now to really control the hiv aids epidemic in sub saharan africa because we ’re find people when they ’re asymptomatic and treat they when they ’re asymptomatic so this be something we know how to do and it ’ something we ’re work very closely with cdc and other on to make sure that we can bring that full capacity to the american people

 so these be just some insight and what we ’re work on we ’re continue obviously to track every single county and community

 and then finally i ’m go to call on one additional group there ’ a group out there of our hiv aids activist and community worker that understand these test that i ’ve be talk about these dna these rna base test because they often get viral load in hiv but they will know how to explain this to the community about sampling and what it mean to run those assay they be essentially virologist they understand all of these assay they also understand the antibody assay because it ’ the antibody assay that they counsel and utilize in hiv testing across the united states

 and maybe it will be our translator to the american public and to their local mayor they understand these test they’re essentially understand all the virology and all the immunology and i ’m really ask all of they to help we communicate what these test be so the community be ready for they because antibody test measure something very different than the viral load in the front of your nose that we ’re use for diagnosis and so really be able to understand all of those test when to use they how to use they will be really critical but the great thing be in the united states of america we have these community group that understand these test very well and we ’ll be able to discuss they at every level with their community

 the vice president i ’m go to call admiral polowczyk up in a minute but i have to call on dr. tony fauci

 let i let i let i just say something really straight from my heart if i can i lose my dad 32 year ago today april 13th be always a tough day for our family and this morning when my brother and sister be send around picture of dad like we always do i just think of the family of the more than 22,000 americans that we ’ve lose

 and i just want to tell you that you ’re on our heart and you ’re in the prayer of million of americans as you as you deal with this heartbreaking loss as well as family that have family member that be struggle with serious illness

 but let i just encourage everyone that in the midst of that loss because the american people have be put these mitigation measure into practice there be family that be still together today and i just want to encourage you here at roughly the halfway point of 30 day to slow the spread to take take that to heart in no way minimize the loss that we ’ve experience as a nation and as family but but to be encourage to know when you see those number on the vast majority of state that because of what the american people be do it ’ work

 and dr. fauci and dr. birx and the entire team continually ask we to remind the american people and we do so again today keep do what you ’re do with the 30 day to slow the spread and we will hasten the day that we heal our land

 dr. fauci

 dr fauci i just want to make one comment that relate to a question that be ask and then we ’ll have question i do not want to take too much time the idea about how we would evaluate from a purely public health standpoint about what i call reentry into some sort of normality as health people i do not know anything about nor do i ever claim to know anything about economic there be go to be people that know a lot more than i do who be go to give advice about all of the committee that the president be talk about

 but the one thing we do know as health people as physician and scientist and public health people as i mention i think over the weekend on one of the show be that some people may think it ’s go to be like a light switch on and off you know we ’re either out and we ’re in it ’s just not go to be that way because we have a very large country and there be different impact as you see new york be very different from other part of the country from the midwest from the mountain region california and washington different than new orleans

 so as we discuss and consider the public health aspect it likely would be something that i refer to as sort of like a rolling reentry it ’s not go to be one size fit all so i do not know what it ’s go to be yet because we still have time to look at it

 dr. birx who do an amazing job with show you the datum and the chart that ’s go to likely influence some of the recommendation that we will make but i can assure you there will be recommendation that will be base purely on public health and the president will get a lot of other input from other but we ’ll give the honest public health recommendation

 the vice president thank you tony admiral admiral polowczyk will give an update on supply and then we ’ll take a few question

 rear admiral polowczyk thank you mr. vice president can i have the ventilator slide back up i ’ll just start from there all right thank you

 so you start with what ’s in the stockpile this morning and then here ’ the contract that we ’ll be deliver over the next few week and we add 8,600 ventilator to the pool we already have that ’s the that ’s the math that you that you get there that ’ a that ’s include the dpa action with gm

 and we ’ll say that we ’ve also issue what would be call rate order with all of these vendor to allow they front of the line privilege so to speak with within their supply chain so these there’s we’ve you know write the contract this be the 100,000 plus ventilator we ’re talk about and then continue to work with they to ensure that the ventilator actually show up so there ’ a continue to work there and as we do that we realize that downstream supply chain need some additional defense production act work as well

 if you go out to the air bridge—80 flight schedule 37 complete 43 on the on the horizon and you can see the number of material that ’s be bring in to supplement the volume that ’s need

 now i ’m go to go through a series of slide of new york first so dr. birx provide i what i will call as a geographic reference to align the supply chain so all of those city you’ll see a little bit of a theme here i ’ll be talk about a lot of the a lot of the city and geographic area

 i align the supply chain to those geographic area to try to get as much there while we realize the rest of the nation need supply as well and then we align to the supply chain to site of care public hospital va private hospital nursing home first responder acute care and on down the line

 so the last business week so monday of last week through friday saturday of the past week these be the mass material that come into the new york new jersey metro area and you can see the volume there

 so if you go to detroit we talk about their hotspot here ’ the volume of delivery go into detroit for that same time period

 if you can go to chicago and i ’m go to run through this kind of quick but you can see that the geographic alignment the place that dr. birx have talk about be where we ’re concentrate supply

 you can go to new orleans to give you an understanding washington d.c. right so now i can talk about that today be a you know a very kind of early entry into the washington d.c. baltimore right?—positioning supply ahead of need we hope in washington

 go to baltimore and you can see try to the volume there try to get ahead of that and then philadelphia be next

 and then now the next slide be a nine city roll up and so to save a little time i do not include boston and houston in there so you can see the volume of material flow through a commercial network air bridge their supply into geographic region and then and then far prioritize to site of care

 now final topic n95 mask so the department of defense announce a dpa action this weekend that come over from dod on friday into the white house approve on saturday and contract award today $ 131 million five company 3 m honeywell owens amp minor moldex and draeger

 you know the cares act be sign before the before march be end towards the end there so essentially two week from that money be put into the title iii authority for dod this action take we from a baseline of what what be be produce domestically of about 30 million mask upwards to as we go through the fall into the end of the winter 120 million mask domestically

 so currently we ’re fill some of that demand from overseas source right and so the additive mask here through this will ramp up low dependence on overseas source and that that will essentially secure a big piece of the supply chain

 five company six six city smithfield rhode island phoenix arizona del rio texas lexington north carolina sheboygan falls wisconsin and aberdeen north dakota all either produce more fabric or increase production facility to have that ramp up

 the vice president great great job thank you admiral

 and can we put that slide i guess it ’s still up this be for just the week end april 11 we have distribute or direct the distribution of 5.3 million n95 mask 5.5 million surgical mask 110 million glove we share that mostly just to make sure our healthcare worker know that the resource be flow we ’re go to continue to flow they but this be just the number for this week and do n’t include for instance what the president announce

 i be able to tell governor tom wolf of pennsylvania today that next week they ’ll be receive 2 million n95 mask to support some of the healthcare challenge that they ’re face in the broad philadelphia area

 so with that we ’ll be happy to take a couple of question go ahead

 q thank you so much one for the admiral and then one for dr. fauci if you do n’t mind

 the vice president yeah please

 q admiral would not it have be useful as you ’re go through you know all of those supply that be now make their way into the system you talk about have to buy foreign product you know as we ’re catch up and make it wouldn’t it have be useful if it have not take until mid march for the government to start place bulk order for these kind of supply

 rear admiral polowczyk okay so i come over from the pentagon the 20th of march so i ’ll speak from the 20th march on now we ’re use the defense production act i think you ’ll see much more use of that as we go forward you know we make

 q sir but my question be about the timing here and that lose time that the president early today deny

 rear admiral polowczyk i know and i ’m not i’m not equip to talk about other than from about the 20th of march forward i just i wasn’t i be over at the joint staff i be not involve

 the vice president okay

 q and i want to ask dr. fauci

 the vice president dr. fauci

 q:—you know you say that you ’d be you know give the president your recommendation you and dr. birx come up with a plan that you guy be comfortable with be you willing once the president have make his decision be you willing to come here and tell we tell the american public what you actually have recommend to he and whether he follow through with what you recommend

 dr fauci i ’m not really what do you mean like

 q so when the president stand up here whether it ’s you know may 1st whatever day it be and outline his plan be you willing to stand up here after he and tell we all tell the american public what it be that you have recommend he do if there be a difference

 dr fauci you know i have to think about that because you know when you have conversation with the president sometimes they really should be confidential in what you give he because he ’s go to have to make his own choice

 i ’d have to think about that

 q so that way we would know whether he be actually listen to the health advice that he ’s be provide

 dr fauci right yeah he be i mean he i can tell you one thing he ’ll listen but i think what ’s go to happen you know i do not know for sure be that he will get input from a number of individual represent a number of aspect of society one of they will be health the only thing that i can tell you be that i will give he the advice base on evidence my observation of what the good public health approach would be

 q dr. fauci

 dr fauci yeah

 q just to go back to where we start today which be with the president ’s seem frustration with some of the reporting about his early decision make process in january and february

 as i ’m sure you know the reason we in the press do that kind of reporting be so that the next president that come along have to deal with a pandemic can learn some of these lesson

 what having watch this unfold up close what do you think be the mistake that be make early on that a future president could learn from with the benefit of hindsight of course

 dr fauci you know i

 q because no president get everything right obviously

 dr fauci i understand i do not want to use the word mistake because when you ’re in the in the fog of war when you ’re do something you have to make decision you get input from a number of individual it ’ always a move target and i just do not want to be have anything take out of context because i already have one of those already in the last couple of days—(laughs)—so i do not want to go through it again

 i would not say mistake could thing have do well of course i mean nothing be perfect and you could always do well but i mean i hesitate to say something be a mistake

 q but with the benefit of hindsight with that caveat what could have be do well

 dr fauci well i mean i can’t i can not comment about anything outside of my own field but the thing that when i think back on be evolve in my mind be something that be a virus that be much bad than what i have think it be go to be base on what we have learn early on when it be first feel to be something that just jump from an animal to a human and really do not have much capability of go human to human and then all of a sudden you find out that not only be it not just animal to human but there be a lot of that ’s probably the way it start

 but then as you go back and you realize there be probably a lot of infection that maybe if we have deal into that a little bit more we could have learn that not only be it affect human to human but it ’s transmit really efficiently

 when i question myself i’m not perfect maybe i i would not say make mistake but maybe i should have really try to delve into that a little bit more about what be go on but the information be not as forthcoming as i would have like

 and then all of a sudden when you find out that you ’re deal with something that be not only what have be your bad nightmare because people ask i that what be your bad nightmare?”—a brand new virus that ’ respiratory transmit that have a high degree of transmissibility that have a high degree of morbidity and mortality you know be that a mistake maybe i should have be able to realize that early i ’m not sure it be a mistake it be just an evolve thing that we finally realize and say whoa this be really bad than we could have imagine

 aide all right last one guy

 q when you meet with abbott laboratories today what do you ask they to do what do they say they could do

 the vice president well we speak with abbott laboratories today about how we can increase significantly the production of cartridge for the 15 minute test because remember we’re we be we’re not only scale to rapidly expand testing across the country today and it ’ one of the reason why you hear i and dr. birx say that we be we have an entire team now that ’s go to be work with governor and with laboratory around the country to identify the machine that already exist today and that could be activate in do test

 but we also we also want to work with abbott laboratories for the long term because if the current trend line hold and i hope and i literally pray that we will soon find ourselves on the downslope of the coronavirus in this country this epidemic in its current form will come to an end

 but as we make decision in the day ahead to reopen america what president trump also want to do be have a policy in place to stay open and have the kind of surveillance testing available around the country so that cdc can do the immediate contact tracing when you have a positive test so that we can deploy resource like the new abbott 15 minute test specifically to nursing home

 we speak today to governor baker in massachusetts to governor hogan in maryland both of whom who have be very innovative implement federal guideline for prevent the spread of infectious disease at nursing home and we commend they for that but be able to increase the manufacture of those device so they can be deploy go forward in the month ahead be also a focal point of our effort

 so rapidly continue to expand testing today and the governor of louisiana tell i today that they have test at the high per capita accord to his number of any state in the union and we congratulate he for that but make sure that go forward we ’ll have the infrastructure of test all across america to deal with the coronavirus should it return in the future

 with that let i let i bid you all a good evening and we will be back tomorrow and

 q mr. vice president

 the vice president okay go ahead

 q i just have a question about these cartridge and this timeline because the new hampshire governor say the federal government be in charge of distribute those fema be so what be the timeline for when they ’ll have enough of they because they say they do not have enough illinois say they do not have enough so what ’s the timeline that you ’re work with

 the vice president yeah let i let i let dr. birx address that but there ’ a there be an initial tranche that we purchase there ’ some 18,000 abbott laboratory machine around the country and fema acquire a certain amount that be immediately distribute across the state

 but now abbott laboratories be literally produce some 50,000 a day and those be available in the open market and we ’re also go to be work with abbott and with the state to deploy those resource

 and we ’re also work with other manufacturer to increase the production of cartridge but if there ’s more to that that you want to add deb we ’ll make it the last

 dr birx no that be perfectly say i just want to sometimes you ask those question and i always want to make sure that people understand

 so a third of they go specifically to indian health service and to these state that have small epidemic two third of it go into the public market mostly target to the place where there be high disease but only two third go that way so that people could purchase they directly and one third go to the indian health service and to the small state that really need these

 and so i think what we ’re try to do now be balance the entire testing framework of medium- low- and high throughput machine to give everyone the maximum flexibility state by state base on what the need be at that moment

 if there ’ an outbreak and you have to do 5,000 test you ’re not go to do they on an id now machine that take 15 minute for every negative but you ’re go to do it on your high throughput machine so make sure everybody know where everything be and what be be run will be really critical move forward because we can not leave anything not on everything have to be on the table in order for we to be able to dramatically increase testing yet another we go up by a log in three week so if we ’re go to increase again it ’s go to have to be get every piece of equipment on

 the vice president let just again say thank you all for your time and attention and thank to every american who ’s join we tonight

 i just want to encourage you we ’re go to continue to lean into this effort to expand testing across the country to deploy supply to our incredible healthcare worker that have do such an amazing job in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic

 but my last word on behalf of the president on behalf of our entire task force be it ’ 30 day to slow the spread and i know we ’re almost at the halfway point and i know it ’s be a month of these mitigation strategy but i hope as you look on as you see the progress that ’s make on the west coast the beginning of real progress in the greater new york city area louisiana detroit and elsewhere i hope it will only steel your resolve to continue to do your part to slow the spread because we ’ll get through this but it ’ll take all of we to continue to do it

 so thank you to the american people for all your effort and we ’ll see you tomorrow



the president okay thank you very much please thank you a big day today at the white house all of american society be engage and mobilize in the war against the invisible enemy while we must remain vigilant it be clear that our aggressive strategy be work and very strongly work i might add

 new case be decline throughout the new york metropolitan area case in the detroit and denver metro area be flat washington d.c. baltimore philadelphia and st. louis be show great sign of progress and new case in houston and new orleans be decline

 the battle continue but the datum suggest that nationwide we have pass the peak on new case hopefully that will continue and we will continue to make great progress

 these encouraging development have put we in a very strong position to finalize guideline for state on reopen the country which we ’ll be announce we ’re go to be talk about that tomorrow we ’ll be have a news conference tomorrow sometime during the afternoon we ’re go to be announce guideline and we ’ll be talk about various state and it ’ very exciting

 it ’s be a horrible time to see such death and destruction especially when you come out of what be the great economy in the history of the world the great there ’s never be an economy like what we have produce but we ’ll produce it again and i think we ’ll produce it again very fast

 the medical and healthcare advance we ’ve make be critical to our continued progress we ’ve rapidly develop the most expansive and accurate testing system anywhere in the world and have complete more than 3.3 million test to date we have authorize 48 separate coronavirus test and the fda be work with 300 company and lab to widen our capacity still far

 today abbott labs announce that it have develop an antibody test that will determine if someone have be previously infect with the coronavirus and potentially develop immunity it ’ a great test the company say these test could be available to screen up to 20 million people in a matter of week

 my administration be also distribute vast amount of medical supply to state across the country through project air bridge which have be an amazing success we have complete 44 flight and these be flight of very very large airplane massive cargo planes—44 flight of critical supply as of today and an additional 56 flight schedule in the near future we have some very brilliant people work on this it ’ logistically incredible what they ’ve do and we ’ve also be work on this with the military and these people have be the genius of all of they together it have be incredible to watch

 in total through all channel the federal government have develop and deliver 39.4 million n95 mask 431 million glove 57 million surgical mask and 10.2 million gown we order 500 million mask and they ’ll be come shortly and we ’ve distribute 100 million mask

 follow our use of the defense production act gm announce that its first ventilator come off the assembly line in kokomo indiana a great place they do it in 11 day from start to finish a remarkable testament to the ingenuity of the american worker gm will ship over 600 ventilator this month alone with thousand more to come and we have other company do something similar

 and i think they say that there ’ a brief clip that we have of general motors send to we by general motors and i think they might be want to play that for your benefit please

 a video be play

 i know you get a little bit nervous when you see there be a clip about ready to be play but that be send to we by general motors and we think it would be a good one to play it ’ amazing it’s you know what they ’ve do in a very very short period of time

 they ’re now make thousand of ventilator and they ’re come out of the factory very rapidly at a clip that nobody can even believe but we have other also do it and these be very high grade ventilator so we ’re help a lot of people and at this moment nobody need they we have to remember during the surge nobody have need he for week now

 but we ’ll have they for stockpile and very importantly we ’re go to have they for other country because nobody be able to do thing like we can do and we ’re go to be able to help other country that be have tremendous problem to put it mildly

 my administration be use every available authority to accelerate the development study and delivery of therapy so important therapy treatment and ultimately what we want to come up with be a safe vaccine but frankly the therapy to i be the most important because it take care of people right now the vaccine have to be test so it take a long period of time but we have some great potential therapy already and we ’ll see how they ’re work we ’ll be able to report on that i think over the next week or two tremendous progress have be make

 at least 35 clinical trial of promising therapy be now underway so 35 different genius company if you look at aids if you look at ebola if you look at so many thing they ’ve come up with the answer to so many thing you would not have believe it and we ’re very honored to be work with they

 they include antiviral and also and they something which be incredible it keep the virus from multiply a mechanism that keep the virus from multiply immune therapy that prevent the immune system from overreach to the virus and convalescent plasma treatment that use antibody from the blood of recovered patient

 and we have a lot of patient who recover and they ’re so happy to have recover that the first thing they do be say we want to give our blood and they do that it ’ incredible we have thousand of people that be do that they recover and they feel they have an obligation because they ’ve get such great care and a lot of they do not think they be go to make it

 as the entire u.s. government work to combat the global pandemic it be absolutely essential that the key position at relevant federal agency be fully staff and we ’re not allow that to take place through our congress they ’re just not they’re just not give it to we we have many many position that be unstaffed because we can not get the approval the democrats be hold we up we can not get approval

 we ’ve get judge because we go through the process i guess we ’re up to 448 federal judge and that we ’ve get because we focus on it we take the maximum time because no matter who the judge be they take vast number of day and hour to approve and it leave no time leave for other very unfair system

 if a judge be go to be approve in one hour in one session it do not matter they’ll take the maximum number of hour and day you’re talk about day to get one judge approve and we ’re close to 250 judge but because of the way they ’re do it there ’ no time for anybody else and many of these people have be wait for two and a half year we have a couple that have be wait for long than that

 there be currently 129 nominee stick in the senate because of partisan obstruction many be nominate for vacancy that must be fill to assist with the coronavirus crisis and the result economic challenge and i ’ve read over the last couple of year well i do n’t fill position i do n’t fill position in some case we do not need the position and i ’m all for that but in many case you do but we can not get they approve by the democrats they will not release they

 the position include the director of national intelligence two member of the federal reserve board of governors the assistant secretary of treasury for financial markets of the united states and the undersecretary of agriculture responsible for administer food security program and sonny perdue who ’s go to be speak today be say please can i have this man can i have this particular person approve as soon as possible he ’s be tell i that for a long time and the democrats will not allow it to happen

 again every single judge every nominee we have go through maximum or at least they go through a long process so it take day and day and there ’ no time leave and it ’ just a concerted effort to make life difficult

 an example be michael pack he ’ my nominee for the ceo of the broadcasking sic]—broadcaste board of governors and he ’s be stick in committee for two year prevent we from manage the voice of america very important

 and if you hear what ’s come out of the voice of america it ’ disgust what thing they say be disgusting toward our country and michael pack would get in and he ’d do a great job but he ’s be wait now for two year can not get he approve

 the senator leave washington until at least may 4th the constitution provide a mechanism for the president to fill position in such circumstance the recess appointment it ’s call the senate ’s practice of dabble into so call pro forma session where no one be even there it have prevent i from use the constitutional authority that we ’re give that we ’re give under the recess provision

 the senate should either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominee or it should formally adjourn so that i can make recess appointment we have a tremendous number of people that have to come into government and now more so than ever before because of the virus and the problem we have to do it and we have to do whatever we have to do they ’ve make it very very difficult to run government i do not think any administration have do anywhere near what we ’ve do in three and a half year

 but every block every week they put up roadblock whether it ’ russia russia russia or whether it ’ impeachment hoax or whatever it may be it ’ always roadblock and a waste of time

 if the house will not agree to that adjournment i will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chamber of congress the current practice of leave town while conduct phony pro forma session be a dereliction of duty that the american people can not afford during this crisis it be a scam what they do it ’ a scam and everybody know it and it ’s be that way for a long time and perhaps it ’s never do before it ’s never be do before nobody be even sure if it have but we ’re go to do it we need these people here we need people for this crisis and we do not want to play any more political game

 i ’ve be wait for two and a half year three year for some of these people and they ’re great people they leave law firm they leave job they give up everything to do it and they ’ve be wait for three year two and a half year two year one year to get approve it ’ ridiculous and everyone know they ’re go to be approve but there ’s only so many hour in the day when you go through judge and you go through a lengthy hearing on judge that they know should be approve immediately and they could do it in one session one and they could do it in one hour and instead it take they many day

 in order to advance the health and security of our nation and all nation as we announce yesterday the u.s. government have put a hold on funding to the who world health organization pende a review of the organization ’s cover up and mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak over the objection of the who we take decisive action and early lifesave action to suspend travel from china they do not want to do it they be angry that we do it it be early on they be angry that we do it took they a long time to realize what be go on but i have a feeling they know exactly what be go on

 tragically other nation put their trust in the who and they do not do any form of ban and you see what happen to italy you see what happen to spain you see what happen to france who ’s guidance have fail to control their border at a very crucial phase quickly unleash the contagion around the world that be a horrible tragic mistake or perhaps they know i ’m sure they do not know the gravity of it but perhaps they know because if they know the gravity that would be an even bad offense

 to ease the economic pain of million of american family we ’ve now process $ 300 billion in loan to more than 1 million small business through the paycheck protection program this action have save million of american job it ’s be an incredible success and they want to replenish it now but again the democrats do not want to do that this be money that go to the worker of our country

 phase one be $ 350 billion dollar and now phase two we want to do $ 250 billion this go to worker and it go to small business so we can save all the small business around our nation

 mike mcfarland from nebraska recently say this historic relief have be a godsend for his small factory and the 136 americans who work there he save those job another small business owner tim miller from oklahoma call the program a total lifesaver for his auto repair shop ’s four employee story like these underscore why congress must replenish the paycheck protection program immediately the republicans want to do it they want to do it immediately they want to do it now and the democrats be stop it

 a short time ago cdc issue public health guideline for critical industry in a few moment agricultural secretary sonny perdue will elaborate on how these guideline apply to our nation ’s dedicated worker in the food processing profession because it ’ a profession it ’ incredible what they do food processing and they ’re keep our grocery store full the shelf be not bare like the shelf that i inherit when we take over the stockpile the medical stockpile where the shelf be bare the cupboard be bare i say

 tomorrow i ’ll also be lead a call with elect official who will consult with my administration as we work to restore our economy to full speed and we really think with all of the stimulus and all of the pen up demand we ’re go to have an economy that really come back quickly and we ’d like to see it more than match what we have before what we have before be a miracle and we think this be go to be even more than a miracle we ’re go to do it because we have the great people in the world

 we ’ll also be speak to america ’s governor tomorrow and then we ’ll be announce exactly what ’s happen you already know we ’ll be open up state some state much soon than other and we think some of the state can actually open up before the deadline of may 1st and i think that that will be a very exciting time indeed

 governor be look forward they’re chomp at the bit to get go again not all state be the same they ’re very different some be have very little problem some have do such a good job that they have very little problem and they ’re ready to go so vice president pence and i will be speak with the governor tomorrow we ’ll be discuss procedure

 today i speak with the leader of many of our nation ’s most renowned company and organization on how to achieve the full resurgence of the american economy my discussion include top leader in health and healthcare transportation technology financial service food beverage hospitality real estate retail agriculture construction energy labor manufacturing and sport industry

 we want to get our country open again we want to have our sport league open you want to watch sport it ’ important we miss sport we miss everything we want to get back

 these expert and innovator provide extremely productive feedback on how to safely reboot our economy they give we a lot of great idea we speak to a lot of very very smart people the high of the high tech the level of iq on some of those call be about the high you ’ve ever see on a phone call that i can tell you

 but we have a lot of great thought go into those call and a lot of question come out and also statement very strong statement as to what they recommend it be i think it be a great day we do a lot of a lot of call with a lot of very prominent people but more importantly very smart people and people that love our country

 they talk about the vital importance of our wide array of relief measure to address the present crisis and they provide valuable insight on how to move forward include on the role of protective gear where we have tremendous amount of protective gear come in robust testing and the future use of therapy and treatment

 they also underscore the crucial importance of strong supply chain and communication infrastructure we ’re talk about infrastructure for the middle of our country we ’re talk about broadband and thing that they frankly do not have and have not have for a long time because a lot of politician forget about they you can not forget about they they ’re really the heart and soul you can not forget about they

 and we ’re talk about the telemedical it ’ a new thing and it ’ incredible what they ’ve be able to do this be an industry that ’s just grow but it ’ take it ’s grow by leap and bound over the last five week people be learn so much without the ability to see a doctor they ’re learn so much and a lot of good thing be happen that ’ something that ’s really go forward i think go to be very important for our country

 as we ’ve see throughout our proud history america be never great than when our people be work in unison toward a common goal that ’ what ’s happen right now we ’ll go ahead we ’ll forge an even bright future today than we have and we ’ll be along with other nation hopefully we ’re work with other nation we’ll be the comeback kid all of we all of we

 it ’ incredible what ’s go on i ’m very proud of the people of this country i ’m very proud of the people i speak to today these be truly great brilliant people and we ’ve gain tremendous insight

 so tomorrow be go to be a very big day we ’re go to be speak with the governor we ’ll have some information on some opening and again we ’ll have some opening that will be will exceed our expectation and they ’ll be safe they ’ll be strong but we want to get our country back we want to get our country back and we ’re go to do it and we ’re go to do it soon

 with that i ’d like to ask dr. birx to come up and say a few word and then secretary sonny perdue and then vice president pence thank you very much thank you thank you

 dr birx thank you mr. president and thank you for summarize the state and what we ’re see so over the last five to six day we ’ve see decline in case across the country and this have be very reassuring for we

 at the same time we know that mortality and the fatality that we ’re face across the united states continue we know the number of people who be still in the hospital in the icu and we want to continue to recognize the healthcare worker who be on the frontline and really recognize how low the united states case fatality rate be compare to other country and this be really due not only to our technology but how that technology be utilize to save life

 at the same time i ’m inspire by the american people who continue social distancing these case continue to decline because of the strong work of the american people

 i also want to let you know that we do have nine state that have less than 1,000 case and less than 30 new case per day so we ’re look at state and metro area as individual individual area

 we talk before how each of these curve be different each of the case ’s experience be different we have some state like california and washington state oregon that never really have a peak because of so much work that their population do to decrease and keep the new case down so each of these individual state and individual metro be be study very specifically

 i do want to highlight and we be remain concern and we ’ve be have discussion with rhode island rhode island and providence be in a unique situation first they have increase case from the new york city area and now they have new increase case from the boston area they be catch between two incredible hotspot in the country they ’re do an extraordinary job they ’re care for the individual on the frontline but providence continue to have new case

 and we do continue to work with specific state that have specific outbreak relate to individual occurrence i will just remind the american people again this be a highly contagious virus social gathering come together be there ’s always a chance that a asymptomatic person can spread the virus unknowingly no one be intend to spread the virus we know if you be sick you will stay home but to all of you that be out there that would like to join together and just have that dinner party for 20 do not do it yet continue to follow the presidential guideline

 we really appreciate the work of the american people we see as a country we ’re improve we see as metro area we ’re improve we see as community as county and as state we ’re improve but that also still require everyone to continue to social distance

 and in the end we do have state that have very few case and very few new case and so these be the one the president be refer to that have be silent relatively silent throughout this epidemic and pandemic that many of we have face and so these be the group we be work with very specifically and each of these governor and each of these mayor will have to make decision after generalize guideline be put out so that they can do what ’ good for their community they be at the frontline

 and i want to conclude by really thank my pepfar team around the world who have be work tirelessly throughout the world to ensure that africa and asia do not experience this level of infection that we have see here they ’ve turn over their capacity from their embassy our u.s. hire throughout the world our ambassador be still on the frontline with our local staff work with ministry of health to confront this virus around the globe and i assure you that they be continue to invest in the health structure the laboratory and the frontline care to ensure that all of the work that we have do against tb hiv and malaria continue but that we use our capacity our laboratory our clinic our hospital that have be build by the american people and the generosity of the american people to really combat this covid-19 around the globe

 thank you

 the president thank you very much thank you doctor

 sonny please

 secretary perdue thank you mr. president for the opportunity to be here with you today and to i want you to know it ’ an honor to represent you in lead the department of agriculture and represent the constituency who be crucial in maintain our nation ’s food security enable we to keep food on the table of our american family not only just food but wholesome and safe food as well

 i ’d like to start my remark today by echo what my colleague at the cdc have be say regard the health and safety of our essential employee across the united states cdc have provide strategy there that aim at help our most critical worker both in healthcare and food processing to quickly and safely return to work after potential exposure to covid-19 provide those worker be symptom free and this guidance will help these critical industry in the food sector provide to protect the health and safety of essential worker while keep critical function work throughout the covid-19 response

 as we know any employee who develop symptom while on the job should go home immediately and the interim guidance be in line with cdc recommendation for healthcare worker care for those sick with covid-19

 so we appreciate the dedication and commitment of all the brave man and working woman work to keep their community feed and we will continue to work with the cdc to keep those individual as safe as possible during these challenge time

 in that vein there ’s be a lot happen this week as covid-19 be impact food process facility as you know for americans who be may be worried about access to good food because of this i want to assure you the american food supply be strong resilient and safe and in fact our food supply chain have show tremendous agility in shift production and logistic so suddenly from restaurant and institutional setting to retail setting

 to all the employer out there in this sector it ’ critical that you follow cdc guideline and guidance and good practice to keep all of your employee and people safe and healthy

 to employee and local public health official advise they the cdc have issue guideline on how to mitigate a situation if you have a positive case in one of your facility we need our local health authority and our state health authority to do everything they can to balance the demand of keep our facility operational and our critical industry go while at the same time keep the health and safety of employee as a top priority as well as our community

 so i want to also take this time to thank all of our critical essential food supply chain worker the entire country be count on these patriotic individual by do the work in our food supply chain these dedicated worker include obviously farmer and producer but also processer trucker and grocery store worker as you know

 america be depend on what you have the food we need to feed our family and you ’re the one who be make that happen thank you

 as an entire nation we ’re truly thankful for the work you ’re do and we recognize that you be the true patriotic hero during this national emergency along with our healthcare worker

 so before i sign off here mr. president i want to remind you and all of we of one more thing in the united states we have plenty of food for all of our citizen i want to be clear the bare store shelf that you may see in some city in the country be a demand issue not a supply issue the way food be prepare and package to be sell in a restaurant or a school be significantly different than the way it ’s package for you to buy in the grocery store our supply chain be sophisticated efficient integrate and synchronize and it ’s take we a few day to relocate the misalignment between institutional setting and grocery setting but that do not mean that we do not have enough food in this country to feed the american people

 you might think of it as an interstate when it ’s flow in along well and you have a crash in one place it back up and that ’ what ’s happen in the food supply chain but we ’re work through that

 and all this through all this our food supply chain have prove to be very resilient just like american people to the extent we have challenge we have and continue to to work through it all together and we can and we will get through this with a whole of america approach mr. president the critical partnership between state and local health official management of company and the employee and we will meet any challenge we face by work together

 please mike please

 the vice president thank you mr. president the white house coronavirus task force meet today it be report to we that we ’ve conduct and complete 3,324,000 test across the nation more than 619,000 americans have test positive but as you reflect yesterday when we welcome coronavirus survivor here to the white house from across the country some more than 45,000 americans have fully recover

 sadly we mourn the loss of more than 27,000 of our our countryman our heart be with their family and with the family of all of those that continue to struggle with the serious consequence of this illness but as dr. birx just reflect despite the heartbreaking loss we ’re get there america

 because of the effort of people all across this country to put into practice the president ’s coronavirus guidelines because of their adherence to the direction of state and local authority as dr. birx just reflect we we see great sign of progress from the west coast to the east coast

 president trump have direct our team to develop new guideline that will be present tomorrow to our nation ’s governor and and release to the american people thereafter

 the american people will be encourage to know that as we stand here today 24 percent of the county of this country have no report coronavirus case in fact half of the state in america have less than 2,500 case per state this be a great tribute to the effort by the people of those community

 but as the president suggest when we unveil the guideline that the team have be work to present tomorrow to our nation ’s governor we ’re go to reflect on the fact that as the president say there will be area of the country that will require continued mitigation and strong effort and there will be other area of the country that will be be give guidance for great flexibility and the president have so direct our team

 when we think of more than 619,000 americans having test positive more than 45,000 having recover we want to announce today that the fda recently announce effort to facilitate the development and access to convalescent plasma mr. president you ’ve speak about this people who have recover from the coronavirus have antibody in your bloodstream that can attack the virus

 the mayo clinic today be work with the red cross to make sure that coronavirus patient have access to the convalescent plasma treatment and over 1,000 institution across america have already join this program

 and we want to urge every american who have recover from the coronavirus for at least two and preferably four week to contact your local blood or plasma donation center and arrange to donate it ’ one more way that the american people can do their part and step forward and thousand have already do so and we know that ten of thousand will join they

 on the subject of supply mr. president i ’ll be very brief because you detail a great amount as the president mention the air bridge have complete 44 flight fifty six more be schedule

 but on the subject of facial mask which be so important for the protection of critical infrastructure i ’m pleased to report that the average daily delivery through the commercial network through our air bridge be 22 million facial mask come into the marketplace the average inventory in the network over a seven day period be 80 million mask and fema be actually work as we speak to move facial mask to priority infrastructure food supply first responder there ’ll be 6.5 million mask that go out before the end of this week an additional 20 million before april the 20th and then we ’ll be add 6.5 million each and every week

 at that the president ’s direction we ’re go to ensure that all of those that work in food supply all of those first responder have access to mask and we ’re increase those every day

 finally i know i speak for the president when i say how proud we be of all of our healthcare worker across the country and how proud we be of the man and woman in uniform our medical professional who have be deploy across the nation literally by the thousand

 in fact as we stand here today 576 doctor nurse and other military medical professional have be deploy to 13 hospital across the nation 10 in new york and 1 in connecticut texas and louisiana each

 and as the president reflect a few day ago because we do not have the happily do not have the demand on the javits center and on the comfort in new york city at the president ’s direction we have deploy doctor and nurse from those two facility to hospital in fact the president and i be just speak to mayor de blasio just before we come out and he express his great admiration and appreciation for the relief that these medical military personnel have provide to incredibly dedicated people in our hospital two hundred and fifty eight medical personnel just yesterday be deploy off the ship and out of the javits center into new york

 with that mr. president i ’ll step aside but it ’ remarkable to think of all that we ’ve accomplish over the last month since you first issue the presidential guidelines for america

 the truth be because of what the american people have do over the last 30 day we be slow the spread we be ensure that every american family would have access to the healthcare that we ’d want any member of our family to have with the great healthcare professional in the world we ’re save life and we ’re heal our land

 and so we want to thank the american people for all you have do and tomorrow we ’ll be present a new guidance to the governor of this country about how we build on our progress and reopen america in a safe and responsible way

 the president well the governor can control that flow as an example in fact i just see a little while ago it be report that certain border be be control already by state they ’re start to take control of their border which be good so they ’ll be control they may do testing for people want to come in i ’d read that about rhode island so they have to watch it they have to be very careful

 yeah please in the back

 q thank you mr. president about reopen the country again you say along with other nation what form would it take be you consider also relax the border between canada and the u.s.

 the president so our relationship with canada be very good we ’ll talk about that it will be one of the early border to be release canada be do well we ’re do well we ’ll see but at some point we ’ll be do that

 in the meantime nation that be heavily infected we have a lot of nation that be heavily infect some be get well some be still on the way up unfortunately we ’re keep very strong border with those nation but with canada we be talk about different thing

 yeah please

 q mr. president you say the the evidence suggest that nationwide we have pass the peak on new case what ’s your evidence for that what be the number say

 the president well all we ’re do be look at the number we ’re look at our graph we ’re look at our model we ’re get a great response from deborah and from tony and from many of the professional that be work we have great professional work with we and i think base on that we’re we’re do very well

 base on that it look like we ’re head absolutely in the right direction but some state be look at other state and they ’re say i can not imagine what they ’re go through”—because they ’re not in that position they ’re in very good shape

 i would say that we have 20 state at least but you really have 29 that be in extremely good shape you have other that be get much well and i think with almost a few exception you have every state that be either do well or on the way to do well

 yeah please

 q mr. president

 the president yeah go ahead

 q thank you mr. president

 the president go ahead

 q on your threat to adjourn or adjourn congress on clearly you have the power article two section three but that would be quite radical to do

 early last month you be in the oval office talk about now be not the time for partisanship how will that act lower the partisanship in this town and could it potentially hinder your ability to get something do on coronavirus and then

 the president well it be it’s look it ’s be a very partisan government for a long period of time not just this administration you can go back into the last two administration you ’ve see a lot of partisanship and even now you would think that we would not have

 as an example with the paycheck plan that ’s go so well it ’ so smooth so beautiful almost without a hitch all of that money be be distribute to small business they ’re give it to their employee it ’s keep they ready viable so when we open and now it ’s be so good that it ’s almost deplete and we want to replenish it and we can not get the democrats to approve it and that ’ a program that they and everybody else admit that be great

 so you do have partisanship we have be try for year to get people approve for position people have leave one man leave a law firm one man leave a a big chain he be a very successful executive he leave it be two year ago we have people that have be wait for three year and we can not get they approve by the democrats in the senate because they ’re take so long to approve our judge

 now i have to tell you that i ’m totally in favor of what mitch be do with judge because that’s always seem to be a priority and it ’ a very important priority i think it ’ one of the great trademark of this administration we ’ve approve record number of federal judge and appellate judge and two supreme court judge

 but rather than approve somebody who ’ highly qualified somebody that everybody know be go to be approve rather than go quickly they take the maximum amount of time whatever that time may be and what they ’re do by do that be take day to approve somebody that could be approve in a quick vote people that get phenomenal review in committee be go maximum number of hour and what they do be there ’s only so many hour in a day

 now we could have say let ’s stay i would have be in favor of that they do not choose to do it but i have a very strong power i ’d rather not use that power but we have way over 100 people that we very badly need in this administration that should have be approve a long time ago and one of they be the head of voice of america if you look at what they ’re do and what they ’re say about our country it ’ a disgrace the people that be run that we have somebody that ’ really good really talente and that love our country and i want to get these people approve

 that ’ one of many we have professional sonny you ’ve be wait for how long have you be wait for the man that we ’re talk about come in

 secretary perdue two and a half year

 the president two and a half year so sonny perdue just happen to be here talk about something else so you ’ve be wait for one of the most important position as secretary of agriculture be the position it ’ distribution we need it now we ’re talk about shelf we ’re talk about cupboard he need it he ’s be wait he do not know he be go to get this question you ’ve be wait two and a half year

 the person be exceptional that person leave a very good job and it ’ embarrassing to i he ’ll say do you think you ’ll get that man approve he ’s be say that to i for a long time it ’s because of the democrats

 and what we ’re do be and i think anybody here would do it judge be a priority a federal judge be go to sit for 50 year potentially a young judge go to be sit for that ’s always go to have to be a priority

 but because they ’re take so much time and approve every they’re try to put we through the mill that’s when you talk about partisanship and it ’s never ever happen before you can look at every administration in the history of this country nobody nobody have ever have hundred of people not approve after three and a half year

 go ahead please

 q what ’s the timeline for that though if congress do not act by when do you have a date

 the president well we ’ll know soon look they know i they’ve be warn and they ’re be warn right now if they do not approve it then we ’re go to go this route and we ’ll probably be challenge in court and we ’ll see who win

 but when the court hear that we be n’t get people approve as sonny would say for two and a half year for an important position that we need because of this crisis we need these people before but now we really need these people

 q mr. president when you talk about back to the number for a second when you talk about the number the jobless claim be go to come out tomorrow it ’ likely around 5 million more americans put their name in for unemployment benefit but yet there be still a couple thousand people as well die a day because of coronavirus

 when you talk about open up the american economy or at least in part now how do you balance that decision out give both of those figure

 the president well we be there have to be a balance you know there ’ also death involve in keep it close and i ’ve go over this with you and i believe this so strongly when you look at mental health when you look at suicide suicide hotline which be explode people lose their job when you look at drug and people that do not take drug and now they ’re become drug addict because they ’re go through a problem they have no job they have no money come in other than the money we ’re get they we ’ve open up the coffer to a large extent we ’re help people

 this be why i wish the democrats would help we a little bit with it because they should it ’ purely partisan what they ’re do and it ’ bad for our country but but you know there be death by do by have this strongly closed country we have to get back to work

 with all of that be say we ’re go to start with state and with governor that have do a great job and they ’re go to open it up as they see fit and we ’re go to be right behind they and we’re we’re go to be work we ’re go to be supply they with thing if they do n’t have they we want they to have they

 we ’re go to be help they with ventilator after this be over so that they can not say oh the federal government we want they to have they’ve have a lot of option many of the governor have have a lot of option over the year to buy ventilator they do not choose to do it so we ’re go to be help they to fill up their stockpile we ’re go to have plenty and as i say i ’m very proud to do it

 we ’re go to be help other nation we ’re go to be help italy spain france other nation and we ’re go to be help they strongly i think russia be go to need ventilator they ’re have a hard time in moscow we ’re go to help they we ’re go to help other country that need ventilator

 we ’re go to have a lot you see it with general motors you see it with other company that be produce we ’re go to have hundred of thousand of ventilator and it ’ a great thing to have

 yes in the back please be anybody freeze laughter you know it ’ very cold out here so we can leave early right laughter

 okay a couple more go ahead please

 q thank you mr. president why do we have 20 percent of the world ’s death from the coronavirus when we ’re only 4 percent of the world ’s population

 the president well you do not know what you have do you think you ’re get honest number from some of these country do you really believe those number in this vast country call china and that they have a certain number of case and a certain number of death do anybody really believe that

 here ’ the story we report everything we ’re report the case and our reporting be good we ’re report every death in fact i see this morning where new york add 3,000 death because they die and they ’re now say rather than it be a heart attack”—they’re say it be a heart attack cause by this so they ’re add if you look at it that ’s it

 and everything we have be document report and what they be do be just in case they ’re call it this and that ’ okay that ’ okay but we be we have more case because we do more reporting we have more case because everything be down

 but do anybody really believe the number of some of these country that you ’ve be watch and you ’ve be report on and then it ’ like they do not have the big thing they have be some really really bad heavily and really some country that be in big big trouble and they ’re not report the fact and that ’s up to they

 all i know be we report the fact and we ’re a country that ’s get well

 john go ahead

 q mr. president multiple source be tell fox news today that the united states government now have high confidence that while the coronavirus be a naturally occur virus it emanate from a virology lab in wuhan that because of lax safety protocol an intern be infect who later infect her boyfriend and then go to the wet market in wuhan where it begin to spread do that correspond with what you have hear from official

 the president well i do not want to say that john but i will tell you more and more we ’re hear the story and we ’ll see when you say multiple sources”—now there ’ a case where you can use the word sources”—but we be do a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happen

 go ahead please

 q in your many conversation with president xi mr. president do you ever discuss with he state department concern about lax safety protocol that have be report to the state department from the embassy in beijing about that laboratory

 the president i do not want to discuss what i talk to he about the laboratory i just do not want to discuss it it ’ inappropriate right now

 please go ahead in the back

 q tim arvier from channel 9 australia there have be call in our country for prime minister scott morrison to make funding for who conditional on reform to the organization i want to get your thought on that and if you have any advice for mr. morrison

 the president look i feel very badly about the world health organization but it ’s be a tool of china it ’s be as i say totally china centric you take a look at everything that ’ happen they ’ve be wrong i be all for it at the beginning what do i know i walk in i say world health organization isn’t that wonderful and then you start to see all the mistake they do not want we to close our border to china to wuhan specifically they do not want our border close

 you take a look mike be there we be all there and they ’re criticize i for close the border i do that very early by the way i do that very early while nancy pelosi be try to have in san francisco party in chinatown because they she think it would be great she want to show that this thing do not exist these be people i’ll tell you we have some politician on the other side that do not know what they ’re do

 if you look at if you look at timeline you’ve get to look at some timeline but the world the world health organization just like the world trade organization i’m tell you i call they they have be treat the united states for decade so badly and they ’ve be so in favor of china

 china take off when it join the world trade organization because of what ’s happen think of it they ’re consider a develop nation and because they ’re a dev-—and we ’re not but we ’re a develop nation too in my book okay we ’re develop too

 but the fact be we have be treat so badly by these organization and believe i i ’m look at that one too we ’re win a lot of lawsuit right now that we never win before in the past we ’re win a lot of money that we never win in the past that ’ with the world trade but with the world health organization what ’s happen there be a disgrace

 here ’ the other thing we pay $ 400- to $ 500 million a year china be pay $ 38- $ 39- and $ 40 million a year and it ’ like they control this group i could do that too if i want to devote full time to it i have some very capable people deal with dr. tedros okay i could do it too i could do very well with that but there ’ something go on there ’ something go on that be very bad

 now the $ 500 million that we save we ’ll determine we’re go to make a determination over a little period of time but they ’re go to either have to make massive change i do not even know if they ’re go to be able to do that or we ’re go to give money to people we want to help people you know what we do in africa with aids people have no idea what we do and the money we spend we be talk about it the other day doctor

 we be spend billion of dollar to help people in the case of one that dr. birx be very much involve in aids billion of dollar and you know what it ’ a great thing nobody talk about it nobody give we credit we do that and we do it very directly

 but we ’re spend billion of dollar to help people live and all over the world but we ’re spend $ 500 million to the world health organization and there ’ something very bad go on and you know what i ’ve get very much involved it ’s be go on for a long period of time and we do not want to be the sucker anymore

 so it ’ cold out we will talk to you tomorrow a big day tomorrow very big day thank you



the president thank you very much later this evening we expect the house to pass the paycheck protection program and health care enhancement act i ’m grateful that congress be answer my call to deliver these additional $ 320 billion in relief for the american worker and for small business

 at a time when many americans be endure significant economic challenge this bill will help small business to keep million of worker on the payroll you see state be start to open up now and it ’ very exciting to see i think it ’ very awe inspiring we ’re come out of it and we ’re come out of it well

 and we’re really i ’m very happy the governor have be the governor really have be do a really good job work with we and it’s it ’s really pretty impressive to see i ’ve speak to numerous leader of country over the last 48 hour and they be say we ’re lead the way we ’re really lead the way in so many different way

 i ’m also very pleased that harvard as you know it ’ harvard and stanford and princeton and numerous other university and college and also large business have send fund back to we and in some case i stop fund that i look at and we be pleased to report that the fund have either not go out or it ’ about $ 350 million and they ’ve either not go out or we ’ve renegotiate it and they ’re not get they

 so and it’s in a couple of case they ’re send they back and send they back immediately so i think it be very nice i want to thank harvard in particular they act very quickly and decisively and they agree when they hear the fact that they should not be get it so we appreciate it very much from harvard princeton stanford and other institution

 the bill also include $ 30 billion to support small lending institution serve distressed community help countless african american and hispanic american small business

 as we continue our battle against the virus the datum and fact on the ground suggest that we ’re make great progress in 23 state new case have decline in the peak week forty percent of american county have also see a rapid decline in new case forty six state report drop in patient show coronavirus like symptom that ’ a big number

 to keep america gain momentum every citizen need to maintain the vigilance and we all understand that very well we ’ve go over it many many time this include practice good hygiene maintain social distance and the voluntary use of face cover

 a safe and phase reopening of our economy it ’ very exciting but it do not mean that we be let down our guard at all in any way on the contrary continued diligence be an essential part of our strategy to get our country back to work to take our country back we ’re win this and we ’re go to win it and we ’re go to keep watch we ’re go to watch very closely for the invisible enemy

 with each pass day we ’re learn more and more about this enemy the scientist at dhs have release a report offer a number of insight about how the virus react to different temperature climate and surface the finding confirm that the virus survive well in cold or in dry environment and do less well in warm and more humid environment

 i have to say that very excitingly we ’re go to have somebody up bill will be up in just a little while it be a great report you give and he ’s go to be talk about how the virus react in sunlight wait until you hear the number you will not even believe they

 u.s. trial of the covid-19 have be go on and have be approve in the united states germany uk and china that ’ big news and we’re a lot of trial be go on we have a lot of great brilliant mind work on this both from the standpoint of a vaccine and therapeutic

 we must be careful in all condition but we will we will get this do we ’re very close to a vaccine unfortunately we ’re not very close to testing because when the testing start it take a period of time but we ’ll get it do

 and i want to thank the head of dhs science and technology bill bryan for what he ’s go to be do and what he ’s go to be say and the report that he ’s about to give i think it ’s go to be something that nobody have ever hear it ’ll be brand new information and very important information

 my administration continue to leverage the defense production act to dramatically increase the manufacture and delivery of critical medical supply we finalize three contract to produce 39 million more n95 mask in 90 day and as you know we ’re also use a sterilization process some great equipment that will sterilize the mask up to 20 time per mask so that ’s like order 20 time more mask and it ’s work very well

 we just want the hospital and the institution where it be to use it a lot of people do not use it they ’re so used to get a new mask they do not want to use it they want to go and immediately get a new one we ’re ask they to use the sterilization process every bit as good up to 20 time think of that

 in addition to ramp up our domestic assembly line we also have airlift nearly 750 million piece of personal protective equipment into the united states through our project airbridge which have be an incredible thing to watch it ’ really a military operation

 the vice president be now provide each governor with an exhaustive count[y]-by county breakdown of the privately distribute personal protection and this be equipment and thing that be incredible it ’ personal protective equipment it ’ incredible and it ’ all brand new and at the high level we ’re get only the high level and also we ’re look at essential gear within their state and it ’s be deliver to different state quickly and as we speak

 this way the governor should know exactly what ’s be deliver through a private sector supply chain within their state as well as through the project airbridge we ’re try to get it immediately from the plane to the state when we can not do that we bring it into our facility and get it to the governor and we ’re get they fast and we ’re notify they very strongly so they know it ’s there governor can use this information to quickly ensure that they get material where and when they be need

 today i also want to extend my special thank to our nation ’s incredible county emergency management team who have be work relentlessly for week around the clock end on end to serve their community help distribute critical supply and save countless american life we salute these heroic official on the frontline

 as we continue to develop potential therapy the fda have recently begin a national effort to expand access to convalescent plasma donate from the blood of those who have recover from the virus the blood of these donor contain antibody that can potentially reduce the severity of the illness in those who be sick and frankly those that be very sick nearly 3,000 patient be now enrol in the expanded access program receive transfusion nationwide

 and i want to thank all of the people that recover for what they ’ve do they as i say yesterday they raise their hand when they barely can walk and they ’re say i want to donate blood i want to donate whatever it be that you want because we want to help people it ’ really quite incredible

 convalescent plasma will also be use to manufacture a concentrated antibody treatment that do not have to be match with a particular blood type this concentrated antibody treatment could be use as a preventative measure to keep healthcare worker and other high risk population from contract the virus in the first place a very big deal

 clinical trial of these product be slate to begin within week and we can maybe have a fairly quick solution i urge americans to get in there and keep do what you ’re do because again we want those people recover or recover from coronavirus to contact their local blood and plasma donation center to learn how they can help and they ’ve be so great and i just appreciate it

 my administration have also partner with leading and we have really be establish some great partnership with lead technology company and scientific journal to create a database of 52,000 scholarly article on the virus that can be analyze by artificial intelligence

 top ai expert be now use this wealth of datum to gain insight into potential therapy and we ’re collaborate with tech firm university and our national labs to harness american supercomputer in the search for treatment and vaccine that search be go on and it ’ be i think you ’ll see in the future you’ll see it ’ very successful ultimately it ’ll be a tremendous success great progress be be make at a rapid pace a pace like no other

 we have every hope that with the full might and resource of american science and technology and with the courage and devotion of the american people who have be so incredible we will end this plague and together we will restore the full measure of american strength and power and prosperity

 our country be go to do fantastically well you see what ’s go on there be a pen up demand in our country to get it back right where it be and maybe even well and that ’ what ’s go to happen

 so with that i ’d like to ask mike pence to come up vice president say a few word please mike

 the vice president thank you mr. president and good afternoon today the white house coronavirus task force meet and while our heart be with the family of those who have lose their life to the coronavirus and those who be struggle with serious illness today our team lead by dr. deborah birx inform we that the datum continue to show promising sign of progress

 the new york metro area new jersey connecticut detroit and new orleans all appear to be past their peak and we be see consistent decline in hospitalization and case in region across the country

 our only conclusion be that we ’re get there america because the american people have put into practice the president ’s guideline of social distancing because you ’ve be listen and adhere to the guidance of state and local official we be we’re making we’re make meaningful progress in a very real sense spare americans to be expose to the coronavirus and no less extent save life

 our task force actually believe mr. president that if we continue these mitigation effort in the day ahead as state implement their policy include phase reopening that we ’ll preserve those gain we do believe by early summer we could be in a much well place as a nation with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind we

 early today we also have a conference call lead by secretary ben carson and leader from hud about the president ’s announcement yesterday that he be repurpose the white house opportunity and revitalization council to focus on the impact of the coronavirus on minority community secretary carson will convene the council tomorrow and we ’ll be report tomorrow afternoon on their progress

 we want to thank the more than 270 leader of organization dedicate to housing homelessness and improve the life of people across our urban community not only for be with we today for the way they have partner with our administration and partner with state and local official to put the health of all of their constituency first

 as the president mention we’ll you’ll receive a report that our task force receive formally this week from bill bryan of the science and technology directorate at the department of homeland security he will outline as the president say encourage news about the impact that heat and sunlight have on the coronavirus which will increase the confidence that we feel about the come summer

 on the subject of testing at the present moment we have report of 4.93 million test having be perform across america and encourage news as state have be engage commercial lab at a high level across the country yesterday our commercial lab system do more than 100,000 test in a single day so we ’re begin to activate all of the capacity

 and tomorrow at the president ’s direction our task force will convene a conference call with all of the nation ’s governor to talk about the progress that they be make on testing and we ’re go to hear from governor about the practice that and method that they be employ to significantly increase testing follow our briefing about capacity in laboratory this past monday

 for instance governor mike dewine just announce that ohio ’s testing have be greatly expand after the fda approve thermo fisher ’s new extraction reagent say in his word that the action quote probably double maybe even triple testing in ohio virtually overnight

 governor tim walz of minnesota announce along with the state ’s healthcare system the mayo clinic and the university of minnesota what he describe as a breakthrough for rapid widespread testing able to test more than 20,000 people use a molecular test per day

 governor kim reynolds of iowa launch the test iowa initiative that will triple testing capacity by partner with nomi health and domo she also work with the university of iowa hospitals to leverage further capacity

 and governor eric holcomb and governor andy beshear of indiana and kentucky respectively both announce additional drive through testing location

 our priority have always be to focus first on those impact by the coronavirus and then on those extraordinary healthcare worker minister to their need every day and i know mr. president how proud you be that our man and woman in uniform have come alongside our healthcare worker in community most impact and i know the american people be proud as well

 as of today fema report that 35,000 national guard have be deploy across the country to aid in our coronavirus response governor kevin stitt of ohio oklahoma actually deploy the national guard to hospital across the state to evaluate protective equipment and hospital capacity and report it in to state emergency management and fema

 and governor greg abbott of texas actually mobilize more than 1,200 national guard and 45 team to provide great access to testing

 along with the national guard at the president ’s direction today more than 4,500 active duty military doctor nurse and medical assistant have be deploy across the country yesterday 1,013 medical professional in our military be actually deploy to 19 hospital in 7 state to support those amazing healthcare worker

 and with 4.4 million more americans file for unemployment in the past week i join the president in welcome passage in the house today of the paycheck protection program it ’ll support work family it ’ll allow small business to keep people on the payroll for a period of two month but it also as the president request include $ 75 billion to assist hospital across the country

 and in that spirit the president and i will continue to urge state across the country give the unique burden on hospital we be now encourage state to restart elective surgery wherever possible either statewide or on a county by county basis we recognize the role elective surgery play in finance for local hospital and we ’ll be work with state to enable that

 in that vein governor doug ducey exec-—issue an executive order not long ago allow elective surgery begin may 1 for hospital that meet certain preparedness criterion

 and indiana ’s governor eric holcomb be allow elective clinical procedure to begin on april 21st

 finally mr. president the task force receive today our first report on state reopening plan at the present moment 16 state have release formal reopening plan thirteen of those be actually release since you unveil the opening up america guidelines to our governor and to the nation last week

 and to your point mr. president state be begin to make those plan and we ’re encourage to see so many state embrace the phased approach to reopen their economy that ’s contemplate in our guidelines for open up america again

 for instance governor mike parson of missouri announce the show i strong recovery plan as two initial phase intend to protect the most at risk

 governor tom wolf announce the plan for pennsylvania that would begin may 8th will end a stay at home order for just portion of pennsylvania but the plan again require region to have few than 50 new positive case per 100,000 for a period of 14 day and it also lay out a phase reopening roadmap

 governor kate brown of oregon update their framework for reopen do three phase again on a county by county basis

 and governor brad little of idaho release rebound idaho in just the last few day that will consist of four phase and require specific criterion that idaho and business need to meet to begin to reopen

 mr. president with the with the guidelines to open up america again state be make plan and at your direction our task force will continue to work very closely provide they with the datum provide they with the resource to be able to implement those plan in a safe and responsible way

 so with that let i just end where i begin and to say thank you to the american people the progress that we be see be a testament to what all of you have do to our extraordinary healthcare worker to a partnership between the federal government and to state and local official and i ’m confident it ’s also owe to the prayer of million of americans each and every day

 all of that combine we’re we’re slow the spread we ’re protect the most vulnerable we ’re save life and every single day we be one day close to open up america again

 with that mr. president i ’d be pleased to call bill forward bill bryan lead the science and technology directorate at the department of homeland security and now will make a presentation on their recent study

 act under secretary bryan thank you mr. vice president thank you mr. president

 the president thank you bill

 act under secretary bryan:—for this opportunity to do this today

 good afternoon everybody my name be bill bryan and i lead the science and technology directorate at the u.s. department of homeland security over the last several month we ’ve intensify the department ’s r&amp;d effort to identify and deliver information that inform our response to covid-19 s&amp;t be work to identify develop deploy and deploy the tool and information to support our response to this crisis

 as part of our effort we ’re leverage the unique capability of s&amp;t ’s national biodefense analysis and countermeasures center to study the biology of the covid-19 virus this center be a high biocontainment laboratory locate in frederick maryland it be establish in the early 2000 in response to the amerithrax attack and where we study characterize analyze and develop countermeasure for biological threat to the homeland we work closely with the cdc fda hhs and also our department of defense colleague and many other

 yesterday i share the emerge result of our work that we ’re do now with the coronavirus task force and today i would like to share certain trend that we believe be important

 if i may have the first slide please and while that ’s come up our most striking observation to date be the powerful effect that solar light appear to have on kill the virus both surface and in the air we ’ve see a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well where increase the temperature and humidity or both be generally less favorable to the virus

 so let i illustrate with this first slide if you look to the right you ’ll see that term half life with a bunch of timestamp on there

 first let i tell you what a half life be we do not measure the virus as far as how long we live on the surface we have to measure the decay of the virus in term of its half life because we do not know certain element we do not know how much a person expectorate when he when he spit right?—when he sneeze whatever the case may be we do not know how much virus be in there so it’s that have a long a bearing on how long the virus be go to be alive and active so we measure it in half life because half life do n’t change

 so if you look at an 18 hour half life what you ’re basically say be that every 18 hour the virus it ’s the life of the virus be cut in half so if you start with 1,000 particle of the virus in 18 hour you ’re down to 500 and 18 hour after that you ’re down to 250 and so on and so forth that ’ important as i explain in the rest of the chart

 if you look at the first three line when you see the word surface we ’re talk about nonporous surface door handle stainless steel and if you look at the as the temperature increase as the humidity increase with no sun involve you can see how drastically the half life go down on that virus so the virus be die at a much more rapid pace just from exposure to high temperature and just from exposure to humidity

 if you look at the fourth line you inject summer the sunlight into that you inject uv ray into that the same effect on line two as 70 to 35 degree with 80 percent humidity on the surface and look at line four but now you inject the sun the half life go from six hour to two minute that ’ how much of an impact uv ray have on the virus

 the last two line be aerosol what do it do in the air we have a very unique capability i be discuss this with the president prior to come out he want i to convey it to you on how we do this i believe we ’re the only lab in the country that have this capability

 but if you can imagine a home depot bucket a five gallon home depot bucket we’re able to take a particle and this be develop and design by our folk at the nbacc we ’re able to take a particle of a virus and suspend it in the air inside of this drum and hit it with various temperature various humidity level multiple different kind of environmental condition to include sunlight and we ’re able to measure the decay of that virus while it ’s suspend in the air this be how we do our aerosol test

 we work with john hopkin applied physics lab and we actually develop a large drum to do actually more testing and it ’ four time the size of that so this be the capability that we bring to this effort

 so in summary within the condition we ’ve test to date the virus in droplet of saliva survive well in indoor and dry condition the virus do not survive as well in droplet of saliva and that ’ important because a lot of testing be do be not necessarily be do number one with the covid-19 virus and number two in saliva or respiratory fluid

 and thirdly the virus die the quick in the presence of direct sunlight under these condition and when you when you look at that chart look at the aerosol as you breathe it you put it in a room 70 to 75 degree 20 percent humidity low humidity it last the half life be about an hour but you get outside and it cut down to a minute and a half a very significant difference when it get hit with uv ray

 and mr. president while there be many unknown link in the covid-19 transmission chain we believe these trend can support practical decision make to lower the risk associate with the virus

 if i can have my next slide

 and when that while that come up you ’ll see a number of some practical application for example increase the temperature and humidity of potentially contaminate indoor space appear to reduce the stability of the virus and extra care may be warrant for dry environment that do not have exposure to solar light

 we ’re also test disinfectant readily available we ’ve test bleach we ’ve test isopropyl alcohol on the virus specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluid and i can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minute isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 second and that ’s with no manipulation no rubbing just spray it on and let it go you rub it and it go away even fast we ’re also look at other disinfectant specifically look at the covid-19 virus in saliva

 this be not the end of our work as we continue to characterize this virus and integrate our finding into practical application to mitigate exposure and transmission i would like to thank the president and thank the vice president for their ongoing support and leadership to the department and for their work in address this pandemic i would also like to thank the scientist not only in s&amp;t and the nbacc but to the large scientific and r&amp;d community

 thank you very much

 the president thank you bill

 q mr. bryan

 the president thank you very much so i ask bill a question that probably some of you be think of if you ’re totally into that world which i find to be very interesting so suppose we hit the body with a tremendous whether it ’ ultraviolet or just very powerful light and i think you say that that have not be check but you ’re go to test it and then i say suppose you bring the light inside the body which you can do either through the skin or in some other way and i think you say you ’re go to test that too it sound interesting

 act under secretary bryan we ’ll get to the right folk who could

 the president right and then i see the disinfectant where it knock it out in a minute one minute and be there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it get in the lung and it do a tremendous number on the lung so it would be interesting to check that so that you ’re go to have to use medical doctor with but it sound it sound interesting to i

 so we ’ll see but the whole concept of the light the way it kill it in one minute that’s that ’ pretty powerful

 steve please

 q you ’re say that the country will be in a well place by early summer do that mean you ’re go to need to extend the social distancing guideline until then

 the president well we may and we may go beyond that we ’re go to have to see where it be and i think people be go to know you ’re go to know i ’m go to know i think people be go to know just out of common sense at some point we will not have to do that but until we feel it ’ safe we ’re go to be extend

 q you say you have 23 case where new cases—23 state where new case be on decline what do that mean about when the country can be safely reopen to a more normal point

 the president   yeah but it mean we ’re go to watch those case very carefully i think we ’ve all get very good at it we ’ve get good at trace we see where the case be where they ’re go and we ’re go to be watch it and it ’s call containment at a certain point we ’re go to be able to contain

 and you know when you see this a lot of people have be talk about summer maybe this be one of the reason we’ve i once mention that maybe it do go away with heat and light and people do not like that statement very much the the fake news do not like it at all and i just throw it out as a suggestion but it seem like that ’s the case because when it ’s on a surface that would last for a long time when that surface be outside it go away very quickly it die very quickly with the sun

 yeah go ahead

 q you say yesterday that you ’re go to look into senator mcconnell ’s suggestion for allow state to declare bankruptcy versus the aid

 the president yeah we ’ll look into it and i have be look into it i ’ve be talk to a lot of the different senator but i do not want to talk about it now that be a very interesting presentation

 go ahead jon

 q well i want to talk about mcconnell ’s suggestion that aid to the state amount to a blue

 the president i just tell you i ’m not talk about it now

 q:—to a blue state inaudible

 the president i ’ll talk about it later

 q okay

 the president i ’d like to talk about something that right now be of more interest to people

 q could i ask mr. bryan a question

 the president yeah sure

 q thank you when you start your presentation you describe this as an emerge result do this mean your study be conclusive be there more work to do

 act under secretary bryan we ’re continue with that for example on the aerosol side you notice the figure be 20 percent humidity we ’re look at high humidity level we would expect that would even have a great impact on the virus we ’re look at other type of disinfectant and and so we’re this be a as a scientific community we ’re continue to study the virus to understand its characteristic

 q mr. bryan can you explain why some hotspot we ’ve see in the u.s. be hot and humid like new orleans for example

 act under secretary bryan let i explain if you look at the coronavirus as a chain with many link what we ’ve do through our study be we ’ve identify some of the weak link in that chain that the virus the transmission of the virus depend upon we identify that heat and humidity be a weakness in that chain we ’ve identify that sunlight solar light uv ray be a weakness in that chain that do not take away the other activity the guidance from the white house the guidance from the cdc and other on the action and step that people need to take to protect themselves

 this be just another another tool in our tool belt right another another weapon in the fight that we can add to it and in the summer we know that summer like condition be go to create an environment where the transmission can be decrease and that ’ an opportunity for we to get ahead

 q but i just can i ask about the president mention the idea of cleaner like bleach and isopropyl alcohol you mention there ’ no scenario that that could be inject into a person be there i mean

 act under secretary bryan no i ’m here to talk about the finding that we have in the study we will not do that within that lab and our lab so

 the president it would not be through injection we ’re talk about through almost a cleaning sterilization of an area maybe it work maybe it do n’t work but it certainly have a big effect if it ’s on a stationary object

 q mr. bryant be we simplify it too much by say that it ’d be well with the warm weather and the sun come out more and more that people would be outside than stay inside their home confine to the four wall of their house

 act under secretary bryan it would be irresponsible for we to say that we feel that the summer be just go to totally kill the virus and that if it ’ a free for all and that people ignore those guideline that be not the case

 we have an opportunity though to get ahead with what we know now and factor that into the decision making for what open and what do n’t

 the president but so be you say on surface the heat the hot summer and whatever other condition humidity and lack of humidity that that would have an impact so that on surface where it can be pick up it will die fairly quickly in the summer whereas in the winter it would not die so quickly

 act under secretary bryan yes mr. president when it ’s expose to uv ray take playground equipment for example the uv ray hit a piece of playground equipment will kill the virus when it hit that when it hit on the playground equipment but underneath where the sun do not get if someone touch that and have it on their hand it could still be there right because it have to be in direct light of the uv ray

 the president if it ’ on somebody ’s hand right

 act under secretary bryan yes

 the president and they have not touch their face and all of the thing that we ’ve all be

 act under secretary bryan if it ’s expose to the sun it ’ll

 the president i know but if they ’re outside right and their hand be expose to the sun will that kill it as though it be on a piece of metal or something else

 act under secretary bryan not i do not want to say it will at the same rate because it ’ a non porous surface but what we do know what we do know be that we look at the bad case scenario and the virus live long on non porous surface so porous surface it do not look quite as long so in theory what you say be correct

 the president this be sort of semi non porous right this right

 act under secretary bryan that ’ true yes mr. president

 q mr. bryan how can the governor

 cross talk

 the president wait wait wait wait okay go ahead

 q one at a time mr. bryan how should governor who be open their state work on that will incorporate the finding of this study into those guideline

 act under secretary bryan i would leave that up to the governor this be a

 q what be your advice

 act under secretary bryan this be a decision this factor into their decision process

 as i mention with know this knowledge and have this knowledge as we continue to study and far know what the virus do and how it react it could impact the way a governor will look at when he open in a state how he open it in what environment these thing be open up but i leave that up to the governor to make that decision

 q obviously at the moment the advice be stay at home by the summer could we be flip that and say you ’d be much well off be outside with uv ray or the humidity that washington bring in august

 act under secretary bryan i would not go contrary to the guidance that have be issue right now i think though to tell you that if if i ’m have an event with my family i ’m do it in the driveway or in the backyard not inside the house with my child

 the president in fact i ’m think about move outside to the rose garden laughter no it ’ a very interesting question actually

 okay please go ahead in the back

 q mr. bryan how much more research how much more time would it take to have conclusive result that could be use here you say these be emerge result

 act under secretary bryan we we first be able to receive the virus back in february be when we start test and it be a science base approach science be a process the doctor can attest to that it do not necessarily line up with goal and target and other thing it be what it be but we be now start to get result and and we’re every week or two week we ’re start to find out something new and something different

 and in talk to the task force and the vice president he ’s already ask we to come to he every time we come up with some new discovery that we could be that we could share to the public

 the president phil

 q yeah sir have you compare note with your counterpart and other foreign government or in private industry who might have be study the same thing and do their finding show the same result that you find here

 act under secretary bryan we have we do have a very good partnership with a lot of our ally we work closely with they on this particular topic we actually author a document call the master questions list if you go to dhs s&amp;t ’s website we ’ve already have about 17,000 hit on this document it actually outline what all the country in the world be do to fill the certain gap of knowledge that do not exist within the virus and what we do know

 and that be really what target and drive the science community to say all right what do n’t we know now so we do not duplicate what other people have do so we ’ve champion that document it ’ well reference and i would encourage you to look at that

 the president and we be work with other country on vaccine as you know

 yeah go ahead please

 q thank mr. president if there be a summer ebb with this virus what would the federal government need to do to take advantage of that time

 the president say it in the beginning what

 q oh so if there be a summer sort of ebb with this virus what would the federal government need to do to take advantage of that time to be well prepare for a possible resurgence in the fall than we be the first time

 the president well i ’ll tell you one thing i think a lot of people be go to go outside all of a sudden people that do not want to go outside they ’ll be go

 this be a to i this be very really a very interesting meeting we cover it in great detail and these be incredible people at that we could call it a laboratory because that ’s essentially what it be it ’ a super laboratory it ’ a lot of thing go on in that laboratory

 q right but what would you

 the president a lot of very interesting thing go on in that laboratory

 yeah

 q what would you and other area that the government need to do on testing for example or other thing like that to be prepare if it come back in the fall

 the president sure mike go ahead go ahead

 q how would you take advantage of the summer

 the president go ahead

 the vice president it’s it ’s actually a very good question it ’ something the task force already have begin discuss that we be if a combination of factor

 let i say again as state put into practice the guidelines to open up america again implement safe and responsible plan to open up their economy along the line that the president unveil a week ago today as people continue to properly exercise social distancing as be recommend in each phase that in combination with some of these finding could well give we a summer respite from the coronavirus

 and our team be already speak about work on a continuous basis through this summer every single day we ’re increase testing every single day air bridge flight be come into the country there be i can promise you at the president ’s direction there will be no letting up on on make sure that our hospital have the equipment have the personal protective supply for medical personnel

 there ’ll be no letting up on the development of therapeutic by our great pharmaceutical company that be drive toward a vaccine as soon as it be possible to make available to the public and there ’ll be no letting up on continue to scale testing already more than anyone in the world but by next fall we ’ll have a broad range of testing a variety of different mean

 and that ’ why we say with confidence that should the coronavirus reemerge at any point next fall or next winter we will be prepare to deal with it identify it do the contact tracing and isolation to ensure that that we we deal with this epidemic in the manner that we that we deal with infectious disease

 the president okay yeah go ahead

 q mr. president on the subject of medical research why have you stop promote hydroxychloroquine as a cure

 the president i have n’t at all i have n’t at all what be you say-—we’ll see what happen

 q you have not talk about it in several day

 the president we ’ve have a lot of very good result and we have some result that perhaps be n’t so good i do n’t know i just read about one but i also read many time good so i have n’t at all and it ’ a it ’ a great for malaria for lupus for other thing and we ’ll see what it be

 but i guess deborah they have many many study go on on that so we’ll we’ll be able to learn

 q have you look at the veteran study that show that that the death rate be high

 the president i have not i have not see it i have not see it

 go ahead please

 q mr. president we ’re now over 26 million new jobless claim over five week

 the president yeah yeah

 q how the vice president talk about this summer get well but how what do your economist tell you about the time it ’s go to take to you and the u.s. to create the job back

 the president well i know a lot about economist

 q august

 the president yeah

 q september

 the president sure

 q october

 the president well let i go we we know the rest of the question right so i i know a lot about economist and the answer be they have no idea i think i have as good an idea as anybody and i think our economy will start to pick up very substantially as soon as the state get open

 and that ’s happen as we speak and it ’ actually very exciting and people be just just thrilled to see it because our country have to get back to work they want to get back to work you see that whether it ’ a demonstration or just in talk to people they ’re go to get back to work and they ’re go to get back to work very fast

 state be advanced i look at gavin newson be newsom be very nice today he write a beautiful statement about we send he a lot of a lot of thing that he need okay thing different thing that he need we get we get it take care of they ’ve do very well in california as you know they ’re do really well in florida they ’re do well in a lot of place new york and new jersey get hit very hard they ’re do very well

 i speak again with governor cuomo with governor murphy they ’re do they’re do a great job and here ’ the thing we have to see they get hit hard everyone close together tight in people do not realize new jersey be very tight you realize that because you ’ve be cover it for a long time but very tight new york obviously be very tight they ’re do a terrific job

 i i think for the most part i’ll be able to tell you when it ’ all over but a lot of the governor have do a really terrific job some i do not think have to be honest but we ’ll be talk about that in future

 yes go ahead

 q thank you mr. president in a new interview today with time magazine dr. fauci say that the u.s. be not in a situation where we can say we be where we want to be with regard to testing capacity he say we need much more testing capacity as well as test so why do you keep say we have a tremendous testing capacity and do we have a national strategy that go beyond track just what the state be do

 the president the answer be yes and the answer be as you know and as i ’ve say many time we’re very advanced in testing other country be call we to find out what be we do

 and by the way within two week you ’ll see number and you ’ll see different form of testing just like we come up with the abbott laboratories machine which give it to you in five minute that everybody want everybody be ask can we get that but you can only make they so fast but as you know we ’ve do more testing than every other nation combine and that ’ a big statement

 and you know when they talk about different test and different thing we ’re also a big nation than most and so when they look at statistic because statistically we ’re do phenomenally in term of mortality in term of all of the different element that you can judge when you look germany and ourselves be do very well

 we be very accurate in the reporting of number in fact i ’ll go a step far as you know in new york they actually add quite a few death to a list that be do in new york and they add a number of death we ’re very very highly accurate

 and then you ’ll look at certain list of other country some be so obvious just to look at where obviously the number be ridiculous in the form of low because they ’re not accurate count they ’re not even close to accurate count in fact they ’re insulting to look at they

 so we ’ve do very well again testing we’re do very well on testing we ’ve test far more than anybody else anywhere in the world and within a short period of time you ’ll be hear about new test that be come out that be go to be incredible

 steve go ahead

 q do you agree with dr. fauci that we ’re just not there yet

 the president no i do not agree with he on that no i think we ’re do a great job in testing i do not agree if he say that i do not agree with he

 yes

 q be you consider way to get to ramp up production of that abbott rapid test

 the president yeah well they ’re do it i ’ll tell you steve they they’re do it at a level that they ’ve never do it before abbott be a great company it ’ a very big highly respect company they come up with this machine where you do it i’ve do it both way i ’ve do it this way and i do not like it and i ’ve do it the abbott way where you literally just touch and five minute later you know the answer

 and we use they in the white house i think you folk have be give that opportunity which be much more pleasant than the first way that they look at you right

 we ’re make they hundred of thousand of machine the advantage to the other test and the laboratory test be we can get million and million of those test do it take a day or two day but you know because it ’ really a delivery situation more than anything else the test itself go quickly once it get to the laboratory

 but as we have find and as we have i think show everybody in the room we have many laboratory we have thou-—we have so many laboratory nobody nobody a lot of the governor do not know that we have this capacity but we have many laboratory all over our country every state have laboratory and some have a lot of they so i think we will we will come up with thing as time go by

 again when i start we end up we we start with nothing essentially what we start with a broken test a test that do n’t work we start with a test that do very few people not million of people

 the problem be if we do 350-—if we do 350 million test one for each person the medium would say oh you should have do two for each person no matter what you do it do not make any difference

 it ’ just like the ventilator i talk about it all the time nobody ever mention ventilator one of the hard thing be ventilator and now we ’re make thousand a week thousand of ventilator and they ’re call from mexico they ’re call from many country

 i ’ve receive today four call would it be possible to send ventilator right i get four call today i get three call yesterday no country be equip like we be we have 11 we have 11 different place make ventilator our country as you know do not need they now our governor be very happy

 but that ’ different than test because with a test you can always say oh we we need more no i think we ’ve do incredibly well with obviously with ventilator we’re we also have 500 million masks—500 million mask that be very shortly go to be here we ’ve make million of mask we have order million of mask that have arrive and be distribute

 we give one hospital in new york city 300,000 mask before the virus they be use 10,000 and now we get they 300,000 and they get rid of they very quick which i quickly which i sort of say how do that happen why because they become very valuable the mask i say how do that happen

 but we get we have we’ve do an amazing job and we ’ve work with the governor and when the governor be n’t able again they ’re the first line when they be n’t able to get something like ventilator they could not get ventilator they could ’ve buy they you could have buy they but most of they many of they choose not to so they all need ventilator we get the job do

 we have i’ll be introduce the team when we ’re finish with this whole nightmare this whole curse this whole plague but the team that work on the ventilator be incredible and the team that work and it ’ a little bit interchangeable but the team that ’s work on the testing be truly an incredible team these be brilliant people and they ’re do it for the country they ’re not do it for other reason

 some have be very successful they ’re do it for the country

 q mr. president

 the president yes

 q the house have now pass since you be here the relief bill

 the president great

 q as you know

 the president i ’ll be sign it probably tonight

 q as you know there ’ no aid to state and locality in that bill mitch mcconnell of course have talk about state seek bankruptcy protection

 he ’s also his office refer to this as a the idea of aid state as a blue state bailout what do you what do say to that do you agree with that or do you agree with governor cuomo that that be a vicious attack on these state that have be hit by

 the president i do not know if it be a vicious attack but certainly some people do look at it that way i ’ve speak to mitch about it i ’ve speak to numerous senator about it and we ’re work with senator that be on the other side of the issue and we ’ll see what happen but we ’re look to do what ’s right for the people of this country we ’re look to do what ’s right for a particular state and we ’ll see what happen

 but it ’ certainly the next thing we ’re go to be discuss because some state have in all fairness jon some state have not do very well for many year long before the virus come you know you can not blame the plague this horrible plague that come in and all of a sudden you know they can not blame that you look at illinois he ’s get a lot of problem long before the virus come in and so we ’ll be talk about it it ’ll be a subject for a period of time

 and right now we’ve we’ve make this incredible deal for the worker and for small business and i ’m very happy that harvard do not get cover we actually never send they the check but they be very nice about it we never send they the money the old fashioned way be the check the new way be send they the money and we do not send they the money

 and but they be very understanding and they be very nice about it so be princeton so be stanford so be a number of other school that you just do not associate with this money so be big company as you know you know many of they it be a relatively small amount of money compare to the whole a very small amount of money compare but we want it to be fair we want it to go to the people that it ’s suppose to go to

 q but be you open to this idea of state and local

 the president i ’m open i ’m open

 q i mean be these be these

 the president i ’m open to idea that be go to be great for the people of this country

 q specifically that idea

 the president and if we can help state we ’re always go to help state

 now there ’ different way of help state some way be well than other so we ’re look it be interesting that the state that be in trouble do happen to be blue it be interesting you know if you look around i mean the state that seem to have the problem happen to be democrat

 q well new york and new jersey get hit by this you know by this virus really hard and massachusetts

 the president no but new york and new jersey be in a lot of trouble long before the plague come i mean they be you know they have a lot of problem long before the plague come i speak with governor cuomo about it speak to governor murphy about it i speak with gavin newsom about it and we i’m speak to a lot of people about it because it ’s probably go to be the next thing on the list

 a lot of people understand very well what mitch be say and they also understand the other side of the the problem and i ’ll be speak about it we ’re go to do the right thing for our country the right thing for our country and the right thing for a lot of great people okay

 yeah please

 q yes mr. president after the presentation we just see about the heat and the humidity be it dangerous for you to make people think they would be safe by go outside in the heat consider that so many people be die in florida consider that this virus have have an outbreak in singapore place that be hot and

 the president yeah here we go

 q:—are humid

 the president here we go the new the new headline be trump asks people to go outside that ’ dangerous here we go same old group you ready i hope people enjoy the sun and if it have an impact that ’ great i ’m just hear this not really for the first time i mean there ’s be a rumor that you know a very nice rumor that you go outside in the sun or you have heat and it do have an effect on other virus

 but now we get it from one of the great laboratory of the world i have to say it cover a lot more territory than just this this be this be probably an easy thing relatively speak for you

 i would like you to speak to the medical doctor to see if there ’s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure you know but if you could and maybe you can maybe you can n’t again i say maybe you can maybe you can n’t i ’m not a doctor but i ’m like a person that have a good you know what

 q but sir you ’re the president

 the president deborah have you ever hear of that the heat and the light relative to certain virus yes but relative to this virus

 dr birx not as a treatment i mean certainly fever

 the president yeah

 dr birx:—is a good thing when you have a fever it help your body respond but not as i’ve not see heat or inaudible

 the president i think it ’ a great thing to look at i mean you know okay

 q but respectfully sir you ’re the president and people tune into these briefing they want to get information and guidance and want to know what to do

 the president hey hey phil

 q they ’re not look for a rumor

 the president hey phil i ’m the president and you ’re fake news and you know what i ’ll say to you i ’ll say it very nicely i know you well

 q why do you say that

 the president i know you well

 because i know the guy i see what he write he ’ a total faker

 q he ’ a good reporter

 the president so be you ready be you ready be you ready it ’ just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very very smart perhaps brilliant man he ’s talk about sun he ’s talk about heat and you see the number so that ’s it that ’ all i have i ’m just here to present talent i ’m here to present idea because we want idea to get rid of this thing and if heat be good and if sunlight be good that ’ a great thing as far as i ’m concerned

 go ahead

 q mr. president you talk a moment ago about vaccine and that we ’re close how close do you think the oxford university study say they could have one by september do you think the pharmaceutical company in the u.s.

 the president they could have one of what

 q they could they could have a vaccine ready

 the president yeah

 q:—for testing by september

 the president oxford be one johnson amp johnson be work they ’re also work together you have many company work together on a vaccine

 q but then do you think they ’ll scale they can scale up production and the pharmaceutical company will be able to do that quickly

 the president oh we ’ll scale it up if we have a vaccine it ’ll be scale up very quickly in fact some of the company johnson amp johnson be one be scale up already before they have the final answer a number of company be do that you ’ll save a lot of time the normal be you scale up after

 i have to say the fda have be fantastic stephen hahn dr. hahn have be fantastic they ’re move along rapidly rapidly

 q would you say would you put a timescale on when you think this will

 the president no i do not want to put a timescale because then the the medium the so call so call media”—“lamestream medium will say he say a time i do not want to say time because every time i say a time if you do not hit it they ’ll say so i do not want to talk about time

 but i will say that there ’s be tremendous progress make over the last month

 q could i just ask a very quick question

 the president yeah

 q you speak to boris johnson this week i just wonder how

 the president i do

 q:—how he sound how he be

 the president i do

 q when do you think he ’ll be back at work

 the president he call i a few day ago i will tell you he sound incredible i be actually surprised i think he ’d be like oh donald how be you he be ready to go i could i’m very surprised to tell you this it ’ like the old boris tremendous energy tremendous drive i be very surprised because he call i almost you know pretty close to when he get out of the hospital

 i think he ’s do great i think he ’s do great he be so sharp and energetic pretty incredible he ’ an incredible guy

 i want to say though we have have outbreak we ’ve have outbreak in specific prison we ’ve have outbreak in specific nursing home we ’ve have outbreak in specific plant and when that happen that add two three hundred four hundred case on that single date

 so we track very carefully not only what the country be do but what each state be do each county be do and we look at delta change across all of the county so that we find early warning signal for these type of outbreak because we want to we want the whole country to go down but we also want to prevent the outbreak before they occur

 q mr. president

 the president go ahead please

 q yes thank you look forward to november to the election give the risk that the flu and the coronavirus be come back

 the president yeah that ’ a that ’ a problem

 q yeah there could be a problem do you think there be a risk that there ’ll be there will be some there will be lack of agreement lack of legitimacy to the result in a very close election and people start say well a whole bunch of people could not go and vote because they be scared

 the president look i can not tell you what ’s go to happen in an election

 q be there a risk for legitimate election

 the president yeah great question i can not tell you what ’s go to happen we have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press be give a free pass to who do not want to do debate because of covid and lot of thing be happen right

 and i watch a couple of interview and i say oh i look forward to this but they ’re keep he shelter because of the coronavirus and he ’s not move around he ’s not move too much and then i watch what the press do to the republican party and to i in particular

 we have the great economy ever put together we be do this be a month and a half ago we be do number the like the like of which we ’ve never do african american asian american hispanic american good employment number ever in the history of our country our employment number the good in the history of our country almost 160 million people the stock market record number many many time during my tenure many many time

 but now we have a country that we have to close because of this and frankly if we do not close it we would have lose million of people possibly but certainly we would have lose a million people you take the high number and cut it in half cut it in half again but whether it would have be 600 700 800 you take a look at the travesty that there be you take a look at this horrible horrible scene of hospital with body in black body bag right multiply that time 10 15 or even 20 because that would have happen

 so we do the right thing so far we do the right thing so far we ’ve call it right we ’ve mobilize like it be a military operation and it be largely a militarily operation between ventilator and testing and so many other thing and we ’ve have a lot of good partner not all good partner but we have a lot of good partner

 gavin newsom today thank we very much gavin newsom california thank we so much for get he all the thing that he need so he can keep go and keep do a good job we get it to he today tomorrow we ’re get he even more it would ’ve be hard for he to get it than we we agree to get it we get it on time he say promise make promise keep he actually say that in a statement today

 we ’ve do a good job we ’ve get very little credit for the great job we ’ve do because of the medium because the media be not an honest medium in my opinion much of it not all of it we have some great reporter that i have tremendous respect but much of the media be not honest

 so i can not tell you about the election you have a democrat party and you have a large portion of the medium automatically give the guy a pass he ’s be give a pass whether or not he ’s go to be the nominee i have no idea but he ’s get a pass

 and the media be not cover the great job that we ’ve do whether it ’ mike ’s task force which have be incredible whether it ’s the way we mobilize in a war like operation to build these incredibly complex and very expensive ventilator they ’re very expensive to build and very complex the job we ’ve do have be an amazing job and i ’m not talk about i i ’m talk about everybody i ’m talk about the general the admiral deborah and tony and and now bill i mean something we have not hear today

 so i can not tell you what ’s go to happen with the election i think that have we not go through a fake russia russia russia deal an impeachment hoax it be a total hoax from the day i get elect but you know it be n’t the day it be many month before i get elect this have be a witch hunt that be illegal it be an illegal witch hunt it be illegal

 and with all of that i ’m do fine because the people see we ’re do a great job and you know what we ’ll continue to do a great job

 if we have an honest press this country would be even great

 thank you thank you very much

 when the chip be down biden will always cave to the radical left he ’ll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that joe biden will always let you down that ’s be his history at my direction early this year the hero of the u.s. military take out the world ’s top terrorist the savage killer leader of isis al baghdadi and the number one terrorist anywhere in the world qasem soleimani we take they out joe biden oppose kill soleimani he be vehemently we kill this number one terrorist he do not like it you know why he do not like it because he think it would be good politically that do n’t work out too well just as he oppose the raid that kill osama bin laden he oppose it you know that biden be always on the wrong side of history as say by people that be with he and work with he he never make a correct foreign policy decision biden be a puppet for china son walk out with 1.5 billion i think it ’ a little bit

 and almost more incredible he give he 1.8 billion in green cash beautiful cash and now they ’re not do so well be they they ’re not do so well someday we ’re go to get credit for this someday but they be wait iran want to make a deal so badly but they ’re tell by kerry and all these other they should n’t the logan act but they ’re tell kerry and all these people wait because if trump lose you ’ll own america you ’re go to own it they ’ll say you own it so i do n’t mind i tell they we can wait but when i win you ’re go to pay a much high price than if you make a deal now it ’ true

 i tell they and look what happen to biden in ukraine where his son ’s pay $ 83,000 a month and he be jobless give i a break $ 83,000 a month more than anybody if joe biden be to become president an emboldened left will launch a full scale assault on american life you know that they ’ll expel anyone who disagree with they look what happen when you disagree you use a term that ’ perfect and they ’re not happy with it they call you a racist they call you a horrible person they want to crush religious liberty they do not want religion silence religious believer indoctrinate your child with hateful and vicious lie about our country subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution

 they want to take away your gun through the repeal of your second amendment as sure as you ’re sit there in fact he even put the big gun grabber beto o’rourke who make a fool out of himself when he run for president they put he in charge of gun lot of luck on your second amendment just remember i say and hopefully you will not have to think back about it too much because it will not matter hopefully it will not matter no beto o’rourke who want to give up gun be in charge of the second amendment the dems will also eliminate private health insurance ban fracke that ’s not good and american energy will be in a position of weakness like it ’s never be before and that ’ after we build the great energy country anywhere in the world by far

 and they want to appoint supreme court justice who will utterly obliterate your constitution and you now see how important the supreme court be think if we do not have two justice that i think have be very very very good but think how important it be think how important it be and we still i guess it ’ a i do not know if it ’ an equal court it ’ almost like we ’re a minority court right it ’ almost like we ’re a minority court the recent supreme court case prove that if joe biden be elect he will stack the court with extremist the forget man and woman together with everyone else we ’ll lose everything the forgotten man and woman i campaign on the forgotten these be great people these be substantial people these be the elite by the way you ’re the elite they ’re not the elite you ’re the elite

 somebody two day ago say sir the elite be really work hard on try to destroy you i say yeah why do you call they the elite i say why well they ’re not elite i look well than they much more handsome got well hair than they do i get nice property i get nice house i get nice apartment i get nice everything i run for politic once just once in my life and i become president of the united states and hopefully if you get out and vote we ’ll do it one more time we will not even toy with they about three or four more time we will n’t we ’ll do it one more time we ’ll be two for two and our country will never ever be strong

 but i ’ll be soon announce a new list of exceptional candidate for the united states supreme court and i ’ll choose only from that list a hundred percent probably 25 incredible people any one of which could be a great justice any one of which and i do it last time and people love when i do it and i ’ll only pick from that list biden can not release his list because the name would be too extreme too radical they would not be acceptable but they will be very radical people people do not understand but we actually win on daca yesterday we actually win because they basically say you win but you have to come back and redo it it ’ almost like gee come on back your paperwork be no good but we ’re go to be refile but do not let it get you everything ’s go to work out really good everything ’s go to work out good

 it be a great it be great i mean would have be nice if we win and everybody say oh you ’re go to win daca you ’re go to win daca that ’ easy you got to win daca that ’ easy they all say it and they come back and they say we do n’t like what you do with your paperwork essentially so we ’re re file it most people would say we lose we do not lose we ’re go to refile it and everything be go to work out for the young people most of whom be n’t so young anymore by the way but we ’re go to work it out for everybody

 biden be fully control by the fringe of his party he be their pawn he do not even know where the hell he be let ’s face it he instal socialist alexandria ocasio cortez to be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy energy you can forget petroleum how do oklahoma feel about be petroleum free not good right our country will have no energy our country will have nothing oklahoma texas north dakota and many other will all be out of business i do not think that ’s go to work out too well but she ’s actually in charge of environmental policy and you know what that mean she do not even want to win she do not want those bird kill machine that go round and round you want to see a lot of bird that be dead go under a windmill sometime she want we to go back to the stone age because she ’s get no sense no credential she ’s get a little charisma not much but she do not have a clue you know it but she ’ in charge of the environment no airplane we can forget boeing i guess come to think of it we talk about boeing we could forget boeing let ’s cancel those brand new air force ones

 likewise representative ilhan omar be go to be very much involve in a biden government they will put this hate fill america bash socialist front and center in decide the fate of your family and decide the fate of your country i do not think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she come somalia no government no safety no police no nothing just anarchy and now she ’s tell we how to run our country no thank you and i think we ’re go to have a big victory in the state of minnesota because they ’ve have it they ’ve have it

 biden be a very willing trojan horse for socialism when biden first run for president over 33 year ago remember i use to call he 1 joe he never get more than 1 until obama take he off the trash heap but he blatantly copy the speech of a british politician even rip off the man ’s personal biography and family history and claim it be his own he forget to say he be bear in america joe biden be a shameless hypocrite since 2003 he have deliver fawn eulogy to the funeral and at those funeral of three lead supporter of segregation include a former member of the kkk and yet biden be now smear as racist ten of million of people like yourself decent hardworke americans who he ’s never meet and he frankly probably do not want to meet america should not take lecture on racial justice from joe biden sleepy joe a man who praise and partner with segregationist shift million of black american job overseas and everyone else ’s job too by the way if i do not come along we ’re build auto plant we ’re build everything and there ’s never be a comeback like we ’re make right now never be

thank you very much everybody thank you and good afternoon my administration have be work around the clock in good faith to reach an agreement with democrats on additional china virus relief

 already my administration have enact over $ 3 trillion in historic relief save many ten of million of dollar and job and you see how fast the economy be come back it do look like it ’s go to be a very sharp v. we have tremendous enthusiasm tremendous spirit and tremendous job growth we set a record on number of job in the last three month it ’ the most job ever create in a three month period during a three month period that ’ great

 before we begin i ’ve just sign two bill that be great for our vet our vet be very special we pass choice as you know veteran choice and veterans accountability and they ’ve be try to get that pass for decade and decade and decade and no president have ever be able to do it and we get it do so veteran have choice and now you have accountability that if you do not love your vet if you ’re in the va and you do not love the vet or take care of the vet you can actually get fire if you do n’t do your job we want people that love our vet

 the first expand the eligibility for vet with blindness in both eye so we have an expansion of benefit an expansion of various element of be and work with the va for vet with blindness and in particular blindness in both eye and we have a lot of problem with blindness in the va and we ’re do something about it they ’ve be talk about this for many year so that be expand eligibility for vet with blindness in both eye okay

 second be require the va to establish a treatment court program for vet who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crime and you know what that all mean and it ’ really something that they ’ve be try to get do for a long time the second require the va to establish a treatment court so this be a treatment court program for vet who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crime okay i think it ’ self explanatory

 we ’ve want this for a long time they ’ve be try to get it for a long time and now we have it and i want to thank everybody for help we get that do we have a lot of support from a lot of great people include people in the va

 in the current negotiation we have repeatedly state our willingness to immediately sign legislation provide expand unemployment benefit protect americans from eviction and provide additional relief payment to family democrats have refuse these offer they want to negotiate what they really want be bailout money for state that be run by democrat governor and mayor and that have be run very badly for many many year and many decade in fact you know the state everybody know who we ’re talk about and what we ’re talk about i do not think we have to go over it

 but what the democrats primarily want be bailout money it have nothing to do with the china virus it have nothing to do with anything that we ’ve be talk about over the last period of time they want to bailout state that have be badly manage by democrat badly run by democrats for many year and in fact in all case many decade and we ’re not willing to do that

 nancy pelosi and chuck schumer have choose to hold this vital assistance hostage on behalf of very extreme partisan demand and the radical left democrats and we just can not do that so hopefully we can do something with they at a later date but we ’re go to be sign some bill in a little while that be go to be very important and will take care of pretty much this entire situation

 as we know it and as you have be cover it in some case actually cover it accurately many of the far leave policy they ’re push have nothing to do again with what we have be work on so hard namely the corona you can call it so many different name what a horrible thing china release upon the world

 one third of their bill the heroes act be spend completely unrelated money to the virus here be just a few of the policy in their extreme left bill and again this be a bill support by biden and biden be totally control now by the bernie sanders leave wing of the party and in fact he ’s gone far leave than bernie sanders ever dream of go so obviously other than bernie have bring he left if you look at the manifesto that they ’ve agree to it ’s far far leave than i ’ve ever hear anything about bernie sanders

 the massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue state we talk about that ’ one of the thing they ’re look to do measure design to increase voter fraud ban voter id they want to ban voter id we should have voter id in every state every state should have voter id you have id on everything you do practically yet every-—everybody have voter id everybody have id except for voter when you vote you do not want id they do not want

 we have some state with it it work out great and if you want to stop fraud in election have voter id they want measure design to increase voter fraud which be ban voter id in all state and ban requirement for signature verification in federal election

 now why would they want in this bill which really have nothing to do with what we ’re talk about stimulus something ban voter id in every single state they want to ban it include state where we already have it because we have some state where we have it indiana and other that do very well

 why would they want to ban voter id in all state and why would they want to ban requirement for signature verification in federal election who would want a bill ban signature verification what ’s that all about

 you know what it ’ about fraud that ’ what they want fraud they want to try and steal this election because frankly it ’ the only way they can win the election

 the bill also require all state to do universal mail in balloting which nobody be nobody be prepare for regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure they want to steal an election that ’ all this be all about they want to steal the election

 so in the bill they have a bill that require all state to do universal mail in balloting regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure like in nevada it ’ such a disaster their infrastructure be a total disaster they do not want to have signature verification they do not want to have any of the safeguard that you need and they do not want to have safeguard that be so common and so basic and even other state that we disagree with have this nevada thing be a mess but we ’ll see how the court determine what the court determine but they certainly do not have the infrastructure in nevada so we ’ll see how it be

 as you know we bring suit last week and we ’ll see how that all work out i think we ’re go to win it but basically what they ’re try to do with all of these requirement include no signature verification they ’re try to steal an election

 and i be in ohio i be in texas i be in florida over the last four or five day and if you would see the crowd along the highway and the roadway people have say they ’ve never see anything like it and they have not see anything like it and the press do not report it because they ’re fake news

 they even want to force state to implement the controversial practice know as ballot harvesting”—a very dangerous practice mean they would allow democrat party operative to deposit thousand and thousand of complete ballot at the post office without any verification of who fill they out include a verification of signature on the ballot so you ’re not even go to have a verify signature anybody i could sign it you could sign it anybody in this room could sign it and that ’s go to count as a vote how can you do a thing like this

 so this be what they ’re ask for this be what nancy pelosi and crying chuck schumer be ask for

 okay it ’ ridiculous it ’ horrible it ’ a horrible thing

 the democrat bill include stimulus check for illegal alien so if you be able to get into our country illegally and our border be as you know do very well right now we have a very strong border and the wall be up to 276 mile and we ’ll be complete with it around the end of the year we ’re go to do some extra mileage in certain area that people do not realize be so bad so we ’ll be complete with it right after we ’re go to do the additional mileage we ’ll do it probably a little bit after the year

 i think from what i ’ve hear joe biden sleepy joe want to rip the wall down he want people to pour into our country they want to have open border we do not want to have open border

 so the democrat bill include stimulus check for illegal alien they require the mass release of illegal alien from detention they also compel the mass release of inmate include serious felon how do you like that one and this be in the bill that we ’re talk about what do this have to do with stimulus the economy what do this have to do with the coronavirus another name what do this have to do with this

 so think of that they require the mass release of illegal alien from detention what do this have to do with what we ’re try to do they want to put this and this be a radical left policy so they can go to portland and try and rip the place apart that they ’ve be do for many year and they ’ve be do for year and year

 they also compel the mass release of inmate what do this have to do with what we ’re talk about this be nancy pelosi crazy nancy and chuck schumer they want to compel you to do this stuff and this have nothing to do with what we ’re talk about and it include serious felon they want to have these people release on a mass basis include serious felon

 that ’s page 1,689 page 1,762 think of it 1,762 and that ’ nowhere near the end of their bill they have thing in there that nobody have even at the time to look at or read these people i don’t i honestly do not believe they love our country you want to know the truth

 in addition to demand these extreme partisan provision democrats be actively block the follow measure support for k-12 school to help they safely open additional funding for the paycheck protection program to help million of worker on the payroll this be a great program very successful keep a lot of business open that ’s why we ’re do so well in reopen our country additional money for hospital testing and vaccine direct payment of $ 3,400 for a family of four

 now remember this be what the extreme partisan this we get we have to this be what we ’re talk about democrats be actively block the thing that we want and what we want be good for people those these be thing that they ’re block support for k-12 school so they can open think of that

 also direct payment of the $ 3,400 for a family of four plus then fund for childcare and mental health care and you need that especially when you have so much of a lockdown you need that mental health care

 funding for broadband airport and agriculture rental assistance and support for community bank and credit union to help they provide $ 100 billion in loan to the hard hit community include rural community and farmer they do not want anybody to get that democrat be obstruct all of it

 therefore i ’m take executive action we ’ve have it and we ’re go to save american job and provide relief to the american worker and i ’ll be sign these bill in a very short period of time

 first one be on provide a payroll tax holiday to americans earn less than $ 100,000 per year in a few moment i will sign a directive instruct the treasury department to allow employer to defer payment of the employee portion of certain payroll taxis from september 1st and we ’re actually go to be make that we just get the word we ’re just get some word from a lot of people we do not think we ’d have to do this because we think the democrats would be reasonable but they ’ve be not only unreasonable they ’ve be ridiculous

 so we ’re go to make that august 1st most likely it ’ll be august 1st we ’ll let you know the exact date but we ’re look like august 1st so it ’d be august 1st through the end of 2020 this will mean big paycheck for working family as we race to produce a vaccine and eradicate the china virus once and for all

 and we ’re do very good with the number you see it ’s go down in arizona very very substantially and rapidly go down in california go down in texas go down in florida other area be prop up a little bit but we ’re watch they very closely we understand the disease and we ’re watch they very closely especially our senior citizen and our senior citizen residence

 if i ’m victorious on november 3rd i plan to forgive these taxis and make permanent cut to the payroll tax so i ’m go to make they all permanent

 now joe biden and the democrats may not want that they do not want that because they ’re add $ 3 trillion in taxis so they ’ll have the option of raise everybody ’s taxis and take this away

 but if i win i may extend and terminate in other word i ’ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax and so we ’ll see what happen biden probably will not be do that you ’ll have to ask he i do not think he know what he ’s do

 second i ’m sign an executive order direct the department of housing and urban development hhs and cdc to make sure renter and homeowner can stay in their home

 so i ’m protect people from eviction yet you ’ve be hear a lot about eviction and the democrats do not want to do anything have to do with protect people from eviction i say let ’s do that separately that can be a totally separate thing from pass along money so people can live and they do not even want to protect people from eviction

 so they would get evict it ’s not their fault that this virus come into our country it ’ china ’s fault and come into the world by the way a lot of the people a lot of the state that be do the good be have some problem a lot of the state that we be not think be do the good be do very well

 you look at some of the country involve some of the country that be really stand out as example be now explode but they ’ll get it down they understand it we ’re deal with they we ’re deal with a lot of country

 we ’re provide thousand and thousand of ventilator all over the world right now we make a lot of ventilator we start off with very little and we ’re make a lot and we have thousand in our stockpile but we ’re make thousand a month and we ’re provide many of they thousand and thousand to other country that would never be able to get they

 the department of housing and urban development will also provide financial assistance to struggle renter and homeowner and work with landlord and lender to keep americans safely in their home so we do not want people be evict and the bill the act that i ’m sign will solve that problem largely hopefully completely

 the third action i ’m take today will also provide additional support for americans who be unemployed due to the china virus under the cares act i proudly sign expand unemployment benefit into law congressional democrats have stonewall our effort to extend this relief they even oppose measure that would give bonus to worker return to the job they be totally opposed to that

 for this reason i ’m take action to provide an additional or an extra $ 400 per week in expand benefit $ 400 okay so that ’ generous but we want to take care of our people again it be not their fault it be china ’s fault

 states will be ask to cover 25 percent of the cost use exist funding such as the ten of billion of dollar available to they through the coronavirus relief fund under this plan state will be able to offer great benefit if they so choose and the federal government will cover 75 percent of the cost so we ’re all set up it ’ $ 400 per week

 and we ’re do that without the democrats we should have be able to do it very easily with they but they want all of these additional thing that have nothing to do with help people

 fourth i be sign a directive provide relief to student loan borrower early this year we slash student loan interest rate to zero i do not know if people know that because the press do not ever report it but maybe they ’re watch now

 the press do not report a lot of good thing that be good for the people and good for the country

 early this year we slash student loan interest rate to zero percent and suspend student loan payment and congress extend that policy through september 30th today i ’m extend this policy through the end of the year and we ’ll extend it far than that most likely right after december 1st so we look like we ’re go to be extend that they ’re pay zero interest and again not their fault that their college be close down and not their fault that they ’re unable to get what they bargain for

 through these four action my administration will provide immediate and vital relief to americans struggle in this difficult time and the beautiful thing about this difficult time be we ’re now come back and set record

 we ’ll also ensure that our economic comeback continue full speed ahead and with the $ 400 and all of the other measure that we ’re talk about and will be sign in a little while that will happen

 we ’re far look at additional tax cut include income tax relief income tax cut and capital gain tax cut so we ’re go to be look at that capital gain for the purpose of create job and income tax be self explanatory and it ’ll be income tax for middle income and low income people but middle income people because they pay a lot of income tax and you do have tax inequality i ’m say that as a republican and you do have tax inequality

 so we ’re go to be look at income tax and we ’re go to be look at capital gain tax cut on both and maybe substantial and we ’ll be report back fairly shortly on that that ’ big news that ’ big news but very important we want to have our job flourish we want to have our company do great we want to have the 401(k)s which be now at a level if you look at the stock market it ’ great

 if you have stock in nasdaq you ’re high than you ever be include even this be still during the pandemic the stock market because they see such incredible thing be happen smart people the stock market be that almost an all time high we ’re just short of it and nasdaq be high than it ever be it ’s break the record 14 time in the last couple of month

 so 401(k)s be do fantastically i hope you keep your stock i hope you do n’t sell i hope you have confidence in your president and confidence that president trump   be go to be reelect

 and i will tell you this that the big tailwind the big problem that we have with respect to the stock market which be not much of a problem because it ’s do so well but it would be actually much high be the possibility that these radical leave democrats could win and if they win we ’re go to have a crash we ’re go to have a terrible problem because they ’re go to raise taxes—3 trillion dollar worth of taxis and that ’s go to affect everybody from middle income to upper income to job to company your 401(k)s will go down like a rock your stock will go down like a rock

 you know and do not forget these big company you have stock in these company you know you own stock and they have million and million of shareholder and whether it ’ pension fund or anybody else you all have stock so there be big company but a lot of people own that stock and we want to keep it go

 but we do have i guess you could say not a tailwind it ’ a headwind i guess would be a well description but it be it ’ a headwind and when you think of it that’s in my opinion it would be much high

 but you look at what they want to do they want to raise everybody ’s taxis everybody and they want to do the green new deal which will decimate our country and decimate it ’ ridiculous too it ’ childish i actually say the green new deal be childish it ’ for child it ’ not for adult

 anybody that believe in that be i do n’t know maybe it ’ politic i do not even think it ’ good politic they seem to think so we ’ll see how they do but i do not think it ’ good politic and it ’ll decimate our economy

 we ’ve learn a great deal about this virus and how to treat it our strategy be to aggressively shield those at the great risk while allow young and healthy citizen to safely resume work and school

 i notice that some of the democrats that i would say be very strongly on the left be now come out and say we really have to open our school for the good of the economy i be shocked to see a couple of they you know they be

 we urge all americans to socially distance and avoid large crowd and all of the thing that we talk about all the time we have to we have to go and make sure that everything be in good shape we really be we’re come back very very strong we ’re do very well with the virus because all of those state that everybody think would be in a bad position for a long time they ’re all come down governor have do a great job
 do not forget we ’re deal with governor some have do a fantastic job all have work hard some have do a much well job than other and someday if you ’d like to know i ’ll give you the good one and the bad one we ’ll give you some good one and some bad one

 but by contrast the never end lockdown be propose by some mostly i guess you could almost say almost all”—in the democrat party would inflict unimaginable harm to our people and to our health for decade to come it ’ll hurt our economy and they view that as a good thing they actually view that as a good thing because they ’re interested in one date november 3rd

 and i actually think it ’ bad politic and i think they ’re start to come along because i ’m see more and more people want to open up and you see the devastating result of lockdown too you know you have depression and suicide and drug and alcohol and bad marriage marriage that be very good turn out to be very bad

  it ’ an amazing thing and it’s who would think it but people get along for 20 year i guess they do not know each other very well and now they ’re not get along

 and you have the opposite also you ’ve have people to get along well they like each other more than they think that ’ okay too

 that we like but the other situation be very very very very bad

 we ’ll develop a vaccine we ’re go to have it very soon and we ’re ready to distribute it and we’re we’ve get the military ready logistics it ’s call and we ’ll end this pandemic and we will rebuild the great economy in the history of the world

 you know we create the great economy in the history of the world the high stock market ever and we ’re very close to get that back that i have to say be way ahead of schedule high stock market ever good employment number for african americans asian americans hispanic americans

 and by the way hispanic americans just set a record for new job african americans just set a record for new job just now during the pandemic the last month and asian americans just set a record for new job so we ’re very proud of what ’s happen

 and i will now sign the executive action and then if you want we can ask a few question

 okay kelly yeah let i do this first and then you can do some question thank you very much

 okay so this be for the authorization of other need assistance program major disaster declaration relate to the coronavirus disease

 q yes sir can we start with the $ 400 sir so i just want to get your reaction so you ’re say the state will have to cover some of the cost sir which governor have tell you that which governor have tell you that they would sign onto it

 president trump well if they do n’t they do n’t that ’s up to they but if they do n’t they do n’t that ’s go to be their problem i do not think their people will be too happy they have the money so i do not think their people will be too happy but if they do n’t they do n’t

 but again the state have the money it ’s sit there

 q sir why do you decide on $ 400 when previously family be receive $ 600

 president trump yeah

 q that will be a hardship for many what do you say to they

 president trump well no it ’ not a hardship this be the money that they need this be the money they want and this give they a great incentive to go back to work

 so this be much more than be originally agree the 600 be a number that be there and as you know they be diff-—there be difficulty with the 600 number because it really be a disincentive

 yeah go ahead please

 q sir the payroll tax cut be oppose by both party on capitol hill can you give your rationale as to why you think that ’ important particularly since it do not help americans who inaudible

 president trump yeah okay it help people greatly it help our country get back and anybody that would say anything different i think be very foolish everybody want it by the way the democrats want it the republicans want it they just could not get it they just could not come to an agreement but everybody want it

 and the very important thing be the people want it and the people need it actually

 q mr. president

 president trump yeah yes

 q mr. president you say that this will pretty much take care of the entire situation but as you say there ’ not money for reopen school other important item be your administration willing to go back to democrats to try to actually negotiate some of these big thing

 president trump well the answer be yes but we have money to do other thing and we have a lot of money that be unspent and we ’ll be able to do thing with the money that be unspent we have significant money that be unspent and we will be able to use that for different purpose

 go ahead

 q but you say you ’re also expect legal challenge with this right so why

 president trump i do not say that no no i do not say that

 q yes you do yesterday sir you say that you be expect legal hurdle

 president trump i i say i what i say be people can do whatever they want i guess maybe they ’ll bring legal action maybe they will n’t but they will not win they will not win

 q but if legal action be bring against you on this why not just work with congress on this deal

 president trump well i ’m not say they ’re not go to come back and negotiate they might very well come back and negotiate

 q but you ’re sign the executive order today and americans want to know when they ’re go to see this relief what date will they see it

 q mr. president though this be expect to be tie up in the court so this relief be either go to be delay or block indefinitely

 president trump oh i do not think so

 q be this just political theater

 president trump i think this be go to go very rapidly through the court

 q but be you give people false hope

 president trump this will go very if if we get sue maybe we will not get sue if we get sue it ’ somebody that do not want people to get money okay and that ’s not go to be a very popular thing

 q but should a president be able to go around congress be you try to set a new precedent

 q but it ’ a false statement sir

 president trump okay thank you very much everybody thank you very much



the president thank you very much thank you happy labor day that be really a very special time i have speak to some of the labor union head and other people they ’re very happy with the way thing be go as you probably see the number be terrific

 so we call some people wish they a very happy labor day and they tell we how they ’re do and we really celebrate the american worker we be in the midst of the fast economic recovery in u.s. history so we have a lot to be thankful for include this really beautiful day it ’ why i think we ’d do this outside as oppose to in your more normal place

 the united states experience the small contraction of any major western nation you probably know that you look around and see how we ’re do compare to every other nation and our rise be spectacular and we ’re rebound much more quickly from the pandemic

 the u.s. economy add 1.4 million job last month and we ’ve have add a record set 10.6 million job since may 10.6 million job since may that ’ a record that be not even close second place be a long way away

 in july the congressional budget office be project unemployment over 10.5 percent through the end of 2020 so they think 2020 and maybe it would be a lot long than that some projection where you ’d go through the entire year and that include a lot of month in the following year 2021 and instead the unemployment rate plunge really to the surprise of many all the way down to 8.4 percent in august and that ’s the second large single month decline on record and we have the first we have both of they so we have the two number one declines—“decline mean positive not negative

 we ’re currently witness the fast labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history world history by contrast biden preside over the bad the weak and slow economic recovery since the great depression it be a long slow slog and it be a very small very small on growth and very small on every other factor that you need it be the weak recovery

 under my leadership next year will be the great economic year in the history of our country i project and some people be start to agree we have a v shape it ’ probably a super v. and you see what ’s go on with the stock market where it ’ in certain case already set record nasdaq have set 17 record already and this be as we ’re hopefully round the final turn in the pandemic

 first we ’ll end the pandemic under operation warp speed we ’ve pioneer groundbreake therapy reduce the fatality rate 85 percent since april you do not hear that from the press very often they do not like to talk about that so the fatality rate 85 percent think of that since april

 the united states have experience among the low case fatality rate of any major country in the world and we be an absolute leader in every way under my leadership we ’ll produce a vaccine in record time biden and his very liberal running mate the most liberal person in congress by the way who ’s not a competent person in my opinion would destroy this country and would destroy this economy should immediately apologize for the reckless anti vaccine rhetoric that they be talk right now talk about endanger life and it undermine science

 and what ’s happen be all of a sudden you ’ll have this incredible vaccine and because of that fake rhetoric it ’ a politic rhetoric that ’s all it be just for politic because now they see we ’ve do an incredible job and in speed like nobody have ever see before this could ’ve take two or three year and instead it ’s go to be it ’s go to be do in a very short of period of time could even have it during the month of october

 so contrary to all of the lie the vaccine that they’re they politicalize they ’ll say anything and it ’ so dangerous for our country what they say but the vaccine will be very safe and very effective and it will be deliver very soon you could you could have a very big surprise come up i ’m sure you ’ll be very happy but the people will be happy the people of the world will be happy

 next we ’ll return to unprecedented prosperity through our pro american policy we ’ll pass new tax cut to boost take home pay we ’re go to be cut taxis very substantially we get it back through growth we have tremendous growth until we get hit with the china virus

 we ’ll continue our historic regulatory reduction campaign we’ve as you know in three and a half year we ’ve cut more regulation than any other administration no matter how long no matter what period of time you ’re talk about we ’ll enact fair trade deal and we ’re work on seven major fair trade deal right now and when i say fair fair to our country because our country be rip off by every nation friend foe do not matter every nation be rip we off at a level that it ’ just unbelievable to be honest

 we ’re go to be expand opportunity zone and we will keep that go it ’s be a tremendous a tremendous program i want to thank senator scott south carolina for come up with that whole concept because he come up and i like it right away and it be it ’s really turn out to be a tremendous thing especially for african americans hispanic americans

 we ’ll continue to unleash american energy we ’re number one in the world and we ’re totally energy independent right now and in 2021 we ’ll create 10 million job at least in the first 10 month

 joe biden and the radical socialist democrats would immediately collapse the economy if they get in they would collapse it you ’ll have a crash the like of which you ’ve never see before your stock your 401(k)s remember it ’ the people that own these massive list company a lot of people rich people and not so rich people and middle income people and those stock will crash like you ’ve never see before

 the biden plan begin with a 4 trillion dollar tax hike and that will end everything include growth there will not be growth there ’ll be total contraction

 biden have also pledge to demolish the u.s. energy industry and implement the same policy cause blackout in california he want to have thing light up with wind he ’ll have to talk to china russia india and lot of other country because they ’re not do that and if they ’re not do it it put we at a tremendous economic disadvantage and it do n’t work

 you take a look at the blackout in california it ’ really rather amazing what ’s go on there they ’ve try to go and that ’s just with a small portion go that route that do n’t work and it can not fire up our big plant we ’re go to have this great industry that we ’ve create can not fire up our big plant

 biden ’s plan for the china virus be to shut down the entire u.s. economy he ’s go to totally rely on somebody to walk up yes sir it ’ time to shut it down he ’d be lay off ten of million of worker and cause countless death from suicide substance abuse depression heart disease and other very serious illness

 because when you do a shutdown there ’ a problem on the other side it ’ not just from the virus you have a big problem with suicide with lose your job with all sort of thing you just take a look depression be a massive problem and what happen be you they turn to substance abuse alcohol drug so we can not do that and then we ’d have to give up all of the gain that i ’ve be talk about over the last three month we’ve what we have do be incredible we ’re set record all over the world no matter where you go nobody have do what we ’ve be able to do

 so we ’re set record in job we ’re set record in number and you ’re go to see some very big number third quarter number be come out right before a very special day november 3rd so you have the number come out and they ’re i think go to be fantastic you know i think they ’re go to be fantastic

 the good number of all if somebody do not come along and raise taxis double triple quadruple your taxis will be the number from next year but you ’re go to have a good third quarter number come out and i think it ’s go to be hard for even the medium to disparage that number

 biden want to surrender our country to the virus he want to surrender our family to the violent left wing mob and he want to surrender our job to china our job and our economic wellbeing i ’ve take in billion and billion of dollar from china no other president have do what i ’ve do i ’ve give much of it to the farmer i ’ve give it to farmer and manufacturer but i ’ve give most of it to the u.s. treasury nobody have do that we have not take in 10 cent from china ever

 they target our farmer and i target they and i give $ 28 billion to our farmer our farmer would not be existent right now right now they ’re very happy in fact they ’re set record on purchase china be purchase more corn than they ’ve ever do record purchase of corn and soybean beef because they know i ’m not happy with they they know i ’m not happy at all

 and frankly i do not want to set the world necessarily to think too much about it right now but there ’s be no country anywhere at any time that ’s rip we off like china have we lose billion and billion of dollar for year and year decade we ’ve lose billion and billion and billion of dollar by deal with china we get nothing from china they get nothing other than loss other than give our money and they take that money and they build their military and you see they ’re build up a powerful military and it ’ very lucky that i ’ve be build our up because otherwise we ’d be dwarf right now by china we would be a terrible thing a terrible thing

 we ’re way ahead on the nuclear front we ’ve upgrade our nuclear hope to god we never have to use it but we would be in a position that we be not in right now but china be spend the money we give they to build up their military so when you mention the world decouple it ’ an interesting word so we lose billion of dollar and if we do n’t do business with they we would not lose billion of dollar it ’s call decouple so you ’ll start think about it you ’ll start think

 they take our money and they spend it on build airplane and build ship and build rocket and missile and biden have be just a pawn for they he ’s be so easy they dream about biden there be a report today that they hope that joe biden become president if joe biden become president china will own the united states and every other country will be smile also they ’ll be smile

 when report come out that certain country do not really like i too much that ’s not because of my personality although it could be that also frankly it ’s because of the fact that i ’ve be very tough on country that have be rip we off for so many year

 if you look at nato with the exception of eight country we’re one of they every country be way behind they ’re delinquent especially germany in pay their nato bill that mean we end up pay it and we ’re not do it i tell they we ’re not do it and they ’ve increase their spending now $ 130 billion go up to $ 400 billion a year it ’ all because of i then you hear the country do not like i i mean i can understand that because president obama and other president in all fairness would go in there and they ’d make a speech and they ’d leave i go in there i look and i say this be unfair we ’re pay for nato we ’re pay for nato almost all of it

 so they rip we off on the military and then they rip we off with the european union on trade and biden do not have a clue you know he do not have a clue everybody know he do not have a clue in primetime he be not good and now it ’ not primetime

 he spend 47 year send american job to china to mexico and to other country while collect million of dollar in campaign and super pac contribution from global corporation that get rich by make american worker poor

 his son where be hunter?”—where be hunter?—i call he where be hunter?”—walke away with one and a half billion dollar to manage even though he never do that before he walk away with a fortune from ukraine from china and from other country between his son and his brother you ought to read the statement and the press do not pick that up if i ever do that it would be it would be hell even bad than it ’s be okay even bad than it ’s be

 what he ’s do be so incredible i will not give they the billion dollar he say i will not give they unless they get rid of that prosecutor and then voila they get rid of the prosecutor and the press do not even want to talk about it you talk about quid pro quo with i there be none with he he ’ right on tape and you do not want to cover it you should be ashamed of yourself the press should be ashamed of themselves

 but biden ship away our job throw open our border and send our youth to fight in these crazy endless war and it ’ one of the reason the military i’m not say the military be in love with i the soldier be the top people in the pentagon probably be n’t because they want to do nothing but fight war so that all of those wonderful company that make the bomb and make the plane and make everything else stay happy

 but we ’re get out of the endless war you know how we ’re we do we defeat 100 percent of the isis caliphate—100 percent when i be in when i come in it be a mess it be all over they have it in a certain color all isis a year later i say where be it it ’ all go sir because of you it ’ all go because of my philosophy but all go and i say that ’ good let ’s bring our soldier back home some people do not like to come home some people like to continue to spend money one cold hearted globalist betrayal after another and that ’ what it be

 biden support nafta he support china ’s entry into the world trade organization two disaster the most disastrous trade deal in history both of they i can not tell you which be bad they be both terrible

 and as you know i end it and i end nafta and we ’re look at the world trade organization they ’ve become much well i will say that we world health i get out of because we ’re spend $ 500 million china be spend $ 38 million and china control it but world trade we ’re look at it they ’ve be very nice to we lately i will say that amazingly we never use to win anything at the world trade would lose every case now all of a sudden we ’re win a lot of case we just win $ 7 billion as a case and they ’re talk to we much differently than they use to because if they do n’t shape up we ’re go to ship out that ’s all we ’re not treat fairly

 china be treat as a develop nation develop nation we ’re treat as a nation that ’s fully develop we ’re not fully develop as far as i ’m concern when you look around at portland and you see what these democrats be do to our city take a look at what ’s happen in new york and chicago where you have democrat run city and mayor that be run and governor that be run state so badly and mayor run city so badly it ’ very sad to look at it it ’ democrat run every one of they that i see i guess we could probably find one or two that be n’t but i don’t so far i have n’t be able to

 if you look at biden he support tpp trans pacific partnership which would have be a disaster it would have destroy our automobile business by the way many plant be be build right now auto plant in michigan just like i say they ’re be build in ohio they ’re be build in south carolina north carolina they ’re be build all over and expand at a level that we ’ve never see before because i say to japan and germany and other sorry you get to come here and build plant otherwise we ’re go to have to make it very tough on you with tariff

 and we get out of the horrible paris climate accord that he ’ll go back into because you know it sound wonderful it ’ a disaster for this country they ’ve basically take away your wealth the paris climate accord and the other country do not have to adhere to it china do not kick in until 2030 they do not have to do anything until 2030 we have very high standard we would have have to close under some scenario 25 percent of our business in order to qualify under this ridiculous paris climate accord it sound good it be very bad very expensive

 the new york times have just publish an entire story on biden ’s china sell out which be amazing for the new york times i appreciate that in 2001 biden say the united states welcome the emergence of a prosperous integrate china on the global stage because we expect this be go to be a china that play by the rule they do not play by the rule they do not play by the rule

 the world trade organization one of the reason it ’ so bad be that china do not play by the rule we do we do but their rule be easy because they ’re consider a develop nation so they have a much low standard but even that they do not play by the rule that ’s when they become a rocket ship they be flat lined for year and year and year then they join the world trade organization and frankly they cheat okay they cheat i ’ll say it what difference do it make i feel much differently i feel i make a great trade deal with china great and they ’re buy you know why they ’re buy because they know i ’m not happy that ’s why they ’re buy and i talk about it because today be labor day and it ’ a good to time talk about when we ’re be rip off by country but nobody be even close to china

 biden cheer china ’s rise as a great power because great power adhere to international norm in the area of nonproliferation human right and trade well they do n’t they take advantage of stupid people stupid people and biden be a stupid person you know that you ’re not go to write it but you know that

 the cost of biden ’s economic treachery be 60,000 shutter american factory and i hear this morning the real number be probably 70,000—70,000 shutter american factory and he ’s talk about how wonderful it be with china no china have be very bad on top of which we have the china plague send to we and other virus nothing near this serious but the swine and we have other virus send in over the year that come from china i wonder why

 if biden win china win because china will own this country if biden win china will own this country and hopefully you ’re not go to be able to find that out it ’ the most important election in our history right now most important election in our history

 under my administration we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we ’ll end our reliance on china once and for all whether it ’s decouple or put in massive tariff like i ’ve be do already we ’re go to end our reliance on china because we can not rely on china and i do not want they build a military like they ’re build right now and they ’re use our money to build it

 we ’ll manufacture our critical medical supply in the united states we ’ll create make in america tax credit and bring our job back from china to the united states and we ’ll impose tariff on company that desert america to create job in china and other country if they can not do it here then let they pay a big tax to build it someplace else and send it into our country we ’ll prohibit federal contract from company that outsource to china and we ’ll hold china accountable for allow the virus to spread around the world

 now you can understand why china would much rather see sleepy joe than donald trump but as long as i ’m president we will never waver in our undying loyalty to the american worker and to our country as a whole

 so happy labor day everybody yeah go ahead

 q thank mr. president the issue of what happen when you be in france continue to be a story

 the president you ’re go to have to take that off please just you can take it off your health how many foot be you away

 q i ’ll speak a lot louder

 the president well if you do not take it off you ’re very muffled so if you would take it off it would be a lot easy

 q i ’ll just speak a lot louder be that well

 the president it ’ well yeah it ’ well

 q mr. president some people be have a hard time believe your denial of the atlantic story because of what you say about john mccain in the past do you understand that and have you ask john kelly

 the president no i do not understand that

 q and have you ask john kelly to refute that story

 the president no i do not understand it at all no because i ’ve always be on the opposite side of john mccain john mccain like war i will be a well warrior than anybody but when we fight a war we ’re go to win they and frankly i be never a fan of john mccain you know that that ’s be very obvious i be but i have to approve his entire his funeral i want he to get he deserve a first class you know and it all be approve by i we send air force one to pick up the casket a lot of thing

 but no i be never a fan of john mccain because he want the endless war and i do n’t i think that the way the vet be take care of our great vet be not good not appropriate and of course he take the fake dirty dossier and give it over to the fbi so this be not somebody be i suppose to say what a wonderful guy

 so you know what i live with he he live with i but we have different philosophy i think my philosophy be right i think it ’s turn out to be right but i be n’t a fan but i respect people and i respect a lot of people that do not mean i necessarily have to agree with they and i do not agree with he on a lot of thing

 the story be a hoax write by a guy who have get a tremendously bad history the magazine itself which i do not read but i hear it ’s just totally anti trump he ’ a big obama person he ’ a big clinton person and he make up the story it ’ a totally make up story

 in fact i be very happy to see zach fuentes come out and say now he’s that’s i think that ’ number 15 and these be people that be there that ’ the 15th person general kellogg everybody that be there know what happen and so i be happy to see that zach come out and say it ’ not true he just come out

 and it ’ a disgrace who would say a thing like that only an animal would say a thing like that there be nobody that have more respect for not only our military but for people that give their life in the military there ’ nobody and i think john kelly know that i think he would know that i think he know that from i

 but zach fuentes as you know work for john and i think they both know that but zach come out as you know today or yesterday last night and say very strongly that he do not hear anything like that even john bolton come out and say that be untrue

 now what be true be that we have the bad weather i think it be as bad a rain as i ’ve just about ever see and it be a fog you you literally could not see i walk out and i do not have i do not need somebody to tell i i walk out and i say there ’ no way we can take helicopter in this i understand helicopter very well and they say no sir that ’s be cancel

 they would have have to go secret service i have the whole list they would have have through a very very busy section during the day of paris they would have have to go through the city the paris police be ask we please do n’t do it because they ’re not ready when you do that you need a lot of time they take day and day and day to prepare for that

 i want to do it very badly i be willing to sit in the car for two hour three hour four hour i do n’t care it do not matter and i have nothing else to do i go there for that i have nothing else to do it be end because of the terrible weather and nobody be prepared to go through in term of paris the police the military and the secret service and they come out very strongly and say sir we can not allow you to make this trip if i want to sir we can not allow you from a safety standpoint

 it be a phony story just like the dirty dossier the fake dirty dossier just like the russia collusion just like all of the other phony story and there ’ll be more phony story

 but i do appreciate zach come out but zach now be the 15th person that ’s deny it zach now i think also talk about the weather aspect of it and he ’ probably the 14th or 15th person that blame it on weather so that ’s enough of that

 yes please

 q thank you christina bobb one america news thank you for hold the briefing

 the president thank you

 q we ’re see judge most recently in detroit limit police ability to use non lethal force my first question would be should the police be allow to use non lethal force to quell the violence in their city

 but i ’ve tell when we have the federal in there as you know i tell the u.s. marshals to go get the man who kill a another man and they know who it be and you have to arrest he you have to arrest he after two and a half day they do not arrest he the u.s. marshals go in and it end up be a gunfight and the man be kill but this be a man that have a bad record and this be a man that kill a man in the street i mean i witness it most people witness it and the u.s. marshals go in they be not playing game they can not play game if somebody be break the law there ’s get to be a form of retribution

 i watch so often when i watch some of the area that we ’re talk about now we have rochester that ’s again democrat governor democrat mayor all democrats every one of they and it always will be

 i be with the governor in texas he look at i and say i can not imagine how they allow this to happen and you know it ’ different it ’ different i could talk about other governor say the same thing

 q from the department of justice for those travel for that purpose

 the president so we have now over 1,000 people federal in jail we ’re prosecute many people a big thing be when i sign the law put people in jail if you knock down monument that be three month ago there have not be a federal monument knock down in three month or even think about i do not think they ’ve even think about it so that ’s have a very big impact a very big impact

 but yeah we ’re go around and the nice part be you people take see those people up there?—they take nice picture of everybody so we do not even have to bother we can use the news photo we have a photo right over there of andrew jackson the monument he be get ready and this guy be a big brave guy and he be up like this and he be show off to all his friend and he get arrest and so do a lot of other people get arrest and i would say we have the ultimate proof now in that case we get there before they rip down the statue of andrew jackson which be so beautiful which be right over there but they never get it

 but right after that i sign a an order say you go to prison for 10 year and as soon as i sign that order that be the end of the statue come down but they have other idea they’ve they’ve get plenty of idea they ’re not at want for idea

 the president and if i think it make a difference or would make a difference i ’d do it in a minute

 yeah go ahead

 q yeah david jackson usa today my question be about the durham report which you have talk about recently you say let ’s see what happen now you ’ve accuse people of commit crime against you during the russia investigation

 the president yeah sure sure

 q include president obama and joe biden

 the president they spy on my campaign that ’ right

 q because my question be

 the president they spy on my campaign and if they be democrats they would have be in jail two year ago they would have be in jail literally if this side be the democrat side they would have be in jail two year ago for 50 year term for treason and other thing

 q but excuse i my question be do you want the justice department to indict people over this

 the president i ’m not go to say that i have to see the report i have n’t see i purposely i do not know if that be a good thing smart thing i do not know but nobody can complain about it i have every right to have be very much involve and maybe someday i ’ll get involve in it

 they spy on my campaign and that include biden and obama they spy on my campaign try to defeat i they write up a fake dossier that have prove to be totally fake write by christopher steele pay for by hillary clinton and the democrats and they use that illegally in the fisa court

 if we do what they do you would have many people in jail all right right now and you have other than the one agent that admit his guilt that he forge document we do not have that yet but the report have not be issue yet let ’s see what happen

 q it sure sound like you want to prosecute people

 the president but let i just let i just tell you something president obama and biden sleepy joe he know everything that be happen they be spy on my campaign and they get catch now let ’s see what happen

 but if this be the opposite way people would have be jail they would have be in jail already for a period of at least it would have start two year ago and it would have be 50 year for treason because you can not do that that ’s never and nothing like that ’ ever happen before then they create at tremendous expense the money they pay be tremendous i ’m sure you know the money that be pay million of dollar they create a fake dossier a fake dossier prove to be now fake everyone and they use it in the fisa court that ’ a crime

 q but it sure sound like you want to prosecute

 the president so far i have not see anybody have a problem but the report have not be issue yet let ’s see what happen with the durham report

 but this start at obama and some people would say and some people well but he be president like let ’s leave he alone if it be i they would not be leave i alone i can tell you it ’ a totally double standard and it ’ a it ’ a disgrace

 and the dirty fight of all be the issuance of 80 million ballot unrequested they ’re not request they ’re just send 80 million ballot all over the country eighty million ballot non requested i call they unsolicited ballot that ’s go to be the dirty fight of all people be go to get ballot they ’re go to say what be i do and then they ’re go to harvest they ’re go to do all the thing

 and if you look at the last period of six month take a look at the race where they ’ve send ballot out take a look at carolyn maloney whose race should be redone because she win that race totally unfairly to her opponent her opponent do very well against she that race should be rerun but they declare she the winner because they hear i find out about it but take a look at what ’s happen in new jersey and in virginia in different place it ’ a disgrace that ’ll be a beauty

 when i come along i say wait a minute we ’re protect germany from russia right nato we ’re protect germany from russia germany be pay russia billion and billion of dollar to get their energy and the real number be probably 60 to 70 percent ultimately of their energy be go to come from russia and i say this for year that nobody talk about it one of the many thing between sanction and all of the what we ’ve do for ukraine relative to what the past they use to send pillow and we send tank buster but i bring that up a long time ago russia be unhappy that i bring it up but you never hear of nord stream 2 nobody do until i get elect

 and i say why be germany make a deal to give billion of dollar to russia and then we ’re protect germany from russia how do that work and then on top of it germany be delinquent because they ’re only pay a little more than 1 percent and they ’re suppose to be pay 2 percent and even the 2 percent be low but just remember trump i i get the country of nato to spend one point—$130 billion go to $ 400 billion a year think of it $ 400 billion a year more for nato

 and the purpose of nato primarily be europe protection against russia now they can use it for other i guess and they have a little bit in the middle east et cetera et cetera

 but i ’m the one that do that so but nobody talk about that nobody talk about nord stream 2

 the answer be absolutely if they feel that something happen but i do not know that germany be in a position right now because germany be in a very weakened position energy wise they ’re close all their plant they ’re close their nuclear they ’re close their coal they ’re close a lot of plant and they be they have put themselves in a very bad position frankly very very bad position

 yeah please

 q mr. president can i follow up jeff mason ’s question have you ask john kelly to publicly refute the atlantic and then can i ask something else

 the president no i have nothing against john i have nothing against anybody no

 i be very heartened to see that a friend of his because i know zach be a friend of his and work for he i be very heartened to see that zach fuentes come out with the statement that he do i guess late last night that it be not true

 q can i ask another question on a different topic mr. president mr. president what exactly be un american about federal government training program that be aim at improve inclusivity or point out bias

 the president well we ’re go to do a report yeah i fire those people they ’re all go and it be a disgrace frankly and we ’re go to give you a big report that ’s go to make you very happy

 all right yeah please

 q thank you darlene superville ap you say a moment ago they ’ll say anything you be talk about joe biden and kamala harris and their comment about the vaccine you have assert

 the president no they say bad they say negative they say negative they ’re go to make the vaccine into a negative so that when we have it and i speak to the head of pfizer i speak to the head of johnson amp johnson i speak to the head of the great medical company in the world we ’re do great we ’re go to have it soon

 q right

 the president wait a minute so now what they ’re say be oh wow this be bad news president trump be get this vaccine in record time by the way if this be the obama administration you would not have that vaccine for three year and you probably would not have it all

 so we ’re go to have a vaccine very soon maybe even before a very special date you know what date i ’m talk about

 q yes

 the president but let i just tell you wait and what they ’re do because they think it be go fast and if you talk to a lot of your source if you have source if you talk to your source in the fda you ’ll see it ’s go very very well the number be look unbelievably strong unbelievably good

 so now they ’re say wow trump have pull this off okay let ’s disparage the vaccine that ’ so bad for this country that ’s so bad for the world to even say that and that ’ what they ’re say

 but i watch kamala ’s poll number drop from 15 to almost zero and then drop out even before she run in iowa because people do not like she and i understand why she will never be president although i have to be careful because obama use to say that about i so i have to be a little bit careful

 q right but

 the president but you have to look at she a little bit more closely because obviously joe be not do too well so you ’re go to have to look at she a little bit too closely

 but she ’s talk about disparage a vaccine so that people do not think the achievement be a great achievement i do not want the achievement for myself i want something that ’s go to make people well that people be n’t go to get sick with that include therapeutic where we ’re do equally as well therapeutic

 q may i finish may i finish the question

 the president go ahead

 q your point be that what they ’re say be that they ’re say it for a political purpose

 the president yes

 q you have assert repeatedly that a vaccine will be on the market by before the election by the end of october

 the president no i do n’t say i do not say they will i say by the end of the year

 q be n’t you do the same thing that you

 the president no but you ’re not quote i accurately

 q say they ’re guilty of

 the president i say that vaccine will be on the market before the end of year but they may even be on the market they may even be develop and fully develop test and everything else

 you know we have 30,000 people in just one vaccine right now under test in very very highly infect area so we ’re go to be able to get a good result one way or the other very soon

 so i do not say what you say what i say be by the end of the year but i think it could even be soon than that it could be during the month of october actually could be before november

 q but be n’t you also say that for political reason

 the president no i ’m say that because we want to save a lot of life the fast with i it ’s the fast the well with somebody else maybe they would say it politically but i ’m say it in term of this be what we need we have to have if get the vaccine early that ’ a great thing whether it ’ politic or not

 now do benefit inure if you ’re able to get something year ahead of schedule i guess maybe they do but the most important thing to i be save life it ’ the most important thing

 yeah go ahead in the back

 q hi just base on some of your recent tweet do you

 the president you sound so clear as oppose to everybody else where they refuse

 q your tweet about the 1619 project

 the president yeah

 q why do you object to that be teach in school and do you object to slavery itself be teach in school

 the president yeah so no i want everybody to know everything they can about our history i ’m not a believer in cancel culture the good or the bad if you do n’t study the bad it could happen again so i do want that subject study very very carefully and very accurately

 but we grow up with a certain history and now they ’re try to change our history revisionist history that ’s why they want to take down our monument that ’s why they want to take down our statue

 i see something the other day which be absolutely horrendous washington monument they want to rename it the d.c. committee but the d.c. committee be all democrats abraham lincoln thomas jefferson i mean we ’re talk about this be the big stuff now this be the big stuff and they want to rename it they want to re designate it they want to take some down no we do not do that never go to happen with i i guarantee you that

 she be a woman of enormous talent and consequence and her life of public service serve as an example to we all particularly poignant to i be her long and deep friendship with justice antonin scalia my own mentor

 justices scalia and ginsburg disagree fiercely in print without rancor in person their ability to maintain a warm and rich friendship despite their difference even inspire an opera these two great americans demonstrate that argument even about matter of great consequence need not destroy affection in both my personal and professional relationship i strive to meet that standard

 i be lucky enough to clerk for justice scalia and give his incalculable influence on my life i be very moved to have member of the scalia family here today include his dear wife maureen

 i clerk for justice scalia more than 20 year ago but the lesson i learn still resonate his judicial philosophy be mine too a judge must apply the law as write judge be not policymaker and they must be resolute in set aside any policy view they might hold the president have ask i to become the ninth justice and as it happen i ’m use to be in a group of nine my family

 our family include i my husband jesse emma vivian tess john peter liam juliet and benjamin vivian and john peter as the president say be bear in haiti and they come to we five year apart when they be very young and the most revealing fact about benjamin our young be that his brother and sister unreservedly identify he as their favorite sibling

 our child be my great joy even though they deprive i of any reasonable amount of sleep i could not manage this very full life without the unwavering support of my husband jesse at the start of our marriage i imagine that we would run our household as partner as it have turn out jesse do far more than his share of the work to my chagrin i learn at dinner recently that my child consider he to be the well cook

 for 21 year jesse have ask i every single morning what he can do for i that day and though i almost always say nothing he still find way to take thing off my plate and that ’s not because he have a lot of free time he have a busy law practice it ’s because he be a superb and generous husband and i be very fortunate

 justice barrett   thank you thank you so very much thank you all for be here tonight and thank you president trump for select i to serve as an associate justice of the united states supreme court it ’ a privilege to be ask to serve my country in this office and i stand here tonight truly honor and humble

 thank also to the senate for give its consent to my appointment i be grateful for the confidence you have express in i and i pledge to you and to the american people that i will discharge my duty to the very good of my ability

 this be a rigorous confirmation process and i thank all of you especially leader mcconnell and chairman graham for help i to navigate it

 jesse and i be also so grateful to the many people have support who have support our family over these last several week through way both tangible and intangible you have make this day possible jesse and i have be truly awestruck by your generosity

 i have spend a good amount of time over the last month at the senate both in meeting with individual senator and in day of hearing before the senate judiciary committee the confirmation process have make ever clear to i one of the fundamental difference between the federal judiciary and the united states senate and perhaps the most acute be the role of policy preference

 it be the job of a senator to pursue her policy preference in fact it would be a dereliction of duty for she to put policy goal aside by contrast it be the job of a judge to resist her policy preference it would be a dereliction of duty for she to give in to they

 federal judge do not stand for election thus they have no basis for claim that their preference reflect those of the people this separation of duty from political preference be what make the judiciary distinct among the three branch of government

 a judge declare independence not only from congress and the president but also from the private belief that might otherwise move she the judicial oath capture the essence of the judicial duty the rule of law must always control

 my fellow americans even though we judge do n’t face election we still work for you it be your constitution that establish the rule of law and the judicial independence that be so central to it

 the oath that i have solemnly take tonight mean at its core that i will do my job without any fear or favor and that i will do so independently of both the political branch and of my own preference

 i love the constitution and the democratic republic that it establish and i will devote myself to preserve it thank you

the president good evening i ’d like to provide the american people with an update on our effort to protect the integrity of our very important 2020 election if you count the legal vote i easily win if you count the illegal vote they can try to steal the election from we if you count the vote that come in late we ’re look at they very strongly but a lot of vote come in late

 i ’ve already decisively win many critical state include massive victory in florida iowa indiana ohio to name just a few we win these and many other victory despite historic election interference from big medium big money and big tech

 as everybody see we win by historic number and the pollster get it knowingly wrong they get it knowingly wrong we have poll that be so ridiculous and everybody know that at the time there be no blue wave that they predict they think there be go to be a big blue wave that be false that be do for suppression reason but instead there be a big red wave

 and it ’s be properly acknowledge actually by the medium they be i think very impressed but that be after the fact that do not do we any good

 we keep the senate despite have twice as many seat to defend as democrats and in a really much more competitive state we ’ve we do a fantastic job with the senate and i think we ’re very proud of what ’s happen there we have many more seat to defend

 they spend almost $ 200 million on senate race in south carolina and kentucky alone two race and hundred of million of dollar overall against we at the national level our opponent major donor be wall street banker and special interest our major donor be police officer farmer everyday citizen yet for the first time ever we lose zero race in the house i be talk to kevin mccarthy today he say he could not believe it zero race very unusual thing zero and actually win many new seat with i think many more on the way

 this be also the year of the republican woman more republican woman be elect to congress than ever before that ’ a great achievement i win the large share of non white voter of any republican in 60 year include historic number of latino african american asian american and native american voter the large ever in our history we grow our party by 4 million voter the great turnout in republican party history

 democrats be the party of the big donor the big medium the big tech it seem and republicans have become the party of the american worker and that ’ what ’s happen and we ’re also i believe the party of inclusion

 as everyone now recognize medium polling be election interference in the true sense of that word by powerful special interest these really phony poll i have to call they phony poll fake poll be design to keep our voter at home create the illusion of momentum for mr. biden and diminish republicans ability to raise fund they be what ’s call suppression poll everyone know that now and it ’s never be use to the extent that it ’s be use on this last election

 to highlight just a few example the day before election quinnipiac which be wrong on every occasion that i know of have joe biden up by 5 point in florida and they be off by 8.4 point and i win florida easily easily so they have i lose florida by a lot and i end up win florida by a lot other than that they be very accurate they have he up 4 point in ohio and they be off by 12.2 point and i also win ohio the great state of ohio very easily

 the washington post have biden up 17 point in wisconsin and it be basically even they be off by about 17 point and they know that they ’re not stupid people they know that suppression

 there be now only a few state yet to be decide in the presidential race the vote apparatus of those state be run in all case by democrats

 we be win in all the key location by a lot actually and then our number start miraculously getting whittle away in secret and they would not allow legally permissible observer we go to court in a couple of instance and we be able to get the observer put in and when the observer get there they want they 60 70 foot away 80 foot 100 foot away or outside the building to observe people inside the building

 and we win a case a big case and we have other happen there be a lot of lot of litigation even beyond our litigation there ’ tremendous amount of litigation generally because of how unfair this process be and i predict that i ’ve be talk about mail in voting for a long time it ’ it ’s really destroy our system

 it ’ a corrupt system and it make people corrupt even if they be n’t by nature but they become corrupt it ’ too easy they want to find out how many vote they need and then they seem to be able to find they they wait and wait and then they find they

 and you see that on election night we be ahead in vote in north carolina by a lot tremendous number of vote and we ’re still ahead by a lot but not as many because they ’re find ballot all of a sudden oh we have some mail in ballot

 it ’ amazing how those mail in ballot be so one sided too i know that it ’s suppose to be to the advantage of the democrats but in all case they ’re so one side

 we be up by nearly 700,000 vote in pennsylvania i win pennsylvania by a lot and that get whittle down to i think they say now we ’re up by 90,000 vote and they ’ll keep come and come and come they find they all over and they do not want we to have any observer although we win a court case the judge say you have to have observer

 likewise in geor- and they ’re appeal actually they ’re appeal we win a case that we want people to watch and we want observer and they ’re actually appealing which be sort of interesting i wonder why they ’d appeal that all we want to do be have people watch as they do the vote tabulation

 likewise in georgia i win by a lot a lot with a lead of over get close to 300,000 vote on election night in georgia and by the way get whittle down and now it ’s get to be to a point where i ’ll go from win by a lot to perhaps be even down a little bit

 in georgia a pipe burst in a faraway location totally unrelated to the location of what be happen and they stop count for four hour and a lot of thing happen the election apparatus in georgia be run by democrats

 we also have margin of 300,000 in michigan we be way up in michigan win the state and in wisconsin we do likewise fantastically well and that get whittle down every in every case they get whittle down

 today we ’re on track to win arizona we only need to carry i guess 55 percent of the remain vote 55 percent margin and that ’ a margin that we ’ve significantly exceed so we ’ll see what happen with that but we ’re on track to do okay in arizona

 our goal be to defend the integrity of the election we ’ll not allow the corruption to steal such an important election or any election for that matter and we can not allow silence anybody to silence our voter and manufacture result

 i ’ve never have i ’ve be do a lot of public thing for a long time i ’ve never have anything that ’s be as inspirational by people call talk send thing to we i ’ve never see such such love and such affection and such spirit as i ’ve see for this people know what ’s happen and they see what ’s happen and it ’ before their eye

 and there be many instance which will be report very shortly there ’ tremendous litigation go on and this be a case where they ’re try to steal an election they ’re try to rig an election and we can not let that happen detroit and philadelphia know as two of the most corrupt political place anywhere in our country easily can not be responsible for engineer the outcome of a presidential race a very important presidential race

 in pennsylvania democrats have go to the state supreme court to try and ban our election observer and very strongly now we win the case but they ’re they ’re go forward they do not want anybody in there they do not want anybody watch they as they count the ballot and i can not imagine why there ’ absolutely no legitimate reason why they would not want to have people watch this process because if it ’ straight they would be they should be proud of it instead they ’re try obviously to commit fraud there ’ no question about that

 in philadelphia observer have be keep far away very far away so far that people be use binocular to try and see and there ’s be tremendous problem cause they put paper on all of the window so you can not see in and the people that be ban be very unhappy and become somewhat violent

 the 11th circuit rule that in georgia the vote have be in by election day that they should be in by election day and they be n’t vote be come in after election day and they have a ruling already that you have to have the vote in by election day to the good of my knowledge vote should be in by election day and they do not do that

 democrat official never believe they could win this election honestly i really believe that that ’s why they do the mail in ballot where there ’ tremendous corruption and fraud go on that ’s why they mail out ten of million of unsolicited ballot without any verification measure whatsoever and i ’ve tell everybody that these thing would happen because i ’ve see it happen i watch a lot of different election before they decide to go with this big massive election with ten of million of ballot go out to everybody in many case totally unsolicited

 this be unprecedented in american history this be by design despite year of claim to care about the election security they refuse to include any requirement to verify signature identity or even determine whether they ’re eligible or ineligible to vote people be walk in that they have no idea they ’re just take number they ’re write down thing the worker and do a lot of bad thing and we have a lot of information come and litigation that you ’ll see that will shake even you people up and you ’ve see it all

 the official oversee the counting in pennsylvania and other key state be all part of a corrupt democrat machine that you ’ve write about and for a long time you ’ve be write about the corrupt democrat machine i go to school there and i know a lot about it it have n’t change it ’ a long time ago and it have n’t change it ’s get bad

 in pennsylvania partisan democrats have allow ballot in the state to be receive three day after the election and we think much more than that and they be count those without even postmark or any identification whatsoever so you do not have postmark you do not have identification there have be a number of disturb irregularity across the nation our campaign have be deny access to observe any counting in detroit detroit be another place

 so you do n’t have postmark you do not have identification there have be a number of disturb irregularity across the nation our campaign have be deny access to observe any counting in detroit detroit be another place and i would not say have the good reputation for election integrity

 poll worker in michigan be duplicate ballot but when our observer attempt to challenge the activity those poll worker jump in front of the volunteer to block their view so that they could not see what they be do and it become a little bit dangerous

 one major hub for count ballot in detroit cover up the window again with large piece of cardboard and so they want to protect and block the counting area they do not want anybody see the counting even though these be observer who be legal observer that be suppose to be there

 in detroit there be hour of unexplained delay in deliver many of the vote for counting the final batch do not arrive until four in the morning and even though the poll close at eight o’clock so they bring it in and the batch come in and nobody know where they come from we ’ve also be deny access to observe in critical place in georgia

 in multiple swing state count be halt for hour and hour on election night with result withhold from major democrat run location only to appear later and they certainly appear and they all have the name biden on they or just about all i think almost all they all have the name biden on they which be a little strange

 i challenge joe and every democrat to clarify that they only want legal vote because they talk about vote and i think they should use the word legal legal vote we want every legal vote count and i want every legal vote count we want openness and transparency no secret count room no mystery ballot no illegal vote be cast after election day

 you have election day and the law be very strong on that you have an election day and they do not want vote cast after election day and they want the process to be an honest one it ’ so important we want an honest election and we want an honest count and we want honest people work back there because it ’ a very important job

 so that ’s the way this country be go to win that ’ the way the united states will win and we think we will win the election very easily we think there ’s go to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence so much proof and it ’s go to end up perhaps at the high court in the land we ’ll see but we think there ’ll be a lot of litigation because we can not have an election steal by like this

 and i i tell you i would i have be talk about this for many month with all of you and i ’ve say very strongly that mail in ballot be go to end up be a disaster small election be a disaster small very easy to handle election be disastrous

 this be a large scale version and it ’s get bad and bad every day we ’re hear story that be horror story absolute horror story and we can not let that happen to the united states of america it ’ not a question of who win republican democrat joe myself we can not let that happen to our country we can not be disgrace by have something like this happen

 so it will be hopefully clear up maybe soon i hope soon but it ’ll probably go through a process a legal process and as you know i ’ve claim certain state and he ’s claim state so we can both claim the state but ultimately i have a feeling judge be go to have to rule but there ’s be a lot of shenanigan and we can not stand for that in our country

 thank you very much

i know your pain i know your hurt

 we have an election that be steal from we it be a landslide election and everyone know it especially the other side

 but you have to go home now we have to have peace we have to have law and order we have to respect our great people in law and order

 we do not want anybody hurt it be a very tough period of time

 there have never be a time like this where such a thing happen where they could take it away from all of we from i from you from our country

 this be a fraudulent election but we can not play into the hand of these people

 we have to have peace so go home we love you you be very special you have see what happen you see the way other be treat that be so bad and so evil i know how you feel but go home and go home video cut off early

i would like to begin by address the heinous attack on the united states capitol like all americans i be outrage by the violence lawlessness and mayhem i immediately deploy the national guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruder

 america be and must always be a nation of law and order the demonstrator who infiltrate the capitol have defile the seat of american democracy

 to those who engage in the act of violence and destruction you do not represent our country

 and to those who break the law you will pay

 we have just be through an intense election and emotion be high but now temper must be cool and calm restore we must get on with the business of america

 my campaign vigorously pursue every legal avenue to contest the election result my only goal be to ensure the integrity of the vote in so do i be fight to defend american democracy i continue to strongly believe that we must reform our election law to verify the identity and the eligibility of all voter and to ensure faith and confidence in all future election

 now congress have certify the result a new administration will be inaugurate on january 20 my focus now turn to ensure a smooth orderly and seamless transition of power this moment call for healing and reconciliation

 now more than ever we must unify around our share value and rise above the partisan rancor and forge our common destiny

 we proudly leave the next administration with the strong and most robust border security measure ever put into place this include historic agreement with mexico guatemala honduras and el salvador along with more than 450 mile of powerful new wall

 we restore american strength at home and american leadership abroad the world respect we again please do not lose that respect

 we reclaim our sovereignty by stand up for america at the united nations and withdraw from the one side global deal that never serve our interest and nato country be now pay hundred of billion of dollar more than when i arrive just a few year ago it be very unfair we be pay the cost for the world now the world be help we

 as a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism we achieve a series of historic peace deal in the middle east nobody believe it could happen the abraham accords open the door to a future of peace and harmony not violence and bloodshed it be the dawn of a new middle east and we be bring our soldier home

 i be especially proud to be the first president in decade who have start no new war

 above all we have reassert the sacred idea that in america the government answer to the people our guide light our north star our unwavering conviction have be that we be here to serve the noble everyday citizen of america our allegiance be not to the special interest corporation or global entity it ’ to our child our citizen and to our nation itself

 as president my top priority my constant concern have always be the good interest of american worker and american family i do not seek the easy course by far it be actually the most difficult i do not seek the path that would get the least criticism i take on the tough battle the hard fight the most difficult choice because that ’ what you elect i to do your need be my first and last unyielding focus

 this i hope will be our great legacy together we put the american people back in charge of our country we restore self government we restore the idea that in america no one be forget because everyone matter and everyone have a voice we fight for the principle that every citizen be entitle to equal dignity equal treatment and equal right because we be all make equal by god everyone be entitle to be treat with respect to have their voice hear and to have their government listen you be loyal to your country and my administration be always loyal to you

 we work to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful family we fight for the community where every american could be safe and school where every child could learn we promote a culture where our law would be uphold our hero honor our history preserve and law abide citizen be never take for grant americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieve together it ’ incredible

 now as i leave the white house i have be reflect on the danger that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share as the world ’s most powerful nation america face constant threat and challenge from abroad but the great danger we face be a loss of confidence in ourselves a loss of confidence in our national greatness a nation be only as strong as its spirit we be only as dynamic as our pride we be only as vibrant as the faith that beat in the heart of our people

 no nation can long thrive that lose faith in its own value history and hero for these be the very source of our unity and our vitality

 what have always allow america to prevail and triumph over the great challenge of the past have be an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history we must never lose this conviction we must never forsake our belief in america

 the key to national greatness lie in sustain and instill our share national identity that mean focus on what we have in common the heritage that we all share

 at the center of this heritage be also a robust belief in free expression free speech and open debate only if we forget who we be and how we get here could we ever allow political censorship and blacklist to take place in america it ’ not even thinkable shut down free and open debate violate our core value and most enduring tradition
 in america we do not insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxy and punitive speech code we just do n’t do that america be not a timid nation of tame soul who need to be shelter and protect from those with whom we disagree that ’s not who we be it will never be who we be

 for nearly 250 year in the face of every challenge americans have always summon our unmatched courage confidence and fierce independence these be the miraculous trait that once lead million of everyday citizen to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great west it be the same profound love of our god give freedom that will our soldier into battle and our astronaut into space

 as i think back on the past four year one image rise in my mind above all other whenever i travel all along the motorcade route there be thousand and thousand of people they come out with their family so that they could stand as we pass and proudly wave our great american flag it never fail to deeply move i i know that they do not just come out to show their support of i they come out to show i their support and love for our country

 this be a republic of proud citizen who be unite by our common conviction that america be the great nation in all of history we be and must always be a land of hope of light and of glory to all the world this be the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn

 for the past four year i have work to do just that from a great hall of muslim leader in riyadh to a great square of polish people in warsaw from the floor of the korean assembly to the podium at the united nations general assembly and from the forbidden city in beijing to the shadow of mount rushmore i fight for you i fight for your family i fight for our country above all i fight for america and all it stand for and that be safe strong proud and free

 now as i prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on wednesday i want you to know that the movement we start be only just begin there ’s never be anything like it the belief that a nation must serve its citizen will not dwindle but instead only grow strong by the day

 as long as the american people hold in their heart deep and devoted love of country then there be nothing that this nation can not achieve our community will flourish our people will be prosperous our tradition will be cherish our faith will be strong and our future will be bright than ever before

 i go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart an optimistic spirit and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our child the good be yet to come

 thank you and farewell god bless you god bless the united states of america

chief justice roberts vice president harris speaker pelosi leader schumer leader mcconnell vice president pence distinguished guest and my fellow americans

 this be america ’s day

 this be democracy ’s day

 a day of history and hope

 of renewal and resolve

 through a crucible for the age america have be test anew and america have rise to the challenge

 today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause the cause of democracy

 the will of the people have be hear and the will of the people have be heed

 we have learn again that democracy be precious

 democracy be fragile

 and at this hour my friend democracy have prevail

 so now on this hallowed ground where just day ago violence seek to shake this capitol ’s very foundation we come together as one nation under god indivisible to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two century

 we look ahead in our uniquely american way restless bold optimistic and set our sight on the nation we know we can be and we must be

 i thank my predecessor of both party for their presence here

 i thank they from the bottom of my heart

 you know the resilience of our constitution and the strength of our nation

 as do president carter who i speak to last night but who can not be with we today but whom we salute for his lifetime of service

 i have just take the sacred oath each of these patriot take an oath first swear by george washington

 but the american story depend not on any one of we not on some of we but on all of we

 on we the people who seek a more perfect union

 this be a great nation and we be a good people

 over the century through storm and strife in peace and in war we have come so far but we still have far to go

 we will press forward with speed and urgency for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility

 much to repair

 much to restore

 much to heal

 much to build

 and much to gain

 few period in our nation ’s history have be more challenging or difficult than the one we ’re in now

 a once in a century virus silently stalk the country

 it ’s take as many life in one year as america lose in all of world war ii

 millions of job have be lose

 hundred of thousand of business close

 a cry for racial justice some 400 year in the making move we the dream of justice for all will be defer no long

 a cry for survival come from the planet itself a cry that can not be any more desperate or any more clear

 and now a rise in political extremism white supremacy domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat

 to overcome these challenge to restore the soul and to secure the future of america require more than word

 it require that most elusive of thing in a democracy

 unity

 unity

 in another january in washington on new year ’s day 1863 abraham lincoln sign the emancipation proclamation

 when he put pen to paper the president say if my name ever go down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul be in it

 my whole soul be in it

 today on this january day my whole soul be in this

 bring america together

 unite our people

 and unite our nation

 i ask every american to join i in this cause

 unite to fight the common foe we face

 anger resentment hatred

 extremism lawlessness violence

 disease joblessness hopelessness

 with unity we can do great thing important thing

 we can right wrong

 we can put people to work in good job

 we can teach our child in safe school

 we can overcome this deadly virus

 we can reward work rebuild the middle class and make health care
 secure for all

 we can deliver racial justice

 we can make america once again the lead force for good in the world

 i know speak of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy

 i know the force that divide we be deep and they be real

 but i also know they be not new

 our history have be a constant struggle between the american ideal that we be all create equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism nativism fear and demonization have long tear we apart

 the battle be perennial

 victory be never assure

 through the civil war the great depression world war 9/11 through struggle sacrifice and setback our well angel have always prevail

 in each of these moment enough of we come together to carry all of we forward

 and we can do so now

 history faith and reason show the way the way of unity

 we can see each other not as adversary but as neighbor

 we can treat each other with dignity and respect

 we can join force stop the shouting and lower the temperature

 for without unity there be no peace only bitterness and fury

 no progress only exhaust outrage

 no nation only a state of chaos

 this be our historic moment of crisis and challenge and unity be the path forward

 and we must meet this moment as the united states of america

 if we do that i guarantee you we will not fail

 we have never ever ever fail in america when we have act together

 and so today at this time and in this place let we start afresh

 all of we

 let we listen to one another

 hear one another
 see one another

 show respect to one another

 politic need not be a rage fire destroy everything in its path

 every disagreement do not have to be a cause for total war

 and we must reject a culture in which fact themselves be manipulate and even manufacture

 my fellow americans we have to be different than this

 america have to be well than this

 and i believe america be well than this

 just look around

 here we stand in the shadow of a capitol dome that be complete amid the civil war when the union itself hang in the balance

 yet we endure and we prevail

 here we stand look out to the great mall where dr. king speak of his dream

 here we stand where 108 year ago at another inaugural thousand of protestor try to block brave woman from march for the right to vote

 today we mark the swearing in of the first woman in american history elect to national office vice president kamala harris

 do not tell i thing can not change

 here we stand across the potomac from arlington national cemetery where hero who give the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace

 and here we stand just day after a riotous mob think they could use violence to silence the will of the people to stop the work of our democracy and to drive we from this sacred ground

 that do not happen

 it will never happen

 not today

 not tomorrow

 not ever

 to all those who support our campaign i be humble by the faith you have place in we

 to all those who do not support we let i say this hear i out as we move forward take a measure of i and my heart

 and if you still disagree so be it

 that ’ democracy that ’s america the right to dissent peaceably within the guardrail of our republic be perhaps our nation ’s great strength

 yet hear i clearly disagreement must not lead to disunion

 and i pledge this to you i will be a president for all americans

 i will fight as hard for those who do not support i as for those who do

 many century ago saint augustine a saint of my church write that a people be a multitude define by the common object of their love

 what be the common object we love that define we as americans

 i think i know

 opportunity

 security

 liberty

 dignity

 respect

 honor

 and yes the truth

 recent week and month have teach we a painful lesson

 there be truth and there be lie

 lie tell for power and for profit

 and each of we have a duty and responsibility as citizen as americans and especially as leader leader who have pledge to honor our constitution and protect our nation to defend the truth and to defeat the lie

 i understand that many americans view the future with some fear and trepidation

 i understand they worry about their job about take care of their family about what come next

 i get it

 but the answer be not to turn inward to retreat into compete faction distrust those who do not look like you do or worship the way you do or do not get their news from the same source you do

 we must end this uncivil war that pit red against blue rural versus urban conservative versus liberal

 we can do this if we open our soul instead of harden our heart

 if we show a little tolerance and humility

 if we ’re willing to stand in the other person ’s shoe just for a moment
 because here be the thing about life there be no accounting for what fate will deal you

 there be some day when we need a hand

 there be other day when we ’re call on to lend one

 that be how we must be with one another

 and if we be this way our country will be strong more prosperous more ready for the future

 my fellow americans in the work ahead of we we will need each other

 we will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter

 we be enter what may well be the tough and deadly period of the virus

 we must set aside the politic and finally face this pandemic as one nation

 i promise you this as the bible say weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning

 we will get through this together

 the world be watch today

 so here be my message to those beyond our border america have be test and we have come out strong for it

 we will repair our alliance and engage with the world once again

 not to meet yesterday ’s challenge but today ’s and tomorrow ’s

 we will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example

 we will be a strong and trust partner for peace progress and security

 we have be through so much in this nation

 and in my first act as president i would like to ask you to join i in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lose this past year to the pandemic

 to those 400,000 fellow americans mother and father husband and wife son and daughter friend neighbor and co worker

 we will honor they by become the people and nation we know we can and should be

 let we say a silent prayer for those who lose their life for those they leave behind and for our country

 amen

 this be a time of testing

 we face an attack on democracy and on truth

 a rage virus

 grow inequity

 the sting of systemic racism

 a climate in crisis

 america ’s role in the world

 any one of these would be enough to challenge we in profound way

 but the fact be we face they all at once present this nation with the gravest of responsibility

 now we must step up

 all of we

 it be a time for boldness for there be so much to do

 and this be certain

 we will be judge you and i for how we resolve the cascade crisis of our era

 will we rise to the occasion

 will we master this rare and difficult hour

 will we meet our obligation and pass along a new and well world for our child

 i believe we must and i believe we will

 and when we do we will write the next chapter in the american story

 it ’ a story that might sound something like a song that mean a lot to i

 it ’s call american anthem and there be one verse stand out for i

 the work and prayer
 of century have bring we to this day
 what shall be our legacy
 what will our child say
 let i know in my heart
 when my day be through

the president good evening my fellow americans

 tonight i ’d like to talk to you about where we be as we mark one year since everything stop because of this pandemic

 a year ago we be hit with a virus that be meet with silence and spread unchecked

 denial for day week then month that lead to more death more infection more stress and more loneliness

 photo and video from 2019 feel like they be take in another era the last vacation the last birthday with friend the last holiday with the extended family

 while it be different for everyone we all lose something

 a collective suffering a collective sacrifice a year fill with the loss of life and the loss of live for all of we

 but in the loss we see how much there be to gain in appreciation respect and gratitude

 find light in the darkness be a very american thing to do in fact it may be the most american thing we do

 and that ’ what we ’ve do

 we ’ve see frontline and essential worker risk their life sometimes lose they to save and help other researcher and scientist race for a vaccine and so many of you as hemingway write be strong in all the broken place

 i know it ’s be hard i truly know

 as i ’ve tell you before i carry a card in my pocket with the number of americans who have die from covid to date it ’ on the back of my schedule as of now the total death in america 527,726 that ’s more death than in world war one world war two the vietnam war and 9/11 combine

 they be husband wife son and daughter grandparent friend neighbor young and old they leave behind love one unable to truly grieve or to heal even to have a funeral

 but i ’m also think about everyone else who lose this past year to natural cause by cruel fate of accident or other disease they too die alone they too leave love one behind who be hurt badly

 you know you ’ve often hear i say before i talk about the long walk any parent can make be up a short flight of stair to his child ’s bedroom to say i ’m sorry i lose my job we can not be here anymore like my dad tell i when he lose his job in scranton

 so many of you have have to make that same walk this past year

 you lose your job you close your business face eviction homelessness hunger a loss of control and maybe bad of all a loss of hope

 watch a generation of child who may be set back up to a year or more because they ’ve not be in school because of their loss of learn

 it ’ the detail of life that matter most and we ’ve miss those detail

 the big detail and small moment

 weddings birthday graduation all the thing that need to happen but do n’t the first date the family reunion the sunday night ritual

 it ’ all have exact a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of we for we be fundamentally a people who want to be with other to talk to laugh to hug to hold one another

 but this virus have keep we apart

 grandparent have not see their child or grandchild parent have not see their kid kid have not see their friend

 the thing we use to do that always fill we with joy have become the thing we could not do and break our heart

 too often we ’ve turn against one another

 a mask the easy thing to do to save life sometimes it divide we

 state pit against one other instead of work with each other

 vicious hate crime against asian americans who have be attack harass blame and scapegoate at this very moment so many of they our fellow americans they ’re on the frontline of this pandemic try to save life and still still they be force to live in fear for their life just walk down street in america it ’ wrong it ’ un american and it must stop

 look we know what we need to do to beat this virus tell the truth follow the scientist and the science work together put trust and faith in our government to fulfill its most important function which be protect the american people no function more important

 we need to remember the government be not some foreign force in a distant capital no it ’ we all of we we the people for you and i that america thrive when we give our heart when we turn our hand to common purpose and right now my friend we be do just that and i have to say as your president i be grateful to you

 last summer i be in philadelphia and i meet a small business owner a woman i ask she i say what do you need most i ’ll never forget what she say to i she say look i in the eye she say i just want the truth the truth just tell i the truth think of that

 my fellow americans you ’re owe nothing less than the truth

 and for all of you ask when thing will get back to normal here be the truth the only way to get our life back to get our economy back on track be to beat the virus

 you ’ve be hear i say that for while i be run and the last 50 day i ’ve be president but this be one of the most complex operation we ’ve under- ever undertake as a nation in a long time

 that ’ why i ’m use every power i have as president of the united states to put we on a war foot to get the job do it sound like hyperbole but i mean it a war foot

 and thank god we ’re make some real progress now

 on my first full day in office i outline for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic and we have spend every day since attempt to carry it out

 two month ago the country this country do not have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or near all of the american public but soon we will

 we ’ve be work with the vaccine manufacturer pfizer moderna johnson amp johnson to manufacture and purchase hundred of million of dose of these three safe effective vaccine and now at the direction and with the assistance of my administration johnson amp johnson be work together with a competitor merck to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new johnson amp johnson vaccine which be one shot

 in fact just yesterday i announce and i meet with the ceo of both company i announce our plan to buy an additional 100 million dose of johnson amp johnson vaccine these two company competitor have come together for the good of the nation and they should be applaud for it

 it ’ truly a national effort just like we see during world war ii

 now because of all the work we ’ve do we ’ll have enough vaccine supply for all adult in america by the end of may that ’s month ahead of schedule

 and we ’re mobilize thousand of vaccinator to put the vaccine in one ’s arm call on active duty military fema retire doctor and nurse administrator and those to administer the shot

 and we ’ve be create more place to get the shot we ’ve make it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one any one of nearly 10,000 pharmacy across the country just like you get your flu shot

 we ’re also work with governor and mayor in red state and blue state to set up and support nearly 600 federally support vaccination center that administer hundred of thousand of shot per day you can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot get your shot never leave your car and drive home in less than an hour

 we ’ve be send vaccine to hundred of community health center all across america locate in underserved area and we ’ve be deploy and we will deploy more mobile vehicle and pop up clinic to meet you where you live so those who be least able to get the vaccine be able to get it

 we continue to work on make at home testing available

 and we ’ve be focus on serve people in the hard hit community of this pandemic black latino native american and rural community

 so what do all this add up to when i take office 50 day ago only 8 percent of americans after month only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 have get their first vaccination today that number be nearly 65 percent just 14 percent of americans over the age 75 50 day ago have get their first shot today that number be well over 70 percent

 with new guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc that come out on monday it mean simply this million and million of grandparent who go month without be able to hug their grandkid can now do so and the more people who be fully vaccinate the cd cdc will continue to provide guidance on what you can do in the workplace place of worship with friend and as well as travel

 when i come into office you may recall i set a goal that many of you say be kind of way over the top i say i intend to get 100 million shot in people ’s arm in my first 100 day in office tonight i can say we be not only go to meet that goal we ’re go to beat that goal because we ’re actually on track to reach this goal of 100 million shot in arm on my 60th day in office no other country in the world have do this none

 now i want to talk about the next step we ’re think about

 first tonight i ’m announce that i will direct all state tribe and territory to make all adult people 18 and over eligible to be vaccinate no later than may 1

 let i say that again all adult americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than may 1 that ’ much early than expect

 let i be clear that do not mean everyone ’s go to have that shot immediately but it mean you ’ll be able to get in line begin may 1 every adult will be eligible to get their shot

 to do this we ’re go to go from a million shot a day that i promise in december before i be swear in to maintain beat our current pace of two million shot a day outpace the rest of the world

 secondly at the time when every adult be eligible in may we will launch with our partner new tool to make it easy for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot include a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinate and the one near you no more search day and night for an appointment for you and your loved one

 thirdly with the passage of the american rescue plan and i thank again the house and senate for pass it and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teacher and school staff include bus driver we can accelerate the massive nationwide effort to reopen our school safely and meet my goal that i state at the same time about 100 million shot of open the majority of k-8 school in my first 100 day in office this be go to be the number one priority of my new secretary of education miguel cardona

 fourth in the come week we will issue further guidance on what you can and can not do once fully vaccinate to lessen the confusion to keep people safe and encourage more people to get vaccinate

 and finally fifth and maybe most importantly i promise i will do everything in my power i will not relent until we beat this virus but i need you the american people i need you i need every american to do their part and that ’ not hyperbole i need you

 i need you to get vaccinate when it ’ your turn and when you can find an opportunity and to help your family and friend and neighbor get vaccinate as well

 because here ’s the point if we do all this if we do our part if we do this together by july the 4th there ’ a good chance you your family and friend will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbeque and celebrate independence day that do not mean large event with lot of people together but it do mean small group will be able to get together

 after this long hard year that will make this independence day something truly special where we not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to mark our independence from this virus

 but to get there we can not let our guard down

 this fight be far from order from over as i tell the woman in pennsylvania i will tell you the truth

 a july 4th with your loved one be the goal but a goal a lot can happen condition can change

 the scientist have make clear that thing may get bad again as new variant of the virus spread

 and we ’ve get work to do to ensure everyone have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccine

 so my message to you be this listen to dr. fauci one of the most distinguished and trust voice in the world he have assure we the vaccine be safe they undergo rigorous scientific review i know they ’re safe vice president harris and i know they ’re safe that ’s why we get the vaccine publicly in front of camera so for the world to see so you could see we do it the first lady and the second gentleman also get vaccinate

 talk to your family your friend your neighbor the people you know good who ’ve get the vaccine

 we need everyone to get vaccinate we need everyone to keep wash their hand stay socially distance and keep wear the mask as recommend by the cdc

 because even if we devote every resource we have beat this virus and get back to normal depend on national unity

 and national unity be not just how politic and politician vote in washington or what the loud voice say on cable or online unity be what we do together as fellow americans because if we do n’t stay vigilant and the condition change then we may have to reinstate restriction to get back on track and please we do not want to do again

 we ’ve make so much progress this be not the time to let up just as we be emerge from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer be not the time to not stick with the rule

 i ’ll close with this

 we ’ve lose so much over the last year

 we ’ve lose family and friend

 we ’ve lose business and dream we spend year building

 we ’ve lose time time with each other

 and our child have lose so much time with their friend time with their school no graduation ceremony this this spring no graduation from college high school move up ceremony

 you know and there ’ something else we lose

 we lose faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard thing for the american people

 but as i stand here tonight we ’re prove once again something i have say time and time again until they ’re probably tired of hear i say it i say it foreign leader and domestic alike it ’s never ever a good bet to bet against the american people america be come back

 the development manufacture and distribution of the vaccine in record time be a true miracle of science it be one of the most extraordinary achievement any country have ever accomplish

 and we also just see the perseverance rover land on mars stunning image of our dream that be now a reality another example of the extraordinary american ingenuity commitment and belief in science and one another

 and today i sign into law the american rescue plan an historic piece of legislation that deliver immediate relief to million of people it include $ 1,400 in direct rescue check payment that mean a typical family of four earn about $ 110,000 will get check for $ 5,600 deposit if they have direct deposit or in a check a treasury check

 it extend unemployment benefit it help small business it lower healthcare premium for many it provide food and nutrition keep family in their home and it will cut child poverty in this country in half accord to the expert and it fi- and it fund all the step i ’ve just describe to beat the virus and create million of job

 in the come week and month i ’ll be travel along with the first lady the vice president the second gentleman and member of my cabinet to speak directly to you to tell you the truth about how the american rescue plan meet the moment and if it fail at any pa- i will acknowledge that it fail but it will not

 about how after a long dark year one whole year there be hope and light of well day ahead

 if we all do our part this country will be vaccinate soon our economy will be on the mend our kid will be back in school and we will have prove once again that this country can do anything hard thing big thing important thing

 over a year ago no one could ’ve imagine what we be about to go through but now we ’re come through it and it ’ a share experience that bind we together as a nation we be bind together by the loss and the pain of the day that have go by but we ’re also bind together by the hope and the possibility of the day in front of we

 my fervent prayer for our country be that after all we have be through we ’ll come together as one people one nation one america

 i believe we can and we will we ’re seize this moment and history i believe will record we face and overcome one of the tough and darkest period in this nation ’s history darkest we ’ve ever know

 i promise you we ’ll come out strong with a renew faith in ourselves a renew commitment to one another to our community and to our country

 this be the united states of america and there be nothing nothing from the bottom of my heart i believe this there be nothing we can not do when we do it together

 so god bless you all

 and please god give solace to all those people who lose someone

 and may god protect our troop

 thank you for take the time to listen

 i look forward to see you

the president please please sit down thank you thank you good afternoon before i take question i want to make give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 day into office here on vaccination and a few other top priority for the american people

 first on vaccination on december 8th i indicate that i hope to get 100 million shot in people ’s arm in my first 100 day we meet that goal last week by day 58 42 day ahead of schedule

 now today i ’m set a second goal and that be we will by my 100th day in office have administer 200 million shot in people ’s arm that ’ right 200 million shot in 100 day

 i know it ’ ambitious twice our original goal but no other country in the world have even come close not even close to what we be do and i believe we can do it

 and today we ’ve make a historic investment in reach the hard hit and the most vulnerable community the high risk community as a consequence of the virus by invest an addition $ 10 billion in be able to reach they

 i also set a goal before i take office of get a majority of school in k through 8 fully open in the first 100 day now thank to the enormous amount of work do by our administration educator parent local state education official and leader a recent department of education department survey show that nearly half of the k through-8 school be open now full time five day a week for in person learn not yet a majority but we ’re really close and i believe in the 35 day leave to go we ’ll meet that goal as well

 as of yesterday more than 100 million payment of $ 1,400 have go into people ’s bank account that ’ real money in people ’s pocket bring relief instantly almost and million more will be get their money very soon

 one final note since we pass the american rescue plan we ’re start to see new sign of hope in our economy since it be pass a majority a majority of economic forecaster have significantly increase their projection on the economic growth that ’s go to take place this year they ’re now project it will exceed 6 percent a 6 percent growth in gdp

 and just this morning we learn that the number of people file for weekly unemployment insurance fall by nearly 100,000 person that ’ the first time in a year the number have fall below the pre pandemic high

 so there be still too many americans out of work too many family hurt and we still have a lot of work to do

 but i can say to you the american people help be here and hope be on the way

 now i ’ll be happy to take your question

 zeke the associated press

 q   thank you mr. president you mention your progress on covid-19 i ’d like to ask you about some of the other issue face your presidency one of the define challenge you face in the come month be how to deliver on your promise to americans on issue like immigration reform gun control voting right climate change all of those right now be face stiff united opposition from republicans on capitol hill how far be you willing to go to achieve those promise that you make to the american people

 the president well i ’m go to look when i take office i decide that it be a fairly basic simple proposition and that be i get elect to solve problem and the most urgent problem face the american people i state from the outset be covid-19 and the economic dislocation for million and million of americans and so that ’ why i put all my focus in the beginning there be a lot of problem put all my focus on deal with those particular problem

 and the other problem we ’re talk about from immigration to gun and the other thing you mention be long term problem they ’ve be around a long time and what we ’re go to be able to do god willing be now begin one at a time to focus on those as well and whether it ’ immigration or gun or a number of other problem that face the country

 but the fundamental problem be get people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wonder whether they lose their health insurance whether they ’re go to lose a family member whether they ’re go to be in a position where they ’re not go to be they ’re go to lose their home because they can not pay their mortgage or that million of people be go to get throw out of their home because of the inability to to pay their rent

 so we ’re go to move on these one at a time try to do as many simultaneously as we can but that ’s the reason why i focus as i have

 and here ’ the deal i think my republican colleague be go to have to determine whether or not we want to work together or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed be to be to just decide to divide the country continue the politic of division but i ’m not go to do that i ’m just go to move forward and take these thing as they come

 q   and just to to follow up mr. president can your presidency be a success if you can not make progress on those four challenge climate change immigration reform gun control voting right

 the president well i plan on make progress on all of they but that ’s go to be for the american people to decide

 i think you know i doubt whether maybe you do maybe other do i think many of you think there be no possibility of my get the plan i get pass pass without any republican vote a pretty big deal it get pass grow the economy people ’s life be change

 so let ’s see what happen all i know i ’ve be hire to solve problem to solve problem not create division

 okay how about yamiche

 q   thank so much mr. president you ’ve say over and over again that immigrant should not come to this country right now this be n’t the time to come that message be not be receive instead the perception of you that get you elect as a moral decent man be the reason why a lot of immigrant be come to this country and entrust you with unaccompanied minor

 how do you resolve that tension and how be you choose which family can stay and which can go give the fact that even though with title 42 there be some family that be stay and be there a timeline for when we will not be see these overcrowded facility with run by cpb sic when it come to unaccompanied minor

 the president well look i guess i should be flatter people be come because i ’m the nice guy that ’s the reason why it ’s happen that i ’m a decent man or however it ’s phrase that you know that ’ why they ’re come because they know biden be a good guy

 the truth of the matter be nothing have change as many people come 28 percent increase in child to the border in my administration 31 percent in the last year of in 2019 before the pandemic in the trump administration it happen every single solitary year there be a significant increase in the number of people come to the border in the winter month of january february march that happen every year

 in addition to that there be a and nobody and by the way do anybody suggest that there be a 31 percent increase under trump because he be a nice guy and he be do good thing at the border that ’s not the reason they ’re come

 the reason they ’re come be that it ’ the time they can travel with the least likelihood of die on the way because of the heat in the desert number one number two they ’re come because of the circumstance in country in country

 the way to deal with this problem and i start to deal with it back when i be a united states senator i mean vice president put together a bipartisan plan of over $ 700 million to deal with the root cause of why people be leave

 what do trump do he eliminate that funding he do not use it he do not do it and in addition to that what he do he dismantle all the element that exist to deal with what have be a problem and and have be continue to be a problem for a long time he in fact shut down the the number of bed available he do not fund hhs to get people to get the child out of those those border patrol facility where they should not be and not suppose to be more than a few day a little while but he dismantle all of that

 and so what we ’re do now be attempt to rebuild rebuild the system that can accommodate the what be happen today and i like to think it ’s because i ’m a nice guy but it ’ not it ’s because of what ’s happen every year

 let i say one other thing on this if you take a look at the number of people who be come the vast majority the overwhelming majority of people come to the border and crossing be be send back be be send back thousand ten of thousand of people who be who be over 18 year of age and single people one at a time come have be send back send home

 we ’re send back the vast majority of the family that be come we ’re try to work out now with mexico their willingness to take more of those family back but we that ’ what ’s happen they ’re not get across the border

 and those who be come across the border who be unaccompanied child we ’re move rapidly to try to put in place what be dismantle as i say for example of all the child who be come across the border over 70 percent be either 16 or 17 year old we ’re not talk about people rip baby from mother arm or little three year old stand on the border less than i think it ’ one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young

 so what we ’re do be we ’re provide for the space again to be able to get these kid out of the border patrol facility which no child no one should be in any long than 72 hour

 and today i go to for example i use all the resource available to i go to the defense department and and the secretary of defense have just make available fort bliss 5,000 bed be make easily available five thousand bed on the texas border

 so we ’re build back up the capacity that should have be maintain and build upon that trump dismantle it ’s go to take time

 and the other thing we ’re do i might add be i give you too long an answer because if you do not want the detail

 q   inaudible

 the president no no but i mean i do not know how much detail you want about immigration maybe i ’ll stop there and fin-

 q   my follow up question be one if you could talk a little bit about which family why they ’re be allow to stay the family that be be allow to stay why they ’re be allow to stay

 and in addition to that when it come to the filibuster which be what zeke be ask about there ’s immigration be a big issue of course when it relate to the filibuster but there ’s also republicans who be pass bill after bill try to restrict voting right chuck schumer be call it an existential threat to democracy why not back a filibuster rule that at least get around issue include voting right or immigration

 jim clyburn someone who of course who you know very well have back the idea of a filibuster rule when it come to civil right and voting right

 the president well look i ’m go to deal with all of those problem the question be the priority as they come and land on my plate

 let ’s go to the first question you ask the first of the second question you ask and that be what about deal with family why be not some not go back because mexico be refuse to take they back they ’re say they will not take they back not all of they

 we ’re in negotiation with the president of mexico i think we ’re go to see that change they should all be go back all be go back the only people we ’re not go to let sit there on the other side of the rio grande by themselves with no help be child

 and what we ’re do there and it ’ an important point to understand i know you understand i do n’t mean to say it that way an important point to focus on the vast majority of people under the age of 18 come to united states come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the united states a mother a father a close relative a grandmom or a grandpop

 what be happen before be it be take literally week and week and maybe even month before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really be someone there well we ’ve set up a system now where within 24 hour there ’ a phone call make as that person or that child cross the border and then a verification system be be put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that be a trafficker be call or that be actually a mom a dad and/or a close relative they ’re establish that right off the bat

 if it in fact be mom or dad dad say to take the extreme case i get a birth certificate then guess what we ’re get that kid directly to that parent immediately

 and so that ’s go to reduce significantly there ’ two way to reduce child population in circumstance that be not acceptable like be hold at a border patrol station one be to get they to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be hold the second way to do it be put they in a health and human services facility that we ’re occupy now both license bed around the country that exist as well as for example federal resource like fort bliss to get they safely in a place where they can be take care of while their fate be determine

 q   and can you answer the filibuster inaudible

 the president filibuster filibuster you know with regard to the filibuster i believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that exist just when i come to the united states senate 120 year ago and that be that it use to be require for the filibuster and i have a card on this i be go to give you the statistic but you probably know they that it use to be that that from between 1917 to 1971 the filibuster exist there be a total of 58 motion to break a filibuster that whole time last year alone there be five time that many so it ’s be abuse in a gigantic way

 and for example it use to be you have to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapse and guess what people get tired of talk and tired of collapse filibuster break down and we be able to break the filibuster get a quorum and vote

 so i strongly support move in that direction in addition to have an open mind about deal with certain thing that be be just elemental to the functioning of our democracy like the right to vote like the basic right to vote we ’ve amend the filibuster in the past

 but here ’ the deal as you observe i ’m a fairly practical guy i want to get thing do i want to get they do consistent with what we promise the american people and in order to do that in a 50 50 senate we ’ve get to get to the place where i get 50 vote so that the vice president of the united states can break the tie or i get 51 vote without she

 and so i ’m go to say something outrageous i have never be particularly poor at calculate how to get thing do in the united states senate so the good way to get something do if you if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to anyway

 i we ’re go to get a lot do and if we have to if there ’s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster then we ’ll have to go beyond what i ’m talk about

 okay hang on sorry oh seung min ms. kim

 q   thank you mr. president to follow up on the filibuster so do you believe it should take 60 vote to end a filibuster on legislation or 51

 the president laughs if we could end it with 51 we would have no problem you ’re go to have to the exist rule it ’s go to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allow 50 vote to end the filibuster the existence of a filibuster

 but it ’ not my expertise in what the parliamentary rule and how to get there be but our preoccupation with the filibuster be totally legitimate but in the meantime we get a lot we can do while we ’re talk about what we ’re go to do about the filibuster

 let i get here okay cecilia vega

 q   i ’d like to circle back to immigration please you just list the reason that people be come talk about in country problem say that it happen every year you blame the last administration sir i just get back last night from a reporting trip to the border where i meet nine year old yossell who walk here from honduras by himself along with another little boy he have that phone number on he

 the president astounding

 q   and we be able to call his family his mother say that she send her son to this country because she believe that you be not deport unaccompanied minor like her son that ’s why she send he alone from honduras

 so sir you blame the last administration but be your message in say that these child be and will be allow to stay in this country and work their way through this process encourage family like yossell say to come

 the president well look the idea that i ’m go to say which i would never do if an unaccompanied child end up at the border we ’re just go to let he starve to death and stay on the other side no previous administration do that either except trump i ’m not go to do it i ’m not go to do it

 that ’ why i ’ve ask the vice president of the united states yesterday to be the lead person on deal with focus on the fundamental reason why people leave honduras guatemala and el salvador in the first place it ’s because of earthquake flood it ’ because of lack of food it ’s because of gang violence it ’s because of a whole range of thing

 that when i be vice president and have the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied child i be able to get it slow up significantly by work with the head of state of those community to do thing like in one of the major city the reason people be leave be they could not walk in the street because they be get their kid be getting beat up or shoot or in gang violence

 well what i be able to do be not give money to the head of state because so many be corrupt but i be able to say okay you need light in the street to change thing i ’ll put the lighting in we get a contractor we get the type of lighting we pay directly to the contractor it do not go through the government and violent crime significantly be reduce in that city few people seek to leave

 when this hurricane occur two hurricane instead of we go down and help in a major way so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they do not have housing or water or sustenance we do nothing we ’re go to do a lot in our administration we ’re go to be spend that 700 plus million dollar a year to change the life and circumstance of why people leave in the first place

 that mother do not sit around with on the kitchen table and say you know i get a great idea the way i ’m go to make sure my son get take care of be i ’m go to put a how old be he or she

 q   he ’ he ’ nine i also meet a 10 year old

 the president a nine year old i ’m go to send he on a thousand mile journey across the desert and up to the united states because i know joe biden be a nice guy and he ’ll take care of he

 what a desperate act to have to take the circumstance must be horrible so we can do something about that that ’ what the vice president be go to be do what i do when president obama ask i to come and deal i be in i be in turkey at the time and he say you got to come home and take care of this so we put together a plan and it have an impact

 and so the question here be whether how we go ahead and do this what we do there ’ no easy answer

 q   a quick follow if i may   do you want to see these unaccompanied minor stay in this country or should they be deport eventually

 the president well the judgment have to be make whether or not and in this young man ’s case he have a mom at home there ’ an overwhelming reason why he ’d be put in a plane and fly back to his mom

 q   final follow sir you mention circumstance that must be horrific the customs and border protection facility in donna texas i be there be at 1,556 percent capacity

 the president yep

 q   right now with mostly unaccompanied minor there be kid that be sleep on floor they be pack into these pod i ’ve speak to lawyer who say that they some of these child have not see the sun in day what ’s your reaction what be your reaction to these image that have come out from that particular facility be what ’s happen inside acceptable to you and when be this go to be fix

 the president be that ’s a serious question right

 be it acceptable to i come on that ’s why we ’re go to be move a thousand of those kid out quickly that ’s why i get fort bliss open up that ’s why i ’ve be work from the moment this start to happen to try to find additional access for child to be able to safely not just child but particularly child to be able to safely be house while we follow through on the rest of what ’s happen

 that be totally unacceptable

 q   thank you mr. president i want to ask you about afghanistan you face a may 1st deadline for the withdrawal of u.s. troop from that country as a candidate in foreign affair you write that it be past time to end these forever war can you commit to the american people that by may 2nd the u.s. will no long have force in afghanistan

 the president the answer be that it ’s go to be hard to meet the may 1 deadline just in term of tactical reason it ’ hard to get those troop out so what we ’ve be do what i ’ve be do and what secretary blinken have be do have be we ’ve be meet with our ally those other nation that have nato allies who have troop in afghanistan as well and if we leave we ’re go to do so in a safe and orderly way

 we ’re in consultation i say with our ally and partner in how to proceed and secretary blinken be meet in brussels this week with our nato allies particularly those who have force there

 but it be not my intention to stay there for a long time but the question be how and in what circumstance do we meet that agreement that be make by president trump to leave under a deal that look like it ’s not be able to be work out to begin with how be that do but we be not stay a long time

 q   you just say if we leave do you think it ’ possible that we

 the president we will leave the question be when we leave

 q   do you sorry do you believe though it ’ possible we could have troop there next year

 the president i i can not picture that be the case

 q   thank you very much mr. president give the condition that be just lay out at the migrant facility at the u.s. border will you commit to allow journalist to have access to the facility that be overcrowded move forward

 the president i will commit when my plan very shortly be underway to let you have access to not just they but to other facility as well

 q   how soon will journalist be able to have access to the facility we ’ve obviously be allow to be inside one but we have not see the facility in which child be pack together to really give the american people a chance to see that will you commit to transparency on this issue mr. president

 the president i will commit to transparency and as soon as i be in a position to be able to implement what we be do right now

 and one of the reason i have not go down i have all my my chief folk have go down be i do not want to become the issue i do not want to be you know bring all of the secret service and everybody with i to get in the way so this be be set up and you ’ll have full access to everything once we get this thing move

 q   okay and just to be clear how soon will that be mr. president

 the president i do not know to be clear

 q   okay and do you bear responsibility for everything that ’s happen at the border now i hear you talk a lot about the past administration you decide to roll back some of those policy do you move too quickly to roll back inaudible policy

 the president to roll back what i ’m sorry

 q   do you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive order of your predecessor

 the president first of all all the policy that be underway be not help at all do not slow up the amount of immigration and there ’ many people come

 and roll back the policy of separate child from from their mother i make no apology for that roll back the policy of remain in mexico sit on the edge of the rio grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and i make no apology for that

 i make no apology for end program that do not exist before trump become president that have an incredibly negative impact on the law international law as well as on human dignity and so i make no apology for that

 q   if i could just ask you about foreign policy mr. president overnight we learn that north korea test two ballistic missile what if any action will you take and what be your red line on north korea

 the president let i say that number one u.n. resolution 1718 be violate by those particular missile that be test number one we ’re consult with our ally and partner and there will be response if they choose to escalate we will respond accordingly

 but i ’m also prepared for some form of diplomacy but it have to be condition upon the end result of denuclearization so that ’ what we ’re do right now consult with our ally

 q   just a very quick follow up

 the president you ’ve only get another hour now okay

 q   diplomacy can you define what you mean and former president obama warn the incoming president trump that north korea be the top foreign policy issue that he be watch be that how you assess the crisis in north korea

 the president yes

 okay hang on a second here kristen nancy cbs

 q   thank you very much mr. president i want to go back to voting right and as yamiche mention republican legislature across the country be work to pass bill that would restrict voting particularly democrats fear impact minority voter and young voter the very people who help to get you elect in november

 be you worried that if you do not manage to pass voting right legislation that your party be go to lose seat and possibly lose control of the house and the senate in 2022

 the president what i ’m worried about be how un american this whole initiative be it ’ sick it ’ sick decide in some state that you can not bring water to people stand in line wait to vote decide that you ’re go to end voting at five o’clock when work people be just get off work decide that there will be no absentee ballot under the most rigid circumstance

 it ’s all design and i ’m go to spend my time do three thing one try to figure out how to pass the legislation pass by the house number one number two educate the american public the republican voter i know find this despicable republican voter the folk out in outside this white house i ’m not talk about the elect official i ’m talk about voter voter

 and so i be convinced that we ’ll be able to stop this because it be the most pernicious thing this make jim crow look like jim eagle i mean this be gigantic what they ’re try to do and it can not be sustain

 i ’m go to do everything in my power along with my friend in the house and the senate to keep that from from become the law

 q   be there anything else you can do about it besides pass legislation

 the president the answer be yes but i ’m not go to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now

 q   and then on a relate note have you decide whether you be go to run for reelection in 2024 you have n’t set up a reelection campaign yet as your predecessor have by this time

 the president laughs my predecessor need do sic need to my predecessor oh god i miss he

 q   have you have you

 the president no the answer be yes my plan be to run for reelection that ’ my expectation

 q   and then on on one other note on bipartisanship your old friend mitch mcconnell say you have only speak to each other once since you take office and that you have move far leave since take office do you see it the same way he do have you reject bipartisanship

 the president no i have n’t at all i ’ve be meet when be the last time a president invite the opposite party down at least a half a dozen time to talk about issue everything from how we work we ’re work with a group of 20 member of the senate right now and house on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chip and how we get ahead of the game how we can work together and we ’re work together on a bunch of thing

 but look i know mitch well mitch know i well i would expect mitch to say exactly what he say but this be a matter of make sure that i would like republican elect republican support but what i know i have now be that i have electoral support from republican voter republican voter agree with what i ’m do

 and so unless mitch say the last thing i do be the last piece of legislation be so far left well then he ought to a look at his party over 50 percent of they must be over that edge as well because they support what i do

 okay where be i here let i see kaitlan

 q   thank you very much mr. president i have a question for you but first i ’d like to follow up on a question from yamiche and that ’s on the filibuster

 the president that count as a question but go ahead

 q   okay i ’ll make it quick it ’ a quick question

 the president no no you can

 q   regard the filibuster at john lewis ’s funeral president barack obama say he believe the filibuster be a relic of the jim crow era do you agree

 the president yes

 q   and if not why not abolish it if it ’ a relic of the jim crow era

 the president successful electoral politic be the art of the possible let ’s figure out how we can get this do and move in the direction of significantly change the abuse of even the filibuster rule first it ’s be abuse from the time it come into being by an extreme way in the last 20 year let ’s deal with the abuse first

 q   it sound like you ’re move close to eliminate the filibuster be that correct

 the president i answer your question

 q   you also just make some news by say that you be go to run for reelection

 the president i say that be my expectation

 q   so be that a yes that you be run for reelection

 the president look i i do not know where you guy come from man i ’ve never be able to travel i ’m a great respecter of fate i ’ve never be able to plan four and half three and a half year ahead for certain

 q   and if you do

 the president it

 q   if you do run will vice president harris be on your ticket

 the president i would fully expect that to be the case she ’s do a great job she ’ a great partner she ’ a great partner

 q   and do you believe you ’ll be run against former president trump

 the president oh come on i do not even think about i do n’t i have no idea i have no idea if there will be a republican party do you i know you do not have to answer my question but i mean you know do you

 i mean look this be the way i view thing i ’ve become a great respecter of fate in my life i set a goal that ’s in front of i to get thing do for the people i care most about which be hardworke decent american people who be get really have it stick to they

 i want to change the paradigm i want to change the paradigm we start to reward work not just wealth i want to change the paradigm

 if you notice do not you find it kind of interesting that my republican friend be worried about that the cost and the taxis that have to be have if there be any tax to be have as they talk about it in deal with the the act that we just pass which put money in people ’s pocket ordinary people

 do you hear they complain when they pass close to a $ 2 trillion trump tax cut 83 percent go to the top 1 percent do you hear they talk about that all i love the fact that they ’ve find this whole idea of concern about the federal budget it ’ kind of amazing

 when the federal budget be save people ’s life they do not think it ’ such a good idea when the federal budget be feather the nest of the wealthy americans 90 of the fortune 500 company make billion of dollar not pay a cent in taxis reduce taxis to the point that people who be make you know if you ’re a husband and wife a schoolteacher and a cop you ’re pay at a high rate than the average person make a billion dollar a year be something be wrong their newfound concern

 i ’m concerned look i mean what i say when i run and a lot of you still think i ’m wrong and i respect that i say i ’m run for three reason to restore the soul dignity honor honesty transparency to the american political system two to rebuild the backbone of this country the middle class hardworke people and people struggle to get in the middle class they build america and union build they the third reason i say i be run be to unite the country and generically speak all of you say no you can not do that well i ’ve not be able to unite the congress but i ’ve be unite the country base on the polling datum we have to come together we have to

 so from my perspective you know it ’ a to i it ’ about just you know get out there put one foot in front of the other and just try to make thing well for people just hardworke people people get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kid to be able have a little bit of breathing room be able to have make sure that they go to bed not stare at the ceiling like my dad wonder whether since he do not have health insurance what happen if mom get sick or he get sick these be basic thing basic thing

 and i ’m of the view that the vast majority of people include register republicans by and large share that that same that same view that same sense of what be you know what ’ appropriate

 justin justin sink bloomberg

 q   thank mr. president i want to ask about your relationship with china now that you ’ve be in office for a couple month there ’ obviously the meeting in alaska that be a little theatrical and there ’ the continue human right abuse

 so today i ’m wonder be you more likely than you be when you come into office to maintain tariff on china be you consider ban import of force labor product and would you consider cut off u.s. investment or chinese access to international payment system

 the president well look they ’re each specifically legitimate question but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with china really be about

 i ’ve know xi jinping for a long time allegedly by the time i leave office as vice president i have spend more time with xi jinping than any world leader have because president obama and the chinese president hu decide we should get to know one another since it be inappropriate for the president of the united states to spend time with the vice president of another country but it be obvious he be go to become the new leader of china

 so i spend hour upon hour with he alone with an interpreter my interpreter and his go into great detail he be very very straightforward do not have a democratic with a small d bone in his body but he ’ a smart smart guy he ’ one of the guy like putin who think that autocracy be the wave of the future and democracy can not function in an ever an ever complex world

 so when i be elect and he call to congratulate i i think to the surprise of the china expert who be his people be on call as well as mine listen we have a two hour conversation for two hour

 and we make several thing clear to one another i make it clear to he again what i ’ve tell he in person on several occasion that we ’re not look for confrontation although we know there will be steep steep competition

 two that we ’ll have strong competition but we ’ll insist that china play by the international rule fair competition fair practice fair trade

 thirdly in order to compete effectively i indicate that we ’re go to deal with china effectively and we ’re go to need three thing to do that i tell he our people first we ’re go to invest in american worker and american science i say that all through the campaign and i say it again and we ’re and i ’m set up my administration to be able to do that which be that you know back in the 60 we use to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire gdp in pure research and investment in science today it ’ 0.7 percent i ’m go to change that we ’re go to change that

 the future lie in who can in fact own the future as it relate to technology quantum computing a whole range of thing include in medical field and so what i ’m go to do be make sure we invest close to 2 percent

 one of the reason why i ’ve set up the the pab pcast the president ’s board with scientist and the like again be we ’re go to invest in medical research cancer alzheimer ’s diabetes the thing industry of the future artificial intelligence quantum computing biotech and we ’re go to make real investment china be out invest we by a longshot because their plan be to own that future

 the third the second thing we ’re go to do be we ’re go to reestablish our alliance and i ’ve be very clear with he it ’ not anti chinese and we ’ve talk about it

 i want to make sure that for example later today after this as a matter of fact shortly after this which be fine we ’ve be go close to an hour i ’m happy to go long but one of the thing that i ’m go to be do i ’m go to be speak with the 27 head of state in europe and very shortly i think within the next hour or so i do not know the exact time

 and early this month and apparently it get the chinese ’s attention that ’s not why i do it i meet with our ally and how we ’re go to hold china accountable in the region australia india japan and the united states the so call quad because we have to have democracy work together

 before too long i ’m go to have i ’m go to invite an alliance of democracy to come here to discuss the future and so we ’re go to make it clear that in order to deal with these thing we be go to hold china accountable to follow the rule to follow the rule whether it relate to the south china sea or the north china sea or their agreement make on taiwan or a whole range of other thing

 and the third thing and the thing that i admire about deal with xi be he understand he make no pretense about not understand what i ’m say any more than i do he i point out to he no leader can be sustain in his position or her position unless they represent the value of the country and i say as and mr. president as i ’ve tell you before americans value the notion of freedom america value human right we do not always live up to our expectation but it ’ a value system we be found on that principle and as long as you and your country continue to so blatantly violate human right we ’re go to continue in an unrelenting way to call to the attention of the world and make it clear make it clear what ’s happen

 and he understand that i make it clear that no american president at least one do but no american president ever back down from speak out of what ’s happen to the uighur what ’s happen in hong kong what ’s happen in country

 that ’s who we be the moment a president walk away from that as the last one do be the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world it ’ who we be

 so i see stiff competition with china china have an overall goal and i do not criticize they for the goal but they have an overall goal to become the lead country in the world the wealthy country in the world and the most powerful country in the world that ’s not go to happen on my watch because the united states be go to continue to grow and expand

 q   all right just to follow up on the meeting of democracy be that where you expect in a multilateral way to make these decision about sanction or

 the president no that ’s not where i make the decision that ’s where i make sure we ’re all on the same page all on the same page look i predict to you your child or grandchild be go to be do their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeed autocracy or democracy because that be what be at stake not just with china

 look around the world we ’re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence will there be middle class how will people adjust to these significant change in science and technology and the environment how will they do that and be democracy equip because all the people get to speak to compete

 it be clear absolutely clear and most of the scholar i deal with at penn agree with i around the country that this be a battle between the utility of democracy in the 21st century and autocracy

 if you notice you do not have russia talk about communism anymore it ’ about an autocracy demand decision make by a leader of a country that ’ what ’s at stake here we ’ve get to prove democracy work

 q   and mr. president sorry i know you have not have a chance to address the tragedy in georgia and colorado you have say to stay tuned for action that you might take on gun control wonder if you ’ve make a decision either about send the manufacturer liability bill that you have promise on day one to capitol hill or executive action like go after ghost gun or give money to city and state to battle gun control

 the president all the above it ’ a matter of timing

 as you ’ve all observe successful president well than i have be successful in large part because they know how to time what they ’re do order it decide and prioritize what need to be do

 the next major initiative be and i ’ll be announce it friday in pittsburgh in detail be to rebuild the infrastructure both physical and technological infrastructure in this country so that we can compete and create significant number of really good pay job really good pay job

 and some of you have be around long enough to know that use to be a great republican goal and initiative i still think the majority of the american people do not like the fact that we be now rank what 85th in the world in infrastructure

 i mean look the future rest on whether or not we have the good airport that be go to accommodate air travel port that you can get in and out of quickly so business decide

 some of you if you be ever local reporter and you find your governor or mayor try to attract business to your community what ’s the first thing that business ask what ’s the close access to access to an interstate highway how far be i from a freight rail be the water be the water available be there enough water available for i to conduct my business all the thing that relate to infrastructure

 we have somewhere i ask the staff to write it down for i and they do not for this but for a long discussion we have somewhere in term of infrastructure we have we rank 13th globally in infrastructure china be invest three time more in infrastructure than the united states be

 bridge more than one third of our bridge 231,000 of they need repair some be physical safety risk or preservation work one in five mile of our highway and major road be in poor condition that ’s 186,000 mile of highway aviation 20 percent of all flight 20 percent of all flight be n’t on time result in 1.5 million hour lose in production six to ten million home in america still have lead pipe service their water line we have over 100,000 wellhead that be not cap leak methane

 what be we do and by the way we can put as many pipefitter and miner and to work cap those well at the same price that they would charge to dig those well

 so i i just find it frustrated frustrating to talk about

 last point i ’ll make on the infrastructure and i apologize for spend more time on it but be that if you think about it it ’ the place where we will be able to significantly increase american productivity at the same time provide really good job for people but we can not build back to what they use to be we have to build the environment have global warming have already do significant damage

 the road that use to be above the water level do not have to worry about where the drainage ditch be now you get to rebuild they three foot high because it ’s not go to go back to what it be before it will only get bad unless we stop it

 there ’ so much we can do look at all of the school in america most of you live in the washington area now but in your hometown i do not know where you ’re all from how many school where the kid can not drink the water out of the fountain how many school be still in the position where there ’s asbestos how many school in america we ’re send our kid to do not have adequate ventilation how many home building office complex be waste billion of barrel of oil over time because they can not hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leak through the window that be so porous and the connection it ’ amazing

 so there ’s so much we can do that ’s good stuff make people healthy and create good job

 and i think that i get one more question here janet from univision

 q   thank you mr. president we too have be report at the border and just like cecilia we run into a pair of sibling who come in on monday who be detain by cbp have the phone number for their mother who live in the u.s.   we have contact the mother that ’ the only way they know her kid be here because cbp today thursday have not contact that mother so when can we expect your promise of thing get well with contact and expediency and processing

 the president well they ’re already get well but they ’re go to get real they ’ll get a whole hell of lot well real quick or we ’re go to hear of some people leave okay

 we can get this do we ’re go to get it do

 i have a long meeting with the entire team and several cabinet level officer the other night we ’re go to be move within the next within the next week over 100,000 i mean 1,000 people out of the border patrol into safe secure bed and facility we ’re go to significantly ramp up we ’re already out there contact everyone from get some of the employee at hhs and there ’ a lot of they do other thing and move they into make those call we ’re in a we ’re in the process of rearrange and provide for the personnel need to get that do

 but i admire the fact that you be down there you ’re make the call yourself it ’ real

 the next thing that have to happen though as you well know have to happen there have to be some certitude that this be the actually mom dad or whomever and there ’ way to do that there ’s way to do that a little bit like determine whether or not you get the right code for your credit card you know what be your dog ’s name kind of a thing i ’m be a bit facetious but not really and also seek hard datum from dna to to birth certificate which take long

 so i want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible

 q   as you well know treat the root cau- cause in latin america do not change thing overnight how do you realistically and physically keep these family from come to the u.s. when thing will not get well in their country right away

 the president well i can not guarantee that but i know you know that old thing the journey of 1,000 mile start with the first step

 you know as well as i do you cover it you have serious it ’s not like somebody at a sit hand hewn table in guatemala i mean in in somewhere in mexico or in guadalupe say i get a great idea let ’s sell everything we have give it to a coyote have he take our kid across the border and into a desert where they do not speak the language will not that be fun let ’s go that ’ not how it happen people do not want to leave

 when my great grandfather get on a coffin ship in the irish sea expectation be be he go to live long enough on that ship to get to the united states of america but they leave because of what the brits have be do they be in real real trouble they do not want to leave but they have no choice so you get we can n’t i can not guarantee we ’re go to solve everything but i can guarantee we can make everything well we can make it well we can change the life of so many people

 and the other thing i want to point out to you and i hope you point out i realize it ’ much more heart wrench and it be to deal with a five- and six- and seven year old but you go down there and you see the vast majority of these child 70 percent be 16 year old 17 year old and mostly male do not make it that do not make it good bad or indifferent but the idea that we have ten of thousand of kid in these god awful facility that be really little baby cry all night and there ’s some that ’ true that ’s why we get to act

 and yesterday i ask my team both the director of the two agency as well as other i ask they what would they in fact and i ask their opinion because they ’re the expert but i say focus on the most vulnerable immediately

 but there ’s no reason why in the next month as people cross the border that phone call can not be make in the first 48 hour and begin

 q   if i may ask one last question have you have any talk with senate republicans who be threaten this administration with not consider the immigration legislation that be pass in the house until the situation at the border have be resolve

 the president no because i know they have to posture for a while they sort of get to get it out of their system this be a but i ’m ready to work with any republican who want to help solve the problem and make the situation well

 but folk i ’m go thank you very very much i appreciate it thank you

the president thank you applause inaudible mike ask i and i say to bobby my good friend he ask i back there he say do you ever get nervous and i he say because i get up this morning make breakfast for my kid i ’ve get to introduce the president

 and what i say to you mike you do a heck of a job but i ’d get nervous if i have to get up in the middle of the night climb up a telephone pole replace in the middle of a storm a connection that knock out everybody ’s electricity and put a transformer in that ’s what would make i nervous so what you do be really good i could not do what you do pal i could not do what you do

 and i want to and it ’ true mike you ’re a union guy i too i get in trouble but i do not make any apology for it i ’m a union guy i support union union build the middle class it ’ about time they start to get a piece of the action

 to all my colleague applause to the county executives to the mayor to everyone who ’s here i want to say thank you thank you congressman for the passport into your district and i appreciate be here i ’m honor to be with you

 two year ago i begin my campaign here in pittsburgh say i be run to rebuild the backbone of america and today i return as your president to lay out the vision of how i believe we do that rebuild the backbone of america

 it ’ a vision not see through the eye of wall street or washington but through the eye of hardworke people like the people i grow up with people like mike and his union family union worker in this carpenters training center people like the folk i grow up with in scranton and claymont delaware

 people who get up every day work hard raise their family pay their taxis serve their country and volunteer for their community and just look for a little bit of breathing room just a little bit of light

 ordinary americans do extraordinary thing the people who break their neck every day for their family and the country they love a country that in fact which on the day i be elect be in extreme distress with a virus on a deadly rampage that have now kill four thou- excuse i five hundred i carry it in my pocket every day i have the list of exactly how many have die 547,296 americans dead from the virus more than all the people kill in world war one world war two the vietnam war 9/11 547,296 americans and an economy that leave million out of work and create so much anxiety

 that ’ why i move so quickly to pass the american rescue plan with the help of my friend here in the congress i really mean that it do not pass by a whole lot but with the leadership of conor and bobby and mayor just you get it do because it be an emergency we need to act to save job to save business and to save life and that ’ what we do

 we ’re begin to see the result we ’re on our way to having give 200 million vaccination shot in the first 100 day of my presidency when i say i ’d get 100 million do people think it be a significant exaggeration we ’re go to get 200 million do twice the original goal because of all the help of all of you

 lead economist be now predict our economy will grow 6 percent this year that ’ a rate we have n’t see in year and year we can cut child poverty in half this year with the american rescue plan we ’re meet immediate emergency now it ’ time to rebuild

 even before the crisis we ’re now face those at the very top in america be do very well which be fine they be do great but everyone else be fall behind the pandemic only make the division so much bad and more obvious million of americans lose their job last year while the wealthy 1 percent of americans see their net worth increase by $ 4 trillion it just go to show you how distorted and unfair our economy have become it be not always this way

 well it ’ time to change that i ’d note parenthetically that i get criticize for give tax break to middle class and poor folk this last time i do not hear that cry hue and cry when we be do the same thing when trump ’s tax bill pass and 83 percent of the money go to the top 1 percent

 you know this be not to target those who ’ve make it not to seek retribution this be about open opportunity for everybody else and here ’ the truth we all will do well when we all do well it ’ time to build our economy from the bottom up and from the middle out not the top down it have not work very well for the economy overall it have not work because wall street do not build this country you the great middle class build this country and union build the middle class applause

 and it ’ time in this time we ’ll rebuild the middle class we ’re go to bring everybody along regardless of your background your color your religion inaudible everybody get to come along

 so today i ’m propose a plan for the nation that reward work not just reward wealth it build a fair economy that give everybody a chance to succeed and it ’s go to create the strong most resilient innovative economy in the world it ’ not a plan that tinker around the edge it ’ a once in a generation investment in america unlike anything we ’ve see or do since we build the interstate highway system and the space race decade ago

 in fact it ’ the large american job investment since world war two it will create million of job good pay job it will grow the economy make we more competitive around the world promote our national security interest and put we in a position to win the global competition with china in the upcoming year

 be it big yes be it bold yes and we can get it do

 it have two part the american jobs plan and the american families plan both be essential to our economic future in a few week i ’ll talk about the americans family plan but today i want to talk about the americans jobs plan

 i ’ll begin with the heart of the plan it modernize transportation infrastructure our road our bridge our airport i just leave your airport the director of the airport say we ’re about to renovate the airport be that right mr. county executive we ’re go to renovate we ’re go to employ thousand of people and she look at i and say i can not thank you enough for this plan

 it grow the economy in key way it put people to work to repair and upgrade so that we badly need it make it easy and more efficient to move good to get to work and to make we more competitive around the world

 some of your local official know when someone want to come into the area and a company want to invest what do they ask where ’s the first rail bed how can i get to the railroad what access to interstate do i have what ’s the water like tell i about it and it go on and on

 it ’ about infrastructure the american jobs plan will modernize 20,000 mile of highway road and main street that be in difficult difficult shape right now it ’ll fix the nation ’s 10 most economically significant bridge in america that require replacement remember that bridge that go down we get 10 of the most economically significant bridge with more commerce go across it that need to be replace

 we ’ll also repair 10,000 bridge desperately need upgrade to unclog traffic keep people safe and connect our city town and tribes across the country

 the american jobs plan will build new rail corridor and transit line ease congestion cut pollution slash commute time and open up investment in community that can be connect to the city and city to the outskirt where a lot of job be these day it ’ll reduce the bottleneck of commerce at our port and our airport

 the american jobs plan will lead to a transformational progress in our effort to tackle climate change with american job and american ingenuity it ’ll protect our community from billion of dollar of damage from historic super storm flood wildfire drought year after year by make our infrastructure more secure and resilient and seize incredible opportunity for american worker and american farmer in a clean energy future

 skilled worker like one we just hear from build a nationwide network of 500,000 charge station create good pay job by lead the world in the manufacturing and export of clean electric car and truck

 we ’re go to provide tax incentive and point of sale rebert sic rebate to help all american family afford clean vehicle of the future the federal government own an enormous fleet of vehicle which be go to be transition to clean electric vehicle and hydrogen vehicle right here in the united states by american worker with american product

 when we make all these investment we ’re go to make sure as the executive order i sign early on that we buy american that mean invest in american base company and american worker not a contract will go out that i control that will not go to a company that be an american company with american product all the way down the line and american worker

 and we ’ll buy the good we need from all of america community that have historically be leave out of these investment black latino asian american native american rural small business entrepreneur across the country

 look today up to 10 million home in america and more than 400,000 school and childcare center have pipe where they get their water from pipe that be lead base pipe include pipe for drinking water

 accord to scientist there be simply no safe exposure to lead for a child lead can slow development cause learn behavior and hear problem

 the american jobs plan will put plumber and pipefitter to work replace 100 percent of the nation ’s lead pipe and service line so every american every child can turn on a faucet or a fountain and drink clean water

 with each $ 5,000 investment replace a line that can mean up to $ 22,000 in healthcare cost save a chance to protect our child help they learn and thrive

 we can not delay we can not delay another minute it ’ long past due

 you know in america where the early interest be in internet this thing call the internet that we invest we invent the early the early internet be invent here million of americans though lack access to reliable high speed internet include more than 35 percent of rural america

 it ’ a disparity even more pronounce during this pandemic american jobs will make sure every single every single american have access to high quality affordable high speed internet for business for school

 and when i say affordable i mean it american pay too much for internet service we ’re go to drive down the price for family who have service now and make it easy for family who do n’t have affordable service to be able to get it now

 as you see in texas and elsewhere our electric and power power grid be vulnerable to storm catastrophic failure and security lapse with tragic result

 my american jobs plan will put hundred of thousand of people to work hundred of thousand of people to work line worker electrician and laborer lay thousand of mile of transmission line build a modern resilient and fully clean grid and cap hundred of thousand of literally orphan oil and gas well that need to be clean up because they ’re abandon pay the same exact rate that a union man or woman would get having dig that well in the first place

 we ’ll build upgrade and weatherize affordable energy efficient housing and commercial building for million of americans

 even before the pandemic million of work family face enormous enormous financial and personal strain try to raise their kid and care for their parent at the same time the so call sandwich generation or family member with disability you get a child at home you can n’t stay home from work to take care of that child unless you lose you ’re go to put the child at risk or you lose your job or you have an elderly parent you ’re take care of and senior and people with disability live independently feel that strain as well but we know if they can remain independently live they live long

 the american jobs plan be go to help in big way it ’s go to extend access to quality affordable home or community base care think of expand vital service like program for senior or think of homecare worker go into home of senior and people with disability cook meal help they get around their home and help they be able to live more independently

 for too long caregiver who be disproportionately woman and woman of color and immigrant have be unseen underpaid and undervalue

 this plan along with the american families plan change that with well wage benefit and opportunity for million of people who will be able to get to work in an economy that work for they

 you know decade ago the united states government use to spend 2 percent of its gdp its gross domestic product on research and development today we spend less than 1 percent i think it ’ seven tenth of 1 percent

 here ’s why that matter we ’re one of only a few major economy in the world whose public investment in research and development as a share of gdp have decline constantly over the last 25 year and we ’ve fall back the rest of the world be close in and close in fast

 we can not allow this to continue the american jobs plan be the big increase in our federal non defense research and development spending on record it ’s go to boost america ’s innovative edge in market where global leadership be up for grab market like battery technology biotechnology computer chip clean energy the competition with china in particular

 critic say we should not spend this money they ask what do we get out of it well they say the same thing when we first fly into space for the first time they say the same thing

 well push the frontier lead to big benefit back home when nasa create apollo ’s digital flight control system unheard of at the time it lead to technology that help we today to drive our car and fly our plane

 when nasa invent way to keep food safe for the astronaut it lead to program that have be use to for decade to keep food safe in supermarket at least 2,000 product and service have be develop and commercialize as a result of american space exploration

 gps have help we find each other computer chip allow we to see and talk to one another even when we ’re separate by mountain and ocean singe happy birthday and watch the first step of that new baby grandchild comfort each other when comfort be need

 think about what it mean to you and your loved one we just have to imagine again

 i have a long discussion with xi jinping the leader of china when he call to congratulate i we spend two hour on the phone and he say and be astonish by nasa ’s security team and the china expert who be on the line he say you ’ve always say mr. president that you can define america in one word possibility that ’s who we be

 in america anything be possible like what we do with vaccine a decade ago that lay the foundation for covid-19 vaccine we have today like we do when the interstate highway system that transform the way we travel live work and develop

 americans could visit relative anywhere in the country with just a family station wagon business here in pittsburgh could load up a truck and get a product to portland or phoenix to this day about a quarter of all the mile americans drive each year on one of those very original highway

 imagine what we can do what ’s within our reach when we modernize those highway you and your family could travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas onboard a high speed train we can connect high speed affordable reliable internet wherever you live

 imagine know that you ’re hand your child and grandchild a country that will lead the world in produce clean energy technology and will need to address one of the big threat of our time that ’ what we ’ll do

 altogether along with the american rescue plan the proposal i put forward will create million of job estimate by some wall street outfit over 18 million job over four year good pay job

 it also work to level the playing field empower worker and ensure that the new job be good job that you can raise a family on and ensure free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively

 that ’ why my plan ask congress to pass the protect the right to organize act the pro act and send it to my desk

 this plan be important not only for what and how it build but it ’ also important to where we build it include everyone regardless of your race or your zip code

 too often economic growth and recovery be concentrate on the coast too often investment have fail to meet the need of marginalized community leave behind

 there be talent innovation everywhere and this plan connect that talent through city small town rural community through our business and our university through our entrepreneur union worker all across america

 we have to move now because i ’m convinced that if we act now in 50 year people be go to look back and say this be the moment that america win the future

 what i ’m propose be a one time capital investment of roughly $ 2 trillion in america ’s future spread largely over eight year

 it will generate historic job growth historic economic growth help business to compete internationally create more revenue as well they be among the high value investment we can make in the nation invest in our infrastructure

 but put it another way fail to make these investment add to our debt and effectively put our child at a disadvantage relative to our competitor that ’ what crumble infrastructure do and our infrastructure be crumble we ’re rank 13th in the world

 what ’s more it heighten our vulnerability to it attac- attract our adversary to compete in way that they have n’t up to now and our adversary be worried about we build this critical infrastructure

 put simply these be investment we have to make we can afford to make they or put another way we can not afford not to

 so how do we pay for it i speak to the majority leader and no long i guess he ’ no long the majority leader he have be for a long time i speak for the republican i speak to the republican leader about the plan everybody be for do something on infrastructure why have not we do it well no one want to pay for it

 less than four year ago as i say the congress pass a tax cut of $ 2 trillion increase the national debt $ 2 trillion it do not meet virtually any of the prediction it would in term of grow the economy overwhelmingly the benefit of that tax package go to the wealthy americans it even include new investment that would profit by shift profit and job overseas if you ’re a corporation it be bad for american competitiveness deeply unfair to the middle class family and wrong for our future

 so here ’ what i ’d do i start with one rule no one let i say it again no one make under $ 400,000 will see their federal taxis go up period this be not about penalize anyone i have nothing against millionaire and billionaire i believe american in american capitalism i want everyone to do well

 but here ’ the deal right now a middle class couple a firefighter and a teacher with two kid make a combine salary of say $ 110- $ 120,000 a year pay 22 cent for each additional dollar they earn in federal income tax but a multinational corporation that build a factory abroad bring it home and then sell it they pay nothing at all we ’re go to raise the corporate tax it be 35 percent which be too high we all agree five year ago it should go down to 28 percent but they reduce it to 21 percent we ’re go to raise it back to up to 28 percent

 no one should be able to complain about that it ’ still low than what that rate be between world war two and 2017 just do that one thing will generate $ 1 trillion in additional revenue over 15 year

 in 2019 an independent analysis find that be 91 let i say it again 91 fortune 500 company the big company in the world include amazon they use various loophole so they ’d pay not a single solitary penny in federal income tax i do not want to punish they but that ’s just wrong that ’ just wrong a fireman and a teacher pay 22 percent amazon and 90 other major corporation be pay zero in federal taxis

 i ’m go to put an end to that and here ’ how we ’ll do it we ’re establish a global minimum tax for u.s. corporation of 21 percent we ’re go to level the international playing field that alone will raise $ 1 trillion over 15 year

 we ’ll also eliminate deduction by corporation for offshore job and shift asset overseas you do that you pay a penalty you do not get a reward in my plan and use the saving from that to give company tax credit to locate manufacturing here in manufacturing and production here in the united states

 and we ’ll significantly ramp up the irs enforcement against corporation who either fail to report their income or under report it ’s estimate that could raise hundred of billion of dollar all of this add up to more than what i ’ve propose to spend in just 15 year

 it ’ honest it ’ fiscally responsible and by the way as the expert will tell you it reduce the debt the federal debt over the long haul

 but let i be clear these be my idea on how to pay for this plan if other have additional idea let they come forward i ’m open to other idea so long as they do not impose any tax increase on people make less than $ 400,000

 let i close with this historically infrastructure have be a bipartisan undertaking many time lead by republicans

 it be abraham lincoln who build the transcontinental railroad dwight eisenhower a republican the interstate highway system i could go on

 and i do not think you ’ll find a republican today in the house or senate maybe i ’m wrong gentleman who do n’t think we have to improve our infrastructure they know china and other country be eat our lunch so there ’ no reason why it can not be bipartisan again

 the division of the moment should not stop we from do the right thing for the future

 i ’m go to bring republicans into the oval office listen to they what they have to say and be open to other idea we ’ll have a good faith negotiation with any republican who want to help get this do but we have to get it do

 i truly believe we ’re in a moment where history be go to look back on this time as a fundamental choice that have to be make between democracy and autocracy

 you know there ’ a lot of autocrat in the world who think the reason why they ’re go to win be democracy can not reach consensus any long autocracy do

 that ’ what competition between america and china and the rest of the world be all about it ’ a basic question can democracy still deliver for their people can they get a majority

 i believe we can i believe we must

 deliver for the american people be what the american rescue plan be all about and it ’s be overwhelmingly popular

 when i write it everybody say i have no bipartisan support we ’re overwhelming bipartisan support with republican register republican voter and ask around if you live in a town with a republican mayor a republican county executive or a republican governor ask they how many would rather get rid of the plan ask they if it help they at all

 it ’ what the american jobs plan be about the new one i ’m propose i hope republicans in congress will join this effort i hope and i believe a number of business will join this effort and i hope and believe the american people will join this effort democrats republican and independent

 we can do this we have to do this we will do this

 we just have to remember this be the united states of america and i ’ve say it a thousand time there ’ nothing beyond our capacity if we act together so it ’ time to move together

 thank you and i hope i get to come back to see you folk after this plan be pass and the question be you have to attract even more apprentice more people because we ’re build so much

 god bless you all and may god protect our troop thank you applause

 it mean everything those thing mean everything

 you know there ’ still you all know it you know it well than any group of americans there ’s still more work to do to beat this virus we can not let our guard down

 but tonight i can say it because of you the american people our progress these past 100 day against one of the bad pandemic in history have be one of the great logistical achievement logistical achievement this country have ever see

 what else have we do in those first 100 day

 we keep our commitment democrats and republicans of send $ 1,400 rescue check to 85 percent of american household we ’ve already send more than one—160 million check out the door it ’s make the difference you all know it when you go home for many people it ’s make all the difference in the world

 a single mom in texas who write to i she say she could not work but she say the relief check put food on the table and save she and her son from eviction from their apartment

 a grandmother in virginia who tell i she immediately take her granddaughter to the eye doctor something she say she put off for month because she do not have the money

 one of the define image at least from my perspective of this crisis have be car line up car line up for mile and not not people who just barely ever start those car nice car line up for mile wait for a box of food to be put in their trunk

 i do not know about you but i do not ever think i ’d see that in america and all of this be through no fault of their own no fault of their own these people be in this position

 that ’ why the rescue plan be deliver food and nutrition assistance to million of americans face hunger and hunger be down sharply already

 we ’re also provide rental assistance you all know this but the american people i want to make sure they understand keep people from be evict from their home provide loan to small business to reopen and keep their employee on the job

 during these 100 day an additional 800,000 americans enrol in the affordable care act when i establish the special sign up period to do that—800,000 in that period

 we ’re make one of the large one time ever investment ever in improve healthcare for veteran critical investment to address the opioid crisis and maybe most importantly thank to the american rescue plan we ’re on track to cut child poverty in america in half this year applause

 and in the process while this be all go on the economy create more than 1,300,000 new job in 100 day more job in the first—(applause)—more job in the first 100 day than any president on record

 the international monetary fund—(applause)—the international monetary fund be now estimate our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year that will be the fast pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decade

 america be move move forward but we can not stop now we ’re in competition with china and other country to win the 21st century we ’re at a great inflection point in history

 we have to do more than just build back well i mean build back we have to build back well we have to compete more strenuously than we have

 throughout our history if you think about it public investment and infrastructure have literally transform america our attitude as well as our opportunity

 the transcontinental railroad the interstate highway unite two ocean and bring a totally new age of progress to the united states of america

 universal public school and college aid open wide the door of opportunity

 scientific breakthrough take we to the moon now we ’re on mars discover vaccine give we the internet and so much more

 these be the investment we make together as one country and investment that only the government be in a position to make time and again they propel we into the future

 that ’ why i propose the american jobs plan a once in a generation investment in america itself this be the large job plan since world war two

 it create job to upgrade our transportation infrastructure job modernize our road bridge highway job build port and airport rail corridor transit line

 it ’ clean water and today up to 10 million home in america and more than 400,000 school and childcare center have pipe with lead in they include in drinking water a clear and present danger to our child ’s health

 the american jobs plan create job replace 100 percent of the nation ’s lead pipe and service line so every american can drink clean water applause

 and in the process it will create thousand and thousand of good pay job it create job connect every american with high speed internet include 35 percent of the rural america that still do not have it

 this be go to help our kid and our business succeed in the 21st century economy

 and i be ask the vice president to lead this effort if she would

 the vice president of course

 the president:—because i know it will get do applause

 it create job build a modern power grid our grid be vulnerable to storm hack catastrophic failure with tragic result as we see in texas and elsewhere during the winter storm

 the american jobs plan will create job that will lay thousand of mile of transmission line need to build a resilient and fully clean grid we can do that applause

 look the american jobs plan will help million of people get back to their job and back to their career

 two million woman have drop out of the workforce during this pandemic two million and too often because they could not get the care they need to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who need help

 eight hundred thousand family be on a medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their age parent or love one with a disability if you think it ’ not important check out in your own district

 democrat or republican democrat or republican voter their great concern almost as much as their child be take care of an elderly love one who can not be leave alone medicaid contemplate it but this plan be go to help those family and create job for our caregiver with well wage and well benefit continue a cycle of growth

 for too long we ’ve fail to use the most important word when it come to meet the climate crisis job jobs job applause

 for i when i think climate change i think job

 the american jobs plan will put engineer and construction worker to work build more energy efficient building and home electrical worker ibew member instal 500,000 charging station along our highway so we can own—(applause)—so we can own the electric car market applause

 farmer farmer planting cover crop so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get pay for do it applause

 look but think about it there be simply no reason why the blade for wind turbine can not be build in pittsburgh instead of beijing no reason none no reason applause

 so folk there ’ no reason why american american worker can not lead the world in the production of electric vehicle and battery i mean there be no reason we have this capacity applause we have the bright well train people in the world

 the american jobs plan be go to create million of good pay job job americans can raise a family on as my dad would then say with a little breathing room

 and all the investment in the american jobs plan will be guide by one principle buy american applause buy american

 and i might note parenthetically—(applause)—that do not that do not violate any trade agreement it ’s be the law since the 30 buy american

 american tax dollar be go to be use to buy american product make in america to create american job that ’ the way it ’s suppose to be and it will be in this administration applause

 and i make it clear to all my cabinet people their ability to give exemption have be exstrenuously sic limited it will be american product

 now i know some of you at home be wonder whether these job be for you so many of you so many of the folk i grow up with feel leave behind forget in an economy that ’s so rapidly change it ’ frightening

 i want to speak directly to you because if you think about it that ’ what people be most worried about can i fit in

 independent expert estimate the american jobs plan will add million of job and trillion of dollar to economic growth in the year to come it be a it be an eight year program these be good pay job that can not be outsource

 nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure job create in the american jobs plan do not require a college degree 75 percent do n’t require an associate ’s degree

 the american jobs plan be a blue collar blueprint to build america that ’ what it be applause

 and it recognize something i ’ve always say in this chamber and the other good guy and woman on wall street but wall street do not build this country the middle class build the country and union build the middle class applause

 so that ’ why i ’m call on congress to pass the protect the right to organize act the pro act and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize applause

 and by the way while you ’re think about send thing to my desk—(laughs)—let ’s raise the minimum wage to $ 15 applause

 no one no one work 40 hour a week no one work 40 hour a week should live below the poverty line

 we need to ensure great equity and opportunity for woman and while we ’re do this let ’s get the paycheck fairness act to my desk as well equal pay it ’s be much too long and if you ’re wonder whether it ’ too long look behind i applause

 and finally the american jobs plan will be the big increase in nondefense research and development on record we will see more technological change and some of you know more about this than i do we’ll see more technological change in the next 10 year than we see in the last 50 that ’ how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more be change

 and we ’re fall behind the competition with the rest of the world

 decade ago we use to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in america—2 percent of our gross domestic product in research and development

 today mr. secretary that ’s less than 1 percent china and other country be close in fast we have to develop and dominate the product and technology of the future
 advanced battery biotechnology computer chip clean energy

 the secretary of defense can tell you and those of you on who work on national security issue know the defense department have an agency call darpa the defense advanced research project agency the people who set up before i come here and that ’s be a long time ago to develop breakthrough that enhance our national security that ’s their only job and it ’ a semi separate agency it ’ under the defense department it ’s lead to everything from the discovery of the internet to gps and so much more that have enhance our security

 the national institute of health the nih i believe should create a similar advanced research projects agency for health applause

 and that would here ’s what it would do it would have a singular purpose to develop breakthrough to prevent detect and treat disease like alzheimer ’s diabetes and cancer

 i ’ll still never forget when we pass the cancer proposal the last year i be vice president almost $ 9 million go to nih and if you excuse the point of personal privilege i ’ll never forget you stand and mention say you ’d name it after my deceased son it mean a lot

 but so many of we have deceased son daughter and relative who die of cancer i can think of no more worthy investment i know of nothing that be more bipartisan so let ’s end cancer as we know it applause it ’ within our power applause it ’ within our power to do it applause

 investment in job and infrastructure like the one we ’re talk about have often have bipartisan support in the past vice president harris and i meet regularly in the oval office with democrats and republicans to discuss the jobs plan and i applaud a group of republican senator who just put forward their own proposal

 so let ’s get to work i want to lay out before the congress my plan before we get into the deep discussion i ’d like to meet with those who have idea that be different they think be well i welcome those idea

 but the rest of the world be not wait for we i just want to be clear from my perspective do nothing be not an option applause

 look we can not be so busy compete with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century

 secretary blinken can tell you i spend a lot of time with president xi travel over 17,000 mile with he spend they tell i over 24 hour in private discussion with he when he call to congratulate i we have a two hour discussion he ’ deadly earnest about become the most significant consequential nation in the world he and other autocrat think that democracy can not compete in the 21st century with autocracy because it take too long to get consensus

 to win that competition for the future in my view we also need to make a once in a generation investment in our family and our child that ’s why i ’ve introduce the american families plan tonight which address four of the big challenge face american family and in turn america

 first be access to a good education when this nation make 12 year of public education universal in the last century it make we the well educate well prepare nation in the world it ’s i believe the overwhelming reason that propel we to where we get in the 21st in the 20th century

 but the world have catch up or catch up they be not wait i would say parenthetically if we be sit down put a bipartisan committee together and say okay we ’re go to decide what we do in term of government provide for free education i wonder whether we ’d think as we do in the 20th century that 12 year be enough in the 21st century i doubt it twelve year be no long enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st century

 that ’ why my american families plan guarantee four additional year of public education for every person in america start as early as we can

 the great university of this country have conduct study over the last 10 year it show that add two year of universal high quality preschool for every three year old and four year old no matter what background they come from it put they in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 year it increase exponentially their prospect of graduate and go on beyond graduation

 the research show when a young child go to school not daycare they be far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school

 when you add two year of free community college on top of that you begin to change the dynamic applause we can do that applause

 and we ’ll increase pell grants and invest in historical black colleges and universities tribal colleges minority serve institution the reason be they do not have the endowment but their student be just as capable of learn about cybersecurity just as capable of learn about metallurgy all the thing that be go on that provide those job of the future

 second thing we need american families plan will provide access to quality affordable childcare we guarantee—(applause and i ’m propose a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle income family will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high quality care for child up to the age of 5 the most hard press work family will not have to spend a dime

 third the american families plan will finally provide up to 12 week of pay leave and medical leave family and medical leave we ’re one of the few industrial country in the world—(applause

 no one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or take care of themselves and their loved one a parent a spouse or child

 and fourth the american family plan put directly into the pocket of million of americans in march we expand a tax credit for every child in a family up to a $ 3,000 per child if they ’re under over six year of age i mean excuse i under over six year of age and $ 3,600 for child over under six year of age

 with two parent two kid that ’ $ 7,200 in the pocket that ’s go to help to take care of your family and that will help more than 65 million child and help cut childcare child poverty in half applause and we can afford it

 so we do that in the rec-—in the in the last piece of legislation we pass but let ’s extend that child care tax credit at least through the end of 2025 applause

 the american rescue plan lower healthcare premium for 9 million americans who buy their coverage under the affordable care act i know that ’s really popular on this side of the aisle laughter but let ’s make that provision permanent so their premium do n’t go back up applause

 in addition to my families plan i ’m go to work with congress to address this year other critical priority for american family

 the affordable care act have be a lifeline for million of americans protect people with preexist condition protect woman ’s health and the pandemic have demonstrate how badly how badly it ’s need let ’s low deductible for work family on the affordable care in the affordable care act applause and let ’s low prescription drug cost applause

 we know how to do this the last president have that as an objective we all know how outrageously expensive drug be in america

 in fact we pay the high prescription drug price of anywhere in the world right here in america nearly three time for the same drug nearly three time what other country pay we have to change that and we can

 let ’s do what we ’ve always talk about for all the year i be down here in this in this body in congress let ’s give medicare the power to save hundred of billion of dollar by negotiate low drug prescription price applause

 and by the way that will not just that will not just help people on medicare it will lower prescription drug cost for everyone

 and the money we save which be billion of dollar can go to strengthen the affordable care act and expand medicare coverage benefit without cost taxpayer an additional penny it ’ within our power to do it let ’s do it now applause

 we ’ve talk about it long enough democrats and republicans let ’s get it do this year this be all about a simple premise healthcare should be a right not a privilege in america applause

 so how do we pay for my jobs and family plan i make it clear we can do it without increase the deficit let ’s start with what i will not do i will not impose any tax increase on people make less than $ 400,000 it’s but it ’ time for corporate america and the wealthy 1 percent of americans to just begin to pay their fair share applause just their fair share

 sometimes i have argument with my friend in the democratic party i think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire but pay your fair share

 a recent study show that 55 of the nation ’s big corporation pay zero federal tax last year those 55 corporation make in excess of $ 40 billion in profit a lot of company also evade taxis through tax haven in switzerland and bermuda and the cayman islands and they benefit from tax loophole and deduction for offshore job and shift profit overseas it ’ not right

 we ’re go to reform corporate taxis so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investment their business will benefit from as well applause

 we ’re go to reward work not just wealth we take the top tax bracket for the wealthy 1 percent of americans those make over $ 400,000 or more back up to where it be when george w. bush be president when he start 39.6 percent that ’s where it be when george w. be president

 we ’re go to get rid of the loophole that allow americans who make more than a million dollar a year and pay a low tax rate on their capital gain than americans who receive a paycheck   we ’re only go to affect three tenth of 1 percent of all americans by that action three tenth of 1 percent

 and the irs be go to crack down on millionaire and billionaire who cheat on their taxis it ’s estimate to be billion of dollar by think tank that be leave right and center

 i ’m not look to punish anybody but i will not add a tax burden an additional tax burden to the middle class in this country they ’re already pay enough i believe what i propose be fair—(applause)—fiscally responsible and it raise revenue to pay for the plan i have propose and will create million of job that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country

 when you hear someone say that they do not want to raise taxis on the wealthy 1 percent or corporate america ask they whose taxis you want to raise instead whose be you go to cut

 look the big tax cut of 2017 remember it be suppose to pay for itself that be how it be sell and generate vast economic growth instead it add $ 2 trillion to the deficit it be a huge windfall for corporate america and those at the very top

 instead of use the tax saving to raise wage and invest in research and development it pour billion of dollar into the pocket of ceo in fact the pay gap between ceo and their worker be now among the large in history

 accord to one study ceo make 320 time what the average worker in their corporation make it use to be in the below a hundred

 the pandemic have only make thing bad twenty million americans lose their job in the pandemic working- and middle class americans at the same time roughly 650 billionaire in america see their net worth increase by more than $ 1 trillion in the same exact period let i say it again 650 people increase their wealth by more than $ 1 trillion during this pandemic and they ’re now worth more than $ 4 trillion

 my fellow americans trickle down trickle down economic have never work and it ’ time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out applause

 you know there ’ a broad consensus of economist left right center and they agree what i ’m propose will help create million of job and generate historic economic growth these be among the high value investment we can make as a nation

 i ’ve often say our great strength be the power of our example not just the example of our power

 in my conversation with world leader and i ’ve speak to over 38 40 of they now i’ve make it know i’ve make it know that america be back and you know what they say the comment that i hear most of all from they be they say we see america be back but for how long but for how long

 my fellow americans we have to show not just that we ’re back but that we ’re back to stay and that we be n’t go to go it alone applause we ’re go to do it by lead with our ally applause

 no one nation can deal with all the crisis of our time from terrorism to nuclear proliferation mass migration cybersecurity climate change as well as experi-—what we ’re experience now with pandemic

 there ’ no wall high enough to keep any virus out and our own vaccine supply as it grow to meet our need and we ’re meet they will become an arsenal of vaccine for other country just as america be the arsenal of democracy for the world—(applause)—and in consequence influence the world applause

 but every american will have access before that occur-—every american will have access to be fully cover by covid-19 from the vaccine we have

 look the climate crisis be not our fight alone it ’ a global fight the united states account as all of you know less than 15 percent of carbon emission the rest of the world account for 85 percent that ’s why i keep my commitment to rejoin the paris accord because if we do everything perfectly it ’s not go to ultimately matter

 i keep my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in america with all of the major economy of the world china russia india the european union and i say i ’d do it in my first 100 day

 i want to be very blunt about it i have my attempt be to make sure that the world could see there be a consensus that we be at an inflection point in history and consensus the consensus be if we act to save the planet we can create million of job and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of live to almost everyone around the world

 if you ’ve watch any of it and you be all busy i ’m sure you do not have much time that ’ what virtually every nation say even the one that be n’t do their fair share

 the investment i ’ve propose tonight also advance the foreign policy in my view that benefit the middle class that mean make sure every nation play by the same rule in the global economy include china

 in my discussion in my discussion with president xi i tell he we welcome the competition we ’re not look for conflict but i make absolutely clear that we will defend america ’s interest across the board america will stand up to unfair trade practice that undercut american worker and american industry like subsidy from state to state own operation and enterprise and the theft of american technology and intellectual property

 i also tell president xi that we ’ll maintain a strong military presence in the indo pacific just as we do with nato in europe not to start a conflict but to prevent one applause

 i tell he what i ’ve say to many world leader that america will not back away from our commitment our commitment to human right and fundamental freedom and to our alliance

 and i point out to he no responsible american president could remain silent when basic human right be be so blatantly violate an american president president have to represent the essence of what our country stand for america be an idea the most unique idea in history we be create all of we equal it ’ who we be and we can not walk away from that principle and in fact say we ’re deal with the american idea

 with regard to russia i know it concern some of you but i make very clear to putin that we ’re not go to seek esca-—ecala-—exc-—excuse i escalation but their action will have consequence if they turn out to be true and they turn out to be true so i respond directly and proportionally to russia ’s interference in our election and the cyberattack on our government and our business they do both of these thing and i tell they we would respond and we have

 but we can also cooperate when it ’ in our mutual interest we do it when we extend the new start treaty on nuclear arm and we ’re work to do it on climate change but he understand we will respond

 on iran and north korea nuclear program that present serious threat to american security and the security of the world we’re go to be work closely with our ally to address the threat pose by both of these country through di-—through diplomacy as well as stern deterrence

 and american leadership mean end the forever war in afghanistan applause we have—(applause)—we have without hyperbole the great fighting force in the history of the world i ’m the first president in 40 year who know what it mean to have a son serve in a warzone

 for much too long the history of what take place here be tell in silence cloak in darkness but just because history be silent it do not mean that it do not take place and while darkness can hide much it erase nothing it erase nothing some injustice be so heinous so horrific so grievous they can not be bury no matter how hard people try

 and so it be here only only with truth can come healing and justice and repair only with truth face it but that be n’t enough

 but one night one night change everything everything change while greenwood be a community to itself it be not separate from the outside

 it be n’t everyone but there be enough hate resentment and vengeance in the community enough people who believe that america do not belong to everyone and not everyone be create equal native americans asian americans hispanic americans black americans a belief enforce by law by badge by hood and by noose

 and it speak to that light the fuse it light it by the spark that it provide a fuse of fury be an innocent interaction that turn into an in-—a terrible terrible headline allegation of a black male teenager attack a white female teenager

 private plane private plane drop explosive the first and only domestic aerial assault of its kind on an american city here in tulsa

 eight of greenwood ’s nearly two dozen church burn like mt. zion across the street at vernon ame

 mother randle say it be like war mother fletcher say all these year later she still see black body around

 the greenwood newspaper publisher a.j. smitherton sic]—excuse i smitherman pen a poem of what he hear and feel that night and here ’ the poem he say kill they burn they set the pace teach they how to keep their place reign of murder theft and plunder be the order of the night that ’ what he remember in the poem that he write

 one hundred year ago at this hour on this first day of june smoke darken the tulsa sky rise from 35 block of greenwood that be leave in ash and ember raze and in rubble

 less than 24 hour in less than 24 hour 1,100 black home and business be lose insurance company they have insurance many of they reject claim of damage ten thousand people be leave destitute and homeless place in internment camp

 as i be tell today they be tell do not you mention you be ever in a camp or we ’ll come and get you that ’ what survivor tell i

 yet no one no arrest of the mob be make none no proper accounting of the dead the death toll record by local official say there be 36 people that ’s all thirty six people

 but base on study record and account the likelihood the likely number be much more in the multiple of hundred untold body dump into mass grave family who at the time wait for hour and day to know the fate of their love one be now descendant who have go 100 year without closure

 but you know as we speak the process the process of exhume the unmarked grave have start and at this moment i ’d like to pause for a moment of silence for the father the mother the sister son and daughter friend of god and greenwood they deserve dignity and they deserve our respect may their soul rest in peace

 pause for a moment of silence

 my fellow americans this be not a riot this be a massacre—(applause)—among the bad in our history but not the only one and for too long forget by our history

 as soon as it happen there be a clear effort to erase it from our memory our collective memory from the news and everyday conversation for a long time school in tulsa do not even teach it let alone school elsewhere

 and most people do not realize that a century ago a second ku klux klan have be found the second ku klux klan have be found

 a friend of mine jon meacham i have write when i say i be run to restore the soul of america he write a book call the soul of america”—not because of what i say and there ’ a picture about page 160 in his book show over 30,000 ku klux klan member in full regalia reverend point hat the robe march down pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c. jesse you know all about this washin-—washington d.c.

 if my memory be correct there be 37 member of the house of representatives who be open member of the klan there be five if i ’m not mistaken it could have be seven i think it be five member of the united states senate open member of the klan multiple governor who be open member of the klan

 most people do not realize that a century ago the klan be found just six year before the horrific destruction here in tulsa and one of the reason why it be found be because of guy like i who be catholic it be n’t about african americans then it be about make sure that all those polish and irish and italian and eastern european catholics who come to the united states after world war one would not pollute christianity

 the flame from those burn crosse torch every region region of the country million of white americans belong to the klan and they be not even embarrass by it they be proud of it

 and that hate became embed systematically and systemically in our law and our culture we do ourselves no favor by pretend none of this ever happen or that it do not impact we today because it do still impact we today

 we can not just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know applause we should know the good the bad everything that ’ what great nation do they come to term with their dark side and we ’re a great nation

 the only way to build a common ground be to truly repair and to rebuild i come here to help fill the silence because in silence wound deepen applause and only as painful as it be only in remembrance do wound heal we just have to choose to remember

 we memorialize what happen here in tulsa so it can be so it can not be erase we know here in this hallowed place we simply can not bury pain and trauma forever

 and at some point there will be a reckoning an inflection point like we ’re face right now as a nation

 what many people have not see before or ha-—or simply refuse to see can not be ignore any long you see it in so many place

 and there ’ great recognition that for too long we ’ve allow a narrow cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester the view that america be a zero sum game where there be only one winner if you succeed i fail if you get ahead i fall behind if you get a job i lose mine and maybe bad of all if i hold you down i lift myself up instead of if you do well we all do well applause we see that in greenwood

 this story be n’t about the loss of life but a loss of living of wealth and prosterity prosperity and possibility that still reverberate today

 mother fletcher talk about how she be only able to attend school until the fourth grade and eventually find work in the shipyard as a domestic worker

 mr. van ellis have share how even after enlist and serve in world war two he still come home to struggle with a segregate america

 imagine all those hotel and dinner diner and mom and pop shop that could be have be pass down this past hundred year imagine what could have be do for black family in greenwood financial security and generational wealth

 if you come from background like my my family a working class middle class family the only way we be ever able to generate any wealth be in equity in our home imagine what they contribute then and what they could ’ve contribute all these year imagine a thriving greenwood in north tulsa for the last hundred year what that would ’ve mean for all of tulsa include the white community

 while the people of greenwood rebuild again in the year after the massacre it do not last eventually neighborhood be redline on map lock black tulsa out of homeownership applause a highway be build right through the heart of the community lisa i be talk about our west side what 95 do to it after we be occupy by the military after dr. king be murder the community cut off black family and business from job and opportunity chronic underinvestment from state and federal government deny greenwood even just a chance at rebuild applause

 we must find the courage to change the thing we know we can change that ’ what vice president harris and i be focus on along with our entire administration include our housing and urban development secretary marcia fudge who be here today applause

 because today we ’re announce two expand effort target toward black wealth creation that will also help the entire community the first be my administration have launch an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing that include everything from redline to the cruel fact that a home own by a black family be too often appraise at a low value than a similar home own by a white family applause

 and i might add and i need help if you have an answer to this i can not figure this one out congressman horsford but if you live in a black community and there ’s another one on the other side of the highway it ’ a white community it ’ the build by the same builder and you have a well driving record than they guy with the same car in the white community you’re can pay more for your auto insurance

 shockingly the percentage of black american homeownership be low today in america than when the fair housing act be pass more than 50 year ago low today that ’ wrong and we ’re commit to change that

 just imagine if instead of deny million of americans the ability to own their own home and build generational wealth we make it possible for they to buy a home and build equity into that into that home and provide for their family

 second small business be the engine of our economy and the glue of our community as president my administration oversee hundred of billion of dollar in federal contract for everything from refurbishing deck of aircraft carrier to instal railing in federal building to professional service

 we have a thing call i will not go into it all because there ’s not enough time now but i ’m determined to use every taxpayer ’s dollar that be assign to i to spend go to american company and american worker to build ameri to build american product and as part of that i ’m go to increase the share of the dollar the federal government spend to small disadvantaged business include black and brown small business

 right now it call for 10 percent i ’m go to move that to 15 percent of every dollar spend will be spend inaudible applause i have the authority to do that

 just imagine if instead of deny million of entrepreneur the ability to access capital and contracting we make it possible to take their dream to the marketplace to create job and invest in our community

 that the data show young black entrepreneur be just as capable of succeed give the chance as white entrepreneur be but they do not have lawyer they do n’t have they they do not have accountant but they have great idea

 do anyone doubt this whole nation would be well off from the investment those people make and i promise you that ’ why i set up the a national small business administration that ’ much broad because they ’re go to get those loan

 instead of consign million of american child to under resource school let ’s give each and every child three and four year old access to school not daycare school applause

 in the last 10 year study have be do by all the great university it show that if increase by 56 percent the possibility of a child no matter what background they come from no matter what if they start school at three year old they have a 56 percent chance of go all through all 12 year without any trouble and be able to do well and a chance to learn and grow and thrive in a school and throughout their life

 and let ’s unlock more than an incredible creativity and innovation that will come from the nation ’s historically black colleges and universities applause i have a $ 5 billion program give they the resource to invest in research center and laboratory and high demand field to compete for the good pay job in industry like of the future like cybersecurity

 the reason why they don’t their their student be equally able to learn as well and get the good pay job that start at 90- and 100,000 buck but they do n’t have they do not have the back they do not have the money to provide and build those laboratory so guess what they ’re go to get the money to build those laboratory applause

 so instead of just talk about infrastructure let ’s get about the about the business of actually rebuild road and highway fill the sidewalk and crack instal streetlight and high speed internet create space space to live and work and play safely

 let ’s ensure access to healthcare clean water clean air nearby grocery store stock the fresh vegetable and food that—(applause)—in fact deal with i mean these be all thing we can do

 do anyone doubt this whole nation would be well off with these investment the rich will be just as well off the middle class will do well and everybody will do well it ’ about good pay job financial stability and be able to build some generational wealth it ’ about economic growth for our country and outcompete the rest of the world which be now outcompete we

 but just as fundamental as any of these investment i ’ve discuss this may be the most fundamental the right to vote applause the right to vote applause

 a lot of the member of the black caucus know john lewis well than i do but i know he on his deathbed like many i call john to speak to he but all john want to do be talk about how i be do he die i think about 25 hour later

 but you know what john say he call the right to vote precious almost sacred he say the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society

 this sacred right be under assault with an incredible intensity like i ’ve never see even though i get start as a public defender and a civil right lawyer with an intensity and an aggressiveness that we have not see in a long long time

 it ’ simply un american it be not however sadly unprecedented the creed we shall overcome be a longtime mainstay of the civil rights movement as jesse jackson can tell you well than anybody

 the obstacle to proc-—to progress that have to be overcome be a constant challenge we see it in the 60 but with the current assault it ’ not just an echo of a distant history

 in 2020 we face a tireless assault on the right to vote restrictive law lawsuit threat of intimidation voter purge and more we resolve to overcome it all and we do more americans vote in the last election than any in the midst of a pandemic than any election in american history applause

 you get voter register you get voter to the poll the rule of law hold democracy prevail we overcome

 but today let i be unequivocal i ’ve be engage in this work my whole career and we ’re go to be ramp up our effort to overcome again

 i will have more to say about this at a later date the truly unprecedented assault on our democracy an effort to replace nonpartisan election administrator and to intimidate those charge with tally and report the election result

 but today as for the act of vote itself i urge voting right group in this country to begin to redouble their effort now to register and educate voter applause

 and in june june should be a month of action on capitol hill i hear all the folk on tv say why do not biden get this do well because biden only have a majority of effectively four vote in the house and a tie in the senate with two member of the senate who vote more with my republican friend

 but we ’re not give up early this year the house of representatives pass for the people act to protect our democracy the senate will take it up later this month and i ’m go to fight like heck with every tool at my disposal for its passage

 the house be also work on the john lewis voting rights act which be which be critical—(applause)—to provide new legal tool to combat the new assault on the right to vote

 to signify the importance of our effort today i ’m ask vice president harris to help these effort and lead they among her many other responsibility

 with her leadership and your support we ’re go to overcome again i promise you but it ’s go to take a hell of a lot of work applause

 and finally we have to and finally we must address what remain the stain on the soul of america what happen in greenwood be an act of hate and domestic terrorism with a through line that exist today still

 just close your eye and remember what you see in charlottesville four year ago on television neo nazis white supremacist the kkk come out of those field at night in virginia with light torch the vein bulge on their as they be scream remember just close your eye and picture what it be

 well mother fletcher say when she see the insurrection at the capitol on january the 9th 6th it break her heart a mob of violent white extremist thug say it remind she what happen here in greenwood 100 year ago

 look around at the various hate crime against asian americans and jewish americans hate that never go away hate only hide

 jesse i think i mention this to you i think after you guy push through with dr. king the voting rights act and the civil rights act i think we move but what i do not realize i think we have make enormous progress and i be so proud to be a little part of it

 but you know what rev i do not realize hate be never defeat it only hide it hide and give a little bit of oxygen just a little bit oxygen by its leader it come out of there from under the rock like it be happen again as if it never go away

 and so folk we can’t we must not give hate a safe harbor

 as i say in my address to the joint session of congress accord to the intelligence community terrorism from white supremacy be the most lethal threat to the homeland today not isis not al qaeda white supremacist applause that ’s not i that ’s the intelligence community under both trump and under my administration

 two week ago i sign into law the covid-19 hate crimes act which the house have pass and the senate my administration will soon lay out our broad strategy to counter domestic terrorism and the violence drive by the most heinous hate crime and other form of vigorty sic]—of bigotry

 but i ’m go to close where i start to mother randle mother fletcher mr. van ellis to the descendant and to all survivor thank you thank you for give i the honor of be able to spend some time with you early today thank you for your courage thank you for your commitment and thank your child and your grandchild and your unc-—and your niece and your nephew

 to see and learn from you be a gift a genuine gift dr. john hope franklin one of america ’s great historian tulsa ’s proud son whose father be a greenwood survivor say and i quote whatever you do it must be do in the spirit of goodwill and mutual respect and even love how else can we overcome the past and be worthy of our forebearer and face the future with confidence and with hope

 on this sacred and solemn day may we find that distinctly greenwood spirit that define the american spirit the spirit that give i so much confidence and hope for the future that help we see face to face a spirit that help we know fully who we be and who we can be as a people and as a nation

 i ’ve never be more optimistic about the future than i be today i mean that and the reason be because of this new generation of young people they ’re the well educate they ’re the least prejudiced the most open generation in american history

 and although i have no scientific basis of what i ’m about to say but those of you who be over 50 how often do you ever see how often do you ever see advertisement on television with black and white couple not a joke

 i challenge you find today when you turn on the station sit on one station for two hour and i do not know how many commercial you ’ll see eight to five two to three out of five have mix race couple in they that ’s not by accident they ’re sell soap man laughter not a joke

 remember ol’ pat caddell he use to say you want to know what ’s happen in american culture watch advertising because they want to sell what they have

 we have hope in folk like you honey i really mean it we have hope but we ’ve get to give they support we have get to give they the backbone to do what we know have to be do because i doubt whether any of you would be here if you do not care deeply about this you sure in the devil do not come to hear i speak laughter

 but i really mean it i really mean it let ’s not give up man let ’s not give up

 as the old saying go hope spring eternal i know we ’ve talk a lot about famous people but i’m my colleague in the senate use to kid i because i be always quote irish poet they think i do it because i ’m irish they think i do it because we irish we have a little chip on our shoulder a little bit sometimes

 that ’s not why i do it i do it because they ’re the good poet in the world laughter you can smile it ’ okay it ’ true

 there be a famous poet who write a poem call the cure at troy”—seamus heaney and there be a stanza in it that i think be the definition of what i think should be our call today for young people

 it say history teach we not to hope on this side of the grave but then once in a lifetime the long for tidal wave of justice rise up and hope and history rhyme

 let ’s make it rhyme thank you

the president good afternoon early today i be brief by our senior military and national security leader on the status of the drawdown of u.s. force and ally force in afghanistan

 when i announce our drawdown in april i say we would be out by september and we ’re on track to meet that target

 our military mission in afghanistan will conclude on august 31st the drawdown be proceed in a secure and orderly way prioritize the safety of our troop as they depart

 our military commander advise i that once i make the decision to end the war we need to move swiftly to conduct the main element of the drawdown and in this context speed be safety

 and thank to the way in which we have manage our withdrawal no one no one u.s. force or any force have have be lose conduct our drawdown differently would have certainly come with an increase risk of safety to our personnel

 to i those risk be unacceptable and there be never any doubt that our military would perform this task efficiently and with the high level of professionalism that ’ what they do and the same be true of our nato allies and partner who have support we be support and support we as well as they conclude their retrograde

 i want to be clear the u.s. military mission in afghanistan continue through the end of august we remain we retain personnel and capacity in the country and we maintain some authority excuse i the same authority under which we ’ve be operate for some time

 as i say in april the united states do what we go to do in afghanistan to get the terrorist who attack we on 9/11 and to deliver justice to osama bin laden and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep afghanistan from become a base from which attack could be continue against the united states we achieve those objective that ’s why we go

 we do not go to afghanistan to nation build and it ’ the right and the responsibility of the afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their country

 together with our nato allies and partner we have train and equip over three hu-—nearly 300,000 current serve member of the military of the afghan national security force and many beyond that who be no long serve add to that hundred of thousand more afghan national defense and security forces train over the last two decade

 we provide our afghan partner with all the tool let i emphasize all the tool training and equipment of any modern military we provide advanced weaponry and we ’re go to continue to provide funding and equipment and we ’ll ensure they have the capacity to maintain their air force

 but most critically as i stress in my meeting just two week ago with president ghani and chairman abdullah afghan leader have to come together and drive toward a future that the afghan people want and they deserve

 in our meeting i also assure ghani that u.s. support for the people of afghanistan will endure we will continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance include speak out for the right of woman and girl

 i intend to maintain our diplomatic presence in afghanistan and we be coordinate closely with our international partner in order to continue to secure the international airport

 and we ’re go to engage in a determined diplomacy to pursue peace and a peace agreement that will end this senseless violence

 i ’ve ask secretary of state blinken and our special representative for afghanistan reconciliation to work vigorously with the party in afghanistan as well as the regional and international stakeholder to support a negotiate solution

 to be clear to be clear country in the region have an essential role to play in support a peaceful settlement we ’ll work with they and they should help step up their effort as well

 we ’re go to continue to work for the release of detain americans include mark excuse i fre frerichs i want to pronounce the name correctly i mis-—i misspoke so that he can return to his family safely

 we ’re also go to continue to make sure that we take on the afghan national who work side by side with u.s. force include interpreter and translator since we ’re no long go to have military there after this we ’re not go to need they and they have no job who be also go to be vital to our effort so they and they ’ve be very vital and so their family be not expose to danger as well

 we ’ve already dramatically accelerate the procedure time for special immigrant visas to bring they to the united states

 since i be inaugurate on january 20th we ’ve already approve 2,500 special immigrant visas to come to the united states up to now few than half have exercise their right to do that half have get on aircraft and com commercial flight and come and the other half believe they want to stay at least thus far

 we ’re work closely with congress to change the authorization legislation so that we can streamline the process of approve those visa and those who have stand up for the operation to physically relocate thousand of afghans and their family before the u.s. military mission conclude so that if they choose they can wait safely outside of afghanistan while their u.s. visa be be process

 the operation have identify u.s. facility outside of the continental united states as well as in third country to host our afghan ally if they ch-—if they so choose and start this month we ’re go to begin to re-—re-—reloc-—we’re go to begin relocation flight for afghanistan siv applicant and their family who choose to leave

 we have a point person in the white house and at the state department lead task force coordinate all these effort

 but our message to those woman and man be clear there be a home for you in the united states if you so choose and we will stand with you just as you stand with we

 when i make the decision to end the u.s. military involvement in afghanistan i judge that it be not in the national interest of the united states of america to continue fight this war indefinitely i make the decision with clear eye and i be brief daily on the battlefield update

 but for those who have argue that we should stay just six more month or just one more year i ask they to consider the lesson of recent history

 in 2011 the nato allies and partner agree that we would end our combat mission in 2014 in 2014 some argue one more year so we keep fight and we keep take casualty in 2015 the same and on and on

 nearly 20 year of experience have show we that the current security situation only confirm that just one more year of fight in afghanistan be not a solution but a recipe for be there indefinitely

 it ’ up to afghans to make the decision about the future of their country

 other be more direct their argument be that we should stay with the afghan in afghanistan indefinitely in do so they point to the fact that we we have not take loss in this last year so they claim that the cost of just maintain the status quo be minimal

 but that ignore the reality and the fact that already present on the ground in afghanistan when i take office the taliban be at its strong mil-—is at its strong militarily since 2001

 the number of u.s. force in afghanistan have be reduce to a bare minimum and the united states in the last administration make an agreement that the with the taliban to remove all our force by may 1 of this past of this year that ’ what i inherit that agreement be the reason the taliban have cease major attack against u.s. force

 if in april i have instead announce that the united states be go to back go back on that agreement make by the last administration—[that the united states and ally force would remain in afghanistan for the foreseeable future the taliban would have again begin to target our force

 the status quo be not an option staying would have mean u.s. troop take casualty american man and woman back in the middle of a civil war and we would have run the risk of have to send more troop back into afghanistan to defend our remain troop

 once that agreement with the taliban have be make stay with a bare minimum force be no long possible

 so let i ask those who want we to stay how many more how many thousand more of america ’s daughter and son be you willing to risk how long would you have they stay

 already we have member of our military whose parent fight in afghanistan 20 year ago would you send their child and their grandchild as well would you send your own son or daughter

 after 20 year a trillion dollar spend training and equip hundred of thousand of afghan national security and defense forces 2,448 americans kill 20,722 more wounded and untold thousand come home with unseen trauma to their mental health i will not send another generation of americans to war in afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieve a different outcome

 the united states can not afford to remain tethered to policy create a response to a world as it be 20 year ago we need to meet the threat where they be today

 today the terrorist threat have metastasize beyond afghanistan so we be reposition our resource and adapt our counterterrorism posture to meet the threat where they be now significantly high in south asia the middle east and africa

 but make no mistake our military and intelligence leader be confident they have the capability to protect the homeland and our interest from any resurgent terrorist challenge emerge or emanating from afghanistan

 we be develop a counterterrorism over the horizon capability that will allow we to keep our eye firmly fix on any direct threat to the united states in the region and act quickly and decisively if need

 and we also need to focus on shore up america ’s core strength to meet the strategic competition with china and other nation that be really go to determine determine our future

 we have to defeat covid-19 at home and around the world make sure we ’re well prepared for the next pandemic or biological threat

 we need to establish international norm for cyberspace and the use of emergenc-—emerge technology

 we need to take concerted action to fight existential threat of climate change

 and we will be more formidable to our adversary and competitor over the long run if we fight the battle of the next 20 year not the last 20 year

 finally i want to recognize the incredible sacrifice and dedication that the u.s. military and civilian personnel serve alongside our allies and partner have make over the last two decade in afghanistan

 i want to honor the significance of what they ’ve accomplish and the great personal risk they encounter and the incredible cost to their family pursue the terrorist threat in some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet and i ’ve be almost throughout that entire country ensure there have not be another attack on the homeland from afghanistan for the last 20 year take out bin laden

 i want to thank you all for your service and the dedication to the mission so many of you have give and to the sacrifice that you and your family have make over the long course of this war

 we ’ll never forget those who give the last full measure of devotion for their country in afghanistan nor those whose life have be immeasurably alter by wound sustain in service to their country

 we ’re end america ’s long war but we ’ll always always honor the bravery of the american patriot who serve in it

 may god bless you all and may god protect our troop thank you

 q mr. president do you trust the taliban mr. president

 q be a taliban takeover of afghanistan now inevitable

 the president no it be not

 q why

 the president because you the afghan troop have 300,000 well equip as well equip as any army in the world and an air force against something like 75,000 taliban it be not inevitable

 q do you trust the taliban mr. president do you trust the taliban sir

 the president you be that a serious question

 q it be absolutely a serious question do you trust the taliban

 the president no i do not

 q do you trust handing over the country to the taliban

 the president no i do not trust the taliban

 q so why be you hand the country over

 q mr. president be the u.s. responsible for the death of afghans after you leave the country

 q mr. president will you amplify that question please will you amplify your answer please why you do not trust the taliban

 the president it ’ a it ’ a silly question do i trust the taliban no but i trust the capacity of the afghan military who be well train well equip and more re-—more competent in term of conduct war yes ma’am

 q thank you mr. president give the amount of money that have be spend and the number of life that have be lose in your view with make this decision be the last 20 year worth it

 the president you know my record i can tell by the way you ask the question

 i oppose permanently have american force in afghanistan i argue from the beginning as you may recall it come to light after the administration be over last our administration no nation have ever unify afghanistan no nation empire have go there and not do it

 the focus we have and i strongly support it and you may remember i physically go to afghanistan i be up in that pass where osama bin laden be allegedly escape or out of harm ’s way

 we go for two reason one to bring osama bin laden to the gate of hell as i say at the time the second reason be to eliminate al qaeda ’s capacity to deal with more attack on the united states from that territory we accomplish both of those objective period

 that ’ what i believe from the beginning why we should be and why we should have go to afghanistan that job have be over for some time and that ’ why i believe that this be the right decision and quite frankly overdue

 q mr. president have the civilian government hail the people of afghanistan

 q mr. president thank you very much your own intelligence community have assess that the afghan government will likely collapse

 the president that be not true

 q be it can you please clarify what they have tell you about whether that will happen or not

 the president that be not true they do not they didn’t do not reach that conclusion

 q so what be the level of confidence that they have that it will not collapse

 the president the afghan government and leadership have to come together they clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place the question be will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it it ’ not a question of whether they have the capacity they have the capacity they have the force they have the equipment the question be will they do it

 and i want to make clear what i make clear to ghani that we be not go just sus-—walk away and not sustain their ability to maintain that force we be we ’re go to also work to make sure we help they in term of everything from food necessity and other thing in in the region but but there ’ not a conclusion that in fact they can not defeat the taliban

 i believe the only way there ’s go to be this be now joe biden not the intelligence community the only way there ’s ultimately go to be peace and security in afghanistan be that they work out a modus vivendi with the taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peace

 and the likelihood there ’s go to be one unified government in afghanistan control the whole country be highly unlikely

 q mr. president thank you but we have talk to your own top general in afghanistan general scott miller he tell abc news the condition be so concern at this point that it could result in a civil war so if kabul fall to the taliban what will the united states do about it

 the president look you ’ve say two thing one that if it could result in a civil war that ’s different than the taliban succeed number one number two the question of what will be do be go to be implicate be go to implicate the entire region as well there ’ a number of country who have a grave concern about what ’s go to happen in afghanistan relative to their security

 the question be how much of a threat to the united states of america and to our ally be whatever result in term of a government or an agreement that ’s when that judgement will be make

 q mr. president some vietnamese veteran see echo of their experience in this withdrawal in afghanistan do you see any parallel between this withdrawal and what happen in vietnam with some people feel

 the president none whatsoever zero what you have be you have entire brigade break through the gate of our embassy six if i ’m not mistaken

 the taliban be not the south the north vietnamese army they ’re not they’re not remotely comparable in term of capability there ’s go to be no circumstance where you see people be lift off the roof of an embassy in the of the united states from afghanistan it be not at all comparable

 q and mr. president

 q mr. president can i

 the president i ’ll take he and then i’ll and then i ’ll go i’ll go to the other side hang on a second

 q mr. president how serious be the corruption among the afghanistan government to this mission fail there

 the president well first of all the mission have not fail yet there be in afghanistan in all party there ’s be corruption the question be can there be an agreement on unity of purpose what be the objective

 for example it start off there be go to be negotiation between the taliban and the afghan national security forces and the afghan government that that of it do not come to it do not come to fruition

 so the question now be where do they go from here that the jury be still out but the likelihood there ’s go to be the taliban overrun everything and own the whole country be highly unlikely

 yes ma’am

 q mr. president will the united states be responsible for the loss of afghan civilian life that could happen after a

 the president no

 q:—military exit

 the president no no no it ’ up to the people of afghanistan to decide on what government they want not we to impose the government on they no country have ever be able to do that

 keep in mind as a student of history as i ’m sure you be never have afghanistan be a united country not in all of its history not in all of its history

 q mr. president if this be n’t a mission accomplish moment what be it in your view

 the president no there ’ no mission accomplish

 q how would you describe it

 the president the mission be accomplish in that we get get osama bin laden and terrorism be not emanate from that part of the world

 q mr. president if speed be safety as you just say in your remark be you satisfied with the timeline of relocate afghan national be it happen quickly enough to your satisfaction if it may not happen until next month at the end

 the president well much of it have already happen there ’s already be people about a thousand people have get on aircraft and come home come to the united states already on commercial aircraft so as i say there ’ over 2,500 people that as from january to now have get those visa and only half decide that they want to leave

 the point be that i think the whole process have to be speed up period in term of be able to get these visa

 q why can not the u.s. evacuate these afghan translator to the united states to await their visa processing as some immigrant at the southern border have be allow to do

 the president because the law do not allow that to happen and that ’ why we ’re ask the congress to consider change the law

 but in the meantime we can guarantee their safety if they wish to leave by take they to third country and/or while the wait be take place to come to to and hopefully while they ’re wait there to be able to bring they back to the united states if that ’ what they choose to do

 q and what do you make and what do you make sir of the taliban be in russia today

 q mr. president i ’m from afghanistan i be afghan inaudible woman any message good message for afghan woman in future because they have achievement they be really concerned about their achievement

 the president they be very concerned with good reason

 q yes

 the president when i be in afghanistan i’ve be there a number of time i remember be in a school outside and and by the way the school in afghanistan be not fundamentally unlike school in the west coast where they have you know a an area in the middle that be sort of like it look like a playground and single story building connect around it

 and i remember say to speak to a group of young woman i guess they be roughly don’t hold i to this they look like they ’d be 14 15 year old and they ’re in school and there ’ a tiere classroom with single light bulb hang from the ceiling as i know you know

 and i say you know the united states come here to make sure that we get this terrorist osama bin laden and that terrorist do not amass again to to go after our country and then we ’re go to have to leave and a young woman say you can not leave you can not leave it be it be heartbreaking you can not leave she say i want to be a doctor i want to be a doctor i want to be a doctor if you leave i ’ll never be able to be a doctor well that ’ why we spend so much time and money train the afghan security forces to do the work of defend that if every work

 well anyway so yes i ’m aware

 i ’m go to take one more question

 q mr. president have you speak with any taliban official about the withdrawal

 q inaudible the taliban be in russia today the taliban

 q mr.—mr president i thank you i want to ask with the benefit of hindsight you ’ve speak to the fact that the taliban be sort of at their militarily strong point that you ’ve see in 20 year how do you feel personally about that with the benefit of hindsight and all of the dollar and investment and american troop that be send there

 the president relative to the training and capacity of the ansf and the training of the federal police they ’re not even close in term of their capacity

 i be make the point the point be that here we be i be the argument be well we could stay because no one be die no americans be be shoot so why leave once the agreement be make by the last administration that we be go to leave by may 1st it be very clear that a taliban that have always be a problem be even a more sophisticated problem than they be than before not more sophisticated than the ansf the government more than they be

 the point be that it would have increase the prospect that they would have be able to take more life of americans if they decide we be not go to go after they that be the point i be make

 thank you all so very much thank you

the president good afternoon i want to speak today to the unfold situation in afghanistan the development that have take place in the last week and the step we ’re take to address the rapidly evolve event

 my national security team and i have be closely monitor the situation on the ground in afghanistan and move quickly to execute the plan we have put in place to respond to every constituency include and contingency include the rapid collapse we ’re see now

 i ’ll speak more in a moment about the specific step we ’re take but i want to remind everyone how we get here and what america ’s interest be in afghanistan

 we go to afghanistan almost 20 year ago with clear goal get those who attack we on september 11th 2001 and make sure al qaeda could not use afghanistan as a base from which to attack we again

 we do that we severely degrade al qaeda in afghanistan we never give up the hunt for osama bin laden and we get he that be a decade ago

 our mission in afghanistan be never suppose to have be nation building it be never suppose to be create a unify centralized democracy

 our only vital national interest in afghanistan remain today what it have always be prevent a terrorist attack on american homeland

 i ’ve argue for many year that our mission should be narrowly focus on counterterrorism not counterinsurgency or nation building that ’s why i oppose the surge when it be propose in 2009 when i be vice president

 and that ’ why as president i be adamant that we focus on the threat we face today in 2021 not yesterday ’s threat

 today the terrorist threat have metastasize well beyond afghanistan al shabaab in somalia al qaeda in the arabian peninsula al nusra in syria isis attempt to create a caliphate in syria and iraq and establish affiliate in multiple country in africa and asia these threat warrant our attention and our resource

 we conduct effective counterterrorism mission against terrorist group in multiple country where we do not have a permanent military presence

 if necessary we will do the same in afghanistan we ’ve develop counterterrorism over the horizon capability that will allow we to keep our eye firmly fix on any direct threat to the united states in the region and to act quickly and decisively if need

 when i come into office i inherit a deal that president trump negotiate with the taliban under his agreement u.s. force would be out of afghanistan by may 1 2021 just a little over three month after i take office

 u.s. force have already draw down during the trump administration from roughly 15,500 american force to 2,500 troop in country and the taliban be at its strong militarily since 2001

 the choice i have to make as your president be either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fight the taliban in the middle of the spring fighting season

 there would have be no ceasefire after may 1 there be no agreement protect our force after may 1 there be no status quo of stability without american casualty after may 1

 there be only the cold reality of either follow through on the agreement to withdraw our force or escalate the conflict and send thousand more american troop back into combat in afghanistan lurch into the third decade of conflict

 i stand squarely behind my decision after 20 year i ’ve learn the hard way that there be never a good time to withdraw u.s. force

 that ’ why we be still there we be clear eyed about the risk we plan for every contingency

 but i always promise the american people that i will be straight with you the truth be this do unfold more quickly than we have anticipate

 so what ’s happen afghanistan political leader give up and flee the country the afghan military collapse sometimes without try to fight

 if anything the development of the past week reinforce that end u.s. military involvement in afghanistan now be the right decision

 american troop can not and should not be fight in a war and die in a war that afghan force be not willing to fight for themselves we spend over a trillion dollar we train and equip an afghan military force of some 300,000 strong incredibly well equip a force large in size than the military of many of our nato ally

 we give they every tool they could need we pay their salary provide for the maintenance of their air force something the taliban do n’t have taliban do not have an air force we provide close air support

 we give they every chance to determine their own future what we could not provide they be the will to fight for that future

 there ’ some very brave and capable afghan special force unit and soldier but if afghanistan be unable to mount any real resistance to the taliban now there be no chance that 1 year—1 more year 5 more year or 20 more year of u.s. military boot on the ground would ’ve make any difference

 and here ’ what i believe to my core it be wrong to order american troop to step up when afghanistan ’s own armed force would not if the political leader of afghanistan be unable to come together for the good of their people unable to negotiate for the future of their country when the chip be down they would never have do so while u.s. troop remain in afghanistan bear the brunt of the fighting for they

 and our true strategic competitor china and russia would love nothing more than the united states to continue to funnel billion of dollar in resource and attention into stabilize afghanistan indefinitely

 when i host president ghani and chairman abdullah at the white house in june and again when i speak by phone to ghani in july we have very frank conversation we talk about how afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil war after the u.s. military depart to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the afghan people we talk extensively about the need for afghan leader to unite politically

 they fail to do any of that

 i also urge they to engage in diplomacy to seek a political settlement with the taliban this advice be flatly refuse mr. ghani insist the afghan force would fight but obviously he be wrong

 so i ’m leave again to ask of those who argue that we should stay how many more generation of america ’s daughter and son would you have i send to fight afghans afghanistan ’s civil war when afghan troop will not   how many more life american life be it worth how many endless row of headstone at arlington national cemetery

 i ’m clear on my answer i will not repeat the mistake we ’ve make in the past the mistake of stay and fight indefinitely in a conflict that be not in the national interest of the united states of double down on a civil war in a foreign country of attempt to remake a country through the endless military deployment of u.s. force

 those be the mistake we can not continue to repeat because we have significant vital interest in the world that we can not afford to ignore

 i also want to acknowledge how painful this be to so many of we the scene we ’re see in afghanistan they ’re gut wrench particularly for our veteran our diplomat humanitarian worker for anyone who have spend time on the ground work to support the afghan people

 for those who have lose love one in afghanistan and for americans who have fight and serve in the country serve our country in afghanistan this be deeply deeply personal

 it be for i as well i ’ve work on these issue as long as anyone i ’ve be throughout afghanistan during this war while the war be go on from kabul to kandahar to the kunar valley

 i ’ve travel there on four different occasion i meet with the people i ’ve speak to the leader i spend time with our troop and i come to understand firsthand what be and be not possible in afghanistan

 so now we ’re fercu sic]—focuse on what be possible

 we will continue to support the afghan people we will lead with our diplomacy our international influence and our humanitarian aid

 we ’ll continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instability

 we ’ll continue to speak out for the basic right of the afghan people of woman and girl just as we speak out all over the world

 i have be clear that human right must be the center of our foreign policy not the periphery but the way to do it be not through endless military deployment it ’s with our diplomacy our economic tool and rally the world to join we

 now let i lay out the current mission in afghanistan i be ask to authorize and i did—6,000 u.s. troop to deploy to afghanistan for the purpose of assist in the departure of u.s. and allied civilian personnel from afghanistan and to evacuate our afghan ally and vulnerable afghans to safety outside of afghanistan

 our troop be work to secure the airfield and to ensure continued operation of both the civilian and military flight we ’re take over air traffic control

 we have safely shut down our embassy and transfer our diplomat our dip-—our diplomatic presence be now consolidate at the airport as well

 over the come day we intend to transport out thousand of american citizen who have be live and work in afghanistan

 we ’ll also continue to support the safe departure of civilian personnel the civilian personnel of our allies who be still serve in afghanistan

 operation allies refugee refuge which i announce back in july have already move 2,000 afghans who be eligible for special immigration visas and their family to the united states

 in the come day the u.s. military will provide assistance to move more siv eligible afghans and their family out of afghanistan

 we ’re also expand refugee access to cover other vulnerable afghans who work for our embassy u.s. non governmental agency or the u.s. non governmental organization and afghans who otherwise be at great risk and u.s. news agency

 i know that there be concern about why we do not begin evacuate afghans civilian soon part of the answer be some of the afghans do not want to leave early still hopeful for their country and part of it be because the afghan government and its supporter discourage we from organize a mass exodus to avoid trigger as they say a crisis of confidence

 american troop be perform this mission as professionally and as effectively as they always do but it be not without risk

 as we carry out this departure we have make it clear to the taliban if they attack our personnel or disrupt our operation the u.s. presence will be swift and the response will be swift and forceful we will defend our people with devastating force if necessary

 our current military mission will be short in time limit in scope and focus in its objective get our people and our ally to safety as quickly as possible

 and once we have complete this mission we will conclude our military withdrawal we will end america ’s long war after 20 long year of bloodshed

 the event we ’re see now be sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable united and secure afghanistan as know in history as the graveyard of empire

 what be happen now could just as easily have happen 5 year ago or 15 year in the future we have to be honest our mission in afghanistan have take many misstep make many misstep over the past two decade

 i ’m now the fourth american president to preside over war in afghanistan two democrats and two republicans i will not pass this responsibly on responsibility on to a fifth president

 i will not mislead the american people by claim that just a little more time in afghanistan will make all the difference nor will i shrink from my share of responsibility for where we be today and how we must move forward from here

 i be president of the united states of america and the buck stop with i

 i be deeply sadden by the fact we now face but i do not regret my decision to end america ’s warfighting in afghanistan and maintain a laser focus on our counterterrorism mission there and in other part of the world

 our mission to degrade the terrorist threat of al qaeda in afghanistan and kill osama bin laden be a success

 our decade long effort to overcome century of history and permanently change and remake afghanistan be not and i write and believe it never could be

 i can not and i will not ask our troop to fight on endlessly in another in another country ’s civil war take casualty suffer life shatter injury leave family break by grief and loss

 this be not in our national security interest it be not what the american people want it be not what our troop who have sacrifice so much over the past two decade deserve

 i make a commitment to the american people when i run for president that i would bring america ’s military involvement in afghanistan to an end and while it ’s be hard and messy and yes far from perfect i’ve honor that commitment

 more importantly i make a commitment to the brave man and woman who serve this nation that i be not go to ask they to continue to risk their life in a military action that should have end long ago

 our leader do that in vietnam when i get here as a young man i will not do it in afghanistan

 i know my decision will be criticize but i would rather take all that criticism than pass this decision on to another president of the united states yet another one a fifth one

 because it ’s the right one it ’s the right decision for our people the right one for our brave service member who have risk their life serve our nation and it ’ the right one for america

 so thank you may god protect our troop our diplomat and all of the brave americans serve in harm ’s way

the president be a tough day this evening in kabul as you all know terrorist attack that we ’ve be talk about and worry about that the intelligence community have assess have be undertake an attack by a group know as isis k take the life of american service member stand guard at the airport and wound several other seriously they also wound a number of civilian and civilian be kill as well

 i ’ve be engage all day and in constant contact with the military commander here in washington the pentagon as well as in afghanistan and doha and my commander here in washington and in the field have be on this with great detail and you ’ve have a chance to speak to some so far

 the situation on the ground be still evolve and i ’m constantly be update

 these american service member who give their life it ’ an overused word but it ’ totally appropriate they be hero hero who have be engage in a dangerous selfless mission to save the life of other

 they be part of an airlift an evacuation effort unlike any see in history with more than 100,000 american citizen american partner afghans who help we and other take to safety in the last 11 day just in the last 12 hour or so another 7,000 have get out

 they be part of the brave most capable and the most selfless military on the face of the earth and they be part of simply what i call the backbone of america they ’re the spine of america the good the country have to offer

 jill and i our heart ache like i ’m sure all of you do as well for all those afghan family who have lose love one include small child or be wound in this vicious attack and we ’re outraged as well as heartbroken

 be the father of an army major who serve for a year in iraq and before that be in kosovo as a u.s. attorney for the well part of six month in the middle of a war when he come home after a year in iraq he be diagnose like many many come home with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brain who we lose

 we have some sense like many of you do what the family of these brave hero be feel today you get this feeling like you ’re be suck into a black hole in the middle of your chest there ’s no way out my heart ache for you

 but i know this we have a continue obligation a sacred obligation to all of you the family of those hero that obligation be not temporary it last forever

 the life we lose today be life give in the service of liberty the service of security in the service of other in the service of america

 like their fellow brother and sister in arm who die defend our vision and our value in the struggle against terrorism of the fall this day they ’re part of a great and noble company of american hero

 to those who carry out this attack as well as anyone who wish america harm know this we will not forgive we will not forget we will hunt you down and make you pay i will defend our interest and our people with every measure at my command

 over the past few week i know you’re many of you be probably tired of hear i say it we’ve be make aware by our intelligence community that the isis k an arch enemy of the taliban people who be free when both those prison be open have be plan a complex set of attack on the united states personnel and other

 this be why from the outset i ’ve repeatedly say this mission be extraordinarily dangerous and why i have be so determined to limit the duration of this mission

 and as general mckenzie say this be why our mission be design this be the way it be design to operate operate under severe stress and attack we ’ve know that from the beginning

 and as i ’ve be in constant contact with our senior military leader and i mean constant around the clock and our commander on the ground and throughout the day they make it clear that we can and we must complete this mission and we will and that ’ what i ’ve order they to do

 we will not be deter by terrorist we will not let they stop our mission we will continue the evacuation

 i ’ve also order my commander to develop operational plan to strike isis k asset leadership and facility we will respond with force and precision at our time at the place we choose and the moment of our choosing

 here be what you need to know these isis terrorist will not win we will rescue the americans who be there we will get out our afghan ally out and our mission will go on

 america will not be intimidate

 i have the utmost confidence in our brave service member who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save life and get americans our partner our afghan ally out of afghanistan

 every day when i talk to our commander i ask they what they need what more do they need if anything to get the job do as they will tell you i grant every request

 i reiterate to they again today on three occasion that they should take the maximum step necessary to protect our force on the ground in kabul

 and i also want to thank the secretary of defense and the military leadership at the pentagon and all the commander in the field there have be complete unanimity from every commander on the objective of this mission and the good way to achieve those objective

 those who have serve through the age have draw inspiration from the book of isaiah when the lord say whom shall i send who shall go for we and the american military have be answer for a long time here be i lord send i here i be send i

 each one of these woman and man of our armed force be the heir of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteer to go into harm ’s way to risk everything not for glory not for profit but to defend what we love and the people we love

 and i ask that you join i now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out uniform military and civilian who have give the last full measure of devotion

 a moment of silence be take

 thank you may god bless you all and may god protect those troop and all those stand watch for america we have so much to do it ’ within our capacity to do it we just have to remain steadfast steadfast

 we will complete our mission and we will continue after our troop have withdraw to find mean by which we define any american who wish to get out of afghanistan we will find they and we will get they out

 lady and gentleman they give i a list here the first person i be instruct to call on be kelly o’donnell of nbc

 q mr. president you have say leave afghanistan be in the national interest of the united states after today ’s attack do you believe you will authorize additional force to respond to that attack inside afghanistan and be you be you prepared to add additional force to protect those americans who remain on the ground carry out the evacuation operation

 the president i ’ve instruct the military whatever they need if they need additional force i will grant it but the military from the chairman of the joint chiefs the joint chiefs the commander in the field have all contact i one way or another usually by letter say they subscribe to the mission as design to get as many people out as we can within the timeframe that be allot that be the good way they believe to get as many americans out as possible and other

 and with regard to finding track down the isis leader who order this we have some reason to believe we know who they be not certain and we will find way of our choosing without large military operation to get they

 q inside afghanistan mr. president

 the president wherever they be

 trevor from reuters

 q thank you mr. president there have be some criticism even from people in your party about the dependence on the taliban to secure the perimeter of the airport do you feel like there be a mistake make in that regard

 the president no i do n’t look i think general mckenzie handle this question very well the fact be that we ’re in a situation we inherit a situation particularly since as we all know that the afghan military collapse 11 day before in 11 day that it be in the interest of as mackenzie say in the interest of the taliban that in fact isis k do not metastasize beyond what it be number one and number two it ’s in their interest that we be able to leave on time on target

 as a consequence of that the major thing we ’ve ask they move back the perimeter give i more space between the wall stop vehicle from come through et cetera search people come through it be not what you ’d call a tightly command regimented operation like the u.s. be the military be but they ’re act in their interest their interest

 and so by and large and i ’ve ask this same question to military on the ground whether or not it ’ a useful exercise no one trust they we ’re just count on their self interest to continue to generate their activity and it ’ in their self interest that we leave when we say and that we get as many people out as we can

 and like i say even in the midst of everything that happen today over 7,000 people have get out over 5,000 americans overall

 so it ’ not a matter of trust it ’ a matter of mutual self interest and but there be no evidence thus far that i ’ve be give as a consequence by any of our commander in the field that there have be collusion between the taliban and isis in carry out what happen today both in front of the hotel and what be expect to continue for beyond today

 aamer associated press

 q thank you mr. president you have speak again powerfully about your own son and the weight of these decision with that in mind and also what you ’ve say that the long we stay the more likelihood that there would be a major attack how do you weigh stay even one more day consider what ’s happen

 the president because i think what america say matter what we say we ’re go to do and the context in which we say we ’re go to do it that we do it unless something exceptional change

 there be additional american citizen there be additional green card holder there be additional personnel of our ally there be additional siv card holder there be additional afghans that have help we and there be additional group of individual that have contact we from woman ’s group to ngos and other who have expressly indicate they want to get out and have gather in certain circumstance in group on bus and other mean that still present the opportunity for the next several day between now and the 31st to be able to get they out

 and our military and i believe to the extent that we can do that know the threat know that we may very well have another attack the military have conclude that ’ what we should do i think they ’re right i think they ’re correct

 and after that we ’re go to be in a circumstance where there be will be i believe numerous opportunity to continue to provide access for additional person to get out of afghanistan either through mean that we provide and/or be provide through cooperation with the taliban they ’re not good guy the taliban i ’m not suggest that at all but they have a keen interest as many of you have be report they very much would like to figure out how to keep the airport open they do not have the capacity to do it they very much be try to figure out whether or not they can maintain what be the portion of an economy that have become not robust but fundamentally different than it have be

 and so there ’s a lot of reason why they have reach out not just to we but to other as to why it would be continue in their interest to get more of the personnel we want to get out we can locate they

 now there ’ not many leave that we can assess that be want to come out there ’ some americans we ’ve identify we’ve contact the vast majority of they if not all of they who do not want to leave because they have sig-—they’re dual national they have extend family et cetera and there ’s other who be look for the time so that ’ why we continue

 i ’ll take a few more question and but you sir

 q thank you mr. president

 the president i do not pick you but that ’ okay laughs

 q i want to ask you you say that what america say matter what do you say to the afghans who help troop who may not be able to get out by august 31st what

 the president i say

 q what do you say to they

 the president:—we’re go to continue to try to get you out it matter

 look i know of no conflict as a student of history no conflict where when a war be end one side be able to guarantee that everyone that want to be extract from that country would get out

 and think about it folk i think it ’ important for i know the american people get this in their gut there be i would argue million of afghani citizen who be not taliban who do not actively cooperate with we as siv who if give a chance they ’d be onboard a plane tomorrow it sound ridiculous but the vast majority of people in community like that want to come to america give a choice

 so get every single person out be can’t be guarantee to anybody because there ’ a determination all who want to get out as well

 at any rate it ’ a process

 i be really point to you but you sir

 q thank you mr. president there be report that u.s. official provide the taliban with name of americans and afghan official to evacuate be you aware of that do that happen

 and then sir do you personally reject a recommendation to hold or to recapture bagram air force base

 the president here ’s what i ’ve do on the ask this i’ll answer the last question first

 on the tactical question of how to conduct an evacuation or a war i gather up all the major military personnel that be in afghanistan the commander as well as the pentagon and i ask for their good military judgment what would be the most efficient way to accomplish the mission

 they conclude the military that bagram be not much value add that it be much wise to focus on kabul and so i follow that recommendation

 with regard to there be certain circumstance where we ’ve get information and quite frankly sometimes from some of you say you know of such and such a group of people who be try to get out and they ’re on a bus they ’re move ”—from other people—“and this be their location

 and there have be occasion when our military have contact their military counterpart in the taliban and say this ”—for example this bus be come through with x number of people on it make up of the follow group of people we want you to let that bus or that group through

 so yes there have be occasion like that

 and to the good of my knowledge in those case the bulk of that have occur they’ve be let through but i can not tell you with any certitude that there ’s actually be a list of name i don’t there may have be but i know of no circumstance it do not mean it ’s not it do not exist that here ’ the name of 12 people they ’re come let they through it could very well have happen

 i ’ll take one more question

 q mr. president can i

 q mr. president right here mr. president

 the president whoa wait wait wait let i take the one question from the most interesting guy that i know in the press

 q thank you mr. president be that be there thank you

 the president that ’s you laughter

 q mr. president there have not be a u.s. service member kill in combat in afghanistan since february of 2020 you set a deadline you pull troop out you send troop back in and now 12 marines be dead you say the buck stop with you do you bear any responsibility for the way that thing have unfold in the last two week

 the president i bear responsibility for fundamentally all that ’ happen of late

 but here ’ the deal you know i wish you ’d one day say these thing you know as well as i do that the former president make a deal with the taliban that he would get all american force out of afghanistan by may 1

 in return the commitment be make and that be a year before in return he be give a commitment that the taliban would continue to attack other but would not attack any american force

 remember that i ’m be serious

 q mr. president

 the president no i i’m ask you a question be a because before i

 q donald trump be not the president right now

 the president no no now wait a minute i ’m ask you a question be that be that accurate to the good of your knowledge

 q i know what you ’re talk about but mr. president respectfully

 the president what

 q:—since i do not think that the issue that do you think that people have an issue with pull out of afghanistan or just the way that thing have happen

 the president i think they have an issue that people be likely to get hurt some as we ’ve see have get kill and that it be messy

 the reason why whether my friend will acknowledge it and be report it the reason why there be no attack on americans as you say from the date until i come into office be because the commitment be make by president trump i will be out by may 1st in the meantime you agree not to attack any americans that be the deal that ’s why no american be attack

 q and you say that you still a few day ago you say you squarely stand by your decision to pull out

 the president yes i do because look at it this way folk and i ’m go to i have another meeting for real but imagine where we ’d be if i have indicate on may the 1st i be not go to renegotiate an evacuation date we be go to stay there

 i ’d have only one alternative pour thousand of more troop back into afghanistan to fight a war that we have already win relative be why the reason we go in the first place

 i have never be of the view that we should be sacrifice american life to try to establish a democratic government in afghanistan a country that have never once in its entire history be a united country and be make up and i do not mean this in a derogatory make up of different tribe who have never ever ever get along with one another

 and so as i say before and this be the last comment i ’ll make but we ’ll have more chance to talk about this unfortunately beyond because we ’re not out yet if osama bin laden as well as al qaeda have choose to launch an attack when they leave saudi arabia out of yemen would we have ever go to afghanistan even though the taliban completely control afghanistan at the time would we have ever go

 i know it ’ not fair to ask you question it ’ rhetorical but raise your hand if you think we should have go and give up thousand of life and ten of thousand of wounded

 our interest in go be to prevent al qaeda from reemerge first to get bin laden wipe out al qaeda in afghanistan and prevent that from happen again

 as i ’ve say 100 time terrorism have metastasize around the world we have great threat come out of other country a heck of a lot close to the united states

 we do not have military encampment there we do not keep people there we have over the horizon capability to keep they from go after we

 lady and gentleman it be time to end a 20 year war

 thank you so much

the president last night in kabul the united states end 20 year of war in afghanistan the long war in american history

 we complete one of the big airlift in history with more than 120,000 people evacuate to safety that number be more than double what most expert think be possible no nation no nation have ever do anything like it in all of history only the united states have the capacity and the will and the ability to do it and we do it today

 the extraordinary success of this mission be due to the incredible skill bravery and selfless courage of the united states military and our diplomat and intelligence professional

 for week they risk their life to get american citizen afghans who help we citizen of our allies and partner and other onboard plane and out of the country and they do it face a crush of enormous crowd seek to leave the country and they do it know isis k terrorist swear enemy of the taliban be lurk in the midst of those crowd

 and still the man and woman of the united states military our diplomatic corps and intelligence professional do their job and do it well risk their life not for professional gain but to serve other not in a mission of war but in a mission of mercy twenty service member be wound in the service of this mission thirteen hero give their life

 i be just at dover air force base for the dignified transfer we owe they and their family a debt of gratitude we can never repay but we should never ever ever forget

 in april i make the decision to end this war as part of that decision we set the date of august 31st for american troop to withdraw the assumption be that more than 300,000 afghan national security forces that we have train over the past two decade and equip would be a strong adversary in their civil war with the taliban

 that assumption that the afghan government would be able to hold on for a period of time beyond military drawdown turn out not to be accurate

 but i still instruct our national security team to prepare for every eventuality even that one and that ’ what we do

 so we be ready when the afghan security forces after two decade of fighting for their country and lose thousand of their own do not hold on as long as anyone expect

 we be ready when they and the people of afghanistan watch their own government collapse and their president flee amid the corruption and malfeasance hand over the country to their enemy the taliban and significantly increase the risk to u.s. personnel and our allies

 as a result to safely extract american citizen before august 31st as well as embassy personnel ally and partner and those afghans who have work with we and fight alongside of we for 20 year i have authorize 6,000 troop american troop to kabul to help secure the airport

 as general mckenzie say this be the way the mission be design it be design to operate under severe stress and attack and that ’ what it do

 since march we reach out 19 time to americans in afghanistan with multiple warning and offer to help they leave afghanistan all the way back as far as march after we start the evacuation 17 day ago we do initial outreach and analysis and identify around 5,000 americans who have decide early to stay in afghanistan but now want to leave

 our operation allied rescue allies refuge end up get more than 5,500 americans out we get out thousand of citizen and diplomat from those country that go into afghanistan with we to get bin laden we get out locally employ staff of the united states embassy and their family total roughly 2,500 people we get thousand of afghan translator and interpreter and other who support the united states out as well

 now we believe that about 100 to 200 americans remain in afghanistan with some intention to leave most of those who remain be dual citizen long time resident who have early decide to stay because of their family root in afghanistan

 the bottom line ninety ninety eight percent of americans in afghanistan who want to leave be able to leave

 and for those remain americans there be no deadline we remain committed to get they out if they want to come out secretary of state blinken be lead the continue diplomatic effort to ensure a safe passage for any american afghan partner or foreign national who want to leave afghanistan

 in fact just yesterday the united nations security council pass a resolution that send a clear message about what the international community expect the taliban to deliver on move forward notably freedom of travel freedom to leave and together we be join by over 100 country that be determined to make sure the taliban uphold those commitment

 it will include ongoing effort in afghanistan to reopen the airport as well as overland route allow for continued departure to those who want to leave and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of afghanistan

 the taliban have make public commitment broadcast on television and radio across afghanistan on safe passage for anyone want to leave include those who work alongside americans we do not take they by their word alone but by their action and we have leverage to make sure those commitment be meet

 let i be clear leave august the 31st be not due to an arbitrary deadline it be design to save american life

 my predecessor the former president sign an agreement with the taliban to remove u.s. troop by may the 1st just month after i be inaugurate it include no requirement that the taliban work out a cooperative governing arrangement with the afghan government but it do authorize the release of 5,000 prisoner last year include some of the taliban ’s top war commander among those who just take control of afghanistan

 and by the time i come to office the taliban be in its strong military position since 2001 control or contest nearly half of the country

 the previous administration ’s agreement say that if we stick to the may 1st deadline that they have sign on to leave by the taliban would not attack any american force but if we stay all bet be off

 so we be leave with a simple decision either follow through on the commitment make by the last administration and leave afghanistan or say we be not leave and commit another ten of thousand more troop go back to war

 that be the choice the real choice between leave or escalating

 i be not go to extend this forever war and i be not extend a forever exit the decision to end the military airlift operation at kabul airport be base on the unanimous recommendation of my civilian and military advisor the secretary of state the secretary of defense the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and all the service chief and the commander in the field

 their recommendation be that the safe way to secure the passage of the remain americans and other out of the country be not to continue with 6,000 troop on the ground in harm ’s way in kabul but rather to get they out through non military mean

 in the 17 day that we operate in kabul after the taliban seize power we engage in an around the clock effort to provide every american the opportunity to leave our state department be work 24/7 contact and talk and in some case walk americans into the airport

 again more than 5,500 americans be airlift out and for those who remain we will make arrangement to get they out if they so choose

 as for the afghans we and our partner have airlift 100,000 of they no country in history have do more to airlift out the resident of another country than we have do we will continue to work to help more people leave the country who be at risk and we ’re far from do

 for now i urge all americans to join i in grateful prayer for our troop and diplomat and intelligence officer who carry out this mission of mercy in kabul and at tremendous risk with such unparalleled result an airma-—an airlift that evacuate ten of thousand to a network of volunteer and veteran who help identifie identify those need evacuation guide they to the airport and provide they for their support along the way

 we ’re go to continue to need their help we need your help and i ’m look forward to meet with you

 and to everyone who be now offer or who will offer to welcome afghan ally to their home around the world include in america we thank you

 i take responsibility for the decision now some say we should have start mass evacuation soon and could not this have be do have be do in a more orderly manner i respectfully disagree

 imagine if we have begin evacuation in june or july bring in thousand of american troop and evacuate more than 120,000 people in the middle of a civil war there still would have be a rush to the airport a breakdown in confidence and control of the government and it still would have be a very difficult and dangerous mission

 the bottom line be there be no evacuatio-—evacuation from the end of a war that you can run without the kind of complexity challenge and threat we face none

 there be those who would say we should have stay indefinitely for year on end they ask why do n’t we just keep do what we be do why do we have to change anything

 the fact be everything have change my predecessor have make a deal with the taliban when i come into office we face a deadline may 1 the taliban onslaught be come

 we face one of two choice follow the agreement of the previous administration and extend it to have or extend to more time for people to get out or send in thousand of more troop and escalate the war

 to those ask for a third decade of war in afghanistan i ask what be the vital national interest in my view we only have one to make sure afghanistan can never be use again to launch an attack on our homeland

 remember why we go to afghanistan in the first place because we be attack by osama bin laden and al qaeda on september 11th 2001 and they be base in afghanistan

 we deliver justice to bin laden on may 2nd 2011 over a decade ago al qaeda be decimate

 i respectfully suggest you ask yourself this question if we have be attack on september 11 2001 from yemen instead of afghanistan would we have ever go to war in afghanistan even though the taliban control afghanistan in 2001 i believe the honest answer be no that ’s because we have no vital national interest in afghanistan other than to prevent an attack on america ’s homeland and their fr-—our friend and that ’ true today

 we succeed in what we set out to do in afghanistan over a decade ago then we stay for another decade it be time to end this war

 this be a new world the terror threat have metastasize across the world well beyond afghanistan we face threat from al shabaab in somalia al qaeda affiliate in syria and the arabian peninsula and isis attempt to create a caliphate in syria and iraq and establish affiliate across africa and asia

 the fundamental obligation of a president in my opinion be to defend and protect america not against threat of 2001 but against the threat of 2021 and tomorrow

 that be the guide principle behind my decision about afghanistan i simply do not believe that the safety and security of america be enhance by continue to deploy thousand of american troop and spend billion of dollar a year in afghanistan

 but i also know that the threat from terrorism continue in its pernicious and evil nature but it ’s change expand to other country our strategy have to change too

 we will maintain the fight against terrorism in afghanistan and other country we just do not need to fight a ground war to do it we have what ’s call over the horizon capability which mean we can strike terrorist and target without american boot on the ground or very few if need

 we ’ve show that capacity just in the last week we strike isis k remotely day after they murder 13 of our service member and dozen of innocent afghans

 and to isis k we be not do with you yet

 as commander in chief i firmly believe the good path to guard our safety and our security lie in a tough unforgiving targeted precise strategy that go after terror where it be today not where it be two decade ago that ’ what ’ in our national interest

 and here ’ a critical thing to understand the world be change we ’re engage in a serious competition with china we ’re deal with the challenge on multiple front with russia we ’re confront with cyberattack and nuclear proliferation

 we have to shore up america ’s competitive[ness to meet these new challenge in the competition for the 21st century and we can do both fight terrorism and take on new threat that be here now and will continue to be here in the future

 and there ’ nothing china or russia would rather have would want more in this competition than the united states to be bogge down another decade in afghanistan

 as we turn the page on the foreign policy that have guide our nat-—our nation the last two decade we ’ve get to learn from our mistake

 to i there be two that be paramount first we must set mission with clear achievable goal not one we ’ll never reach and second we must stay clearly focus on the fundamental national security interest of the united states of america

 this decision about afghanistan be not just about afghanistan it ’ about end an era of major military operation to remake other country

 we see a mission of counterterrorism in afghanistan get the terrorist and stop attack morph into a counterinsurgency nation building try to create a democratic cohesive and unify afghanistan something that have never be do over the many century of afghans afghanistan ’s history

 move on from that mindset and those kind of large scale troop deployment will make we strong and more effective and safe at home

 and for anyone who get the wrong idea let i say it clearly to those who wish america harm to those that engage in terrorism against we and our ally know this the united states will never rest we will not forgive we will not forget we will hunt you down to the end of the earth and we will you will pay the ultimate price

 and let i be clear we will continue to support the afghan people through diplomacy international influence and humanitarian aid we ’ll continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instability we ’ll continue to speak out for basic right of the afghan people especially woman and girl as we speak out for woman and girl all around the globe and i ’ve be clear that human right will be the center of our foreign policy

 but the way to do that be not through endless military deployment but through diplomacy economic tool and rally the rest of the world for support

 my fellow americans the war in afghanistan be now over i ’m the fourth president who have face the issue of whether and when to end this war when i be run for president i make a commitment to the american people that i would end this war and today i ’ve honor that commitment it be time to be honest with the american people again we no long have a clear purpose in an open ended mission in afghanistan

 after 20 year of war in afghanistan i refuse to send another generation of america ’s son and daughter to fight a war that should have end long ago

 after more than $ 2 trillion spend in afghanistan a cost that researcher at brown university estimate would be over $ 300 million a day for 20 year in afghanistan for two decade yes the american people should hear this $ 300 million a day for two decade

 if you take the number of $ 1 trillion as many say that ’s still $ 150 million a day for two decade and what have we lose as a consequence in term of opportunity i refuse to continue in a war that be no long in the service of the vital national interest of our people

 and most of all after 800,000 americans serve in afghanistan i’ve travel that whole country brave and honorable service after 20,744 american serviceman and woman injure and the loss of 2,461 american personnel include 13 life lose just this week i refuse to open another decade of warfare in afghanistan

 we ’ve be a nation too long at war if you ’re 20 year old today you have never know an america at peace

 so when i hear that we could ’ve should ’ve continue the so call low grade effort in afghanistan at low risk to our service member at low cost i do not think enough people understand how much we have ask of the 1 percent of this country who put that uniform on who be willing to put their life on the line in defense of our nation

 maybe it ’s because my deceased son beau serve in iraq for a full year before that well maybe it ’ because of what i ’ve see over the year as senator vice president and president travel these country

 a lot of our veteran and their family have go through hell deployment after deployment month and year away from their family miss birthday anniversary empty chair at holiday financial struggle divorce loss of limb traumatic brain injury post traumatic stress

 we see it in the struggle many have when they come home we see it in the strain on their family and caregiver we see it in the strain of their family when they ’re not there we see it in the grief bear by their survivor the cost of war they will carry with they their whole life

 most tragically we see it in the shocking and stunning statistic that should give pause to anyone who think war can ever be low grade low risk or low cost 18 veteran on average who die by suicide every single day in america not in a far off place but right here in america

 there ’ nothing low grade or low risk or low cost about any war it ’ time to end the war in afghanistan

 as we close 20 year of war and strife and pain and sacrifice it ’ time to look to the future not the past to a future that ’ safe to a future that ’s more secure to a future that honor those who serve and all those who give what president lincoln call their last full measure of devotion

 i give you my word with all of my heart i believe this be the right decision a wise decision and the good decision for america

 thank you thank you and may god bless you all and may god protect our troop

the president good evening my fellow americans i want to talk to you about where we be in the battle against covid-19 the progress we ’ve make and the work we have leave to do

 and it start with understand this even as the delta variant 19 sic have covid-19 have be hit this country hard we have the tool to combat the virus if we can come together as a country and use those tool

 if we raise our vaccination rate protect ourselves and other with mask and expand testing and identify people who be infect we can and we will turn the tide on covid-19

 it will take a lot of hard work and it ’s go to take some time many of we be frustrate with the nearly 80 million americans who be still not vaccinate even though the vaccine be safe effective and free

 you might be confuse about what be true and what be false about covid-19 so before i outline the new step to fight covid-19 that i ’m go to be announce tonight let i give you some clear information about where we stand

 first we have con we have make considerable progress

 in battle covid-19 when i become president about 2 million americans be fully vaccinate today over 175 million americans have that protection

 before i take office we have not order enough vaccine for every american just week in office we do the week before i take office on january 20th of this year over 25,000 americans die that week from covid-19 last week that grim weekly toll be down 70 percent

 and in the three month before i take office our economy be falter create just 50,000 job a month we ’re now average 700,000 new job a month in the past three month

 this progress be real but while america be in much well shape than it be seven month ago when i take office i need to tell you a second fact

 we ’re in a tough stretch and it could last for a while the highly contagious delta variant that i begin to warn america about back in july spread in late summer like it do in other country before we

 while the vaccine provide strong protection for the vaccinate we read about we hear about and we see the story of hospitalize people people on their death bed among the unvaccinated over these past few week

 this be a pandemic of the unvaccinated and it ’s cause by the fact that despite america have an unprecedented and successful vaccination program despite the fact that for almost five month free vaccine have be available in 80,000 different location we still have nearly 80 million americans who have fail to get the shot

 and to make matter bad there be elect official actively work to undermine the fight against covid-19 instead of encourage people to get vaccinate and mask up they ’re order mobile morgue for the unvaccinated die from covid in their community this be totally unacceptable

 third if you wonder how all this add up here ’ the math the vast majority of americans be do the right thing nearly three quarter of the eligible have get at least one shot but one quarter have not get any that ’s nearly 80 million americans not vaccinate and in a country as large as ours that ’ 25 percent minority that 25 percent can cause a lot of damage and they be

 the unvaccinated overcrowd our hospital be overrun the emergency room and intensive care unit leave no room for someone with a heart attack or pancreitis pancreatitis or cancer

 and fourth i want to emphasize that the vaccine provide very strong protection from severe illness from covid-19 i know there ’ a lot of confusion and misinformation but the world ’s lead scientist confirm that if you be fully vaccinate your risk of severe illness from covid-19 be very low

 in fact base on available datum from the summer only one of out of every 160,000 fully vaccinate americans be hospitalize for covid per day

 these be the fact

 so here ’s where we stand the path ahead even with the delta variant be not nearly as bad as last winter but what make it incredibly more frustrating be that we have the tool to combat covid-19 and a distinct minority of americans support by a distinct minority of elect official be keep we from turn the corner these pandemic politic as i refer to be make people sick cause unvaccinated people to die

 we can not allow these action to stand in the way of protect the large majority of americans who have do their part and want to get back to life as normal

 as your president i ’m announce tonight a new plan to require more americans to be vaccinate to combat those block public health

 my plan also increase testing protect our economy and will make our kid safe in school it consist of six broad area of action and many specific measure in each that and each of those action that you can read more about at whitehouse.gov whitehouse.gov

 the measure these be go to take time to have full impact but if we implement they i believe and the scientist indicate that in the month ahead we can reduce the number of unvaccinated americans decrease hospitalization and death and allow our child to go to school safely and keep our economy strong by keep business open

 first we must increase vaccination among the unvaccinated with new vaccination requirement of the nearly 80 million eligible americans who have not gotten vaccinate many say they be wait for approval from the food and drug administration the fda well last month the fda grant that approval

 so the time for wait be over this summer we make progress through the combination of vaccine requirement and incentive as well as the fda approval four million more people get their first shot in august than they do in july

 but we need to do more this be not about freedom or personal choice it ’ about protect yourself and those around you the people you work with the people you care about the people you love

 my job as president be to protect all americans

 so tonight i ’m announce that the department of labor be develop an emergency rule to require all employer with 100 or more employee that together employ over 80 million worker to ensure their workforce be fully vaccinate or show a negative test at least once a week

 some of the big company be already require this united airlines disney tysons food and even fox news

 the bottom line we ’re go to protect vaccinate worker from unvaccinated co worker we ’re go to reduce the spread of covid-19 by increase the share of the workforce that be vaccinate in business all across america

 my plan will extend the vaccination requirement that i previously issue in the healthcare field already i ’ve announce we ’ll be require vaccination that all nursing home worker who treat patient on medicare and medicaid because i have that federal authority

 tonight i ’m use that same authority to expand that to cover those who work in hospital home healthcare facility or other medical facility a total of 17 million healthcare worker

 if you ’re seek care at a health facility you should be able to know that the people treat you be vaccinate simple straightforward period

 next i will sign an executive order that will now require all executive branch federal employee to be vaccinate all and i ’ve sign another executive order that will require federal contractor to do the same

 if you want to work with the federal government and do business with we get vaccinate if you want to do business with the federal government vaccinate your workforce

 and tonight i ’m remove one of the last remain obstacle that make it difficult for you to get vaccinate

 the department of labor will require employer with 100 or more worker to give those worker pay time off to get vaccinate no one should lose pay in order to get vaccinate or take a love one to get vaccinate

 today in total the vaccine requirement in my plan will affect about 100 million americans two third of all worker

 and for other sector i issue this appeal to those of you run large entertainment venue from sport arena to concert venue to movie theater please require folk to get vaccinate or show a negative test as a condition of entry

 and to the nation ’s family physician pediatrician gps general practitioner you’re the most trust medical voice to your patient you may be the one person who can get someone to change their mind about be vaccinate

 tonight i ’m ask each of you to reach out to your unvaccinated patient over the next two week and make a personal appeal to they to get the shot america need your personal involvement in this critical effort

 and my message to unvaccinated americans be this what more be there to wait for what more do you need to see we ’ve make vaccination free safe and convenient

 the vaccine have fda approval over 200 million americans have get at least one shot

 we ’ve be patient but our patience be wear thin and your refusal have cost all of we so please do the right thing but just do not take it from i listen to the voice of unvaccinated americans who be lie in hospital bed take their final breath say if only i have get vaccinate if only

 it ’ a tragedy please do not let it become your

 the second piece of my plan be continue to protect the vaccinated

 for the vast majority of you who have gotten vaccinate i understand your anger at those who have n’t gotten vaccinate i understand the anxiety about get a breakthrough case

 but as the science make clear if you ’re fully vaccinate you ’re highly protect from severe illness even if you get covid-19

 in fact recent datum indicate there be only one confirm positive case per 5,000 fully vaccinate americans per day

 you ’re as safe as possible and we ’re do everything we can to keep it that way keep it that way keep you safe

 that ’s where booster come in the shot that give you even more protection than after your second shot

 now i know there ’s be some confusion about booster so let i be clear last month our top government doctor announce an initial plan for booster shot for vaccinate americans they believe that a booster be likely to provide the high level of protection yet

 of course the decision of which booster shot to give when to start they and who will give they will be leave completely to the scientist at the fda and the centers for disease control

 but while we wait we ’ve do our part we ’ve buy enough booster enough booster shot and the distribution system be ready to administer they

 as soon as they be authorize those eligible will be able to get a booster right away in ten of thousand of site across the site across the country for most americans at your nearby drug store and for free

 the third piece of my plan be keep and maybe the most important be keep our child safe and our school open for any parent it do not matter how low the risk of any illness or accident be when it come to your child or grandchild trust i i know

 so let i speak to you directly let i speak to you directly to help ease some of your worry

 it come down to two separate category child age 12 and old who be eligible for a vaccine now and child age 11 and under who be not be yet eligible

 the safe thing for your child 12 and old be to get they vaccinate they get vaccinate for a lot of thing that ’s it get they vaccinate

 as with adult almost all the serious covid-19 case we ’re see among adolescent be in unvaccinated 12- to 17 year old an age group that lag behind in vaccination rate

 so parent please get your teenager vaccinate

 what about child under the age of 12 who can not get vaccinate yet well the good way for a parent to protect their child under the age of 12 start at home every parent every teen sibling every caregiver around they should be vaccinate

 child have four time high chance of getting hospitalize if they live in a state with low vaccination rate rather than the state with high vaccination rate

 now if you ’re a parent of a young child you ’re wonder when will it be when will it be the vaccine available for they i strongly support an independent scientific review for vaccine use for child under 12 we can not take shortcut with that scientific work

 but i ’ve make it clear i will do everything within my power to support the fda with any resource it need to continue to do this as safely and as quickly as possible and our nation ’s top doctor be commit to keep the public at large update on the process so parent can plan

 now to the school we know that if school follow the science and implement the safety measure like testing masking adequate ventilation system that we provide the money for social distancing and vaccination then child can be safe from covid-19 in school

 today about 90 percent of school staff and teacher be vaccinate we should get that to 100 percent my administration have already acquire teacher at the school run by the defense department because i have the authority as president in the federal system the defense department and the interior department to get vaccinate that ’s authority i possess

 tonight i ’m announce that we ’ll require all of nearly 300,000 educator in the federal pay program head start program must be vaccinate as well to protect your young our young most precious americans and give parent the comfort

 and tonight i ’m call on all governor to require vaccination for all teacher and staff some already have do so but we need more to step up

 vaccination requirement in school be nothing new they work they ’re overwhelmingly support by educator and their union and to all school official try to do the right thing by our child i ’ll always be on your side

 let i be blunt my plan also take on elect official and state that be undermine you and these lifesave action right now local school official be try to keep child safe in a pandemic while their governor pick a fight with they and even threaten their salary or their job talk about bully in school if they ’ll not help if these governor will not help we beat the pandemic i ’ll use my power as president to get they out of the way

 the department of education have already begin to take legal action against state undermine protection that local school official have order any teacher or school official whose pay be withhold for do the right thing we will have that pay restore by the federal government 100 percent i promise you i will have your back

 the fourth piece of my plan be increase testing and masking from the start america have fail to do enough covid-19 testing in order to well detect and control the delta variant i ’m take step tonight to make testing more available more affordable and more convenient i ’ll use the defense production act to increase production of rapid test include those that you can use at home

 while that production be ramp up my administration have work with top retailer like walmart amazon and kroger ’s and tonight we ’re announce that no later than next week each of these outlet will start to sell at home rapid test kit at cost for the next three month this be an immediate price reduction for at home test kit for up to 35 percent reduction

 we ’ll also expand expand free testing at 10,000 pharmacy around the country and we ’ll commit we’re commit $ 2 billion to purchase nearly 300 million rapid test for distribution to community health center food bank school so that every american no matter their income can access free and convenient test this be important to everyone particularly for a parent or a child with a child not old enough to be vaccinate you ’ll be able to test they at home and test those around they

 in addition to testing we know mask help stop the spread of covid-19 that ’ why when i come into office i require mask for all federal building and on federal land on airline and other mode of transportation

 today tonight i ’m announce that the transportation safety administration the tsa will double the fine on traveler that refuse to mask if you break the rule be prepare to pay

 and by the way show some respect the anger you see on television toward flight attendant and other do their job be wrong it ’ ugly

 the fifth piece of my plan be protect our economic recovery because of our vaccination program and the american rescue plan which we pass early in my administration we ’ve have record job creation for a new administration economic growth unmatched in 40 year we can not let unvaccinated do this progress undo it turn it back

 so tonight i ’m announce additional step to strengthen our economic recovery we ’ll be expand covid-19 economic injury disaster loan program that ’ a program that ’s go to allow small business to borrow up to $ 2 million from the current $ 500,000 to keep go if covid-19 impact on their sale

 these low interest long term loan require no repayment for two year and be can use to hire and retain worker purchase inventory or even pay down high cost debt rack up since the pandemic begin i ’ll also be take additional step to help small business stay afloat during the pandemic

 sixth we ’re go to continue to improve the care of those who do get covid-19 in early july i announce the deployment of surge response team these be team comprise of expert from the department of health and human services the cdc the defense department and the federal emergency management agency fema to area in the country that need help to stem the spread of covid-19

 since then the federal government have deploy nearly 1,000 staff include doctor nurse paramedic into 18 state today i ’m announce that the defense department will double the number of military health team that they ’ll deploy to help their fellow americans in hospital around the country

 additionally we ’re increase the availability of new medicine recommend by real doctor not conspir-—conspiracy theorist the monoclonal antibody treatment have be show to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70 percent for unvaccinated people at risk of develop sefe-—severe disease

 we ’ve already distribute 1.4 million course of these treatment to save life and reduce the strain on hospital tonight i ’m announce we will increase the average pace of shipment across the country of free monoclonal antibody treatment by another 50 percent

 before i close let i say this community of color be disproportionately impact by this virus and as we continue to battle covid-19 we will ensure that equity continue to be at the center of our response we ’ll ensure that everyone be reach my first responsibility as president be to protect the american people and make sure we have enough vaccine for every american include enough booster for every american who ’s approve to get one

 we also know this virus transcend border that ’ why even as we execute this plan at home we need to continue fight the virus overseas continue to be the arsenal of vaccine

 we ’re proud to have donate nearly 140 million vaccine over 90 country more than all other country combine include europe china and russia combine that ’ american leadership on a global stage and that ’s just the beginning

 we ’ve also now start to ship another 500 million covid vaccine pfizer vaccine purchase to donate to 100 low income country in need of vaccine and i ’ll be announce additional step to help the rest of the world later this month

 as i recently release the key part of my pandemic preparedness plan so that america be not catch flat footed when a new pandemic come again as it will next month i ’m also go to release the plan in great detail

 so let i close with this we have so-—we’ve make so much progress during the past seven month of this pandemic the recent increase in vaccination in august already be have an impact in some state where case count be drop in recent day even so we remain at a critical moment a critical time we have the tool now we just have to finish the job with truth with science with confidence and together as one nation

 look we ’re the united states of america there ’ nothing not a single thing we’re unable to do if we do it together so let ’s stay together

 god bless you all and all those who continue to serve on the frontline of this pandemic and may god protect our troop

 this law be go to make high speed internet affordable and available everywhere everywhere in america urban suburban rural and create job lay down those broadband line

 no parent no parent coughs excuse i no parent should have to sit in a parking lot at a fast food restaurant again just so their child can use the internet to do their homework that ’ over applause

 and folk if i visit your town i ’m sure you ’d be able to tell i and where you hold your breath as you cross the particular bridge or where the most dangerous intersection of your town be

 this law make this the most significant investment in road and bridge in the past 70 year it make the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 year and in public transit ever

 so what what that mean be you ’re go to be safe and you ’re go to get there fast and we ’re go to have a whole hell of a lot pollution less pollution in the air

 the bipartisan law will modernize our port our airport our freight rail to make it easy for company to get good to market reduce supply chain bottleneck as we ’re experience now and low cost for you and your family

 the law also build on our resilience so that the next storm superstorm drought wildfire hurricane can be deal with

 last year alone the united states as a consequence of these kind of extreme weather event lose $ 99 billion in the united states alone in damage

 after hurricane ida i see the distinguished governor from louisiana be over there i see he stand up i go down to see he we go through and see all the damage there they have 179 mile an hour wind at top speed in louisiana

 but then i head on up to new york chuck up in your area into queens and new jersey more people die there than in a hurricane more people die with the flooding

 record wildfire rage and go i go to idaho and california and see it more land have burn to the ground than the entire state of new jersey out west

 folk walk the neighborhood and look the people in the eye in these circumstance as many of you have and you ’ll see the despair and the heartache so many of you understand you ’re live through it

 this law build back our bridge our water system our powerline our levee well and strong so few americans will be flood out of their home or lose power in those day and week that come with the storm that hit

 folk this bipartisan law for the first time ever create a true national network of charge station for electric vehicle over 500,000 of they applause so you can charge your car here and drive all the way to california not worry about have to find place to charge create thousand of job thousand

 it be also go to make it possible for americans to get off the sideline and into the game of manufacture solar panel wind turbine battery to store energy and power for electric vehicle include electric school bus which will mean million of child will no long inhale the dangerous diesel fume that come out of the bus applause

 for real it ’ a big deal

 and it ’ll reward company for pay good wage and for buy american source their product here in america right now

 it ’s go to help the united states export clean energy technology to the world create mil- ten of thousand of more job

 there ’s so much more in the law but most of all it do something truly historic

 i run for president believe it be time to rebuild the backbone of this nation which i characterize as work people in the middle class they ’re the one who build the country and to rebuild the economy from the bottom up in the middle out

 this law deliver on that long overdue promise in my view it create well job for million of americans and no one no one earn less than $ 400,000 a year will pay a single penny in federal taxis because of it applause

 and it do not include as we do the bipartisan infrastructure bill it do not include a single penny in gas tax which i reject because people under $ 400,000 would be pay it

 this law be a blue collar blueprint to rebuild america it leave no one behind and it make it mark an inflection point that we face as a nation

 for most of the 20th century we lead the world by a significant margin because we invest in ourselves but somewhere along the way we stop invest in ourselves we ’ve risk lose our edge as a nation and china and the rest of the world be catch up

 our infrastructure use to be rate the good in the world now accord to the world economic forum we rank 13th in the world well that ’s about to change applause

 thing be go to turn around in a big way for example because of this law next year will be the first year in 20 year american infrastructure investment will grow fast than china ’s we ’ll once again have the good road bridge port and airport over the next decade and we ’ll lead the world into the 21st century with modern car and truck and transit system

 we ’re go to do this by build again and move again

 folk too often in washington the reason we do not get thing do be because we insist on get everything we want everything

 with this law we focus on get thing do i run for president because the only way to move this country forward in my view be through compromise and consensus that ’ how the system work that ’ american democracy

 and i ’m go to be sign a law that be truly consequential because we make our democracy deliver for the american people we compromise we reach a consensus that ’ necessary

 and now our focus move to implement an infrastructure law that ’s go to with speed and with discipline

 i have a lot of experience in do that when i be vice president i be give responsibility for oversee and implement the recovery act a nearly $ 900 billion emergency package

 i ’m proud to say that when we finish implement that recovery act it be determined that there have be less than two tenth of 1 percent waste fraud or abuse

 and i be it be how i learn and earn the nickname
 sheriff joe from president obama because i make it a point every single day for well over a year to stay on top of how the money be be use

 i speak with over 160 mayor two three time sometimes and i speak with county executive and every governor save one i will not mention that save one laughter she could see alaska from her porch but monitor what we ’re do just how it be be do

 and it be one of the most efficient implementation of a major program in american history and now we owe it to the american people to do the same thing again

 and to make sure every penny be spend where it ’s suppose to go in a timely fashion i ’ve ask the former mayor of new orleans and former lieutenant governor of louisiana mitch landrieu to oversee this responsibility applause

 he ’ll have full access to every tool the federal government have to get it do and we have we have the high obligation and responsibility to make sure this money be use wisely and use well

 folk i ’ve be look forward to this day for a long time like all of my colleague here have

 tomorrow i ’ll be travel to new hampshire to visit a bridge that be structurally not safe like thousand of bridge across america that ’ what this law be all about keep community safe and more efficient

 on wednesday i ’ll be in detroit to meet with the uaw worker who be build the next generation of electric vehicle and that ’s just the beginning

 and folk when you see those project start in your hometown i want you to feel what i feel pride pride in what we can do together as the united states of america

 folk you know the same go for my plan to build back well for the people get folk back to work and reduce cost of thing like childcare eldercare housing healthcare prescription drug and meet the moment on climate change

 i ’m confident that the house will pass this bill and then we ’re go to have to pass it in the senate and it ’s fully pay for

 it will reduce the deficit over the long term accord to lead economist in the world and again no one earn less than $ 400,000 will pay a single penny more in federal taxis

 and together together with the infrastructure bill million of life will be change for the well

 folk let i close with this throughout our history we ’ve emerge from crisis by invest in ourselves

 during and after the civil war it ’s be reference we build the transcontinental railroad unite east and west and unite america

 during the cold war we build the interstate highway system transform how america live their life

 and now we ’re emerge from the covid-19 pandemic and we ’ll build an economy for the 21st century

 when i meet with the president of china who i ’m go to be speak with tonight several year ago he ask i we be in china he ask i he say could i define america and i say absolutely it ’ the god ’s truth i say absolutely i can define it in one word possibility possibility

 there be no limit to what our people think we can do and there be no limit to what our nation can do and there be no one thing that i know more than this it ’s never ever be a good bet to bet against the american people never never never applause

 give half a chance the american people have never ever ever ever let this nation down and it ’ our job to give our people that chance it ’ our job to come together and make sure we remain a nation of possibility

 as i look out on this crowd today i see democrats and republicans national leader local leader all elect official labor leader business leader and most of all i see fellow americans i see america

 4:21 p.m. est

vice president fellow americans good morning

 certain date echo throughout history include date that instantly remind all who have live through they where they be and what they be do when our democracy come under assault date that occupy not only a place on our calendar but a place in our collective memory december 7th 1941 september 11th 2001 and january 6th 2021

 on that day i be not only vice president elect i be also a united states senator and i be here at the capitol that morning at a classified hearing with fellow member of the senate intelligence committee hour later the gate of the capitol be breach

 i have leave but my thought immediately turn not only to my colleague but to my staff who have be force to seek refuge in our office convert filing cabinet into barricade

 what the extremist who roam these hall target be not only the life of elect leader what they seek to degrade and destroy be not only a building hallow as it be what they be assault be the institution the value the ideal that generation of americans have march picket and shed blood to establish and defend

 on january 6th we all see what our nation would look like if the force who seek to dismantle our democracy be successful the lawlessness the violence the chaos

 what be at stake then and now be the right to have our future decide the way the constitution prescribe it by we the people all the people

 we can not let our future be decide by those bent on silence our voice overturn our vote and peddle lie and misinformation by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent but whose root run old and deep

 when i meet with young people they often ask about the state of our democracy about january 6th and what i tell they be january 6th reflect the dual nature of democracy its fragility and its strength

 you see the strength of democracy be the rule of law the strength of democracy be the principle that everyone should be treat equally that election should be free and fair that corruption should be give no quarter the strength of democracy be that it empower the people

 and the fragility of democracy be this that if we be not vigilant if we do not defend it democracy simply will not stand it will falter and fail

 the violent assault that take place here the very fact of how close we come to an election overturn that reflect the fragility of democracy

 yet the resolve i see in our elect leader when i return to the senate chamber that night their resolve not to yield but to certify the election their loyalty not to party or person but to the constitution of the united states that reflect its strength

 and so of course do the heroism of the capitol police the dc metropolitan police department the national guard and other law enforcement officer who answer the call that day include those who later succumb to wound both visible and invisible

 our thought be with all of the family who have lose a love one

 you know i wonder how will january 6th come to be remember in the year ahead

 will it be remember as a moment that accelerate the unraveling of the old great democracy in the world or a moment when we decide to secure and strengthen our democracy for generation to come

 the american spirit be be test

 the answer to whether we will meet that test reside where it always have reside in our country with you the people

 and the work ahead will not be easy here in this very building a decision will be make about whether we uphold the right to vote and ensure free and fair election

 let us be clear we must pass the voting right bill that be now before the senate and the american people must also do something more

 we can not sit on the sideline we must unite in defense of our democracy in order to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and to our prosperity and posterity

 that be the preamble of the constitution that president biden and i swear an oath to uphold and defend and that be the endure promise of the united states of america

 my fellow americans it be my honor to introduce a public servant with the character and fortitude to meet this moment a leader whose life 's work have be move our nation toward that more perfect union president joe biden

 the president madam vice president my fellow americans to state the obvious one year ago today in this sacred place democracy be attack simply attack the will of the people be under assault the constitution our constitution face the gravest of threat

 outnumber and in the face of a brutal attack the capitol police the dc metropolitan police department the national guard and other brave law enforcement official save the rule of law

 our democracy hold we the people endure and we the people prevail

 for the first time in our history a president have not just lose an election he try to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breach the capitol

 but they fail they fail

 and on this day of remembrance we must make sure that such an attack never never happen again

 i ’m speak to you today from statuary hall in the united states capitol this be where the house of representatives meet for 50 year in the decade lead up to the civil war this be on this floor be where a young congressman of illinois abraham lincoln sit at desk 191

 above he above we over that door lead into the rotunda be a sculpture depict clio the muse of history in her hand an open book in which she record the event take place in this chamber below

 clio stand watch over this hall one year ago today as she have for more than 200 year she record what take place the real history the real fact the real truth the fact and the truth that vice president harris just share and that you and i and the whole world see with our own eye

 the bible tell we that we shall know the truth and the truth shall make we free we shall know the truth

 well here be the god ’s truth about january 6th 2021

 close your eye go back to that day what do you see rioter rampage wave for the first time inside this capitol a confederate flag that symbolize the cause to destroy america to rip we apart

 even during the civil war that never ever happen but it happen here in 2021

 what else do you see a mob break window kick in door breach the capitol american flag on pole be use as weapon as spear fire extinguisher be throw at the head of police officer

 a crowd that profess their love for law enforcement assault those police officer drag they spray they stomp on they

 over 140 police officer be injure

 we ’ve all hear the police officer who be there that day testify to what happen one officer call it quote a med-—“medieval battle and that he be more afraid that day than he be fight the war in iraq

 they ’ve repeatedly ask since that day how dare anyone anyone diminish belittle or deny the hell they be put through

 we see it with our own eye rioter menace these hall threaten the life of the speaker of the house literally erect gallow to hang the vice president of the united states of america

 but what do we not see

 we do not see a former president who have just rally the mob to attack sit in the private dining room off the oval office in the white house watch it all on television and do nothing for hour as police be assault live at risk and the nation ’s capital under siege

 this be n’t a group of tourist this be an armed insurrection

 they be not look to uphold the will of the people they be look to deny the will of the people

 they be look to uphold they be not look to uphold a free and fair election they be look to overturn one

 they be not look to save the cause of america they be look to subvert the constitution

 this be n’t about be bogge down in the past this be about make sure the past be not bury

 that ’ the only way forward that ’ what great nation do they do not bury the truth they face up to it sound like hyperbole but that ’ the truth they face up to it

 we be a great nation

 my fellow americans in life there ’ truth and tragically there be lie lie conceive and spread for profit and power

 we must be absolutely clear about what be true and what be a lie

 and here be the truth the former president of the united states of america have create and spread a web of lie about the 2020 election he ’s do so because he value power over principle because he see his own interest as more important than his country ’s interest and america ’s interest and because his bruised ego matter more to he than our democracy or our constitution

 he can not accept he lose even though that ’ what 93 united states senator his own attorney general his own vice president governor and state official in every battleground state have all say he lose

 that ’ what 81 million of you do as you vote for a new way forward

 he have do what no president in american history the history of this country have ever ever do he refuse to accept the result of an election and the will of the american people

 while some courageous man and woman in the republican party be stand against it try to uphold the principle of that party too many other be transform that party into something else they seem no long to want to be the party the party of lincoln eisenhower reagan the bushes

 but whatever my other disagreement be with republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man i will always seek to work together with they to find share solution where possible because if we have a share belief in democracy then anything be possible anything

 and so at this moment we must decide what kind of nation be we go to be

 be we go to be a nation that accept political violence as a norm

 be we go to be a nation where we allow partisan election official to overturn the legally express will of the people

 be we go to be a nation that live not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lie

 we can not allow ourselves to be that kind of nation the way forward be to recognize the truth and to live by it

 the big lie be tell by the former president and many republicans who fear his wrath be that the insurrection in this country actually take place on election day november 3rd 2020

 think about that be that what you think be that what you think when you vote that day take part in an insurrection be that what you think you be do or do you think you be carry out your high duty as a citizen and voting

 the former president and his supporter be try to rewrite history they want you to see election day as the day of insurrection and the riot that take place here on january 6th as the true expression of the will of the people

 can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country to look at america i can not

 here ’ the truth the election of 2020 be the great demonstration of democracy in the history of this country

 more of you vote in that election than have ever vote in all of american history over 150 million americans go to the poll and vote that day in a pandemic some at grea-—great risk to their life they should be applaud not attack

 right now in state after state new law be be write not to protect the vote but to deny it not only to suppress the vote but to subvert it not to strengthen or protect our democracy but because the former president lose

 instead of look at the election result from 2020 and say they need new idea or well idea to win more vote the former president and his supporter have decide the only way for they to win be to suppress your vote and subvert our election

 it ’ wrong it ’ undemocratic and frankly it ’ un american

 the second big lie be tell by the former president and his supporter be that the result of the election of 2020 can not be trust

 the truth be that no election no election in american history have be more closely scrutinize or more carefully count

 every legal challenge question the result in every court in this country that could have be make be make and be reject often reject by republican appoint judge include judge appoint by the former president himself from state court to the united states supreme court

 recounts be undertake in state after state georgia georgia count its result three time with one recount by hand

 phony partisan audits be undertake long after the election in several state none change the result and in some of they the irony be the margin of victory actually grow slightly

 so let ’s speak plainly about what happen in 2020 even before the first ballot be cast the former president be preemptively sow doubt about the election result he build his lie over month it be not base on any fact he be just look for an excuse a pretext to cover for the truth

 he ’s not just a former president he ’ a defeat former president defeat by a margin of over 7 million of your vote in a full and free and fair election

 there be simply zero proof the election result be inaccurate in fact in every venue where evidence have to be produce and an oath to tell the truth have to be take the former president fail to make his case

 just think about this the former president and his supporter have never be able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election result that take place on november 3rd the election for governor united states senate the house of representatives election in which they close the gap in the house

 they challenge none of that the president ’s name be first then we go down the line governor senator house of representatives somehow those result be accurate on the same ballot but the presidential race be flaw

 and on the same ballot the same day cast by the same voter

 the only difference the former president do not lose those race he just lose the one that be his own

 finally the third big lie be tell by a former president and his supporter be that the mob who seek to impose their will through violence be the nation ’s true patriot

 be that what you think when you look at the mob ransack the capitol destroy property literally defecate in the hallway rifle through desk of senator and representative hunt down member of congress patriot not in my view

 to i the true patriot be the more than 150 million americans who peacefully express their vote at the ballot box the election worker who protect the integrity of the vote and the hero who defend this capitol

 you can not love your country only when you win

 you can not obey the law only when it ’ convenient

 you can not be patriotic when you embrace and enable lie

 those who storm this capitol and those who instigate and incite and those who call on they to do so hold a dagger at the throat of america at american democracy

 they do not come here out of patriotism or principle they come here in rage not in service of america but rather in service of one man

 those who incite the mob the real plotter who be desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the voter

 but their plot be foil congressman democrats and republicans stay senator representative staff they finish their work the constitution demand they honor their oath to defend the constitution against all enemy foreign and domestic

 look folk now it ’ up to all of we to we the people”—to stand for the rule of law to preserve the flame of democracy to keep the promise of america alive

 that promise be at risk target by the force that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy fear over hope personal gain over public good

 make no mistake about it we ’re live at an inflection point in history

 both at home and abroad we ’re engage anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy between the aspiration of the many and the greed of the few between the people ’s right of self determination and self-—the self seek autocrat

 from china to russia and beyond they ’re bet that democracy ’s day be number they ’ve actually tell i democracy be too slow too bogge down by division to succeed in today ’s rapidly change complicated world

 and they ’re bet they’re bet america will become more like they and less like we they ’re bet that america be a place for the autocrat the dictator the strongman

 i do not believe that that be not who we be that be not who we have ever be and that be not who we should ever ever be

 our founding father as imperfect as they be set in motion an experiment that change the world literally change the world

 here in america the people would rule power would be transfer peacefully never at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gun

 and they commit to paper an idea that could not live up to they could not live up to but an idea that could not be constrain yes in america all people be create equal

 we reject the view that if you succeed i fail if you get ahead i fall behind if i hold you down i somehow lift myself up

 the former president who lie about this election and the mob that attack this capitol could not be far away from the core american value

 they want to rule or they will ruin ruin what our country fight for at lexington and concord at gettysburg at omaha beach seneca falls selma alabama what and what we be fight for the right to vote the right to govern ourselves the right to determine our own destiny

 and with right come responsibility the responsibility to see each other as neighbor maybe we disagree with that neighbor but they ’re not an adversary the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case the responsibility to see that america be an idea an idea that require vigilant stewardship

 as we stand here today one year since january 6th 2021 the lie that drive the anger and madness we see in this place they have not abate

 so we have to be firm resolute and unyielde in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote count

 some have already make the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effort

 jill and i have mourn police officer in this capitol rotunda not once but twice in the wake of january 6th once to honor officer brian sicknick who lose his life the day after the attack and a second time to honor officer billy evans who lose his life defend this capitol as well

 we think about the other who lose their life and be injure and everyone live with the trauma of that day from those defend this capitol to member of congress in both party and their staff to reporter cafeteria worker custodial worker and their family

 do not kid yourself the pain and scar from that day run deep

 i say it many time and it ’ no more true or real than when we think about the event of january 6th we be in a battle for the soul of america a battle that by the grace of god and the goodness and gracious and greatness of this nation we will win

 believe i i know how difficult democracy be and i ’m crystal clear about the threat america face but i also know that our dark day can lead to light and hope

 from the death and destruction as the vice president reference in pearl harbor come the triumph over the force of fascism

 from the brutality of bloody sunday on the edmund pettus bridge come historic voting right legislation

 so now let we step up write the next chapter in american history where january 6th mark not the end of democracy but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play

 i do not seek this fight bring to this capitol one year ago today but i will not shrink from it either

 i will stand in this breach i will defend this nation and i will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy

 we will make sure the will of the people be hear that the ballot prevail not violence that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transfer

 i believe the power of the presidency and the purpose be to unite this nation not divide it to lift we up not tear we apart to be about we about we not about i

 deep in the heart of america burn a flame light almost 250 year ago of liberty freedom and equality

 this be not a land of king or dictator or autocrat we ’re a nation of law of order not chaos of peace not violence

 here in america the people rule through the ballot and their will prevail

 so let we remember together we ’re one nation under god indivisible that today tomorrow and forever at our good we be the united states of america

 god bless you all may god protect our troop and may god bless those who stand watch over our democracy

the president sorry to keep you wait good afternoon the russian military have begin a brutal assault on the people of ukraine without provocation without justification without necessity

 this be a premeditated attack vladimir putin have be plan this for month as i ’ve be as we ’ve be say all along he move more than 175,000 troop military equipment into position along the ukrainian border

 he move blood supply into position and build a field hospital which tell you all you need to know about his intention all along

 he reject every good faith effort the united states and our allies and partner make to address our mutual security concern through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering

 for week for week we have be warn that this would happen and now it ’s unfold largely as we predict

 in the past week we ’ve see shell increase in the donbas the region in eastern ukraine control by russian back separatist

 rus-—the russian government have perpetrate cyberattack against ukraine

 we see a stage political theater in moscow outlandish and baseless claim that ukraine be ukraine be about to invade and launch a war against russia that ukraine be prepared to use chemical weapon that ukraine commit a genocide without any evidence

 we see a flagrant violation of international law in attempt to unilaterally create two new so call republic on sovereign ukrainian territory

 and at the very moment that the united nations security council be meet to stand up for ukraine ’s sovereignty to stave off invasion putin declare his war

 within moment moment missile strike begin to fall on historic city across ukraine

 then come in the air raid follow by tank and troop roll in

 we ’ve be transparent with the world we ’ve share declassify evidence about russia ’s plan and cyberattack and false pretext so that there can be no confusion or cover up about what putin be do

 putin be the aggressor putin choose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequence

 today i ’m authorize additional strong sanction and new limitation on what can be export to russia

 this be go to impose severe cost on the russian economy both immediately and over time

 we have purposefully design these sanction to maximize the long term impact on russia and to minimize the impact on the united states and our allies

 and i want to be clear the united states be not do this alone for month we ’ve be build a coalition of partner represent well more than half of the global economy

 twenty seven member of the european union include france germany italy as well as the united kingdom canada japan australia new zealand and many other to amplify the joint impact of our response

 i just speak with the g7 leader this morning and we be in full and total agreement we will limit russia ’s ability to do business in dollars euros pounds and yen to be part of the global economy we will limit their ability to do that we be go to stunt the ability to finance and grow rus-—the russian military

 we ’re go to impose major and we ’re go to impair their ability to compete in a high tech 21st century economy

 we ’ve already see the impact of our action on russia ’s currency the ruble which early today hit its weak level ever ever in history and the russian stock market plunge today the russian government ’s borrowing rate spike by over 15 percent

 in today ’s action we have now sanction russian bank that together hold around $ 1 trillion in asset

 we ’ve cut off russia ’s large bank a bank that hold more than one third of russia ’s banking asset by itself cut it off from the us financial system

 and today we ’re also block four more major bank that mean every asset they have in america will be frozen this include v.t.b. the second large bank in russia which have $ 250 billion in asset

 as promise we ’re also add name to the list of russian elite and their family member that be sanction that we ’re sanction as well

 as i say on tuesday these be people who personally gain from the kremlin ’s policy and they should share in the pain we will keep up this drumbeat of those designation against corrupt billionaire in the day ahead

 on tuesday we stop the russian government from raise money from us or european investor

 now we ’re go to apply the same restriction to russia ’s large state own enterprise company with asset that exceed $ 1.4 trillion

 some of the most powerful impact of our action will come over time as we squeeze russia ’s access to finance and technology for strategic sector of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for year to come

 between our action and those of our allies and partner we estimate that we ’ll cut off more than half of russia ’s high tech import

 it will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military it ’ll degrade their aerospace industry include their space program it will hurt their ability to build ship reduce their ability to compete economically and it will be a major hit to putin ’s long term strategic ambition

 and we ’re prepare to do more in addition to the economic penalty we ’re impose we ’re also take step to defend our nato allies particularly in the east

 tomorrow nato will convene a summit we’ll be there to bring together the leader of 30 allied nation and close partner to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next step we will take to far strengthen all aspect of our nato alliance

 although we provide over $ 650 million in defensive assistance to ukraine just this year this last year let i say it again our force be not and will not be engage in the conflict with russia in ukraine our force be not go to europe to fight in ukraine but to defend our nato allies and reassure those allies in the east

 as i make crystal clear the united states will defend every inch of nato territory with the full force of american power and the good news be nato be more united and more determined than ever

 there be no doubt no doubt that the united states and every nato ally will meet our article 5 commitment which say that an attack on one be an attack on all

 over the past few week i order thousand of additional force to germany and poland as part of our commitment to nato

 on tuesday in response to russia ’s aggressive action include its troop presence in belarus and the black sea i ’ve authorize the deployment of ground and air force already station in europe to nato ’s eastern flank allies estonia latvia lithuania poland and romania

 our allies have also be step up add the other allies the rest of nato add their own force and capability to ensure our collective defense

 and today within hour of russia ’s unleash its assault nato come together and authorize and activate an activation of response plan

 this will enable nato ’s high readiness force to deploy and when and where they ’re need to protect our nato allies on the eastern boundary of europe

 and now i ’m authorize additional us force and capability to deploy to germany as part of nato ’s response include some of us base force that the department of defense place on standby week ago

 i ’ve also speak with defense secretary austin and chairman of the joint chiefs general milley about preparation for additional move should they become necessary to protect our nato allies and support the great military alliance in the history of the world nato

 as we respond my administration be use the tool every tool at our disposal to protect american family and business from rise price at the gas pump

 you know we ’re take active step to bring down the cost and american oil and gas company should not should not exploit this moment to hike their price to raise profit

 you know in our sanction package we specifically design to allow energy payment to continue

 we be closely monitor energy supply for any disruption we have be coordinate with major oil produce and consume country toward our common interest to secure global energy supply

 we be actively work with country around the world to elevate evaluate a collective release from the strategic petroleum reserves of major energy consume country and the united states will release additional barrel of oil as condition warrant

 i know this be hard and that americans be already hurt i will do everything in my power to limit the pain the american people be feel at the gas pump this be critical to i

 but this aggression can not go unanswered if it do the consequence for america would be much bad america stand up to bully we stand up for freedom this be who we be

 let i also repeat the warning i make last week if russia pursue cyberattack against our company our critical infrastructure we be prepared to respond

 for month we have be work closely with our private with the private sector to harden their cyber defense sharpen our ability to respond to russian cyberattack as well

 i speak late last night to president zelenskyy of ukraine and i assure he that the united states together with our allies and partner in europe will support the ukrainian people as they defend their country we ’ll provide humanitarian relief to ease their suffering

 and in the early day of this conflict russian propaganda outlet will keep try to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a make up threat

 but history have show time and again how swift gain in territory eventually give way to grind occupation act of mass civil mass civil disobedience and strategic dead end

 the next few week and month will be hard on the people of ukraine putin have unleash a great pain on they but the ukrainian people have know 30 year of independence and they have repeatedly show that they will not tolerate anyone who try to take their country backwards

 this be a dangerous moment for all of europe for the freedom around the world putin have a have commit an assault on the very principle that uphold global peace

 but now the entire world see clearly what putin and his kremlin and his kremlin ally be really all about this be never about genuine security concern on their part it be always about naked aggression about putin ’s desire for empire by any mean necessary by bully russia ’s neighbor through coercion and corruption by change border by force and ultimately by choose a war without a cause

 putin ’s action betray his sinister vision for the future of our world one where nation take what they want by force

 but it be a vision that the united states and freedom love nation everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power

 the united states and our allies and partner will emerge from this strong more united more determined and more purposeful

 and putin ’s aggression against ukraine will end up cost russia dearly economically and strategically we will make sure of that putin will be a pariah on the international stage any nation that countenance russia ’s naked aggression against ukraine will be stain by association

 when the history of this era be write putin ’s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on ukraine will have leave russia weak and the rest of the world strong

 liberty democracy human dignity these be the force far more powerful than fear and oppression they can not be extinguish by tyrant like putin and his army they can not be erase by people from people ’s heart and hope by any amount of violence and intimidation they endure

 and in the contest between democracy and autocracy between sovereignty and subjugation make no mistake freedom will prevail

 god bless the people of a free and democratic ukraine and may god protect our troop

 wall street journal tarina tarini

 number two it be always an option but right now that ’s not the position that the rest of europe wish to take

 cecilia ve-—vega abc

 q thank you sir sir sanction clearly have not be enough to deter vladimir putin to this point what be go to stop he how and when do this end and do you see he try to go beyond ukraine

 the president first of all there ’ no doubt that when a major nuclear power attack and invade another country that the world be go to respond and market be go to respond all over the world so there ’ no doubt about that number one

 number two the notion that this be go to last for a long time be highly unlikely as long as we continue to stay resolve in impose the sanction we ’re go to impose on russia period

 what ’s your next question i ’m sorry

 q the next question be do you underestimate putin and would you still describe he the way that you do in the summer as a worthy adversary

 the president at the time he be i make it clear he be an adversary and i say he be worthy i do not underestimate he

 and i ’ve read most of everything he ’s write do you read the i should not sa-—i’m not be a wise guy the you hear the speech he make almost an hour ’s worth of speech why he be go into ukraine

 he have much large ambition in ukraine he want to in fact reestablish the former soviet union that ’ what this be about

 and i think that his his ambition be be completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world have arrive

 q president biden president biden

 q okay but

 the president they ’re two different thing and we ’re now go to he ’s go to begin to see the effect of the sanction

 q and what will that do how will that change his mindset here give he ’s attack ukraine as we speak

 the president because it will so weaken his country that he ’ll have to make a very very difficult choice of whether to continue to move toward be a second rate power or in fact respond

 q you say in recent week that big nation can not bluff when it come to something like this you recently say that the idea of personally sanction president putin be on the table be that a step that you ’re prepared to take and if not

 the president it ’ not a bluff it ’s on the table

 q sanctioning president putin

 the president specifically the sanction we ’ve impose exceed swift the sanction we impose exceed anything that ’s ever be do the sanction we impose have generate two third of the world join we they be profound sanction let ’s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they ’re work

 q let i ask you about can i ask you about zelenskyy sir you speak to volodymyr zelenskyy yesterday sir if i could follow up

 q what ’s the risk that we be watch the beginning of another cold war and be there now a complete rupture in us and russian relation

 and in term of a cold war that depend you have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what he ’s do from asia to south america to europe to acr-—around the world

 throughout our history we ’ve learn this lesson when dictator do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos

 they keep move

 and the cost and the threat to america and the world keep rise

 that ’ why the nato alliance be create to secure peace and stability in europe after world war 2

 the united states be a member along with 29 other nation

 it matter american diplomacy matter american resolve matter

 putin ’s late attack on ukraine be premeditate and unprovoked

 he reject repeat effort at diplomacy

 he think the west and nato would not respond

 and he think he could divide we at home putin be wrong we be ready here be what we do

 we prepare extensively and carefully

 we spend month build a coalition of other freedom love nation from europe and the americas to asia and africa to confront putin

 i spend countless hour unify our european ally we share with the world in advance what we know putin be plan and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression

 we counter russia ’s lie with truth

 and now that he have act the free world be hold he accountable

 we be inflict pain on russia and support the people of ukraine putin be now isolate from the world more than ever

 together with our ally we be right now enforce powerful economic sanction

 we be choke off russia ’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for year to come

 together with our ally we be provide support to the ukrainians in their fight for freedom military assistance economic assistance humanitarian assistance

 we be give more than $ 1 billion in direct assistance to ukraine

 and we will continue to aid the ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering

 let i be clear our force be not engaged and will not engage in conflict with russian force in ukraine

 our force be not go to europe to fight in ukraine but to defend our nato allies in the event that putin decide to keep move west

 for that purpose we ’ve mobilize american ground force air squadron and ship deployment to protect nato country include poland romania latvia lithuania and estonia

 as i have make crystal clear the united states and our allies will defend every inch of territory of nato country with the full force of our collective power

 and we remain clear eyed the ukrainians be fight back with pure courage but the next few day week month will be hard on they

 putin have unleash violence and chaos but while he may make gain on the battlefield he will pay a continue high price over the long run

 and a proud ukrainian people who have know 30 year of independence have repeatedly show that they will not tolerate anyone who try to take their country backwards

 to all americans i will be honest with you as i ’ve always promise a russian dictator invade a foreign country have cost around the world

 and i ’m take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanction be target at russia ’s economy and i will use every tool at our disposal to protect american business and consumer

 tonight i can announce that the united states have work with 30 other country to release 60 million barrel of oil from reserve around the world

 america will lead that effort release 30 million barrel from our own strategic petroleum reserve   and we stand ready to do more if necessary unify with our ally

 these step will help blunt gas price here at home and i know the news about what ’s happen can seem alarming

 but i want you to know that we be go to be okay

 when the history of this era be write putin ’s war on ukraine will have leave russia weak and the rest of the world strong

 while it should not have take something so terrible for people around the world to see what ’s at stake now everyone see it clearly

 we see the unity among leader of nation and a more unified europe a more unified west and we see unity among the people who be gather in city in large crowd around the world even in russia to demonstrate their support for ukraine

 in the battle between democracy and autocracy democracy be rise to the moment and the world be clearly choose the side of peace and security

 this be a real test it ’s go to take time so let we continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the ukrainian people

 to our fellow ukrainian americans who forge a deep bond that connect our two nation we stand with you

 putin may circle kyiv with tank but he will never gain the heart and soul of the ukrainian people

 he will never extinguish their love of freedom he will never weaken the resolve of the free world

 we meet tonight in an america that have live through two of the hard year this nation have ever face

 the pandemic have be punish

 and so many family be live paycheck to paycheck struggle to keep up with the rise cost of food gas housing and so much more

 i understand

 i remember when my dad have to leave our home in scranton pennsylvania to find work

 i grow up in a family where if the price of food go up you feel it

 that ’ why one of the first thing i do as president be fight to pass the american rescue plan

 because people be hurt we need to act and we do

 few piece of legislation have do more in a critical moment in our history to lift we out of crisis

 it fuel our effort to vaccinate the nation and combat covid-19 it deliver immediate economic relief for ten of million of americans

 helped put food on their table keep a roof over their head and cut the cost of health insurance

 and as my dad use to say it give people a little breathing room

 and unlike the $ 2 trillion tax cut pass in the previous administration that benefit the top 1 percent of americans the american rescue plan help work people and leave no one behind

 and it work it create job lot of job

 in fact our economy create over 6.5 million new job just last year more job create in one year than ever before in the history of america

 our economy grow at a rate of 5.7 percent last year the strong growth in nearly 40 year the first step in bring fundamental change to an economy that have n’t work for the work people of this nation for too long

 for the past 40 year we be tell that if we give tax break to those at the very top the benefit would trickle down to everyone else

 but that trickle down theory lead to weak economic growth low wage big deficit and the wide gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century

 vice president harris and i run for office with a new economic vision for america

 invest in america educate americans grow the workforce build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out not from the top down

 because we know that when the middle class grow the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well

 america use to have the good road bridge and airport on earth

 now our infrastructure be rank 13th in the world

 we will not be able to compete for the job of the 21st century if we do not fix that

 that ’ why it be so important to pass the bipartisan infrastructure law the most sweeping investment to rebuild america in history

 this be a bipartisan effort and i want to thank the member of both party who work to make it happen

 we ’re do talk about infrastructure week

 we ’re go to have an infrastructure decade

 it be go to transform america and put we on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st century that we face with the rest of the world particularly with china

 as i ’ve tell xi jinping it be never a good bet to bet against the american people

 we ’ll create good job for million of americans modernize road airport port and waterway all across america

 and we ’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effect of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice

 we ’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charge station begin to replace poisonous lead pipe so every child and every american have clean water to drink at home and at school provide affordable high speed internet for every american urban suburban rural and tribal community

 4,000 project have already be announce

 and tonight i ’m announce that this year we will start fix over 65,000 mile of highway and 1,500 bridge in disrepair

 when we use taxpayer dollar to rebuild america we be go to buy american buy american product to support american job

 the federal government spend about $ 600 billion a year to keep the country safe and secure

 there ’s be a law on the book for almost a century to make sure taxpayer dollar support american job and business

 every administration say they ’ll do it but we be actually do it

 we will buy american to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrail be make in america

 but to compete for the good job of the future we also need to level the play field with china and other competitor

 that ’ why it be so important to pass the bipartisan innovation act sit in congress that will make record investment in emerge technology and american manufacturing

 let i give you one example of why it ’ so important to pass it

 if you travel 20 mile east of columbus ohio you ’ll find 1,000 empty acre of land

 it will not look like much but if you stop and look closely you ’ll see a field of dream the ground on which america ’s future will be build

 this be where intel the american company that helped build silicon valley be go to build its $ 20 billion semiconductor mega site

 up to eight state of the art factory in one place 10,000 new good pay job

 some of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chip the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday life

 smartphone the internet technology we have yet to invent

 but that ’s just the beginning

 intel ’s ceo pat gelsinger who be here tonight tell i they be ready to increase their investment from $ 20 billion to $ 100 billion

 that would be one of the big investment in manufacturing in american history

 and all they ’re wait for be for you to pass this bill

 so let ’s not wait any long send it to my desk i ’ll sign it

 and we will really take off

 and intel be not alone

 there ’ something happen in america

 just look around and you ’ll see an amazing story

 the rebirth of the pride that come from stamp product make in america the revitalization of american manufacturing

 company be choose to build new factory here when just a few year ago they would have build they overseas

 that ’ what be happen ford be invest $ 11 billion to build electric vehicle create 11,000 job across the country

 gm be make the large investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicle create 4,000 job in michigan

 all tell we create 369,000 new manufacture job in america just last year

 power by people i ’ve meet like jojo burgess from generation of union steelworker from pittsburgh who ’ here with we tonight

 as ohio senator sherrod brown say it ’ time to bury the label rust belt

 it ’ time

 but with all the bright spot in our economy record job growth and high wage too many family be struggle to keep up with the bill

 inflation be rob they of the gain they might otherwise feel

 i get it that ’ why my top priority be get price under control

 look our economy roar back fast than most predict but the pandemic mean that business have a hard time hire enough worker to keep up production in their factory

 the pandemic also disrupt global supply chain

 when factory close it take long to make good and get they from the warehouse to the store and price go up

 look at car

 last year there be n’t enough semiconductor to make all the car that people want to buy

 and guess what price of automobile go up

 so we have a choice

 one way to fight inflation be to drive down wage and make americans poor

 i have a well plan to fight inflation

 lower your cost not your wage

 make more car and semiconductor in america

 more infrastructure and innovation in america

 more good move fast and cheap in america

 more job where you can earn a good living in america

 and instead of rely on foreign supply chain let ’s make it in america

 economist call it increase the productive capacity of our economy

 i call it build a well america

 my plan to fight inflation will lower your cost and lower the deficit

 seventeen nobel laureate in economic say my plan will ease long term inflationary pressure top business leader and most americans support my plan and here ’ the plan

 first cut the cost of prescription drug just look at insulin one in ten americans have diabete in virginia i meet a 13 year old boy name joshua davis

 he and his dad both have type 1 diabetes which mean they need insulin every day insulin cost about $ 10 a vial to make

 but drug company charge family like joshua and his dad up to 30 time more i speak with joshua ’s mom

 imagine what it ’s like to look at your child who need insulin and have no idea how you ’re go to pay for it

 what it do to your dignity your ability to look your child in the eye to be the parent you expect to be

 joshua be here with we tonight yesterday be his birthday happy birthday buddy

 for joshua and for the 200,000 other young people with type 1 diabetes let ’s cap the cost of insulin at $ 35 a month so everyone can afford it

 drug company will still do very well and while we ’re at it let medicare negotiate low price for prescription drug like the va already do

 look the american rescue plan be help million of family on affordable care act plan save $ 2,400 a year on their health care premium let ’s close the coverage gap and make those saving permanent

 second cut energy cost for family an average of $ 500 a year by combat climate change

 let ’s provide investment and tax credit to weatherize your home and business to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit

 double america ’s clean energy production in solar wind and so much more

 low the price of electric vehicle save you another $ 80 a month because you ’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again

 third cut the cost of child care many family pay up to $ 14,000 a year for child care per child

 middle class and work family should not have to pay more than 7 percent of their income for care of young child

 my plan will cut the cost in half for most family and help parent include million of woman who leave the workforce during the pandemic because they could not afford child care to be able to get back to work

 my plan do not stop there it also include home and long term care more affordable housing and pre k for every 3- and 4 year old

 all of these will lower cost

 and under my plan nobody earn less than $ 400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxis nobody

 the one thing all americans agree on be that the tax system be not fair we have to fix it

 i ’m not look to punish anyone but let ’s make sure corporation and the wealthy americans start pay their fair share

 just last year 55 fortune 500 corporation earn $ 40 billion in profit and pay zero dollar in federal income tax

 that ’s simply not fair that ’s why i ’ve propose a 15 percent minimum tax rate for corporation

 we get more than 130 country to agree on a global minimum tax rate so company can not get out of pay their taxis at home by ship job and factory overseas

 that ’ why i ’ve propose close loophole so the very wealthy do n’t pay a low tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter

 so that ’s my plan it will grow the economy and low cost for family

 so what be we wait for let ’s get this do and while you ’re at it confirm my nominee to the federal reserve which play a critical role in fight inflation

 my plan will not only low cost to give family a fair shot it will lower the deficit

 the previous administration not only balloon the deficit with tax cut for the very wealthy and corporation it undermine the watchdog whose job be to keep pandemic relief fund from be waste

 but in my administration the watchdog have be welcome back

 we ’re go after the criminal who steal billion in relief money mean for small business and million of americans

 and tonight i ’m announce that the justice department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud

 by the end of this year the deficit will be down to less than half what it be before i take office

 the only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollar in a single year

 lower your cost also mean demand more competition

 i ’m a capitalist but capitalism without competition be n’t capitalism

 it ’ exploitation and it drive up price

 when corporation do not have to compete their profit go up your price go up and small business and family farmer and rancher go under

 we see it happen with ocean carrier move good in and out of america

 during the pandemic these foreign own company raise price by as much as 1,000 percent and make record profit

 tonight i ’m announce a crackdown on these company overcharge american business and consumer

 and as wall street firm take over more nursing home quality in those home have go down and cost have go up

 that end on my watch

 medicare be go to set high standard for nursing home and make sure your love one get the care they deserve and expect

 we ’ll also cut cost and keep the economy go strong by give worker a fair shot provide more training and apprenticeship hire they base on their skill not degree

 let ’s pass the paycheck fairness act and pay leave

 raise the minimum wage to $ 15 an hour and extend the child tax credit so no one have to raise a family in poverty

 let ’s increase pell grants and increase our historic support of hbcu and invest in what jill our first lady who teach full time call america ’s well keep secret community college

 and let ’s pass the pro act when a majority of worker want to form a union they should not be stop

 when we invest in our worker when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together we can do something we have not do in a long time build a well america

 for more than two year covid-19 have impact every decision in our life and the life of the nation

 and i know you ’re tired frustrated and exhaust

 but i also know this

 because of the progress we ’ve make because of your resilience and the tool we have tonight i can say we be move forward safely back to more normal routine

 we ’ve reach a new moment in the fight against covid-19 with severe case down to a level not see since last july

 just a few day ago the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc issue new mask guideline

 under these new guideline most americans in most of the country can now be mask free

 and base on the projection more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of week

 thank to the progress we have make this past year covid-19 need no long control our life

 i know some be talk about live with covid-19 tonight i say that we will never just accept live with covid-19

 we will continue to combat the virus as we do other disease and because this be a virus that mutate and spread we will stay on guard

 here be four common sense step as we move forward safely

 first stay protect with vaccine and treatment we know how incredibly effective vaccine be if you ’re vaccinate and boost you have the high degree of protection

 we will never give up on vaccinate more americans now i know parent with kid under 5 be eager to see a vaccine authorize for their child

 the scientist be work hard to get that do and we ’ll be ready with plenty of vaccine when they do

 we ’re also ready with anti viral treatment if you get covid-19 the pfizer pill reduce your chance of end up in the hospital by 90 percent

 we ’ve order more of these pill than anyone in the world and pfizer be work overtime to get we 1 million pill this month and more than double that next month

 and we ’re launch the test to treat initiative so people can get test at a pharmacy and if they ’re positive receive antiviral pill on the spot at no cost

 if you ’re immunocompromise or have some other vulnerability we have treatment and free high quality mask

 we ’re leave no one behind or ignore anyone ’s need as we move forward

 and on testing we have make hundred of million of test available for you to order for free

 even if you already order free test tonight i be announce that you can order more from covidtests.gov start next week

 second we must prepare for new variant over the past year we ’ve get much well at detect new variant

 if necessary we ’ll be able to deploy new vaccine within 100 day instead of many more month or year

 and if congress provide the fund we need we ’ll have new stockpile of test mask and pill ready if need

 i can not promise a new variant will not come but i can promise you we ’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it do

 third we can end the shutdown of school and business we have the tool we need

 it ’ time for americans to get back to work and fill our great downtown again people work from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office

 we ’re do that here in the federal government the vast majority of federal worker will once again work in person

 our school be open let ’s keep it that way our kid need to be in school

 and with 75 percent of adult americans fully vaccinate and hospitalization down by 77 percent most americans can remove their mask return to work stay in the classroom and move forward safely

 we achieve this because we provide free vaccine treatment test and mask

 of course continue this cost money

 i will soon send congress a request

 the vast majority of americans have use these tool and may want to again so i expect congress to pass it quickly

 fourth we will continue vaccinate the world

 we ’ve send 475 million vaccine dose to 112 country more than any other nation

 and we will not stop

 we have lose so much to covid-19 time with one another and bad of all so much loss of life

 let ’s use this moment to reset let ’s stop look at covid-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it be a god awful disease

 let ’s stop see each other as enemy and start see each other for who we really be fellow americans

 we can not change how divided we ’ve be but we can change how we move forward on covid-19 and other issue we must face together

 i recently visit the new york city police department day after the funeral of officer wilbert mora and his partner officer jason rivera

 they be respond to a 9 1 1 call when a man shoot and kill they with a steal gun

 officer mora be 27 year old

 officer rivera be 22

 both dominican americans who ’d grow up on the same street they later choose to patrol as police officer

 i speak with their family and tell they that we be forever in debt for their sacrifice and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserve

 i ’ve work on these issue a long time

 i know what work invest in crime prevention and community police officer who ’ll walk the beat who ’ll know the neighborhood and who can restore trust and safety

 so let ’s not abandon our street or choose between safety and equal justice

 let ’s come together to protect our community restore trust and hold law enforcement accountable

 that ’ why the justice department require body camera ban chokehold and restrict no knock warrant for its officer

 that ’ why the american rescue plan provide $ 350 billion that city state and county can use to hire more police and invest in prove strategy like community violence interruption trust messenger break the cycle of violence and trauma and give young people hope

 we should all agree the answer be not to defund the police the answer be to fund the police with the resource and training they need to protect our community

 i ask democrats and republicans alike pass my budget and keep our neighborhood safe

 and i will keep do everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost gun you can buy online and make at home they have no serial number and can not be trace

 and i ask congress to pass prove measure to reduce gun violence pass universal background check why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon

 ban assault weapon and high capacity magazine

 repeal the liability shield that make gun manufacturer the only industry in america that can not be sue

 these law do n’t infringe on the second amendment they save life

 the most fundamental right in america be the right to vote and to have it count and it ’ under assault

 in state after state new law have be pass not only to suppress the vote but to subvert entire election

 we can not let this happen

 tonight i call on the senate to pass the freedom to vote act pass the john lewis voting rights act and while you ’re at it pass the disclose act so americans can know who be fund our election

 tonight i ’d like to honor someone who have dedicate his life to serve this country justice stephen breyer an army veteran constitutional scholar and retire justice of the united states supreme court justice breyer thank you for your service

 one of the most serious constitutional responsibility a president have be nominate someone to serve on the united states supreme court

 and i do that 4 day ago when i nominate circuit court of appeals judge ketanji brown jackson one of our nation ’s top legal mind who will continue justice breyer ’s legacy of excellence

 a former top litigator in private practice a former federal public defender and from a family of public school educator and police officer a consensus builder since she ’s be nominate she ’s receive a broad range of support from the fraternal order of police to former judge appoint by democrats and republicans

 and if we be to advance liberty and justice we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system

 we can do both at our border we ’ve instal new technology like cut edge scanner to well detect drug smuggling

 we ’ve set up joint patrol with mexico and guatemala to catch more human trafficker

 we ’re put in place dedicated immigration judge so family flee persecution and violence can have their case hear fast

 we ’re secure commitment and support partner in south and central america to host more refugee and secure their own border

 we can do all this while keep light the torch of liberty that have lead generation of immigrant to this land my forefather and so many of your

 provide a pathway to citizenship for dreamer those on temporary status farm worker and essential worker

 revise our law so business have the worker they need and family do not wait decade to reunite

 it ’ not only the right thing to do it ’s the economically smart thing to do

 that ’ why immigration reform be support by everyone from labor union to religious leader to the us chamber of commerce

 let ’s get it do once and for all

 advance liberty and justice also require protect the right of woman

 the constitutional right affirm in roe v. wade stand precedent for half a century be under attack as never before

 if we want to go forward not backward we must protect access to health care preserve a woman ’s right to choose and let ’s continue to advance maternal health care in america

 and for our lgbtq+ americans let ’s finally get the bipartisan equality act to my desk the onslaught of state law target transgend americans and their family be wrong

 as i say last year especially to our young transgender americans i will always have your back as your president so you can be yourself and reach your god give potential

 while it often appear that we never agree that be n’t true i sign 80 bipartisan bill into law last year from prevent government shutdown to protect asian americans from still too common hate crime to reform military justice

 and soon we ’ll strengthen the violence against women act that i first write three decade ago it be important for we to show the nation that we can come together and do big thing

 so tonight i ’m offer a unity agenda for the nation four big thing we can do together

 first beat the opioid epidemic

 there be so much we can do increase funding for prevention treatment harm reduction and recovery

 get rid of outdated rule that stop doctor from prescribe treatment and stop the flow of illicit drug by work with state and local law enforcement to go after trafficker

 if you ’re suffer from addiction know you be not alone i believe in recovery and i celebrate the 23 million americans in recovery

 second let ’s take on mental health especially among our child whose life and education have be turn upside down

 the american rescue plan give school money to hire teacher and help student make up for lost learning

 i urge every parent to make sure your school do just that and we can all play a part sign up to be a tutor or a mentor

 child be also struggle before the pandemic bullying violence trauma and the harm of social medium

 as frances haugen who be here with we tonight have show we must hold social medium platform accountable for the national experiment they ’re conduct on our child for profit

 it ’ time to strengthen privacy protection ban target advertising to child demand tech company stop collect personal datum on our child

 and let ’s get all americans the mental health service they need more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care

 third support our veteran

 veteran be the good of we

 i ’ve always believe that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for they and their family when they come home

 my administration be provide assistance with job training and housing and now help low income veteran get va care debt free

 our troop in iraq and afghanistan face many danger

 one be station at basis and breathe in toxic smoke from burn pit that incinerate waste of war medical and hazard material jet fuel and more

 i know

 one of those soldier be my son major beau biden

 we do not know for sure if a burn pit be the cause of his brain cancer or the disease of so many of our troop

 but i ’m committed to find out everything we can

 commit to military family like danielle robinson from ohio

 through her pain she find purpose to demand we do well

 tonight danielle we be

 the va be pioneer new way of link toxic exposure to disease already help more veteran get benefit

 and tonight i ’m announce we ’re expand eligibility to veteran suffer from nine respiratory cancer

 i ’m also call on congress pass a law to make sure veteran devastate by toxic exposure in iraq and afghanistan finally get the benefit and comprehensive health care they deserve

 and fourth let ’s end cancer as we know it

 this be personal to i and jill to kamala and to so many of you

 cancer be the 2 cause of death in america second only to heart disease

 last month i announce our plan to supercharge the cancer moonshot that president obama ask i to lead six year ago

 our goal be to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 year turn more cancer from death sentence into treatable disease

 more support for patient and family

 to get there i call on congress to fund arpa h the advanced research projects agency for health

 it ’s base on darpa the defense department project that lead to the internet gps and so much more

 arpa h will have a singular purpose to drive breakthrough in cancer alzheimer ’s diabetes and more

 a unity agenda for the nation

 we can do this

 my fellow americans tonight we have gather in a sacred space the citadel of our democracy

 in this capitol generation after generation americans have debate great question amid great strife and have do great thing

 as hard as these time have be i be more optimistic about america today than i have be my whole life

 because i see the future that be within our grasp

 because i know there be simply nothing beyond our capacity

 we be the only nation on earth that have always turn every crisis we have face into an opportunity

 the only nation that can be define by a single word possibility

 so on this night in our 245th year as a nation i have come to report on the state of the union

 and my report be this the state of the union be strong because you the american people be strong

 we be strong today than we be a year ago

 and we will be strong a year from now than we be today

 now be our moment to meet and overcome the challenge of our time

 and we will as one people

 the united states of america

 may god bless you all may god protect our troop

the president thank you thank you thank you please if you have a seat be seat laughter if you do n’t come up on stage

 thank you very much it ’ a great honor to be here mr. president they tell i you ’re over there somewhere there you be thank you mr. president

 be not afraid they be the first word at the first public address of the first polish pope after his election on october of 1978 they be word that would come to define pope john paul ii word that would change the world

 john paul bring the message here to warsaw in his first trip back home as pope in june of 1979 it be a message about the power the power of faith the power of resilience and the power of the people

 in the face of a cruel and brutal system of government it be a message that help end the soviet repression in the central land and eastern europe 30 year ago it be a message that will overcome the cruelty and brutality of this unjust war

 when pope john paul bring that message in 1979 the soviet union rule with an iron fist behind an iron curtain

 then a year later the solidarity movement take hold in poland and while i know he could not be here tonight we ’re all grateful in america and around the world for lech wałęsa applause

 it remind i of that phrase of philosopher kierkegaard f]aith see well in the dark and there be dark moment

 ten year later the soviet union collapse and poland and central and eastern europe would soon be free nothing about that battle for freedom be simple or easy it be a long painful slog fight over not day and month but year and decade

 but we emerge anew in the great battle for freedom a battle between democracy and autocracy between liberty and repression between a rule base order and one govern by brute force

 in this battle we need to be clear eyed this battle will not be win in day or month either we need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead

 mr. president mr. prime minister mr. mayor member of the parliament distinguished guest and the people of poland and i suspect some people of ukraine that be here we’re—(applause)—we be gather here at the royal castle in this city that hold a sacred place in the history of not only of europe but humankind ’s unending search for freedom

 for generation warsaw have stand where liberty have be challenge and liberty have prevail

 in fact it be here in warsaw when a young refugee who flee her home country from czechoslovakia be under soviet domination come back to speak and stand in solidarity with dissident

 her name be madeleine korbel albright she became—(applause)—one of the most ardent supporter of democracy in the world she be a friend with whom i serve america ’s first woman secretary of state she pass away three day ago

 she fight her whole life for essential democratic principle and now in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom ukraine and its people be on the frontline fight to save their nation

 and their brave resistance be part of a large fight for an essential democratic principle that unite all free people the rule of law free and fair election the freedom to speak to write and to assemble the freedom to worship as one choose freedom of the press

 these principle be essential in a free society applause but they have always they have always be under siege they ’ve always be embattle every generation have have to defeat democracy ’s mortal foe that ’ the way of the world for the world be imperfect as we know where the appetite and ambition of a few forever seek to dominate the life and liberty of many

 my message to the people of ukraine be the message i deliver today to ukraine ’s foreign minister and defense minister who i believe be here tonight we stand with you period

 today ’s fighting in kyiv and mariupol and kharkiv be the late battle in a long struggle hungary 1956 poland 1956 then again 1981 czechoslovakia 1968

 soviet tank crush democratic uprising but the resistance continue until finally in 1989 the berlin wall and all of the wall of soviet domination they fall they fall and the people prevail

 but the battle for democracy could not conclude and do not conclude with the end of the cold war

 over the last 30 year the force of autocracy have revive all across the globe its hallmark be familiar one contempt for the rule of law contempt for democratic freedom contempt for the truth itself

 today russia have strangle democracy have seek to do so elsewhere not only in its homeland under false claim of ethnic solidarity it have invalidate invade neighboring nation

 putin have the gall to say he ’s de nazifying ukraine it ’ a lie it ’ just cynical he know that and it ’s also obscene

 president zelenskyy be democratically elect he ’ jewish his father ’s family be wipe out in the nazi holocaust and putin have the audacity like all autocrat before he to believe that might will make right

 in my own country a former president name abraham lincoln voice the oppose spirit to save our union in the midst of a civil war he say let we have faith that right make might right make might

 today let we now have that faith again let we resolve to put the strength of democracy into action to thwart the denign sic of our the design of autocracy let we remember that the test of this moment be the test of all time

 the kremlin want to portray nato enlargement as an imperial project aim at destabilizing russia nothing be far from the truth nato be a defensive alliance it have never seek the demise of russia

 in the lead up to the current crisis the united states and nato work for month to engage russia to avert a war i meet with he in person and talk to he many time on the phone

 time and again we offer real diplomacy and concrete proposal to strengthen european security enhance transparency and build confidence on all side

 but putin and russia meet each of the proposal with disinterest in any negotiation with lie and ultimatum russia be bent on violence from the start

 i know not all of you believe i and we when we keep say they be go to cross the border they be go to attack

 repeatedly he assert we have no interest in war guarantee he would not move

 repeatedly say he would not invade ukraine

 repeatedly say russian troop along the border be there for training”—all 180,000 of they

 there be simply no justification or provocation for russia ’s choice of war it ’ an example of one of the old of human impulse use brute force and disinformation to satisfy a craving for absolute power and control

 it ’ nothing less than a direct challenge to the rule base international order establish since the end of world war two

 and it threaten to return to decade of war that ravage europe before the international rule base order be put in place we can not go back to that we can not

 the gravity of the threat be why the response of the west have be so swift and so powerful and so unified unprecedented and overwhelming

 swift and punishing cost be the only thing that be go to get russia to change its course

 within day of its invasion the west have move jointly with sanction to damage russia ’s economy

 russia ’s central bank be now block from the global financial system deny kremlin ’s access to the war fund it stash around the globe

 we ’ve aim at the heart of russia ’s economy by stop the import of russian energy to the united states

 to date the united states have sanction 140 russian oligarch and their family member seize their ill begotten gain their yacht their luxury apartment their mansion

 we ’ve sanction more than 400 russian government official include key architect of this war

 these official and oligarch have reap enormous benefit from the corruption connect to the kremlin and now they have to share in the pain

 the private sector be act as well over 400 private multinational company have pull out of do business in russia leave russia completely from oil company to mcdonald ’s

 as a result of these unprecedented sanction the ruble almost be immediately reduce to rubble the russian economy—(applause)—that ’ true by the way it take about 200 ruble to equal one dollar

 the economy be on track to be cut in half in the come year it be rank russia ’s economy be rank the 11th big economy in the world before this evasion sic]—invasion it will soon not even rank among the top 20 in the world

 take together these economic sanction be a new kind of economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that rival military might

 these international sanction be sap russian strength its ability to replenish its military and its ability its ability to project power and it be putin it be vladimir putin who be to blame period

 at the same time alongside these economic sanction the western world have come together to provide for the people of ukraine with incredible level of military economic and humanitarian assistance

 in the year before the invasion we america have send over $ 650 million before they cross the border in weapon to ukraine include anti air and anti armor equipment

 since the invasion america have commit another $ 1.35 billion in weapon and ammunition

 and thank to the courage and bravery of the ukrainian people—(applause)—the equipment we ’ve send and our colleague have send have be use to devastating effect to defend ukrainian land and airspace our allies and partner have step up as well

 but as i ’ve make clear american force be in europe not in europe to engage in conflict with russian force american force be here to defend nato allies

 yesterday i meet with the troop that be serve alongside our polish ally to bolster nato ’s frontline defense the reason we want to make clear be their movement on ukraine do not even think about move on one single inch of nato territory

 we have a sacred obligation—(applause)—we have a sacred obligation under article 5 to defend each and every inch of nato territory with the full force of our collective power

 and early today i visit your national stadium where thousand of ukrainian refugee be now try to answer the tough question a human can ask my god what ’s go to happen to i what ’s go to happen to my family

 i see tear in many of the mother eye as i embrace they their young child their young child not sure whether to smile or cry one little girl say mr. president”—she speak a little english—“is my brother and my daddy be they go to be okay will i see they again without their husband their father in many case their brother or sister who stay back to fight for their country

 i do not have to speak the language or understand the language to feel the emotion in their eye the way they grip my hand and little kid hang on to my leg pray with a desperate hope that all this be temporary apprehension that they may be perhaps forever away from their home almost with debilitate sadness that this be happen all over again

 but i be also strike by the generosity of the people of warsaw for that matter all the polish people for the depth of their compassion their willingness to reach out—(applause)—opene their heart

 i be say to the mayor they ’re prepare to open their heart and their home simply to help i also want to thank my friend the great american chef josé andrés and his team who help feel sic those—(applause)—feede those who be yearn to be free

 but help these refugee be not something poland or any other nation should carry alone all the world democracy have a responsibility to help all of they and the people of ukraine can count on the united states to meet its responsibility

 i ’ve announce two day ago we will welcome 100,000 ukrainian refugee we already have 8,000 a week come to the united states of other nat-—nationalities

 we ’ll provide nearly $ 300 million of humanitarian assistance provide ten of thousand of ton of food water medicine and other basic supply

 in brussels i announce the united states be prepared to provide more than $ 1 billion in addition in humanitarian aid

 the world food programme tell we that despite significant obstacle at least some relief be get to major city in ukraine but not metropol sic]—no excuse i mar-—not mariupol because russian force be block relief supply

 but we ’ll not cease our effort to get humanitarian relief wherever it be need in ukraine and for the people who ’ve make it out of ukraine

 notwithstanding the brutality of vladimir putin let there be no doubt that this war have already be a strategic failure for russia already having lose child myself i know that ’ no solace to the people who ’ve lose family

 but he putin think ukrainians would roll over and not fight not much of a student of history instead russian force have meet their match with brave and stiff ukrainian resistance

 rather than break ukrainian resolve russia ’s brutal tactic have strengthen the resolve

 rather than drive nato apart the west be now strong and more united than it have ever be

 russia want less of a nato presence on its border but now he have we have a strong presence a large presence with over a hundred thousand american troop here along with all the other member of nato

 in fact—(applause)—russia have manage to cause something i ’m sure he never intend the democracy of the world be revitalize with purpose and unity find in month that we ’d once take year to accomplish

 it ’ not only russia ’s action in ukraine that be remind we of democracy ’s blessing it ’ our own country his own country the kremlin be jail protestor two hundred thousand people have allegedly already leave there ’ a brain drain leave russia shut down independent news state medium be all propaganda block the image of civilian target mass grave starvation tactic of the russian force in ukraine

 be it any wonder as i say that 200,000 russians have all leave their country in one month a remarkable brain drain in such a short period of time which bring i to my message to the russian people

 i ’ve work with russian leader for decade i sit across the negotiating table go all the way back to soviet premier alexei kosygin to talk arm control at the height of the cold war

 i ’ve always speak directly and honestly to you the russian people

 let i say this if you ’re able to listen you the russian people be not our enemy

 i refuse to believe that you welcome the killing of innocent child and grandparent or that you accept hospital school maternity ward that for god ’s sake be be pummel with russian missile and bomb or city be surround so that civilian can not flee supply cut off and attempt to starve ukrainians into submission

 million of family be be drive from their home include half of all ukraine ’s child these be not the action of a great nation

 of all people you the russian people as well as all people across europe still have the memory of be in a similar situation in the late thirty and forty the situation of world war two still fresh in the mind of many grandparent in the region

 what whatever your generation experience whether it experience the siege of leningrad or hear about it from your parent and grandparent train station overflow with terrify family flee their home night shelter in basement and cellar morning sit through the rubble in your home these be not memory of the past not anymore because it ’s exactly what the russian army be do in ukraine right now

 march 26 2022 just day before we’re at the twenty fir-—you be a 21st century nation with hope and dream that people all over the world have for themselves and their family

 now vladimir putin ’s aggression have cut you the russian people off from the rest of the world and it ’s take russia back to the 19th century

 this be not who you be this be not the future reserve you deserve for your family and your child i ’m tell you the truth this war be not worthy of you the russian people

 putin can and must end this war the american people stand with you and the brave citizen of ukraine who want peace

 and my message to the rest of europe this new battle for freedom have already make a few thing crystal clear

 first europe must end its dependence on russian fossil fuel and we the united states will help that ’s why just yesterday in brussels i announce a plan with the president of the european commission to get europe through the immediate energy crisis

 over the long term as a matter of economic security and national security and for the survivability of the planet we all need to move as quickly as possible to clean renewable energy and we ’ll work together to help get that do so that the day of any nation be subject to the whim of a tyrant for its energy need be over they must end they must end

 and second we have to fight the corruption come from the kremlin to give the russian people a fair chance

 and finally and most urgently we maintain absolute unity we must among the world ’s democracy

 it ’ not enough to speak with rhetorical flourish of ennoble word of democracy of freedom equality and liberty all of we include here in poland must do the hard work of democracy each and every day my country as well

 that ’ why—(applause)—that ’s why i come to europe again this week with a clear and determined message for nato for the g7 for the european union for all freedom love nation we must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul we must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the year and decade to come

 it will not be easy there will be cost but it ’ a price we have to pay because the darkness that drive autocracy be ultimately no match for the flame of liberty that light the soul of free people everywhere

 time and again history show that it ’s from the dark moment that the great progress follow and history show this be the task of our time the task of this generation

 let ’s remember the hammer blow that bring down the berlin wall the might that lift the iron curtain be not the word of a single leader it be the people of europe who for decade fight to free themselves

 their sheer bravery open the border between austria and hungary for the pan european picnic they join hand for the baltic way they stand for solidarity here in poland and together it be an unmistakable and undeniable force of the people that the soviet union could not withstand

 and we ’re see it once again today with the brave ukrainian people show that their power of many be great than the will of any one dictator

 so in this hour let the word of pope john paul burn as brightly today never ever give up hope never doubt never tire never become discouraged be not afraid

 a dictator bend on rebuild an empire will never erase a people ’s love for liberty brutality will never grind down their will to be free ukraine will never be a victory for russia for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness

 we will have a different future a bright future root in democracy and principle hope and light of decency and dignity of freedom and possibility

 for god ’s sake this man can not remain in power

 god bless you all and may god defend our freedom and may god protect our troop   thank you for your patience thank you thank you thank you

good evening fellow americans

 i have hope when i become president i would not have to do this again

 another massacre uvalde texas an elementary school beautiful innocent second third fourth grader and how many score of little child who witness what happen see their friend die as if they ’re on a battlefield for god ’s sake they ’ll live with it the rest of their life

 there ’ a lot we do n’t know yet but there ’ a lot we do know

 there be parent who will never see their child again never have they jump in bed and cuddle with they parent who will never be the same

 to lose a child be like have a piece of your soul rip away there ’ a hollowness in your chest and you feel like you ’re be suck into it and never go to be able to get out it ’ suffocate and it ’s never quite the same

 and it ’ a feeling share by the sibling and the grandparent and their family member and the community that ’s leave behind

 scripture say jill and i have talk about this in different contexts in other contexts the lord be near to the brokenhearted and save the crushed in spirit so many crushed spirit

 so tonight i ask the nation to pray for they to give the parent and sibling the strength in the darkness they feel right now

 as a nation we have to ask when in god ’s name be we go to stand up to the gun lobby when in god ’s name will we do what we all know in our gut need to be do

 it ’s be 340—3,448 days—10 year since i stand up at a high school in connecticut a grade school in connecticut where another gunman massacre 26 people include 20 first grader at sandy hook elementary school

 since then there have be over 900 incident of gunfire report on school ground

 marjorie stoneman douglas high school in parkland florida santa fe high school in texas oxford high school in michigan the list go on and on

 and the list grow when it include mass shooting at place like movie theater house of worship and as we see just 10 day ago at a grocery store in buffalo new york

 i be sick and tired of it we have to act and do not tell i we can not have an impact on this carnage

 i spend my career as a senator and as vice president work to pass commonsense gun law we can not and will not prevent every tragedy but we know they work and have a positive impact when we pass the assault weapon ban mass shooting go down when the law expire mass shooting triple

 the idea that an 18 year old kid can walk into a gun store and buy two assault weapon be just wrong

 what in god ’s name do you need an assault weapon for except to kill someone

 deer be n’t run through the forest with kevlar vest on for god ’s sake it ’ just sick

 and the gun manufacturer have spend two decade aggressively marketing assault weapon which make they the most and large profit

 for god ’s sake we have to have the courage to stand up to the industry

 here ’s what else i know most americans support commonsense law commonsense gun law

 i just get off my trip from asia meet with asian leader and i learn of this while i be on the aircraft and what strike i on that 17 hour flight what strike i be these kind of mass shooting rarely happen anywhere else in the world

 why they have mental health problem they have domestic dispute in other country they have people who be lose but these kind of mass shooting never happen with the kind of frequency that they happen in america why

 why be we willing to live with this carnage why do we keep let this happen where in god ’s name be our backbone to have the courage to deal with it and stand up to the lobby    it ’ time to turn this pain into action

 for every parent for every citizen in this country we have to make it clear to every elect official in this country it ’ time to act

 it ’ time for those who obstruct or delay or block the commonsense gun law we need to let you know that we will not forget

 we can do so much more we have to do more

 our prayer tonight be for those parent lie in bed and try to figure out will i be able to sleep again what do i say to my other child what happen tomorrow   

 may god bless the loss of innocent life on this sad day and may the lord be near the brokenhearted and save those crush in spirit because they ’re go to need a lot of help and a lot of our prayer

   god love you

the president my fellow americans please if you have a seat take it i speak to you tonight from sacred ground in america independence hall in philadelphia pennsylvania

 this be where america make its declaration of independence to the world more than two century ago with an idea unique among nation that in america we ’re all create equal

 this be where the united states constitution be write and debate

 this be where we set in motion the most extraordinary experiment of self government the world have ever know with three simple word we the people we the people

 these two document and the idea they embody equality and democracy be the rock upon which this nation be build they be how we become the great nation on earth they be why for more than two century america have be a beacon to the world

 but as i stand here tonight equality and democracy be under assault we do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise

 so tonight i have come this place where it all begin to speak as plainly as i can to the nation about the threat we face about the power we have in our own hand to meet these threat and about the incredible future that lie in front of we if only we choose it

 we must never forget we the people be the true heir of the american experiment that begin more than two century ago

 we the people have burn inside each of we the flame of liberty that be light here at independence hall a flame that light our way through abolition the civil war suffrage the great depression world war civil rights

 that sacred flame still burn now in our time as we build an america that be more prosperous free and just

 that be the work of my presidency a mission i believe in with my whole soul

 but first we must be honest with each other and with ourselves

 too much of what ’s happen in our country today be not normal

 donald trump and the maga republicans represent an extremism that threaten the very foundation of our republic

 now i want to be very clear very clear up front not every republican not even the majority of republicans be maga republicans not every republican embrace their extreme ideology

 i know because i ’ve be able to work with these mainstream republicans

 but there be no question that the republican party today be dominate drive and intimidate by donald trump and the maga republicans and that be a threat to this country

 these be hard thing

 but i ’m an american president not the president of red america or blue america but of all america

 and i believe it be my duty my duty to level with you to tell the truth no matter how difficult no matter how painful

 and here in my view be what be true maga republicans do not respect the constitution they do not believe in the rule of law they do not recognize the will of the people

 they refuse to accept the result of a free election and they ’re work right now as i speak in state after state to give power to decide election in america to partisan and crony empower election denier to undermine democracy itself

 maga force be determined to take this country backwards backwards to an america where there be no right to choose no right to privacy no right to contraception no right to marry who you love

 they promote authoritarian leader and they fan the flame of political violence that be a threat to our personal right to the pursuit of justice to the rule of law to the very soul of this country

 they look at the mob that storm the united states capitol on january 6th brutally attack law enforcement not as insurrectionist who place a dagger to the throat of our democracy but they look at they as patriot

 and they see their maga failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 election

 they try everything last time to nullify the vote of 81 million people this time they ’re determined to succeed in thwart the will of the people

 that ’ why respected conservative like federal circuit court judge michael luttig have call trump and the extreme maga republicans quote a clear and present danger to our democracy

 but while the threat to american democracy be real i want to say as clearly as we can we be not powerless in the face of these threat we be not bystander in this ongoing attack on democracy

 there be far more american far more americans from every from every background and belief who reject the extreme maga ideology than those that accept it

 and folk it be within our power it ’s in our hand your and mine to stop the assault on american democracy

 i believe america be at an inflection point one of those moment that determine the shape of everything that ’s to come after

 and now america must choose to move forward or to move backwards to build the future or obsess about the past to be a nation of hope and unity and optimism or a nation of fear division and of darkness

 maga republicans have make their choice they embrace anger they thrive on chaos they live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lie

 but together together we can choose a different path we can choose a well path forward to the future a future of possibility a future to build and dream and hope

 and we ’re on that path move ahead

 i know this nation i know you the american people i know your courage i know your heart and i know our history

 this be a nation that honor our constitution we do not reject it

 this be a nation that believe in the rule of law we do not repudiate it

 this be a nation that respect free and fair election we honor the will of the people we do not deny it

 and this be a nation that reject violence as a political tool we do not encourage violence

 we be still an america that believe in honesty and decency and respect for other patriotism liberty justice for all hope possibility

 we be still at our core a democracy

 and yet history tell we that blind loyalty to a single leader and a willingness to engage in political violence be fatal to democracy

 for a long time we ’ve tell ourselves that american democracy be guarantee but it ’ not

 we have to defend it protect it stand up for it each and every one of we

 that ’ why tonight i ’m ask our nation to come together unite behind the single purpose of defend our democracy regardless of your ideology

 we ’re all call by duty and conscience to confront extremist who will put their own pursuit of power above all else

 democrats independent mainstream republicans we must be strong more determined and more committed to save american democracy than maga republicans be to to destroy american democracy

 we the people will not let anyone or anything tear we apart today there be danger around we we can not allow to prevail   we hear you’ve hear it more and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country it ’ not it can never be an acceptable tool

 so i want to say this plain and simple there be no place for political violence in america period none ever

 we see law enforcement brutally attack on january the 6th we ’ve see election official poll worker many of they volunteer of both party subject to intimidation and death threat and can you believe it?—fbi agent just do their job as direct face threat to their own life from their own fellow citizen

 on top of that there be public figure today yesterday and the day before predict and all but call for mass violence and rioting in the street

 this be inflammatory it ’ dangerous it ’ against the rule of law and we the people must say this be not who we be

 lady and gentleman we can not be pro insurrectionist and pro american they ’re incompatible

 we can not allow violence to be normalize in this country it ’ wrong we each have to reject political violence with all the moral clarity and conviction this nation can muster now

 we can not let the integrity of our election be undermine for that be a path to chaos

 look i know politic can be fierce and mean and nasty in america i get it i believe in the give and take of politic in disagreement and debate and dissent

 we ’re a big complicated country but democracy endure only if we the people respect the guardrail of the republic only if we the people accept the result of free and fair election only if we the people see politic not as total war but mediation of our difference

 democracy can not survive when one side believe there be only two outcome to an election either they win or they be cheat and that ’ where maga republicans be today

 they do not understand what every patriotic american know you can not love your country only when you win it ’ fundamental

 american democracy only work only if we choose to respect the rule of law and the institution that be set up in this chamber behind i only if we respect our legitimate political difference

 i will not stand by and watch i will not the will of the american people be overturn by wild conspiracy theory and baseless evidence free claim of fraud

 i will not stand by and watch election in this country steal by people who simply refuse to accept that they lose

 i will not stand by and watch the most fundamental freedom in this country the freedom to vote and have your vote count and be take from you and the american people

 look as your president i will defend our democracy with every fiber of my being and i ’m ask every american to join i

 throughout our history america have often make the great progress come out of some of our dark moment like you ’re hear in that bullhorn

 i believe we can and we must do that again and we be

 maga republicans look at america and see carnage and darkness and despair they spread fear and lies–-lie tell for profit and power

 but i see a very different america an america with an unlimited future an america that be about to take off i hope you see it as well   just look around

 i believe we could lift america from the depth of covid so we pass the large economic recovery package since franklin delano roosevelt and today america ’s economy be fast strong than any other advanced nation in the world we have more to go

 i believe we could build a well america so we pass the big infrastructure investment since president dwight d. eisenhower and we ’ve now embark on a decade of rebuild
 the nation ’s road bridge highway port water system high speed internet railroad

 i believe we could make america safe so we pass the most significant gun safety law since president clinton

 i believe we could go from be the high cost of prescription in the world to make prescription drug and healthcare more affordable so we pass the most significant healthcare reform since president obama sign the affordable care act

 and i believe we could create we could create a clean energy future and save the planet so we pass the most important climate initiative ever ever ever

 the cynic and the critic tell we nothing can get do but they be wrong there be not a single thing america can not do not a single thing beyond our capacity if we do it together

 it ’ never easy but we ’re prove that in america no matter how long the road progress do come

 look i know the last year few year have be tough but today covid no long control our life more americans be work than ever business be grow our school be open million of americans have be lift out of poverty million of veteran once expose to toxic burn pit will now get what they deserve for their family and the compensation

 american manufacturing have come alive across the heartland and the future will be make in america no matter what the white supremacist and the extremist say

 i make a bet on you the american people and that bet be pay off prove that from darkness the darkness of charlottesville of covid of gun violence of insurrection we can see the light light be now visible

 light that will guide we forward not only in word but in action action for you for your child for your grandchild for america

 even in this moment with all the challenge we face i give you my word as a biden i ’ve never be more optimistic about america ’s future not because of i but because of who you be

 we ’re go to end cancer as we know it mark my word

 we be go to create million of new job in a clean energy economy

 we ’re go to think big we ’re go to make the 21st century another american century because the world need we to

 that ’s where we need to focus our energy not in the past not on divisive culture war not on the politic of grievance but on a future we can build together

 the maga republicans believe that for they to succeed everyone else have to fail they believe america not like i believe about america

 i believe america be big enough for all of we to succeed and that be the nation we ’re build a nation where no one be leave behind

 i run for president because i believe we be in a battle for the soul of this nation i still believe that to be true i believe the soul be the breath the life and the essence of who we be the soul be what make we we

 the soul of america be define by the sacred proposition that all be create equal in the image of god that all be entitle to be treat with decency dignity and respect that all deserve justice and a shot at life of prosperity and consequence and that democracy democracy must be defend for democracy make all these thing possible folk and it ’ up to we

 democracy begin and will be preserve in we the people ’s habit of heart in our character optimism that be test yet endure courage that dig deep when we need it empathy that fuel democracy the willingness to see each other not as enemy but as fellow americans

 look our democracy be imperfect it always have be

 notwithstanding those folk you hear on the other side there they ’re entitle to be outrageous this be a democracy but history and common sense good manner be nothing they ’ve ever suffer from

 but history and common sense tell we that opportunity liberty and justice for all be most likely to come to pass in a democracy

 we have never fully realize the aspiration of our founding but every generation have open those door a little wide to include more people who have be exclude before

 my fellow americans america be an idea the most powerful idea in the history of the world and it beat in the heart of the people of this country it beat in all of our heart it unite america it be the american creed

 the idea that america guarantee that everyone be treat with dignity it give hate no safe harbor it install in everyone the belief that no matter where you start in life there ’ nothing you can not achieve

 that ’s who we be that ’ what we stand for that ’ what we believe and that be precisely what we be do open door create new possibility focus on the future and we ’re only just begin

 our task be to make our nation free and fair just and strong noble and whole

 and this work be the work of democracy the work of this generation it be the work of our time for all time

 we can not afford to have leave anyone on the sideline we need everyone to do their part so speak up speak out get engaged vote vote vote

 and if we all do our duty if we do our duty in 2022 and beyond then age still to come will say we all of we here we keep the faith we preserve democracy we heed not our bad instinct but our well angel and we prove that for all its imperfection america be still the beacon to the world an ideal to be realize a promise to be keep

 there be nothing more important nothing more sacred nothing more american that ’ our soul that ’s who we truly be and that ’s who must we must always be

 and i have no doubt none––that this be who we will be and that we ’ll come together as a nation that we ’ll secure our democracy that for the next 200 year we ’ll have what we have the past 200 year the great nation on the face of the earth

 we just need to remember who we be we be the united states of america the united states of america

 and may god protect our nation and may god protect all those who stand watch over our democracy god bless you all democracy thank you

thank you

 mr. president mr. secretary general my fellow leader in the last year our world have experience great upheaval a grow crisis in food insecurity record heat flood and drought covid-19 inflation and a brutal needless war a war choose by one man to be very blunt

 let we speak plainly a permanent member of the united nations security council invade its neighbor attempt to erase a sovereign state from the map

 russia have shamelessly violate the core tenet of the united nations charter no more important than the clear prohibition against country take the territory of their neighbor by force

 again just today president putin have make overt nuclear threat against europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibility of the non proliferation regime

 now russia be call call up more soldier to join the fight and the kremlin be organize a sham referenda to try to annex part of ukraine an extremely significant violation of the u.n. charter

 this world should see these outrageous act for what they be putin claim he have to act because russia be threaten but no one threaten russia and no one other than russia seek conflict

 in fact we warn it be come and with many of you we work to try to avert it

 putin ’s own word make his true purpose unmistakable just before he invade putin assert and i quote ukraine be create by russia and never have quote real statehood

 and now we see attack on school railway station hospital wa-—on center of ukrainian history and culture
 in the past even more horrifying evidence of russia ’s atrocity and war crime mass grave uncover in izyum body accord to those that excavate those body show sign of torture

 this war be about extinguish ukraine ’s right to exist as a state plain and simple and ukraine ’s right to exist as a people whoever you be wherever you live whatever you believe that should not that should make your blood run cold

 that ’ why 141 nation in the general assembly come together to unequivocally condemn russia ’s war against ukraine the united states have marshal massive level of security assistance and humanitarian aid and direct economic support for ukraine more than $ 25 billion to date

 our ally and partner around the world have step up as well and today more than 40 country represent in here have contribute billion of their own money and equipment to help ukraine defend itself

 the united states be also work closely with our ally and partner to impose cost on russia to deter attack against nato territory to hold russia accountable for the atrocity and war crime

 because if nation can pursue their imperial ambition without consequence then we put at risk everything this very institution stand for everything

 every victory win on the battlefield belong to the courageous ukrainian soldier but this past year the world be test as well and we do not hesitate

 we choose liberty we choose sovereignty we choose principle to which every party to the united nations charter be behold we stand with ukraine

 like you the united states want this war to end on just term on term we all sign up for that you can not seize a nation ’s territory by force the only country stand in the way of that be russia

 so we each of we in this body who be determined to uphold the principle and belief we pledge to defend as member of the united nations must be clear firm and unwavering in our resolve

 ukraine have the same right that belong to every sovereign nation we will stand in solidarity with ukraine we will stand in solidarity against russia ’s aggression period

 now it ’ no secret that in the contest between democracy and autocracy the united states and i as president champion a vision for our world that be ground in the value of democracy

 the united states be determined to defend and strengthen democracy at home and around the world because i believe democracy remain humanity ’s great instrument to address the challenge of our time

 we ’re work with the g7 and likeminded country to prove democracy can deliver for their citizen but also deliver for the rest of the world as well

 but as we meet today the u.n. charter the u.n. charter ’s very basis of a stable and just rule base order be under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage

 and the united nations charter be not only sign by democracy of the world it be negotiate among citizen of dozen of nation with vastly different history and ideology unite in their commitment to work for peace

 as president truman say in 1945 the u.n. charter and i quote be proof that nation like man can state their difference can face they and then can find common ground on which to stand end of quote

 that common ground be so straightforward so basic that today 193 of you—193 member state have willingly embrace its principle and stand up for those principle for the u.n. charter be the job of every responsible member state

 i reject the use of violence and war to conquer nation or expand border through bloodshed

 to stand against global politic of fear and coercion to defend the sovereign right of small nation as equal to those of large one to embrace basic principle like freedom of navigation respect for international law and arm control no matter what else we may disagree on that be the common ground upon which we must stand

 if you ’re still commit to a strong foundation for the good of every nation around the world then the united states want to work with you

 i also believe the time have come for this institution to become more inclusive so that it can well respond to the need of today ’s world

 member of the u.n. security council include the united states should consistently uphold and defend the u.n. charter and refrain refrain from the use of the veto except in rare extraordinary situation to ensure that the council remain credible and effective

 that be also why the united states support increase the number of both permanent and non permanent representative of the council this include permanent seat for those nation we ’ve long support and permanent seat for country in africa latin america and the caribbean

 the united states be committed to this vital work in every region we pursue new constructive way to work with partner to advance shared interest from elevate the quad in the indo pacific to sign the los angeles declaration of migration and protection at the summit of the americas to join a historic meeting of nine arab leader to work toward a more peaceful integrate middle east to host the u.s.-africa leader summit in this december

 as i say last year the united states be open an era of relentless diplomacy to address the challenge that matter most to people ’s life all people ’s life tackle the climate crisis as the previous speaker speak to strengthen global health security feed the world feed the world

 we make that priority and one year later we ’re keep that promise

 from the day i come to office we ’ve lead with a bold climate agenda we rejoin the paris agreement convene major climate summit help deliver critical agreement on cop26 and we help get two third of the world gdp on track to limit warming to 1.5 degree celsius

 and now i ’ve sign a historic piece of legislation here in the united states that include the big most important climate commitment we have ever make in the history of our country $ 369 billion toward climate change that include ten of billion in new investment in offshore wind and solar double down on zero emission vehicle increase energy efficiency support clean manufacturing

 our department of energy estimate that this new law will reduce u.s. emission by one gigaton a year by 2030 while unleash a new era of clean energy power economic growth

 our investment will also help reduce the cost of develop clean energy technology worldwide not just the united states this be a global gamechanger and none too soon we do not have much time

 we all know we ’re already live in a climate crisis no one seem to doubt it after this past year as we meet much of pakistan be still underwater it need help meanwhile the horn of africa face unprecedented drought

 family be face impossible choice choose which child to feed and wonder whether they ’ll survive

 this be the human cost of climate change and it ’s grow not lessen

 so as i announce last year to meet our global responsibility my administration be work with our congress to deliver more than $ 11 billion a year to international climate finance to help low income country implement their climate goal and ensure a just energy transition

 the key part of that will be our prepare plan which will help half a billion people and especially vulnerable country adapt to the impact of climate change and build resilience

 this need be enormous so let this be the moment we find within ourselves the will to turn back the tide of climate devastation and unlock a resilient sustainable clean energy economy to preserve our planet

 on global health we ’ve deliver more than 620 million dose of covid-19 vaccine to 116 country around the world with more available to help meet country need all free of charge no string attach

 and we ’re work closely with the g20 and other country and the united states help lead the change to establish a groundbreaking new fund for pandemic prevention preparedness and response at the world bank

 at the same time we ’ve continue to advance the ball on endure global health challenge

 later today i ’ll host the seventh replenishment conference for the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria with bipartisan support in our congress i have pledge to contribute up to $ 6 billion to that effort

 so i look forward to welcome a historic round of pledge at the conference result in one of the large global health fundraiser ever hold in all of history

 we ’re also take on the food crisis head on with as many as 193 million people around the world experience acute acute food insecurity a jump of 40 million in a year today i ’m announce another $ 2.9 billion in u.s. support for lifesave humanitarian and food security assistance for this year alone

 russia in the meantime be pump out lie try to pin the blame for the crisis the food crisis onto sanction impose by many in the world for the aggression against ukraine

 so let i be perfectly clear about something our sanction explicitly allow explicitly allow russia the ability to export food and fertilizer no limitation it ’ russia ’s war that be worsen food insecurity and only russia can end it

 i ’m grateful for the work here at the u.n.—include your leadership mr. secretary general establish a mechanism to export grain from black sea port in ukraine that russia have block for month and we need to make sure it ’s extend

 we believe strongly in the need to feed the world that ’ why the united states be the world ’s large supporter of the world food programme with more than 40 percent of its budget

 we ’re lead support we’re lead support of the unicef effort to feed child around the world

 and to take on the large challenge of food insecurity the united states introduce a call to action a roadmap eliminate global food insecurity to eliminate global food insecurity that more than 100 nation member state have already support

 in june the g7 announce more than $ 4.5 billion to strengthen food security around the world

 through usaid ’s feed the future initiative the united states be scale up innovative way to get drought- and heat resistant seed into the hand of farmer who need they while distribute fertilizer and improve fertilizer efficiency so that farmer can grow more while use less

 and we ’re call on all country to refrain from ban food export or hoarding grain while so many people be suffer because in every country in the world no matter what else divide we if parent can not feed their child nothing nothing else matter if parent can not feed their child

 as we look to the future we ’re work with our partner to update and create rule of the road for new challenge we face in the 21st century

 we launch the trade and technology council with the european union to ensure that key technology key technology be develop and govern in the way that benefit everyone

 with our partner country and through the u.n. we ’re support and strengthen the norm of responsibility responsible state behavior in cyberspace and work to hold accountable those who use cyberattack to threaten international peace and security

 with partner in the americas africa europe and the middle east and the indo pacific we ’re work to build a new economic ecosystem while where every nation every nation get a fair shot and economic growth be resilient sustainable and share

 that ’ why the united states have champion a global minimum tax and we will work to see it implement so major corporation pay their fair share everywhere everywhere

 it ’s also be the idea behind the indo pacific economic framework which the united states launch this year with 13 other indo pacific economy we ’re work with our partner in asean and the pacific islands to support a vision for a critical indo pacific region that be free and open connected and prosperous secure and resilient

 together with partner around the world we ’re work to secure resilient supply chain that protect everyone from coercion or domination and ensure that no country can use energy as a weapon

 and as russia ’s war roll the global economy we ’re also call on major global creditor include the non paris club country to transparently negotiate debt forgiveness for low income country to forestall broad economic and political crisis around the world

 instead of infrastructure project that generate huge and large debt without deliver on the promise advantage let ’s meet the enormous infrastructure need around the world with transparent investment high standard project that protect the right of worker and the environment key to the need of the community they serve not to the contributor

 that ’ why the united states together with fellow g7 partner launch a partnership for global infrastructure and investment we intend to collectively mobilize $ 600 billion in investment through this partnership by 2027

 dozen of project be already underway industrial scale vaccine manufacturing in senegal transformative solar project in angola first of its kind small modular nuclear power plant in romania

 these be investment that be go to deliver return not just for those country but for everyone the united states will work with every nation include our competitor to solve global problem like climate change climate diplomacy be not a favor to the united states or any other nation and walk away hurt the entire world

 let i be direct about the competition between the united states and china as we manage shift geopolitical trend the united states will conduct itself as a reasonable leader we do not seek conflict we do not seek a cold war we do not ask any nation to choose between the united states or any other partner

 but the united states will be unabashe in promote our vision of a free open secure and prosperous world and what we have to offer community of nation investment that be design not to foster dependency but to alleviate burden and help nation become self sufficient partnership not to create political obligation but because we know our own success each of our success be increase when other nation succeed as well

 when individual have the chance to live in dignity and develop their talent everyone benefit critical to that be live up to the high goal of this institution increase peace and security for everyone everywhere

 the united states will not waver in our unrelenting determination to counter and thwart the continue terrorist threat to our world and we will lead with our diplomacy to strive for peaceful resolution of conflict

 we seek to uphold peace and stability across the taiwan straits

 we remain committed to our one china policy which have help prevent conflict for four decade and we continue to oppose unilateral change in the status quo by either side

 we support an african union lead peace process to end the fight in ethiopia and restore security for all its people

 in venezuela where year of the political oppression have drive more than 6 million people from that country we urge a venezuelan lead dialogue and a return to free and fair election

 we continue to stand with our neighbor in haiti as it face political fueled gang violence and an enormous human crisis

 and we call on the world to do the same we have more to do

 we ’ll continue to back the u.n.-mediated truce in yemen which have deliver precious month of peace to people that have suffer year of war

 and we will continue to advocate for last negotiate peace between the jewish and democratic state of israel and the palestinian people the united states be commit to israel ’s security full stop and a negotiate two state solution remain in our view the good way to ensure israel ’s security and prosperity for the future and give the palestinians the state which to which they be entitle both side to fully respect the equal right of their citizen both people enjoy equal measure of freedom and dignity

 let i also urge every nation to recommit to strengthen the nuclear non proliferation regime through diplomacy no matter what else be happen in the world the united states be ready to pursue critical arm control measure a nuclear war can not be win and must never be fight

 the five permanent member of the security council just reaffirm that commitment in january but today we ’re see disturb trend russia shun the non proliferation ideal embrace by every other nation at the 10th npt review conference

 and again today as i say they ’re make irresponsible nuclear threat to use nuclear weapon china be conduct an unprecedented concern nuclear buildup without any transparency

 despite our effort to begin serious and sustained diplomacy the democratic people ’s republic of korea continue to blatantly violate u.n. sanction

 and while the united states be prepare for a mutual return to the joint comprehensive plan of action if iran step up to its obligation the united states be clear we will not allow iran to acquire a nuclear weapon

 i continue to believe that diplomacy be the good way to achieve this outcome the nonproliferation regime be one of the great success of this institution we can not let the world now slide backwards nor can we turn a blind eye to the erosion of human right

 perhaps singular among this body ’s achievement stand the universal declaration of human rights which be the standard by which our forebear challenge we to measure ourselves

 they make clear in 1948 human right be the basis for all that we seek to achieve and yet today in 2022 fundamental freedom be at risk in every part of our world from the violation of in xinjiang detail in recent report by the office of u.n.—u.s.—reports detail by the u.s. u.n. high commissioner to the horrible abuse against pro democracy activist and ethnic minority by the military regime in burma to the increase repression of woman and girl by the taliban in afghanistan

 and today we stand with the brave citizen and the brave woman of iran who right now be demonstrate to secure their basic right

 but here ’ what i know the future will be win by those country that unleash the full potential of their population where woman and girl can exercise equal right include basic reproductive right and contribute fully to build a strong economy and more resilient society where religious and ethnic minority can live their life without harassment and contribute to the fabric of their community where the lgbtq+ community individual live and love freely without be target with violence where citizen can question and criticize their leader without fear of reprisal

 the united states will always promote human right and the value enshrine in the u.n. charter in our own country and around the world

 let i end with this this institution guide by the u.n. charter and the universal declaration of human rights be at its core an act of dauntless hope

 let i say that again it ’ an act of dauntless hope

 think about the vision of those first delegate who undertake a seemingly impossible task while the world be still smolder

 think about how divide the people of the world must have feel with the fresh grief of million dead the genocidal horror of the holocaust expose

 they have every right to believe only the bad of humanity instead they reach for what be good in all of we and they strove to build something well endure peace comity among nation equal right for every member of the human family cooperation for the advancement of all humankind

 my fellow leader the challenge we face today be great indeed but our capacity be great our commitment must be great still
 so let ’s stand together to again declare the unmistakable resolve that nation of the world be unite still that we stand for the value of the u.n. charter that we still believe by work together we can bend the arc of history toward a free and more just world for all our child although none of we have fully achieve it
 we ’re not passive witness to history we be the author of history

 we can do this we have to do it for ourselves and for our future for humankind

 as we gather here tonight we be write the next chapter in the great american story a story of progress and resilience when world leader ask i to define america i define our country in one word possibility

 you know we ’re often tell that democrats and republicans can not work together

 but over these past two year we prove the cynic and the naysayer wrong

 yes we disagree plenty and yes there be time when democrats have to go it alone

 but time and again democrats and republicans come together

 come together to defend a strong and safe europe

 come together to pass a once in a generation infrastructure law build bridge to connect our nation and people

 to my republican friend if we could work together in the last congress there be no reason we can not work together in this new congress

 the people send we a clear message fight for the sake of fighting power for the sake of power conflict for the sake of conflict get we nowhere

 and that ’s always be my vision for our country to restore the soul of the nation to rebuild the backbone of america the middle class to unite the country

 we ’ve be send here to finish the job

 for decade the middle class be hollow out

 too many good pay manufacturing job move overseas factory at home close down

 once thrive city and town become shadow of what they use to be

 and along the way something else be lose

 pride that sense of self worth

 i run for president to fundamentally change thing to make sure the economy work for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do

 to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out not from the top down because when the middle class do well the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well we all do well

 as my dad use to say a job be about a lot more than a paycheck it ’ about your dignity it ’ about respect it ’ about be able to look your kid in the eye and say honey it ’s go to be ok and mean it

 so let ’s look at the result unemployment rate at 3.4 a 50 year low near record low unemployment for black and hispanic worker

 we ’ve already create 800,000 good pay manufacturing job the fast growth in 40 year

 where be it write that america can not lead the world in manufacturing again

 for too many decade we import product and export job

 now thank to all we ’ve do we ’re export american product and create american job

 inflation have be a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupt supply chain and putin ’s war that disrupt energy and food supply

 but we ’re well position than any country on earth

 we have more to do but here at home inflation be come down

 here at home gas price be down $ 1.50 a gallon since their peak

 food inflation be come down

 inflation have fall every month for the last six month while take home pay have go up

 additionally over the last two year a record 10 million americans apply to start a new small business

 every time somebody start a small business it ’ an act of hope

 and the vice president will continue her work to ensure more small business can access capital and the historic law we enact

 stand here last year i share with you a story of american genius and possibility

 semiconductors the small computer chip the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphone to automobile and so much more these chip be invent right here in america

 america use to make nearly 40 of the world ’s chip

 but in the last few decade we lose our edge and we ’re down to produce only 10 we all see what happen during the pandemic when chip factory overseas shut down

 today ’s automobile need up to 3,000 chip each but american automaker could not make enough car because there be n’t enough chip

 car price go up so do everything from refrigerator to cellphone

 we can never let that happen again

 that ’ why we come together to pass the bipartisan chips and science act

 we ’re make sure the supply chain for america begin in america

 we ’ve already create 800,000 manufacturing job even without this law

 with this new law we will create hundred of thousand of new job across the country

 that ’s go to come from company that have announce more than $ 300 billion in investment in american manufacturing in the last two year

 outside of columbus ohio intel be build semiconductor factory on a thousand acre a literal field of dream

 that ’ll create 10,000 job 7,000 construction job 3,000 job once the factory be finish

 job pay $ 130,000 a year and many do n’t require a college degree

 jobs where people do not have to leave home in search of opportunity

 and it ’s just getting start

 think about the new home new small business and so much more that will come to life

 talk to mayor and governors democrats and republicans and they ’ll tell you what this mean to their community

 we ’re see these field of dream transform the heartland

 but to maintain the strong economy in the world we also need the good infrastructure in the world

 we use to be 1 in the world in infrastructure then we fall to 13th

 now we ’re come back because we come together to pass the bipartisan infrastructure law the large investment in infrastructure since president eisenhower ’s interstate highway system

 already we ’ve fund over 20,000 project include at major airport from boston to atlanta to portland

 these project will put hundred of thousand of people to work rebuild our highway bridge railroad tunnel port and airport clean water and high speed internet across america

 urban suburban rural tribal

 and we ’re just getting start i sincerely thank my republican friend who vote for the law

 and to my republican friend who vote against it but still ask to fund project in their district do not worry

 i promise to be the president for all americans

 we ’ll fund your project and i ’ll see you at the ground breaking

 this law will help far unite all of america

 major project like the brent spence bridge between kentucky and ohio over the ohio river build 60 year ago badly in need of repair

 one of the nation ’s most congested freight route carry $ 2 billion worth of freight every day folk have be talk about fix it for decade but we ’re finally go to get it do

 i go there last month with democrats and republicans from both state to deliver $ 1.6 billion for this project

 while i be there i meet an ironworker name sara who be here tonight

 for 30 year she ’s be a proud member of ironworkers local 44 know as the cowboy of the sky who build the cincinnati skyline

 sara say she can not wait to be ten story above the ohio river building that new bridge that ’ pride

 that ’ what we ’re also build pride

 we ’re also replace poisonous lead pipe that go into 10 million home and 400,000 school and childcare center so every child in america can drink clean water

 we ’re make sure that every community have access to affordable high speed internet

 no parent should have to drive to a mcdonald ’s parking lot so their kid can do their homework online

 and when we do these project we ’re go to buy american

 buy american have be the law of the land since 1933 but for too long past administration have find way to get around it

 not anymore

 tonight i ’m also announce new standard to require all construction material use in federal infrastructure project to be make in america

 american make lumber glass drywall fiber optic cable

 and on my watch american road american bridge and american highway will be make with american product

 my economic plan be about invest in place and people that have be forget amid the economic upheaval of the past four decade too many people have be leave behind or treat like they ’re invisible

 maybe that ’s you watch at home

 you remember the job that go away and you wonder whether a path even exist anymore for you and your child to get ahead without move away

 i get it

 that ’ why we ’re build an economy where no one be leave behind

 job be come back pride be come back because of the choice we make in the last two year this be a blue collar blueprint to rebuild america and make a real difference in your life

 for example too many of you lay in bed at night stare at the ceiling wonder what will happen if your spouse get cancer your child get sick or if something happen to you

 will you have the money to pay your medical bill will you have to sell the house

 i get it with the inflation reduction act that i sign into law we ’re take on powerful interest to bring your health care cost down so you can sleep well at night

 you know we pay more for prescription drug than any major country on earth

 for example one in ten americans have diabete

 every day million need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive insulin have be around for 100 year it cost drug company just $ 10 a vial to make

 but big pharma have be unfairly charge people hundred of dollar and make record profit

 not anymore

 we cap the cost of insulin at $ 35 a month for senior on medicare

 but there be million of other americans who be not on medicare include 200,000 young people with type i diabete who need insulin to save their life

 let ’s finish the job this time

 let ’s cap the cost of insulin at $ 35 a month for every american who need it

 this law also cap out of pocket drug cost for senior on medicare at a maximum $ 2,000 per year when there be in fact many drug like expensive cancer drug that can cost up to $ 10,000 $ 12,000 and $ 14,000 a year

 if drug price rise fast than inflation drug company will have to pay medicare back the difference

 and we ’re finally give medicare the power to negotiate drug price bring down prescription drug cost do not just save senior money

 it will cut the federal deficit save tax payer hundred of billion of dollar on the prescription drug the government buy for medicare

 why would not we want to do that

 now some member here be threaten to repeal the inflation reduction act

 make no mistake if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drug i will veto it

 i ’m pleased to say that more americans have health insurance now than ever in history

 a record 16 million people be enrol under the affordable care act

 thank to the law i sign last year million be save $ 800 a year on their premium

 but the way that law be write that benefit expire after 2025

 let ’s finish the job make those saving permanent and expand coverage to those leave off medicaid

 look the inflation reduction act be also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis

 lower utility bill create american job and lead the world to a clean energy future

 i ’ve visit the devastating aftermath of record flood and drought storm and wildfire

 in addition to emergency recovery from puerto rico to florida to idaho we be rebuild for the long term

 new electric grid able to weather the next major storm

 road and water system to withstand the next big flood

 clean energy to cut pollution and create job in community too often leave behind

 we ’re build 500,000 electric vehicle charge station instal across the country by ten of thousand of ibew worker

 and help family save more than $ 1,000 a year with tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicle and energy efficient appliance

 historic conservation effort to be responsible steward of our land

 let ’s face reality

 the climate crisis do not care if your state be red or blue it be an existential threat

 we have an obligation to our child and grandchild to confront it i ’m proud of how america be at last step up to the challenge

 but there ’s so much more to do

 we will finish the job

 and we pay for these investment in our future by finally make the wealthy and the big corporation begin to pay their fair share

 i ’m a capitalist but just pay your fair share

 and i think a lot of you at home agree with i that our present tax system be simply unfair

 the idea that in 2020 55 of the big company in america make $ 40 billion in profit and pay zero in federal income taxis

 that ’s simply not fair

 but now because of the law i sign billion dollar company have to pay a minimum of 15

 just 15

 that ’ less than a nurse pay let i be clear

 under my plan nobody earn less than $ 400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxis

 nobody not one penny

 but there ’ more to do

 let ’s finish the job reward work not just wealth pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax

 because no billionaire should pay a low tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter

 you may have notice that big oil just report record profit

 last year they make $ 200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis

 it ’ outrageous

 they invest too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas price down

 instead they use those record profit to buy back their own stock reward their ceo and shareholder

 corporation ought to do the right thing

 that ’ why i propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buyback to encourage long term investment instead

 they will still make a considerable profit

 let ’s finish the job and close the loophole that allow the very wealthy to avoid pay their taxis

 instead of cut the number of audits of wealthy tax payer i sign a law that will reduce the deficit by $ 114 billion by crack down on wealthy tax cheat

 that ’s be fiscally responsible

 in the last two year my administration cut the deficit by more than $ 1.7 trillion the large deficit reduction in american history

 under the previous administration america ’s deficit go up four year in a row

 because of those record deficit no president add more to the national debt in any four year than my predecessor

 nearly 25 of the entire national debt a debt that take 200 year to accumulate be add by that administration alone

 how do congress respond to all that debt

 they lift the debt ceiling three time without precondition or crisis

 they pay america ’s bill to prevent economic disaster for our country

 tonight i ’m ask this congress to follow suit

 let we commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the united states of america will never ever be question

 some of my republican friend want to take the economy hostage unless i agree to their economic plan all of you at home should know what their plan be

 instead of make the wealthy pay their fair share some republicans want medicare and social security to sunset every five year

 that mean if congress do n’t vote to keep they those program will go away

 other republicans say if we do not cut social security and medicare they ’ll let america default on its debt for the first time in our history

 i will not let that happen

 social security and medicare be a lifeline for million of senior

 americans have be pay into they with every single paycheck since they start work

 so tonight let ’s all agree to stand up for senior stand up and show they we will not cut social security we will not cut medicare

 those benefit belong to the american people they earn they

 if anyone try to cut social security i will stop they and if anyone try to cut medicare i will stop they

 i will not allow they to be take away

 not today not tomorrow not ever

 next month when i offer my fiscal plan i ask my republican friend to offer their plan

 we can sit down together and discuss both plan together

 my plan will lower the deficit by $ 2 trillion

 i will not cut a single social security or medicare benefit

 in fact i will extend the medicare trust fund by at least two decade

 i will not raise taxis on anyone make under $ 400,000 a year and i will pay for the idea i ’ve talk about tonight by make the wealthy and big corporation begin to pay their fair share

 look here ’ the deal big corporation be n’t just take advantage of the tax code they ’re take advantage of you the american consumer

 here ’ my message to all of you out there i have your back we ’re already prevent insurance company from send surprise medical bill stop 1 million surprise bill a month

 we ’re protect senior life and life saving by crack down on nursing home that commit fraud endanger patient safety or prescribe drug they do n’t need

 millions of americans can now save thousand of dollar because they can finally get hear aid over the counter without a prescription

 capitalism without competition be not capitalism it be exploitation

 last year i crack down on foreign shipping company that be make you pay high price for everyday good come into our country

 i sign a bipartisan bill that cut shipping cost by 90 help american farmer business and consumer

 let ’s finish the job

 pass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platform from give their own product an unfair advantage

 my administration be also take on junk fee those hide surcharge too many business use to make you pay more

 for example we ’re make airline show you the full ticket price upfront and refund your money if your flight be cancel or delay

 we ’ve reduce exorbitant bank overdraft fee save consumer more than $ 1 billion a year

 we ’re cut credit card late fee by 75 from $ 30 to $ 8

 junk fee may not matter to the very wealthy but they matter to most folk in home like the one i grow up in they add up to hundred of dollar a month

 they make it hard for you to pay the bill or afford that family trip

 i know how unfair it feel when a company overcharge you and get away with it

 not anymore

 we ’ve write a bill to stop all that it ’s call the junk fee prevention act

 we ’ll ban surprise resort fee that hotel tack on to your bill these fee can cost you up to $ 90 a night at hotel that be n’t even resort

 we ’ll make cable internet and cellphone company stop charge you up to $ 200 or more when you decide to switch to another provider

 we ’ll cap service fee on ticket to concert and sporting event and make company disclose all fee upfront

 and we ’ll prohibit airline from charge up to $ 50 roundtrip for family just to sit together

 baggage fee be bad enough they can not just treat your child like a piece of luggage

 americans be tired of be play for sucker

 pass the junk fee prevention act so company stop rip we off

 for too long worker have be getting stiffe

 not anymore

 we ’re begin to restore the dignity of work

 for example 30 million worker have to sign non compete agreement when they take a job so a cashier at a burger place can not cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple buck more

 not anymore

 we ’re ban those agreement so company have to compete for worker and pay they what they ’re worth

 i ’m so sick and tired of company break the law by prevent worker from organize

 pass the pro act because worker have a right to form a union and let ’s guarantee all worker a living wage

 let ’s also make sure work parent can afford to raise a family with sick day pay family and medical leave and affordable child care that will enable million more people to go to work

 let ’s also restore the full child tax credit which give ten of million of parent some breathing room and cut child poverty in half to the low level in history

 and by the way when we do all of these thing we increase productivity we increase economic growth

 let ’s also finish the job and get more family access to affordable and quality housing

 let ’s get senior who want to stay in their home the care they need to do so and give a little more breathing room to million of family caregiver look after their love one

 pass my plan so we get senior and people with disability the home care service they need and support the worker who be do god ’s work

 these plan be fully pay for and we can afford to do they

 restore the dignity of work also mean make education an affordable ticket to the middle class

 when we make 12 year of public education universal in the last century it make we the well educate well prepare nation in the world

 but the world have catch up

 jill who teach full time have an expression any nation that out educate we will out compete we

 folk you all know 12 year be not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st century

 if you want america to have the well educate workforce let ’s finish the job by provide access to pre school for 3- and 4 year old

 study show that child who go to pre school be nearly 50 more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4 year degree no matter their background

 let ’s give public school teacher a raise

 and we ’re make progress by reduce student debt and increase pell grants for working- and middle class family

 let ’s finish the job connect student to career opportunity start in high school and provide two year of community college some of the good career training in america in addition to be a pathway to a four year degree

 let ’s offer every american the path to a good career whether they go to college or not

 and folk in the midst of the covid crisis when school be closed let ’s also recognize how far we ’ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself

 while the virus be not go thank to the resilience of the american people we have break covid ’s grip on we

 covid death be down nearly 90

 we ’ve save million of life and open our country back up

 and soon we ’ll end the public health emergency

 but we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many more than 1 million americans have lose their life to covid

 family grieve child orphan empty chair at the dining room table

 we remember they and we remain vigilant

 we still need to monitor dozen of variant and support new vaccine and treatment

 so congress need to fund these effort and keep america safe

 and as we emerge from this crisis strong i ’m also double down on prosecute criminal who steal relief money mean to keep worker and small business afloat during the pandemic

 before i come to office many inspector general who protect taxpayer dollar be sideline fraud be rampant

 last year i tell you the watchdog be back since then we ’ve recover billion of taxpayer dollar

 now let ’s triple our anti fraud strike force go after these criminal double the statute of limitation on these crime and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicate steal billion of dollar from the american people

 for every dollar we put into fighting fraud taxpayer get back at least ten time as much

 covid leave other scar like the spike in violent crime in 2020 the first year of the pandemic

 we have an obligation to make sure all our people be safe

 public safety depend on public trust but too often that trust be violate

 join we tonight be the parent of tyre nichols who have to bury he just last week there be no word to describe the heartbreak and grief of lose a child

 but imagine what it ’s like to lose a child at the hand of the law

 imagine have to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walk down the street or play in the park or just drive their car

 i ’ve never have to have the talk with my child beau hunter and ashley that so many black and brown family have have with their child

 if a police officer pull you over turn on your interior light do not reach for your license keep your hand on the steering wheel

 imagine have to worry like that every day in america

 here ’s what tyre ’s mom share with i when i ask she how she find the courage to carry on and speak out

 with faith in god she say her son be a beautiful soul and something good will come from this

 imagine how much courage and character that take

 equal protection under the law that ’s the covenant we have with each other in america

 and we know police officer put their life on the line every day and we ask they to do too much

 to be counselor social worker psychologist respond to drug overdose mental health crisis and more

 we ask too much of they

 i know most cop be good decent people they risk their life every time they put on that shield

 but what happen to tyre in memphis happen too often

 we have to do well

 give law enforcement the training they need hold they to high standard and help they succeed in keep everyone safe

 we also need more first responder and other professional to address grow mental health and substance abuse challenge

 more resource to reduce violent crime and gun crime more community intervention program more investment in housing education and job training

 all this can help prevent violence in the first place

 and when police officer or department violate the public ’s trust we must hold they accountable

 with the support of family of victim civil right group and law enforcement i sign an executive order for all federal officer ban chokehold restrict no knock warrant and other key element of the george floyd act

 let ’s commit ourselves to make the word of tyre ’s mother come true something good must come from this

 all of we in this chamber we need to rise to this moment

 we can not turn away

 let ’s do what we know in our heart we need to do

 let ’s come together and finish the job on police reform

 that be the same plea of parent who lose their child in uvalde do something on gun violence

 thank god we do pass the most sweeping gun safety law in three decade

 but america ’s border problem will not be fix until congress act

 if you will not pass my comprehensive immigration reform at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officer to secure the border and a pathway to citizenship for dreamer those on temporary status farm worker and essential worker

 here in the people ’s house it ’ our duty to protect all the people ’s right and freedom

 congress must restore the right the supreme court take away last year and codify roe v. wade to protect every woman ’s constitutional right to choose

 the vice president and i be do everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy but already more than a dozen state be enforce extreme abortion ban

 make no mistake if congress pass a national abortion ban i will veto it

 today we ’re in the strong position in decade to compete with china or anyone else in the world

 i be committed to work with china where it can advance american interest and benefit the world

 but make no mistake as we make clear last week if china ’s threaten our sovereignty we will act to protect our country and we do

 and let ’s be clear win the competition with china should unite all of we we face serious challenge across the world

 but in the past two year democracy have become strong not weak

 autocracy have grow weak not strong

 here tonight in this chamber be the man who bear the scar of that brutal attack but be as tough and strong and as resilient as they get

 my friend paul pelosi

 but such a heinous act never should have happen

 we must all speak out there be no place for political violence in america in america we must protect the right to vote not suppress that fundamental right we honor the result of our election not subvert the will of the people we must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institution of democracy

 and we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor

 democracy must not be a partisan issue it must be an american issue

 every generation of americans have face a moment where they have be call on to protect our democracy to defend it to stand up for it

 and this be our moment

 my fellow americans we meet tonight at an inflection point one of those moment that only a few generation ever face where the decision we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decade to come

 we be not bystander to history we be not powerless before the force that confront we it be within our power of we the people we be face the test of our time and the time for choose be at hand

 we must be the nation we have always be at our good optimistic hopeful forward look

 a nation that embrace light over darkness hope over fear unity over division stability over chaos

 that all of we every one of we be create equal in the image of god a nation that stand as a beacon to the world a nation in a new age of possibility

 so i have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union and here be my report

 because the soul of this nation be strong because the backbone of this nation be strong because the people of this nation be strong the state of the union be strong

 as i stand here tonight i have never be more optimistic about the future of america we just have to remember who we be

 we be the united states of america and there be nothing nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together

 may god bless you all may god protect our troop

the president   hello poland one of our great ally president duda prime minister mr. prime minister mr. mayor and to all the former minister and president as well as mayor and polish political leader from all across the country thank you for welcome i back to poland

 you know it be nearly one year ago nearly one year ago i speak at the royal castle here in warsaw just week after vladimir putin have unleash his murderous assault on ukraine the large land war in europe since world war two have begin and the principle that have be the cornerstone of peace prosperity and stability on this planet for more than 75 year be at risk of be shatter

 one year ago the world be brace for the fall of kyiv well i have just come from a visit to kyiv and i can report kyiv stand strong kyiv stand proud it stand tall and most important it stand free

 when russia invade it be n’t just ukraine be test the whole world face a test for the age

 europe be be test america be be test nato be be test all democracy be be test and the question we face be as simple as they be profound

 would we respond or would we look the other way would we be strong or would we be weak would be we would would we be all of our ally would be unite or divide

 one year later we know the answer

 we do respond we would be strong we would be unite and the world would not look the other way

 we also face fundamental question about the commitment to the most basic of principle would we stand up for the sovereignty of nation would we stand up for the right of people to live free from naked aggression would we stand up for democracy

 one year later we know the answer

 yes we would stand up for sovereignty and we do

 yes we would stand up for the right of people to live free from aggression and we do

 and we would stand up for democracy and we do

 and yesterday i have the honor to stand with president zelenskyy in kyiv to declare that we will keep stand up for these same thing no matter what

 when president putin order his tank to roll into ukraine he think we would roll over he be wrong

 the ukrainian people be too brave

 america europe a coalition of nation from the atlantic to the pacific we be too unified

 democracy be too strong

 instead of an easy victory he perceive and predict putin leave with burn out tank and russia ’s force in delay in disarray

 he think he ’d get the finlandization of nato instead he get the natoization of finland and sweden

 he think nato would fracture and divide instead nato be more united and more unified than ever than ever before

 he think he could weaponize energy to crack your resolve europe ’s resolve

 instead we ’re work together to end europe ’s dependence on russian fossil fuel

 he think autocrat like himself be tough and leader of democracy be soft

 and then he meet the iron will of america and the nation everywhere that refuse to accept a world govern by fear and force

 he find himself at war with a nation lead by a man whose courage would be forge in fire and steel president zelenskyy

 president putin president putin be confront with something today that he do not think be possible a year ago the democracy of the world have grow strong not weak but the autocrat of the world have grow weak not strong

 because in the moment of great upheaval and uncertainty that know what you stand for be most important and know who stand with you make all the difference

 the people of poland know that you know that in fact you know you know it well than anyone here in poland because that ’ what solidarity mean

 through partition and oppression when the beautiful city be destroy after the warsaw uprising during decade under the iron fist of communist rule poland endure because you stand together

 that ’ how the brave leader of the opposition and the people of belarus continue to fight for their democracy

 that ’ how the resolve of moldovan people applause resolve of the people of moldova to live in freedom gain they independence and put they on the path to eu membership

 president sandu be here today i ’m not sure where she be but i ’m proud to stand with you and the freedom love people of moldova give she a round of applause

 one year into this war putin no long doubt the strength of our coalition but he still doubt our conviction he doubt our staying power he doubt our continued support for ukraine he doubt whether nato can remain unified

 but there should be no doubt our support for ukraine will not waver nato will not be divide and we will not tire

 president putin ’s craven lust for land and power will fail and the ukrainian people ’s love for their country will prevail

 democracy of the world will stand guard over freedom today tomorrow and forever for that ’s what that ’ what ’s at stake here freedom

 that ’ the message i carry to kyiv yesterday directly to the people of ukraine

 when president zelenskyy say he come to the united states in december quote he say this struggle will define the world and what our child and grandchild how they live and then their child and grandchild

 he be not only speak about the child and grandchild of ukraine he be speak about all of our child and grandchild your and mine

 we ’re see again today what the people of poland and the people all across europe see for decade appetite of the autocrat can not be appease they must be oppose

 autocrat only understand one word no   no   no

 no you will not take my country no you will not take my freedom no you will not take my future

 and i ’ll repeat tonight what i say last year in this same place a dictator bend on rebuild an empire will never be able to erase the people ’s love of liberty brutality will never grind down the will of the free and ukraine ukraine will never be a victory for russia never

 for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness

 you know this have be an extraordinary year in every sense

 extraordinary brutality from russian force and mercenary they have commit depravity crime against humanity without shame or compunction they ’ve target civilian with death and destruction use rape as a weapon of war steal ukrainian child in an attempt to in an attempt to steal ukraine ’s future bomb train station maternity hospital school and orphanage

 no one no one can turn away their eye from the atrocity russia be commit against the ukrainian people it ’ abhorrent it ’ abhorrent

 but extraordinarily as well have be the response of the ukrainian people and the world

 one year after the bomb begin to fall and russian tank roll into ukraine ukraine be still independent and free

 from kherson to kharkiv ukrainian fighter have reclaim their land

 in more than 50 percent of the territory russia hold last year the blue and the yellow flag of ukraine proudly wave once again

 president zelenskyy still lead a democratically elect government that represent the will of the ukrainian people

 and the world have already vote multiple time include in the united nations general assembly to condemn russia ’s aggression and support a just peace

 each time in the u.n. that vote have be overwhelming

 in october 143 nation in the united nations condemn russia ’s illegal annexation only four four in the entire u.n. vote with russia four

 so tonight i speak once more to the people of russia

 the united states and the nation of europe do not seek to control or destroy russia the west be not plot to attack russia as putin say today and million of russian citizen who only want to live in peace with their neighbor be not the enemy

 this war be never a necessity it ’ a tragedy

 president putin choose this war every day the war continue be his choice he could end the war with a word

 it ’ simple if russia stop invade ukraine it would end the war if ukraine stop defend itself against russia it would be the end of ukraine

 that ’ why together we ’re make sure ukraine can defend itself

 the united states have assemble a worldwide coalition of more than 50 nation to get critical weapon and supply to the brave ukrainian fighter on the frontline air defense system artillery ammunition tank and armored vehicle

 the european union and its member state have step up with unprecedented commitment to ukraine not just in security assistance but economic and humanitarian refugee assistance and so much more

 to all of you here tonight take a moment and i ’m serious when i say this turn on and look turn around and look at one another look at what you ’ve do so far

 poland be host more than 1.5 million refugee from this war god bless you

 poland ’s generosity your willingness to open your heart and your home be extraordinary

 and the american people be unite in our resolve as well

 all across my country in big city and small town ukrainian flag fly from american home

 over the past year democrats and republicans in our united states congress have come together to stand for freedom

 that ’s who americans be and that ’ what americans do

 the world be also come together to address the global fallout from president putin ’s war

 putin try to starve the world block the port in the black sea to stop ukraine from export its grain exacerbate the global food crisis that hit develop nation in africa especially hard

 instead the united states and the g7 and partner around the world answer the call with historic commitment to address the crisis and to bolster global food supply

 and this week my wife jill biden be travel to africa to help bring attention to this critical issue

 our commitment be to the people of ukraine and the future of ukraine a ukraine that ’s free sovereign and democratic

 that be the dream of those who declare ukraine ’s independence more than 30 year ago who lead the orange revolution and the revolution of dignity who brave ice and fire on the maidan and the heavenly hundred who die there and those who continue still to root out kremlin ’s effort to corrupt coerce and control

 it ’ a dream for those ukrainian patriot who have fight for year against russia ’s aggression in the donbas and the hero who have give everything give their life in the service of their beloved ukraine

 i be honor to visit their memorial in kyiv yesterday to pay tribute to the sacrifice of those who lose their life stand alongside president zelenskyy

 the united states and our partner stand with ukraine ’s teacher its hospital staff its emergency responder the worker in city across ukraine who be fight to keep the power on in the face of russia ’s cruel bombardment

 we stand with the million of refugee of this war who have find a welcome in europe and the united states particularly here in poland

 ordinary people all across europe do whatever they could to help and continue to do so polish business civil society cultural leader include the first lady of poland who be here tonight have lead with the heart and determination showcase all that ’ good about the human spirit

 madam first lady we love you   thank you all

 i ’ll never forget last year visit with refugee from ukraine who have just arrive in warsaw see their face exhausted and afraid hold their child so close worry they might never see their father their husband their brother or sister again

 in that darkest moment of their life you the people of poland offer they safety and light you embrace they you literally embrace they i watch i watch the look on their face

 meanwhile together we have make sure that russia be pay the price for its abuse

 we continue to maintain the large sanction regime ever impose on any country in history and we ’re go to announce more sanction this week together with our partner

 we ’ll hold accountable those who be responsible for this war and we will seek justice for the war crime and crime against humanity continue to be commit by the russians

 you know there be much for we to be proud of over the all that we have achieve together this past year but we have to be honest and clear eyed as we look at the year ahead

 the defense of freedom be not the work of a day or of a year it ’ always difficult it ’ always important

 as ukraine continue to defend itself against the russian onslaught and launch counter offensive of its own there will continue to be hard and very bitter day victory and tragedy but ukraine be steel for the fight ahead and the united states together with our allies and partner be go to continue to have ukraine ’s back as it defend itself

 next year i will host every member of nato for our 2024 summit in the united states together we ’ll celebrate the 75th anniversary of the strong defensive alliance in the history of the world nato

 and let there be no doubt the commitment of the united states to our nato alliance and article 5 be rock solid and every member of nato know it and russia know it as well

 an attack against one be an attack against all it ’ a sacred oath a sacred oath to defend every inch of nato territory

 over the past year the united states have come together with our allies and partner in an extraordinary coalition to stand against russian aggression

 but the work in front of we be not just what we ’re against it ’ about what we ’re for what kind of world do we want to build

 we need to take the strength and capacity of this coalition and apply it to lift up lift up the life of people everywhere improve health grow prosperity preserve the planet build peace and security treat everyone with dignity and respect

 that ’ our responsibility the democracy of the world have to deliver it for our people

 as we gather tonight the world in my view be at an at an inflection point the decision we make over the next five year or so be go to determine and shape our life for decade to come

 that ’ true for americans it ’ true for the people of the world

 and while decision be ours to make now the principle and the stake be eternal a choice between chaos and stability between building and destroy between hope and fear between democracy that lift up the human spirit and the brutal hand of the dictator who crush it between nothing less than limitation and possibility the kind of possibility that come when people who live not in captivity but in freedom freedom

 freedom there be no sweet word than freedom there be no nobler goal than freedom there be no high aspiration than freedom

 americans know that and you know it and all that we do now must be do so our child and grandchild will know it as well

 freedom

 the enemy of the tyrant and the hope of the brave and the truth of the age

 freedom

 stand with we we will stand with you

 let we move forward with faith and conviction and with an abide commitment to be ally not of darkness but of light not of oppression but of liberation not of captivity but yes of freedom

 may god bless you all may god protect our troop and may god bless the hero of ukraine and all those who defend freedom around the world

 thank you poland thank you thank you thank you for what you ’re do god bless you all

good evening my fellow americans we ’re face an inflection point in history one of those moment where the decision we make today be go to determine the future for decade to come that ’ what i ’d like to talk with you about tonight
  you know early this morning i return from israel they tell i i ’m the first american president to travel there during a war
  i meet with the prime minister and member of his cabinet and most movingly i meet with israelis who have personally live through horrific horror of the attack by hamas on the 7th of october
  more than 1,300 people slaughter in israel include at least 32 american citizen score of innocent from infant to elderly grandparent israelis americans take hostage
  as i tell the family of americans be hold captive by hamas we ’re pursue every avenue to bring their love one home as president there be no high priority for i than the safety of americans hold hostage
  the terrorist group hamas unleash pure unadulterated evil in the world but sadly the jewish people know perhaps well than anyone that there be no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on other
  in israel i see a people who be strong determined resilient and also angry in shock and in deep deep pain
  i also speak with president abbas of the palestinian authority and reiterate that the united states remain committed to the palestinian people ’ right to dignity and to self determination the action of hamas terrorist do not take that right away
  like so many other i be heartbroken by the tragic loss of palestinian life include the explosion at a hospital in gaza which be not do by the israelis
  we mourn every innocent life lose we can not ignore the humanity of innocent palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity
  you know the assault on israel echo nearly 20 month of war tragedy and brutality inflict on the people of ukraine people that be very badly hurt since putin launch his all out invasion
  we ’ve have not forget the mass grave the body find bear sign of torture rape use as a weapon by the russians and thousand and thousand of ukrainian child forcibly take into russia steal from their parent it ’ sick
  hamas and putin represent different threat but they share this in common they both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy completely annihilate it
  hamas its state purpose for exist be the destruction of the state of israel and the murder of jewish people
  hamas do not represent the palestinian people hamas use palestinian civilian as human shield and innocent palestinian family be suffer greatly because of they
  meanwhile putin deny ukraine have or ever have real statehood he claim the soviet union create ukraine and just two week ago he tell the world that if the united states and our ally withdraw and if the united states withdraw our ally will as well military support for ukraine it would have quote a week leave to live but we ’re not withdraw
  i know these conflict can seem far away and it ’ natural to ask why do this matter to america
  so let i share with you why make sure israel and ukraine succeed be vital for america ’s national security you know history have teach we that when terrorist do n’t pay a price for their terror when dictator do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos and death and more destruction they keep go and the cost and the threat to america and to the world keep rise
  so if we do not stop putin ’s appetite for power and control in ukraine he will not limit himself just to ukraine he’s putin have already threate to remind”—quote remind poland that their western land be a gift from russia
  one of his top advisor a former president of russia have call estonia latvia and lithuania russia ’s baltic province these be all nato allies
  for 75 year nato have keep peace in europe and have be the cornerstone of american security and if putin attack a nato ally we will defend every inch of nato which the treaty require and call for
  we will have something that we do not seek make it clear we do not seek we do not seek to have american troop fight in russia or fight against russia
  beyond europe we know that our ally and maybe most importantly our adversary and competitor be watch they ’re watch our response in ukraine as well
  and if we walk away and let putin erase ukraine ’s independence would be aggressor around the world would be embolden to try the same the risk of conflict and chaos could spread in other part of the world in the indo pacific in the middle east especially in the middle east
  iran be be support russia in ukraine and it ’s support hamas and other terrorist group in the region and we ’ll continue to hold they accountable i might add
  the united states and our partner across the region be work to build a well future for the middle east one where the middle east be more stable well connect to its neighbor and through innovative project like the india middle east europe rail corridor that i announce this year at the summit of the world ’s big economy more predictable market more employment less rage less grievance less war when connect it benefit the people it would benefit the people of the middle east and it would benefit we
  american leadership be what hold the world together american alliance be what keep we america safe american value be what make we a partner that other nation want to work with to put all that at risk if we walk away from ukraine if we turn our back on israel it ’ just not worth it
  that ’ why tomorrow i ’m go to send to congress an urgent budget request to fund america ’s national security need to support our critical partner include israel and ukraine
  it ’ a smart investment that ’s go to pay dividend for american security for generation help we keep american troop out of harm ’s way help we build a world that be safe more peaceful and more prosperous for our child and grandchild
  in israel we must make sure that they have what they need to protect their people today and always
  the security package i ’m send to congress and ask congress to do be an unprecedented commitment to israel ’s security that will sharpen israel ’s qualitative military edge which we ’ve commit to the qualitative military edge
  we ’re go to make sure iron dome continue to guard the sky over israel we ’re go to make sure other hostile actor in the region know that israel be strong than ever and prevent this conflict from spread
  look at the same time prime minister netanyahu and i discuss again yesterday the critical need for israel to operate by the law of war that mean protect civilian in combat as well as they can the people of gaza urgently need food water and medicine
  yesterday in discussion with the leader of israel and egypt i secure an agreement for the first shipment of humanitarian assistance from the united nations to palestinian civilian in gaza
  if hamas do not divert or steal this shipment these shipment we ’re go to provide an opening for sustained delivery of lifesave humanitarian assistance for the palestinians
  and as i say in israel as hard as it be we can not give up on peace we can not give up on a two state solution
  israel and palestinians equally deserve to live in safety dignity and peace
  you know and here at home we have to be honest with ourselves in recent year too much hate have be give too much oxygen fuel racism a rise in antisemitism and islamophobia right here in america
  it ’s also intensify in the wake of recent event that lead to the horrific threat and attack that both shock we and break our heart
  on october 7th terror attack have trigger deep scar and terrible memory in the jewish community
  today jewish family worried about be target in school wear symbol of their faith walk down the street or go out about their daily life
  you know i know many of you in the muslim american community or the arab american community the palestinian american community and so many other be outraged and hurt say to yourself here we go again with islamophobia and distrust we see after 9/11
  just last week a mother be brutally stab a little boy here in the united states a little boy who have just turn six year old be murder in their home outside of chicago
  his name be wadea wadea a proud american a proud palestinian american family
  we can not stand by and stand silent when this happen we must without equivocation denounce antisemitism we must also without equivocation denounce islamophobia
  and to all of you hurt those of you who be hurt i want you to know i see you you belong and i want to say this to you you ’re all america you ’re all america
  this be in a moment where there’s you know in moment like these when fear and suspicion anger and rage run hard that we have to work hard than ever to hold on to the value that make we who we be
  we ’re a nation of religious freedom freedom of expression we all have a right to debate and disagree without fear of be target at school or workplace or in our community
  and we must renounce violence and vitriol see each other not as enemy but as but as fellow americans
  when i be in israel yesterday i say that when america experience the hell of 9/11 we feel enraged as well while we seek and get justice we make mistake so i caution the government of israel not to be blind by rage
  and here in america let we not forget who we be we reject all form all form of hate whether against muslims jews or anyone that ’ what great nation do and we be great nation
  on ukraine i ’m ask congress to make sure we can continue to send ukraine the weapon they need to defend themselves and their country without interruption so ukraine can stop putin ’s brutality in ukraine
  they be succeed
  when putin invade ukraine he think he would take kyiv and all of ukraine in a matter of day well over a year later putin have fail and he continue to fail kyiv still stand because of the bravery of the ukrainian people
  ukraine have regain more than 50 percent of the territory that russian troop once occupy back by a u.s.-led coalition of more than 50 country around the world all do its part to support kyiv
  what would happen if we walk away we be the essential nation
  meanwhile putin have turn to iran and north korea to buy attack drone and ammunition to terrorize ukrainian city and people
  from the outset i have say i will not send american troop to fight in ukraine
  all ukraine be ask for be help for the weapon munition the capacity the capability to push invade russian force off their land and the air defense system to shoot down russian missile before they destroy ukrainian city
  and let i be clear about something we send ukraine equipment sit in our stockpile and when we use the money allocate by congress we use it to replenish our own store our own stockpile with new equipment equipment that defend america and be make in america patriot missile for air defense battery make in arizona artillery shell manufacture in 12 state across the country in pennsylvania ohio texas and so much more
  you know just as in world war two today patriotic american worker be build the arsenal of democracy and serve the cause of freedom
  let i close with this early this year i board air force one for a secret flight to poland there i board a train with black out window for a 10 hour ride each way to kyiv to stand with the people of ukraine ahead of the one year anniversary of their brave fight against putin
  i ’m tell i be the first american president to enter a warzone not control by the united states military since president lincoln
  with i be just a small group of security personnel and a few advisor
  but when i exit that train and meet zelenskyy president zelenskyy i do not feel alone i be bring with i the idea of america the promise of america to the people who be today fight for the same thing we fight for 250 year ago freedom independence self determination
  and as i walk through kyiv with president zelenskyy with air raid siren sound in the distance i feel something i ’ve always believe more strongly than ever before america be a beacon to the world still still
  we be as my friend madeleine albright say the indispensable nation
  tonight there be innocent people all over the world who hope because of we who believe in a well life because of we who be desperate not be forget by we and who be wait for we
  but time be of the essence
  i know we have our division at home we have to get past they we can not let petty partisan angry politic get in the way of our responsibility as a great nation
  we can not and will not let terrorist like hamas and tyrant like putin win i refuse to let that happen
  in moment like these we have to remind we have to remember who we be we be the united states of america the united states of america and there be nothing nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together

  trump ’s not concerned about your future i promise you trump be now promise a full scale campaign of revenge and retribution his word for some year to come they be his word not mine he go on to say he would be a dictator on day one
  i mean if i be write a book of fiction and i say an american president say that and not in jest
  he call it and i quote the termina- quote this be a quote the termination of all the rule regulation and article even those find in the u.s. constitution should be terminate if it ’ his will
  it ’ really kind of hard to believe even find in the constitution he could terminate
  he ’s threaten the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff with the death penalty say he should be put to death because the chairman put his oath to the constitution ahead of his personal loyalty to trump
  this come from a president who call when he visit a ce- a cemetery call dead soldier sucker and loser remember that
  sometimes i ’m really happy the irish in i can not be see laughter
  it be right around the time i be at beau ’s grave tommy
  how dare he who in god ’s name do he think he be
  with former aide trump plan to invoke the ins- insurrectionist act the insurrection act which would allow he to deploy which he ’s not allow to do in ordinary circumstance allow he to deploy us military force on the street of america he say it
  he call those who oppo- oppose he vermin he talk about the blood of americans be poison echo the same exact language use in nazi germany
  he proudly post on social medium the word that well describe his 2024 campaign quote revenge quote power and quote dictatorship
  there ’ no confusion about who trump be and what he intend to do
  i place my hand on our family bible and i swear an oath on the very same step of the capitol just 14 day after the attack on january the 6th
  as i look out over the capital city whose street be line with national guard to prevent another attack i see an american that have be push to the brink an america that have be push to the brink
  but i feel enormous pride not in win i feel enormous pride in america because american democracy have be test and american democracy have hold together and when trump have see weakness in our democracy and continue to talk about it i see strength your strength it ’ not hyperbole your strength your integrity american strength and integrity
  ordinary citizen state election official the american judicial system have put the constitution first and sometimes at their peril at their peril
  because of they because of you the will of the people prevail not the anger of the mob or the appetite of one man
  when the attack on january 6th happen there be no doubt about the truth at the time even republican member of congress and fox news commentator publicly and privately condemn the attack
  as one republican senator say trump ’s behavior be embarrassing and humiliating for the country but now that same senator and those same people have change their tune
  as time have go one go on politic fear money all have intervene and now these maga voice who know the truth about trump on january 6th have abandon the truth and abandon democracy
  they make their choice now the rest of we democrats independent mainstream republicans we have to make our choice
  i know mine and i believe i know america ’s
  we will defend the truth not give in to the big lie we ’ll embrace the constitution and the declaration not abandon it we ’ll honor the sacred cause of democracy not walk away from it
  today i make this sacred pledge to you the defense protection and preservation of american democracy will remain as it have be the central cause of my presidency applause
  america as we begin this election year we must be clear democracy be on the ballot your freedom be on the ballot applause
  yes we ’ll be vote on many issue on the freedom to vote and have your vote count on the freedom of choice the freedom to have a fair shot the freedom from fear and we ’ll debate and disagree
  without democracy no progress be inaudible possible think about it the alternative to democracy be dictatorship the rule of one not the rule of we the people
  that ’ what the soldier of valley forge understand and so be i be what we have to understand it as well we ’ve be bless so long with a strong stable democracy it ’ easy to forget why so many before we risk their life and strengthen democracy what our life would be without it
  democracy mean have the freedom to speak your mind to be who you be to be who you want to be democracy be about be able to bring about peaceful change democracy democracy be how we ’ve open the door of opportunity wide and wider with each successive generation notwithstanding our mistake
  but if democracy fall we ’ll lose that freedom we ’ll lose the power of we the people to shape our destiny if you doubt i look around the world travel with i as i meet with other head of state throughout the world
  look at the authoritarian leader and dictator trump say he admire he out loud say he admire i will not go through they all it would take too long nbsp;look remember how he fers- when he when he refer to what he call the love letter exchange between he and the dictator of north korea those woman and man out there in the audience who ever fight for the american military would you ever believe you ’d hear a president say something like that
  his admiration for putin i can go on
  and look at what these autocrat be do to limit freedom in their country they ’re limit freedom of speech freedom of press freedom to assemble woman ’s right lgb[t]q right people be go to jail so much more
  it ’ true the push and pull of american history be not a fairy tale every stride forward in america be meet with a ferocious backlash many time from those who fear progress and those who exploit that fear for their own personal gain from those who traffic in lie tell for power and profit from those who be drive by grievance and grift consume by conspiracy and victimhood from those who seek to bury history and ban book
  do you ever think you ’d be at a political event talk about book ban for a presidential in a presidential election
  the choice and contest between those force those compete force between solidarity and division be perennial but this time it ’ so different
  you can not have a contest you can not have a contest if you see politic as an all out war instead of a peaceful way to resolve our difference all out war be what trump want
  that ’ why he do not understand the most fundamental truth about this country unlike other nation on earth america be not build on ethnicity religion geography we ’re the only nation in the history of the world build on an idea not hyperbole build on an idea we hold these truth to be self evident that all man and woman be create equal
  it ’ an idea declare in the declaration create in a way that we view everybody as equal and be should be treat equally throughout their life
  we ’ve never fully live up to that we have a long way to go but we ’ve never walk away from the idea we ’ve never walk away from it before but i promise you i will not let donald trump and the maga republicans applause force we to walk away now
  we ’re live in an era where a determined minority be do everything in its power to try to destroy our democracy for their own agenda the american people know it and they ’re stand bravely in the breach
  remember after 2020 january 6th insurrection to undo the election in which more americans have vote than any other in american history america see the threat pose to the country and they vote he out in 2022 historic midterm election in state after state election after election the election denier be defeat
  now in 2024 trump in run as the deni in chief the election deni in chief once again he ’s say he will not honor the result of the election if he lose
  trump say he do not understand well he still do not understand the basic truth and that be you can not love your country only when you win applause you can not love your country only when you win
  so i ’ll keep my commitment to be president for all of america whether you vote for i or not i ’ve do it for the last three year and i ’ll continue to do it
  together we can keep prove that america be still a country that believe in decency dignity honesty honor truth we still believe that no one not even the president be above the law we still believe applause the vast majority of we still believe that everyone deserve a fair shot at make it we ’re still a nation that give hate no safe harbor
  i tell you from my experience work with leader around the world and i mean this sincerely not a joke that america be still view as the beacon of democracy for the world.&nbsp
  i can not tell you how many how many world leader and i know all of they virtually all of they grab my arm in private and say he can not win tell i no my country will be at risk ”&nbsp
  think of how many country tommy you know that be on the br- on the edge imagine
  we still believe in we the people and that include all of we not some of we
  let i close with this on that cold winter of 1777 george washington and his american troop at valley forge wage a battle on behalf of a revolutionary idea that everyday people like where i come from and the vast majority of you not a king or a dictator that everyday people can govern themselves without a king or a dictator
  in fact in the rotunda of the capitol there ’ a giant painting of general george washington not president washington and he be resign his commission as commander in chief of the continental army
  a european king at this at the time say after he win the revolution now be the time for he to declare his kingship
  but instead the mob that attack the capitol wave trump flag and confederate flag storm right past that portrait that image of george washington give they no pause but it should have
  the artist that paint that portrait memorialize that moment because he say it be quote one of the high moral lesson ever give to the world nbsp;end of quote
  george washington be at the height of his power having just defeat the most powerful empire on earth could have hold onto the power as long as he want he could have make himself not a future president but a future monarch in effect
  and by the way when he get elect president he could have stay for two three four five term until he die but that be n’t the america he and the american troop at valley forge have fight for
  in america genuine leader democratic leader with a small d do not hold on to power relentlessly our leader return power to the people and they do it willingly because that ’s the deal you do your duty you serve your country
  and ours be a country worthy of service as many republican president and democratic president have show over the year
  we ’re not perfect but at our good we face on we face head on the good the bad the truth of who we be we look in the mirror and ultimately never pretend we ’re something we ’re not that ’ what great nation do and we ’re a great nation we ’re the great nation on the face of the earth we really be applause
  that ’ the america i see in our future we get up we carry on we never bow we never bend we speak of possibility not carnage we ’re not weigh down by grievance we do n’t foster fear we do not walk around as victim
  we take charge of our destiny we get our job do with our peop- the help of the people we find in america who find their place in the change world and dream and build a future that not only they but all people deserve a shot at
  we do not believe none of you believe america be fail we know america be win that ’ american patriotism applause
  and it ’s not win because of joe biden it ’s win
  this be the first national election since january 6th insurrection place a dagger at the throat of american democracy since that moment we all know who donald trump be the question we have to answer be who be we nbsp;that ’ what ’ at stake applause who be we
  in the year ahead as you talk to your family and friend cast your ballot the power be in your hand after all we ’ve be through in our history from independence to civil war to two world war to a pandemic to insurrection i refuse to believe that in 2024 we americans will choose to walk away from what ’s make we the great nation in the history of the world freedom liberty applause
  democracy be still a sacred cause and there ’ no country in the world well position to lead the world than america
  that ’ why applause i ’ve say it many time that ’s why i ’ve never be more optimistic about our future and i ’ve be do this a hell of a long time laughter
  just have to remember who we be with patience and fortitude with one heart we be the united states of america for god ’s sake applause
  i mean it there be nothing i believe with every fiber that there be nothing beyond our capacity if we act together and decently with one another nothing nothing nothing applause i mean it
  we ’re the only nation in the world that ’s come out of every crisis strong than we go into that crisis that be true yesterday and it ’ true today and i guarantee you will be true tomorrow
  god bless you all and may god protect our troop applause

 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">now let i speak to the question of fundamental fairness for all americans i ’ve be deliver real result in fiscally responsible way we ’ve already cut the federal deficit we ’ve already cut the federal deficit by over $ 1 trillion.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i sign a bipartisan deal to cut another trillion dollar in the next decade.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">it ’s my goal to cut the federal deficit another $ 3 trillion by make big corporation and the very wealthy finally begin to pay their fair share.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">look i ’m a capitalist if you want to make or can make a million or million of buck that ’ great just pay your fair share in taxes.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">a fair tax code be how we invest in thing that make this country great healthcare education defense and so much more.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">but here ’ the deal the last administration enact a $ 2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent the very wealthy and the big corporation and explode the federal deficit.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">they add more to the national debt than any presidential term in american history check the numbers.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">folks at home do anybody really think the tax code be fair?</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">do you really think the wealthy and big corporation need another $ 2 trillion tax break?</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i sure do n’t i ’m go to keep fight like hell to make it fair under my plan nobody earn less than $ 400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in federal taxis nobody not one penny and they have n’t yet.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">in fact the child tax credit i pass during the pandemic cut taxis for million of work family and cut child poverty in half.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">restore that child tax credit no child should go hungry in this country.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">the way to make the tax code fair be to make big corporation and the very wealthy begin to pay their share remember in 2020 55 of the big company in america make $ 40 billion and pay zero in federal income tax zero.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">not anymore.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">thanks to the law i write and we sign big company now have to pay a minimum of 15 percent but that ’s still less than work people pay in federal taxes.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">it ’s time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every big corporation finally begin to pay their fair share.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i also want to end tax break for big pharma big oil private jet massive executive pay when it be only suppose to be a million bal- a million dollar that could be deduct they can pay they $ 20 million if they want but deduct a million.</span >

 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">they’re make great sacrifice 8.2 percent.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">that ’ far less than the vast majority of americans pay.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">no billionaire should pay a low federal tax rate than a teacher a sanitation worker or a nurse.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i propose a minimum tax for billionaire of 25 percent just 25 percent you know what that would raise that would raise $ 500 billion over the next 10 years.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">and imagine what that could do for america imagine a future with affordable childcare million of family can get what they need to go to work to help grow the economy.</span >

 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">one hundred more high tech drug detection machine to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicle smuggle fentanyl into america that ’s kill thousand of children.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">this bill would save life and bring order to the border.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">it would also give i and any new president new emergency authority to temporarily shut down the border when the number of migrant at the border be overwhelming.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">the border patrol union have endorse this bill.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">the federal chamber of commerce have yeah yeah you ’re say no look at the fact i know i know you know how to read.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i believe that give the opportunity for a majority in the house and senate would endorse the bill as well a majority right now.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">but unfortunately politic have derail this bill so far.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i’m tell my predecessor call member of congress in the senate to demand they block the bill he feel political win he view it as a it would be a political win for i and a political loser for he it ’ not about he it ’ not about i i ’d be a winner not really i < /span >

the president hello folk the president check his watch just check it ’s afternoon laughter
  good afternoon before i begin my remark i just want to say a few word about what happen yesterday in new york city
  the american principle that no one be above the law be reaffirm
  donald trump be give every opportunity to defend himself
  it be a state case not a federal case and it be hear by a jury of 12 citizens—12 americans 12 people like you like million of americans who serve on jury this jury be choose the same way every jury in america be choose it be a process that donald trump ’s attorney be part of
  the jury hear five week of evidence five week and after careful deliberation the jury reach a unanimous verdict they find donald trump guilty on all 34 felony count now he ’ll be give the opportunity as he should to appeal that decision just like everyone else have that opportunity
  that ’ how the american system of justice work
  and it ’ reckless it ’ dangerous and it ’ irresponsible for anyone to say this be rig just because they do n’t like the verdict
  our justice system have endure for nearly 250 year and it literally be the cornerstone of america our justice system
  the justice system should be respect and we should never allow anyone to tear it down it ’ as simple as that
  that ’ america that ’s who we be and that ’ who we ’ll always be god willing
  now to another issue i want to give an update on my effort to end the crisis in gaza
  for the past several month my negotiator of foreign policy intelligence community and the like have be relentlessly focus not just on a ceasefire that would inevitably be fragile and temporary but on a durable end to the war that ’s be the focus a durable end to this war
  one that bring all the hostage home ensure israel ’s security create a well day after in gaza without hamas in power and set the stage for a political settlement that provide a well future for israelis and palestinians alike
  now after intensive diplomacy carry out by my team and my many conversation with leader of israel qatar and egypt and other middle eastern country israel have now offer israel have offer a comprehensive new proposal
  it ’ a roadmap to an endure ceasefire and the release of all hostage
  this proposal have be transmit by qatar to hamas
  today i want to lay out its term for the american citizen and for the world
  this new proposal have three phase three
  the first phase would last for six week here ’s what it would include a full and complete ceasefire a withdrawal of israeli force from all populated area of gaza a release of a number of hostage include woman the elderly the wounded in exchange for the release of hundred of palestinian prisoner there be american hostage who would be release at this stage and we want they home
  additional some remain of hostage who have be kill would be return to their family bring some degree of closure to their terrible grief
  palestinians civilian would return to their home and neighborhood in all area of gaza include in the north
  humanitarian assistance would surge with 600 truck carry aid into gaza every single day
  with a ceasefire that aid could be safely and effectively distribute to all who need it hundred of thousand of temporary shelter include housing unit would be deliver by the international community
  all of that and more would begin immediately immediately
  during the six week of phase one israel and hamas would negotiate the necessary arrangement to get to phase two which be a permanent end to hostility
  now i ’ll be straight with you there be a number of detail to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two israel will want to make sure its interest be protect
  but the proposal say if the negotiation take long than six week for phase one the ceasefire will still continue as long as negotiation continue
  and the united states egypt and qatar would work to ensure negotiation keep go all agreement all agreement until all the agreement be reach and phase two be able to begin
  then phase two there would be an exchange for the release of all remain live hostage include male soldier israeli force would withdraw from gaza and as long as hamas live up to its commitment a temporary ceasefire would become in the word of the israeli proposal the cessation of hostility permanently end of quote cessation of hostility permanently
  finally in phase three a major reconstruction plan for gaza would commence and any final remain of hostage who have be kill would be return to their family
  that ’s the offer that ’s now on the table and what we ’ve be ask for it ’ what we need
  the people of israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they ’ve devastate hamas force over the past eight month at this point hamas no long be capable of carry out another october 7th which one of the israelis main objective in this war and quite frankly a righteous one
  i know there be those in israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely some be even in the government coalition and they ’ve make it clear they want to occupy gaza they want to keep fight for year and the hostage be not a priority to they
  well i ’ve urge the leadership in israel to stand behind this deal despite whatever pressure come
  and to the people of israel let i say this as someone whose have a lifelong commitment to israel as the only american president who have ever go to israel in a time of war as someone who just send the u.s. force to directly defend israel when it be attack by iran i ask you to take a step back and think what will happen if this moment be lose
  we can not lose this moment indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring israel in will not bring down bog down will only bog down israel in gaza drain the economic military and human resource and further israel ’s isolation in the world
  that will not bring hostage home that will not bring an enduring defeat of hamas that will not bring israel last security
  but a comprehensive approach that start with this deal will bring hostage home and will lead to a more secure israel and once a ceasefire and hostage deal be conclude it unlock the possibility of a great deal more progress include calm along israel ’s northern border with lebanon
  the united states will help forge a diplomatic resolution one that ensure israel ’s security and allow people to safely return to their home without fear of be attack
  with a deal a rebuilding of gaza will begin with arab nation and the international community along with palestinian and israeli leader to get it do in a manner that do not allow hamas to re arm
  and the united states will work with our partner to rebuild home school and hospital in gaza to help repair community that be destroy in the chaos of war
  and with this deal israel could become more deeply integrate into the region include it ’ no surprise to you all include a potential historic normalization agreement with saudi arabia israel could be part of a regional security network to counter the threat pose by iran
  all of this progress would make israel more secure with israeli family no long live in the shadow of a terrorist attack
  and all of this would create the condition for a different future and a well future for the palestinian people one of self determination dignity security and freedom this path be available once the deal be strike
  israel will always have the right to defend itself against the threat to its security and to bring those responsible for october 7th to justice and the united states will always ensure that israel have what it need to defend itself
  if hamas fail to fulfill its commitment under the deal israel can resume military operation but egypt and qatar have assure i and they be continue to work to ensure that hamas do n’t do that and the united states will help ensure that israel live up to their obligation as well
  that ’ what this deal say that ’ what it say and we ’ll do our part
  this be truly a decisive moment israel have make their proposal hamas say it want a ceasefire this deal be an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it
  hamas need to take the deal
  for month people all over the world have call for a ceasefire now it ’ time to raise your voice and to demand that hamas come to the table agree to this deal and end this war that they begin
  of course there will be difference on the specific detail that need to be work out that ’ natural if hamas come to negotiate ready to deal then israel negotiation must be give a mandate the necessary flexibility to close that deal
  the past eight month have mark heartbreaking pain pain of those whose loved one be slaughter by hamas terrorist on october 7th hostage and their family wait in anguish ordinary israelis whose life be forever mark by the shatter event of hamas ’s sexual violence and ruthless brutality
  and the palestinian people have endure sheer hell in this war too many innocent people have be kill include thousand of child far too many have be badly wound
  we all see the terrible image from the deadly fire in rafah early this week follow an israeli strike against target hamas and even as we work to surge assistance to gaza with 1,800 truck deliver supply these last five days—1,800 the humanitarian crisis still remain
  i know this be a subject on which people in this country feel deep passionate conviction and so do i. this have be one of the hard most complicated problem in the world there ’ nothing easy about this nothing easy about it
  through it all though the united states have work relentlessly to support israelis security to get humanitarian supply into gaza and to get a ceasefire and a hostage deal to bring this war to an end
  yesterday with this new initiative we ’ve take an important step in that direction
  and i want to level with you today as to where we be and what might be possible but i need your help everyone who want peace now must raise their voice and let the leader know they should take this deal work to make it real make it last and forge a well future out of the tragic terror attack and war
  it ’ time to begin this new stage for the hostage to come home for israel to be secure for the suffering to stop it ’ time for this war to end and for the day after to begin
  thank you very much

< p class="p1"><span class="s1">the president my fellow leader today be the fourth time i ’ve have the great honor of speak to this assembly as president of the united states it will be my last.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i’ve see a remarkable sweep of history i be first elect to office in the united states of america as a u.s. senator in 1972 now i know i look like i ’m only 40 i know that.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i be 29 year old back then we be live through an inflection point a moment of tension and uncertainty the world be divide by the cold war the middle east be head toward war america be at war in vietnam and at that point the long war in america ’s history.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">our country be divided and angry and there be question about our staying power and our future but even then i enter public life not out of despair but out of optimism.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">the united states and the world get through that moment it be not easy or simple or without significant setback but we would go on to reduce the threat of nuclear weapon throughout the through arm control and then go on to bring the cold war itself to an end israel and egypt go to war but then forge a historic peace we end the war in vietnam.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">the last year in hanoi i be meet with the vietnamese leadership and we elevate our partnership to the high level it ’ a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity for reconciliation that today the united states and vietnam be partner and friend and it ’ proof that even from the horror of war there be a way forward thing can get better.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we should never forget that i have see that throughout my career.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the 1980 i speak out against apartheid in south africa and then i watch the racist regime fall.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the 1990 i work to hold milošević accountable for war crime he be hold accountable.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">at home i write and pass the violence against women act to end the scourge of violence against woman and girl not only in america but across the world as many of you have as well but we have so much more to do especially against rape and sexual violence as weapon of war and terror.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we be attack on 9/11 by al qaeda and osama bin laden we bring he justice.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">then i come to the presidency in another moment in a crisis and uncertainty i believe america have to look forward new challenge new threat new opportunity be in front of we we need to put ourselves in a position to see the threat to deal with the challenge and to seize the opportunity as well.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we need to end the era of war that begin on 9/11 as vice president to president obama he ask i to work to wind down the military operation in iraq and we do painful as it was.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">when i come to office as president afghanistan have replace vietnam as america ’s long war i be determined to end it and i do it be a hard decision but the right decision.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">four american president have face that decision but i be determined not to leave it to the fifth it be a decision accompany by tragedy thirteen brave americans lose their life along with hundred of afghans in a suicide bomb i think those lose life i think of they every day.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i think of all the 2,461 u.s. military death over a long 20 year of that war 20,744 american serviceman wound in action i think of their service their sacrifice and their heroism.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i know other country lose their own man and woman fight alongside we we honor their sacrifice as well.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">to face the future i be also determined to rebuild my country ’s alliance and partnership to a level not previously see we do we do just that from traditional treaty alliance to new partnership like the quad with the united states japan australia and india.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i know i know many look at the world today and see difficulty and react with despair but i do not i won’t.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">as leader we do n’t have the luxury.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i recognize the challenge from ukraine to gaza to sudan and beyond war hunger terrorism brutality record displacement of people a climate crisis democracy at risk strain within our society the promise of artificial intelligence and its significant risk the list go on.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">but maybe because of all i ’ve see and all we have do together over the decade i have hope i know there be a way forward.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">in 1919 the irish poet william butler yeats describe a world and i quote where thing fall apart the centre can not hold mere anarchy be loose upon the world end of quote.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">some may say those word describe the world not just in 1919 but in 2024 but i see a critical distinction.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">in our time the center have hold leader and people from every region and across the political spectrum have stand together turn the page we turn the page on the bad pandemic in a century we make sure covid no long control our life we defend the u.n. charter and ensure the survival of ukraine as a free nation my country make the large investment in climate and clean energy ever anywhere in history.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">there will always be force that pull our country apart and the world apart aggression extremism chaos and cynicism a desire to retreat from the world and go it alone.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">our task our test be to make sure that the force hold we together be strong than those that be pull we apart that the principle of partnership that we come here each year to uphold can withstand the challenge that the center hold once again.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">my fellow leader i truly believe we be at another inflection point in world history where the choice we make today will determine our future for decade to come.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">will we stand behind the principle that unite we we stand firm against aggression we will we end the conflict that be rage today will we take on global challenge like climate change hunger and disease will we plan now for the opportunity and risk of a revolutionary new technologies?</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i want to talk today about each of those decision and the action in my view we must take.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">to start each of we in this body have make a commitment to the principle of the u.n. charter to stand up against aggression when russia invade ukraine we could have stand by and merely protest but vice president harris and i understand that that be an assault on everything this institution be suppose to stand for.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">and so at my direction america step into the breach provide massive security and economic and humanitarian assistance our nato allies and partner in 50 plus nation stand up as well but most importantly the ukrainian people stand up and i ask the people of this chamber to stand up for them.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">the good news be putin ’s war have fail at his core aim he set out to destroy ukraine but ukraine be still free he set out to weaken nato but nato be big strong and more united than ever before with two new member finland and sweden but we can not let up.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">the world now have another choice to make will we sustain our support to help ukraine win this war and preserve its freedom or walk away and let aggression be renew and a nation be destroyed?</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i know my answer we can not grow weary we can not look away and we will not let up on our support for ukraine not until ukraine win a just and durable peace base on the u.n. charter.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we also need to uphold our principle as we seek to responsibly manage the competition with china so it do not veer into conflict we stand ready to cooperate on urgent challenge for the good of our people and the people everywhere.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we recently resume cooperation with china to stop the flow of deadly synthetic narcotic i appreciate the collaboration it matter for the people in my country and many other around the world.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">on matter of conviction the united states be unabashe push back against unfair economic competition and against military coercion of other nation in the south china sea in maintain peace and stability across the taiwan straits in protect our most advanced technology so they can not be use against we or any of our partners.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">at the same time we ’re go to continue to strengthen our network of alliance and partnership across the indo pacific these partnership be not against any nation they be build block for a free open secure and peaceful indo pacific.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we be also work to bring a great measure of peace and stability to the middle east the world must not flinch from the horror of october 7th any country any country would have the right and responsibility to ensure that such an attack can never happen again.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">thousand of armed hamas terrorist invade a sovereign state slaughter and massacre more than 1,200 people include 46 americans in their home and at a music festival despicable act of sexual violence 250 innocent take hostage.&nbsp;</span >

 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">full scale war be not in anyone ’s interest even as the situation have escalate a diplomatic solution be still possible in fact it remain the only path to last security to allow the resident from both country to return to their home on the border safely and that ’ what work that ’ what we ’re work tirelessly to achieve.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">as we look ahead we must also address the rise of violence against innocent palestinians on the west bank and set the condition for a well future include a two state solution where the world where israel enjoy security and peace and full recognition and normalize relation with all its neighbor where palestinians live in security dignity and self determination in a state of their own applause.)</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">progress toward peace will put we in a strong position to deal with the ongoing threat pose by iran together we must deny oxygen to terrorist to its terrorist proxy which have call for more october 7ths and ensure that iran will never ever obtain a nuclear weapon.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">gaza be not the only conflict that deserve our outrage in sudan a bloody civil war unleash one of the world ’s bad humanitarian crisis eight million eight million on the brink of famine hundred of thousand already there atrocity in darfur and elsewhere.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">the united states have lead the world in provide humanitarian aid to sudan and with our partner we have lead diplomatic talk to try to silence the gun and avert a wide famine the world need to stop arm the general to speak with one voice and tell they stop tear your country apart stop block aid to the sudanese people end this war now.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">but people need more than the absence of war they need the chance the chance to live in dignity they need to be protect from the ravage of climate change hunger and disease.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">our administration have invest over $ 150 billion to make progress and other sustainable development goals it include $ 20 billion for food security and over $ 50 billion for global health we ’ve mobilize billion more in private sector investment.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we’ve take the most ambitious climate action in history we ’ve move to rejoin the paris agreement on day one and today my country be finally on track to cut emission in half by 2030 on track to honor my pledge to quadruple climate financing to develop nation with $ 11 billion thus far this year.&nbsp;</span >

 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">beyond the core necessity of food and health the united states the g7 and our partner have embark on an ambitious initiative to mobilize and deliver significant financing to the develop world we be work to help country build out their infrastructure to clean energy transition to their digital transformation to lay new economic foundation for a prosperous future.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">it ’s call the partnership for global infrastructure and investment we ’ve already start to see the fruit of this emerge in southern africa and in southeast asia and in the americas we have to keep it going.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i want to get thing do together in order to do that we must build a strong more effective and more inclusive united nations the u.n. need to adapt to bring in new voice and new perspective that ’s why we support reform and expand the membership of the u.n. security council.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">my u.n. ambassador just lay out our detailed vision to reflect today ’s world not yesterday ’s it ’ time to move forward.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the security council like the u.n. itself need to get back to the job of make peace of broker deal to end war and suffering and to stop the spread of the most dangerous weapon of stabilize troubled region in east africa from east africa to haiti to kenya lead mission that ’s work alongside the haitian people to turn the tide.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we also have a responsibility to prepare our citizen for the future we ’ll see more technological change i argue in the next 2 to 10 year than we have in the last 50 years.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">artificial intelligence be go to change our way of life our way of work and our way of war it could usher in scientific progress at a pace never see before and much of it could make our life better.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">but ai also bring profound risk from deepfake to disinformation to novel pathogen to bioweapons.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we have work at home and abroad to define the new norm and standard this year we achieve the first ever general assembly resolution on ai to start develop global rule of the road we also announce a declaration of the responsible use of ai join by 60 country in this chamber.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">but let ’s be honest this be just the tip of the iceberg of what we need to do to manage this new technology.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">nothing be certain about how ai will evolve or how it will be deploy no one know all the answers.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">but my fellow leader it ’ with humility i offer two questions.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">first how do we as an international community govern ai as country and company race to uncertain frontier we need an equally urgent effort to ensure ai ’s safety security and trustworthiness as ai grow more powerful it also must grow more responsive to our collective need and value the benefit of all must be share equitably it should be harness to narrow not deepen digital divides.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">second will we ensure that ai support rather than undermine the core principle that human life have value and all human deserve dignity we must make certain that the awesome capability of ai will be use to uplift and empower everyday people not to give dictator more powerful shackle on the human spirit.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the year ahead there may well be no great test of our leadership than how we deal with ai nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">let i close with this even as we navigate so much change one thing must not change we must never forget who we ’re here to represent.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">“we the people these be the first word of our constitution the very idea of america and they inspire the opening word of the u.n. charter.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i’ve make the preservation of democracy the central cause of my presidency.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">this summer i face a decision whether to seek a second term as president it be a difficult decision be president have be the honor of my life there be so much more i want to get do but as much as i love the job i love my country more i decide after 50 year of public service it ’ time for a new generation of leadership to take my nation forward.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">my fellow leader let we never forget some thing be more important than stay in power it ’ your people applause it ’ your people that matter the most.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">never forget we be here to serve the people not the other way around because the future will be win by those who unleash the full potential of their people to breathe free to think freely to innovate to educate to live and love openly without fear.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">that ’s the soul of democracy it do not belong to any one country.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">i’ve see it all around the world in the brave man and woman who end apartheid bring down the berlin wall fight today for freedom and justice and dignity.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we see it that universal yearning for right and freedom in venezuela where million cast their vote for change it have not be recognize but it can not be deny the world know the truth.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we see it in uganda&nbsp;lgbt activist demand safety and recognition of their common humanity.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">we see it in citizen across the world peacefully choose their future from ghana to india to south korea nation represent one quarter of humanity who will hold election this year alone.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">it ’s remarkable the power of we the people that make i more optimistic about the future than i ’ve ever be since i be first elect to the united states senate in 1972.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">every age face its challenge i see it as a young man i see it today.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">but we be strong than we think we ’re strong together than alone and what the people call impossible be just an illusion.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">nelson mandela teach we and i quote it always seem impossible until it ’s do it always seem impossible until it ’s do ”</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">my fellow leader there be nothing that ’s beyond our capacity if we work together let ’s work together.</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">god bless you all and may god protect all those who seek peace.&nbsp;</span >
 < p class="p1"><span class="s1">thank you applause.)</span >
